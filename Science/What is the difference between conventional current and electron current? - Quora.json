            "answer_text": "Actually there is no difference. Electron flow *IS* conventional flow, since conventional flow includes all types of charge motion. The electrons carry negative charge, so when they flow forwards, they\u2019re creating a backwards current. Contrast this with proton currents (in acid solutions, car batteries.) Protons carry positive charge, so when they flow forwards, they\u2019re creating a forwards electric current. In other words, the direction of charge-flow is not the direction of electric currents. For negative charges, the current must be backwards when compared to positive charges. Everyone gets confused by thinking that \u201cconventional current\u201d is a flow of positive charges. Nope. Instead, conventional current is a description of pure electric current, while it ignores/conceals the true flows of charge inside the conductor. For example, if we had some positive sodium atoms flowing one way in salt water, and also some negative chlorine atoms flowing the other direction in the same water \u2026do we have to always discuss and visualize these two separate currents? No, because the total current (Conventional Current) is simply the current measured by ammeters. Just measure it! Your ammeter will add the sodium and chloride currents, and give you a net average of both together. Conventional current is the sum total, and it conceals the complicated flows of various ions inside that conductive water (perhaps there\u2019s potassium ions flowing too, and positive hydrogen and negative sulfates. Depends on what\u2019s dissolved. Each one creates a separate electric current in the salt solution. Too complicated!) In other words, \u201campere\u201d doesn\u2019t care if the actual current is protons or electrons or a solution with drifting ions, or several different charge flows in an exotic conductor, or e-beams in CRT tubes. Conventional Current conceals all the complexity, and turns it into a single number: the amperes. If you\u2019re talking amperes, then you\u2019re using Conventional Current, whether you realize it or not. Your digital meter displays amperes: amperes of conventional current. Your meter doesn\u2019t care if the actual current is made of protons flowing forwards or electrons flowing backwards, or a combination of both at the same time. Heh, when we move a copper wire, we\u2019re moving the protons of the copper, which creates an enormous electric current. To be completely accurate, we\u2019re not allowed to ignore this proton-motion. We must describe this proton flow of moved wires (plus any electron motion going the other way.) To be accurate, we must confront the total complexity of charge-motions inside that wire. We\u2019re not allowed to just focus on electron-flows, while pretending that the copper\u2019s protons don\u2019t exist! On the other hand, if we want to keep things simple, and we only want to discuss the amperes in a conductor, then we\u2019d better stop talking about proton-flows and ion-flows and electron flows. Just replace all of these with the ampere-concept, also known as \u201cconventional current.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In the beginning, we didn\u2019t understand electricity well. We knew that something flowed. I believe it may have been Michael Faraday who first used the terms positive and negative, but I could be wrong as to who it was. So anyway, something flows. That something was represented to flow from an accumulation of \u201cplenty of that something\u201d, or a positive amount, into an area that is \u201cdepleted in that something\u201d, or a negative amount. This is referred to as \u201cclassical current.\u201d The battery symbol is drawn such that the positive side is a longer line than the negative side to show that this is where the greater amount of charge comes from. This was around 1831 and the electron was not discovered until 1897. Bohr\u2019s model for the atom wasn\u2019t until 1913. Lenz\u2019s Law (pronounced like \u201cLints\u201d) in 1834\u2014just a few years after Faraday, had current flowing opposite that of Faraday. Lenz happened to be right but the true direction of current was not proven until after the death of them both\u2014Lenz in 1865 and Faraday in 1867. Faraday did a lot of work in electrochemistry too and in solutions, positive charges (as ions) can carry current as well, so we can forgive him for being wrong about current flow in wires. He had a 50/50 chance of being right after all\u2014unfortunately the coin landed on tails. Faraday\u2019s generator law and motor law all have to do with the direction of classical current flow and we have the \u201cright-hand rule.\u201d The majority of people are right handed anyway so everyone was happy. When electronics was being developed, the schematic symbols were drawn to show the flow of this classical current. The symbol for the diode, bipolar and FET transistors, scr\u2019s, etc., are all drawn with an arrow-head pointing in the direction of classical current. These symbols do not make sense if you look at them with respect to electron flow. We even choose to make negative ground in DC circuits\u2014pretty much universally. There is a trend now to teach current flow as electron flow and ignore classical current. I personally believe that the credit should go to the first one to discover it and therefore I vote for Michael Faraday and classical current. I can follow the current path through the schematics simply by following the arrows. Kirchhoff\u2019s laws still work exactly the same either way as long as you are consistent throughout. ",
