            "answer_text": "You've answered your own question: Optimal means best or most benefit. So a scientifically optimal workout is better than just getting to the gym and doing anything. However, the optimal workout may not be a lot better and so the benefits may not be worth the negatives (for instance, it may be boring, etc). But without specifics, no one could answer that. The one thing that we can state is that going to the gym and not doing the scientifically optimal workout is better than not going to the gym at all. ",
