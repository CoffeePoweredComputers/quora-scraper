            "answer_text": "First of all, there's just typical office politics that you see regardless of what kind of workplace you're at. They are made more intense in academia by the tenure system, which makes people stay at the same workplace for much longer than they would at a non-academic setting. Tenure also makes politics more intense in that you need the members of your department to support you in order to get tenure, so you need to be more aware of politics than at most offices, where your advancement is mostly dependent on how your higher ups view you. This is made more intense by the nature of the work, where people often have strong disagreements with each other in relation to their research. And, to make things even worse, most academic departments are self-contained fiefdoms with little formal hierarchy within them. If there were strong factional issues in an office, any competent manager would figure out a way to resolve them. But, my sense is that most Deans are not very aware of what goes on in individual departments politics wise, and thus are not really in a position to do anything about it. Academics also don't really have to work together for much of what they do. They need to teach classes, mentor grad students, and conduct research - none of which requires the active cooperation of everyone in the department. And even when it breaks down, it doesn't do so in a way that prevents the overall functioning of the department - so a grad student might be screwed over here and there due to factional politics, but that's not something a dean will even be aware of, let alone see as something that needs addressing. So you can sustain a level of hostility between members of a department while still accomplishing everything you need to do in a year that would destroy an office where people need to work together more closely in order to achieve more tangible and immediately measurable goals.

            "answer_text": "Because success in academia is all about doing well in the very ill-defined market for recognition and credit.  Supreme case in point: Who discovered the double-helix structure of DNA? If you look at the Nobel Prize award, it was James Watson and Francis Crick. If you read Watson's book, \"The Double Helix,\" then you develop an even deeper appreciation of Watson's own contributions. If you go back and look at the earlier literature, you realize that earlier contributions by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins were slighted quite severely by others. Credit and recognition matter! Become known as the biggest, brightest thinker in your field, and you get a bigger salary, the run of a full-fledged institute to develop your ideas (and brand), plus textbook contracts, high speaking fees, and maybe even a trip to Stockholm. Get overlooked, and you'll forever be at a disadvantage in seeking funding, getting your papers published, etc. You'll watch helplessly as the areas where you wanted to make a contribution are seized by more prominent people. These stakes are not small! Anyone who says academia is all about small squabbles hasn't spent enough time close to the stars of any discipline. In capitalism, success is all about ownership -- which is carefully documented and as permanent as you want it to be. If you bought lots of Apple stock in 1998, you are very rich and completely sheltered from the jealous longings of people who wish they owned your stock at your price. You can be as prominent in the media as Warren Buffett or as reclusive as Kentucky cigarette king Brad Kelley (The Man With a Million Acres), and it doesn't matter. You don't need to keep campaigning for legitimacy.  In academia, fame and glory are being reallocated all the time. The pressure to keep burnishing your reputation -- or to lose standing -- is always there. The process by which that happens is pure politics. Academics constantly form alliances; help one another glide into more rarified circles; back-stab their rivals, etc. I believe that's the nature of any enterprise that creates a public good, yet chooses to reallocate rewards frequently and unevenly.
