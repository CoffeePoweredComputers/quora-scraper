            "answer_text": "The consensus by industry experts, state and federal regulators, and post fracking analytics is - hydraulic fracking is absolutely safe. There has never been a documented case or confirmed instance where groundwater was contaminated from or by \u201cfracking\u201d a well.  New York Governor Cuomo bowed to environmental pressure regarding fracking and confirmed a ban to limit its use. Large water dependent jobs to produce the Marcellus and Utica shale were affected by the ban. Fracking shallower targets with smaller water volumes is still permissible. Ultimately the ban revolved around the subject of climate change as opposed to any real dangers from mechanically breaking rocks to release more gas. By attacking the process activism successfully stalled gas production in the state. The public has fallen victim to hyperbole and marketing to frame their opinions. A study appeared in an issue of American Sociological Review, which examined how the propaganda in Josh Fox\u2019s fictional movie Gasland, along with social media efforts, tangibly moved the dial in favor of anti-fracking sentiment among those who were unfamiliar with the process or the subject. Josh Fox is an environmental activist, and refuses to engage in a rational discussion regarding his films authenticity or accuracy. In order to avoid expensive treatment and disposal of flowback water from fracked wells, many gas producers are reusing their produced water. This commitment to environmental concerns has the added benefit of reducing the burden on surface water resources. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there is a consensus among professionals, and those lonely souls who have not been too lazy or self satisfied to spend a few hours acquiring an elementary understanding of geology and what \u201cfracking\u201d actually entails. The acolytes of obvious frauds like the movie \u201cGasland\u201d can no more be challenged or swayed in their opinions than anti-vaccers, Taliban, and similar fanatics. There is another group who oppose fracking because they oppose all forms of hydrocarbon extraction. At least there is some logical consistency to their opinion. True, they might rely partially on lies to support that opinion, but many people from many points of view do likewise. Some of them are decent, sincere people. They are also misguided and incredibly insular. If the little people, whom they have never seen, have to live in cold and darkness until the renewable energy Dawn, that\u2019s just tough luck. ",
