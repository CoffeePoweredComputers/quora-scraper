            "answer_text": "This question is interesting, and textbooks give answers to this, but they conflict and they are usually wrong. There are different theories which state different things. For example quantum electrodynamics has each photon partially absorbed and partially re-emitted an infinite number of times by electrons in the mirror. Wave theory has the incoming wave induce oscillations in countless electrons which then cancel the original wave and emit a wave in new directions. It is not actually possible to experimentally detect photons being absorbed and re-emitted or changing direction and energy. (Talking about normal linear optics. We can observe photons absorbed and re-emitted in fluorescence and stimulated emission.) Since momentum is transferred, the reflected photon has a slightly different energy than the incident photon. (There is is special case where the reflecting surface has exactly the same but opposite sign momentum of the photon and the momenta cancel.) People make assertions about this, but what they say depends on which textbook they used. Quantum mechanics does not allow questions like this to be definitely answered. This is closely related to the double slit experiment. How does a quantum particle interfere with itself and be in two places at once, and is it the same particle after it does this? Again, there is no experiment that can answer the question. We have to accept that quantum particles behave in ways that are difficult to comprehend, and if they are indistinguishable, they act as if they are the same particle. It defies our expectations. In the same way, we can\u2019t answer exactly what happens to the photon at the atomic level. Is the reflected photon the same photon or is it a new photon? Again quantum mechanics says that these questions at the atomic level are ultimately meaningless and can not be answered definitively. People may passionately argue a field theory or a wave theory or a particle theory\u2026 but they are only approximate concepts based on macroscopic ideas. At the quantum level, particles and waves are actually two different ways of looking at the same thing. Thinking in terms of photons usually leads to the wrong conclusions. I mented a double slit experiment. There is another problem with photons. How do the electrons know that a photon is arriving? The photon comes at the speed of light and the electron has no time to react before the photon is there. Only when you realize photons are not tiny little balls can you actually make photon theory match experiments. The photons are effectively quite large, and yet all the energy of a very large photon can be absorbed by one tiny atom. It is difficult to keep all this in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAre reflections of light caused by the reflection of photons? If so, what actually causes the photons to reflect since the material on the mirror would still be comprised of atoms?\u201d The answer to the first question is \u2018no.\u2019 Light, when moving, behaves like a wave. It only behaves like a particle (called the photon) when it reaches its destination and is detected. By \u201clike a particle\u201d we mean that the effect of light only happens in discrete chunks. It is misleading to think of a beam of light as a stream of photons. Your second question is vaguely \u2018how does light reflection work?\u2019 In general, when the light wave reaches the intersection of two different materials, it can be transmitted into the second material, reflected back, or both in some combination. The thing that happens arises from the need to match the waves on both sides of the boundary. Metals have loosely bound electrons that are free to move around, which is why they are good electrical conductors. This also means that they react easily to the \u201celectro-\u201d part in \u201celectromagnetic wave,\u201d and the boundary condition at the interface is that electric field should be small. (Think of it as \u201cshorted out.\u201d) Physically, this corresponds to summing the incoming wave with an outgoing wave of equal magnitude and opposite phase\u2014a reflection. ",

            "answer_text": "I find it most helpful to think of this in terms of waves, but then again I would, since I have an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics that I term Guidance Waves (similar to the pilot wave but slightly different.) If you think of it as a wave, then reflection must occur if the wave strikes a surface and would have a different phase velocity in that medium. It is actually a consequence of the geometric need not to self-interfere. The light does not get absorbed, assuming the medium, such as clear glass, does not have an absorber. So, why does it change velocity? Largely because there is an electric field due to the electrons around the atoms, and this electric field interacts with the oscillating electric field of the light. However, the electric field around atoms in covalent compounds tends to be very weak, the reason being that it is exactly opposed by the positive field of the nucleus. With metals, the electrons are delocalised over the whole substance, and now the light is slowed down almost to a standstill. As such, the waves are almost totally reflected and we see them as silver (unless, like copper and gold, some are absorbed.) If you take sodium, which tis similarly silver, and put immense pressure on it, besides rearranging the structural array, it forces the atoms to take up less volume and they do this by holding more firmly onto their electrons - if you like, they are squeezed back into their atoms. Th net result is the sodium becomes transparent. Electrons are so small light simply laps around them, but the electric fields are not localised like that. ",

            "answer_text": "Scattering means absorption and re-emission of the incident photon by a free electron or an electron bound to an atom. The free electrons inside a metal mirror are what causes the reflection. They oscillate 180 degrees out of phase with the incident light, leading to destructive interference of the transmitted light and therefore to complete reflection. Since there is no bandgap for free electrons, they absorb and re-emit all the photons incident on them, but since the phase of the transmitted light is opposed to the phase of the incident light, the probability for transmission of photons is zero, all get reflected. Image Acquisition Dielectric mirrors are composed of very thin layers of transparent materials with high refractive index alternating with low reflective index. This leads to the thin film interference in multiple layers, amplifying the reflection of some frequencies of light and attenuating the reflection of other frequencies.

You may look at light as an ekectromagnetic wave. The mirror is a conducting surface and imposes boundary conditions. The incoming wave creates a currdnt and this current creates the outgoing wave. You can view it as photons. The photons are absorbed and new photons are emitted. Interference of these to cancel in all directions except the directions of the outgoing ray. You may look at photons as exitations of the photon field. Now you are back at the EM fielt. The EM field is the same as the photon field. ",

            "answer_text": "In classical electrodynamics, reflections of waves show up at boundaries where there is a change in index of refraction due to dielectric \u201cconstant,\u201d or due to conductivity. Getting a hold on the contribution from microscopic effects and macroscopic wave behavior has a few points of contact. First is the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem. Ewald\u2013Oseen extinction theorem - Wikipedia Second is the Clausius-Mossottti equation like arguments. http://web.hep.uiuc.edu/home/serrede/P435/Lecture_Notes/P435_Lect_12.pdf That gets you to a position where you can explore the response of polarization interactions between molecules and photons.

            "answer_text": "Light is an electromagnetic wave. A magnetic field will put forces on electrons. Metals (and some other materials) have electrons in their outer layers that are free to move. When an electromagnetic wave hits such a material, it sets those electrons moving back and forth at the same frequency, and those moving electrons emit their own electromagnetic waves of the same frequency. The metal has reflected the light! Why does the reflected light travel in the direction that it does? That\u2019s a more complicated question I won\u2019t address here. Note that the reason metals are good at reflecting light is the same reason that metals are good electrical conductors. Both processes rely on an abundance of free electrons. ",

            "answer_text": "The atoms are comprised of electrically charge particles. The electromagnetic field moves the electric charges. It is the motion of the electrically charged particles that cause optical phenomena such as reflection. Some of the details get hairy, but this is roughly the answer. All optical phenomena regarding materials is in some way associated with the motion of electrically charged particles in the material. ",
