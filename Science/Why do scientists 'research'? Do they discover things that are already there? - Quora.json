            "answer_text": "Why do scientists 'research'? Do they discover things that are already there? Ok, a bit of a noodle bender answer here. Everything exists, the classic Schr\u00f6dinger's cat approach would have it that theoretically, all things and probabilities exist before we choose one or cause it to be recognised, but all discoveries pre-exist. Scientists work to discover those already existing things, to unravel the confusion within the universe and to try to make sense of the confusion. The world is a fundamentally difficult thing to understand and we try to make sense of this mayhem. By understanding something we hope to make our lives better (selfish? yes!) However, we also get to control what damage we do to the environment, that is if we have the willpower to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. We research in order to reexamine the things we already know and evaluate whether anything was left out. For instance, Einstein wasn't the first to observe photoelectric effect. But he was the first to interpret and explain it using quantization of light. Likewise, Poincare designed the group theoretical structure much before Einstein came up with Special Relativity. So, no. We don't aim to discover things that are already there. We can't publish or contribute if we discover pre-existing results. Whats interesting to us are the gaps left behind, the inadequacies of earlier results. ",
