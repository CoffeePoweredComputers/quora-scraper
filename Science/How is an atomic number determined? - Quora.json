            "answer_text": "A lot of these answers seem to be explaining how you calculate the atomic mass, not the atomic number. The rest of them answer the question, but describe how you would find it from a periodic table, which is quite possibly what the original poster meant and is probably what the GCSE examiner would be looking for. I was wondering how you work it out if you don\u2019t have access to a periodic table (or google, for that matter). After a little more searching, I found this answer, which I believe is the way its done if you have a multimillion dollar lab (TL;DR: you put it through a mass spectrometer to isolate the various isotopes, and once you know their individual mass you can work out the charge based on the amount they\u2019re deflected in an electromagnetic field) How do you calculate atomic number? (Scroll down to Damon Craig\u2019s answer) Somewhere in between - other answers describe how you calculate atomic mass from Avogadro\u2019s number and weighing a mole of the element (although to work out how much a mole is I believe you need to react it with something, which means you need to know which group of the periodic table it is in, which means you need to know the atomic number!). BUT once you\u2019ve got the atomic mass, you could probably work out the atomic number by the following: Divide the atomic mass by 2. With the exception of hydrogen, this gives you a number that is the upper bound for the atomic number. Lets say that number puts the element in row 3, group 7.Now you use your knowledge of the expected physical and chemical properties of that substance to work out whether it is actually in group 7, 6,5,4 etc. For instance, group 7 is likely to be a reactive gas which reacts 1:1 with group 1. Group 6 will react 1:2 with group 1 etc.If you hit the transition metals then sorry, I think you\u2019re pretty much out of luck with this technique!",
