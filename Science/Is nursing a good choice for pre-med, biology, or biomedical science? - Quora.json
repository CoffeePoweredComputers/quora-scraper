            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t do nursing - the other answers give great reasons for why. Basically, major in whatever you are interested in and make sure to take the prerequisite courses needed to apply to the medical schools you are interested in. You can find out what prereqs are required by looking at the medical school\u2019s website. The MSAR has great information but is sometimes wrong, so check the medical school\u2019s website to be absolutely sure. Medical schools do not really care what you decide to major in. I have a degree in philosophy and theology and was accepted to medical school. My degree choice was actually an interesting part of the interview and they liked my diverse educational background. Major in something that you really like and you will have a higher GPA than majoring in something you think the medical schools would like!
