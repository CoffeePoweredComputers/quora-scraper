            "answer_text": "Quntitative research sounds as if you must get the quantities yourself, not just look them up using published resources. In high school and even college, this research assignment might very well mean the latter. In which case pick a topic which has the most and easiest-to-find information. (It would help if you had some interest in the topic so that you wouldn't fall asleep doing your research.) If this be a true research assignment, then you must be practical. There is no use picking a topic which you, as a student, cannot access for study. The more boards and bosses' permission you need, the less likely you are to get them. You are not in a position to fly from location to location looking for numbers. The topic must be one for which you can gain access and collect data. The fewer people involved, the better. You need not worry about privacy laws when counting items the way you must when counting people. Seriously, choosing topic should be a class or class session for all students. Teachers should never ask students to pick a topic without teaching them how to go about doing so. Some ideas. Measuring particulates in tap water from different taps and from the same taps at different times. All you need are some sample vials. Compare the differences in bytes used between different applications which purport to do the same operations or the differences between the same applications running on different platforms. Graph the number of discarded fasteners at a couple of different job sites. ",

            "answer_text": "Edit: What do you mean by research? Do you mean a simple final paper for a class or do you mean for a competitive science research class. My original answer assumes the latter because of the wording \u201cresearch for STEM students.\u201d The student should study whatever they find interest in. If they don't know what that is, the answer is not to shove some specific topic down their throat. This is contrary to some of the answer posts. A student with no interests or preliminary knowledge should read popular science. Popular science is useful for a few reasons. First, the journalist's job is to make difficult science accessible. Second, they cover tremendous ground in a few hundred words. There are problems the student will have to deal with. Often this comes by the ways journalists cover all that ground. Some of those ways are innocent. They use metaphors and analogies to speed through complicated ideas. The student will have to deal with the fact that when they read further, every metaphor and every analogy falls apart. But that's not dishonesty. Moreover, for the average audience member, it's actually valuable. The bigger, more pernicious problem is the certainty of the language journalists often use. When discussing established facts, this isn't a problem. But, journaists often plow through uncertain scientific territory with same certain language. This is especially true for the hottest topics in the biomedical sciences. Metaphors are easy to shake. Certainty is not because it's subtler. I've heard people tell students to dive into the technical literature. That is a bad idea for most students. The goal at this point is to find an interest, not hone in on a topic. Reading technical papers without first knowing your interest is contrary to that. Once the student knows what interests them, it is time to dive into the literature. The student should read a lot of journal articles. The student should prefer at first at least to read literature reviews over technical reports of new experiments. This will help the student become familiar with both the language and epistemic modalities of the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very broad question, with many possible good answers. One that comes to my mind is to consider embeddings in AI, which have gained (relatively) recent great prominence. The main idea is to represent all kinds of quantitative concepts, i.e. described with large sets of numbers by vectors in some vector space. The dimensions of such spaces are key, they should not be very large but also not too small. In AI the number is typically in the low hundreds.  One of the principal benefits of such approaches is that you have a well defined notion of distance, which can be Euclidean or cosine, that gives you a clear idea what things are related and how closely. Such a notion is very powerful and has been recognized as such. It is amazing to see how many different things embeddings have been applied to - they include words, sentences, books, images, videos, stock prices, medical images, network and knowledge graphs etc. This is just one suggestion, but I think it is an interesting one and connected to recent big advances in AI in an intriguing way.

During my study in Petroleum Engineering major, I found out that the most great and challenging quantitative research topic to be done is to find a new equation or formula in calculating something. In my experience, it also more easy for you to do a presentation or explanation about what is your research to your professor. However, if you want a more challenging topics, you might try to make a quantitative research that require a laboratorium or experimental stuff. Even if this idea is more challenging, you will find it hard to explain to other people if they didn\u2019t see your experiment or run thru it. Also, the possibility of fail in doing laboratorium or experimental research is higher. So, it depend on your time availability and your interest on doing research. ",

If any of them have an answer that interests you, I\u2019d then ask them if they could mentor you in an extra-credit project that might give you some experience as to what it would be like to do quantitative research on that topic. If your school has a Science Fair, this could lead to a project that might even win you an award. If you are a sophomore or junior, this could also be something that you could write about in you college application essay. Good luck! ",

Now make speculations about the societal implications\u2026..income, prestige , etc. This is just and I mean JUST an example \u2014- choose your own. Not that any of this is earth shattering, but it will give you experience in data collection, manipulation, etc. AND prove to potential employers that you have got some moxi. ",

            "answer_text": "My advice would be to explore several fields. Every person is different so a question like what is the best field in general will not get you the answer for what is the best field for you. Between the time of undergrad through the end of my PhD my interests jumped from chemical engineering to cell culture to solid state state physics to optics to nanomanufacturing to spectroscopy to machine learning. All of this jumping certainly didn't hold me back during my education. I don't think people need to specialize as early as possible. Now I have a good idea of what people are doing in science, and I've found a nice niche for myself in the interface of a few of those fields. ",
