            "answer_text": "The reduced Planck's constant, or h-bar as it's commonly known, is a modified form of the equation that describes the quantization of angular momentum.Angular momentum explains the rotary inertia of an object in motion, such as the Earth on its axis as well as its orbit around the Sun. Planck's constant describes the behavior of photons as discrete packets of energy, or quanta. ",

            "answer_text": "The reduced Planck constant, [math]\\hbar[/math], is the quantum of angular momentum. In other words, the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator (or better of it\u2019s z component) are [math]m\\hbar[/math], where m is an integer which can assume a particular range of values. These are the only possible values you can obtain by measuring any component of the angular momentum of a particle. This is one of the many possible answers, because [math]\\hbar[/math] is really everywhere in QM (momentum and energy operators, Fermi golden rule, uncertainty principle) and I\u2019m not yet aware of the reason behind it\u2019s ubiquitousness.
