            "answer_text": "You ask, \u201cWhat are similarities between assessment, measurement, and evaluation?\u201d That\u2019s a really good question because many people use the words interchangeably. Although the three words/concepts are related, there are differences. These differences cumulatively describe the process by which different aspects of information can be obtained. Assessment and evaluation are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference. An assessment is a process were an evaluator obtains information via multiple procedures including formal tests, observations, clinical judgement and staff input. The focus is on obtaining some known objective or goal. An evaluation is the development and utilization of observed information and data with the primary purpose of measuring, judging and assessing the data/information and to determine outcomes and conclusions. . Measurement is a clearer concept, referring to the testing techniques used to assess/evaluate a particular ability or set of abilities in an individual. ",

            "answer_text": "Coming from an educational background, these are the similarities: Assessment - refers to tests used to see how much the students have learned about a subject. Measurement - I don\u2019t think this word would be used regularly in school/college situations. Although the word does have a numerical connotation and it may appear when students are measured against each other e.g. how many students obtained A grades, how many got Cs etc. Evaluation - I use the word evaluation to mean a \u2018super\u2019 concept which subsumes assessment. i.e. assessment of students is a part of evaluation, but evaluation also involves finding out what people/students think about a course.
