            "answer_text": "Simpler answer: Stars do glow during the day, but we can't see them because of the glare of sunlight. When the sun is up, the blue color in sunlight gets scattered all over the atmosphere, turning the sky the familiar bright blue color. This blue light is much brighter than the faint light coming from the stars, so it prevents us from seeing them. For example, it's a lot easier to see the glow of a candle in the dark than in the light. If you were standing on the Moon, for instance, where there is no atmosphere, you would see the stars both day and night. Of course, the brightness of the moon\u2019s sunlit surface prevented the Apollo cameras (with their aperture set to adjust for the brightness) from filming the dimmer stars. More complicated answer: To tackle this, you must understand several effects. First, the human eye is sensitive to light over an enormous range of intensities. Typical \"bright\" stars are actually very dim compared to the brightness of the sun -- about a trillion 10^12 times dimmer. The brightness of objects illuminated by the sun typically 10 to 100 times dimmer than it is -- but that still makes the an enormous problem for the eye. (It has at least two mechanisms for light accommodation-- the iris which simple stops a fraction of the light like a camera lens, and chemical changes which enhance the cells particular to night vision. -- this takes some 10 to 20 minutes and unless you walk rapidly from dim to bright or vice versa you won't notice it.) So the first problem is that your eye -- to allow you to see, will reduce its sensitivity when there is bright light present. Secondly, the atmosphere of the earth has lots of fine particles of dust which are so small they never settle to the ground. These dust particles scatter a small part of the light from the sun in random directions, and the mechanism for scattering works better for shorter (bluer) wavelengths. This is why the sky is blue and why the sun seems to redden as it sets -- it has a longer path in the air -- so more of the blue light is lost, then green ... etc. By the way, clouds are made of much bigger bits, so they scatter visible light fairly evenly -- making them appear white. (But not to even longer light like infrared -- which can peer through clouds). Both processes make seeing stars in the daytime very hard. Did you know that Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, would have to shine five times its normal intensity before most could see it during the day (although at least one observer has reported seeing Sirius with his naked eye, it was under ideal conditions, an hour before sunset, after he had first located the star using binoculars). However, it IS possible to see stars during the day (and the moon at certain times during the day). First, there\u2019s the sun, our nearest star, but observing it directly is dangerous without using the proper shields and equipment. Other individual, bright stars can be seen during daylight hours through a telescope or a really powerful pair of binoculars. The trick lies in knowing exactly where to point them, so that the brightness of the star \u2014 and, most importantly, the magnification and light-gathering capacity of the lenses \u2014 can overcome the glare of refracted sunlight. Some telescopes now have \u201cgo-to\u201d systems that make this much easier. Just punch in the object to be viewed, and the telescope automatically slews to point at its location in the sky. Venus, which is a planet but looks a lot like a superbright star to the naked eye, is visible during the day if you know exactly where to look. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, the sky is brighter than the stars, so their glow gets mostly lost in the background. The same effect happens at night too, if there is significant light pollution, so the sky background is not pitch black. In many large cities you can only see a few brightest stars against the dark blue/purple/orange/gray sky (depending on the type of city lights). However, that\u2019s not the only reason. Another reason is that when we look at the uniform blue sky our eyes can\u2019t focus, so even if a star is visible, we don\u2019t see it because the picture is out of focus, so the point of light is blurred out, making the star invisible to us. But, with some effort, you can actually see a few of the brightest stars and planets even during daytime, if you know exactly where to look. Then, with some mental effort you can focus even on a barely visible object and then you\u2019ll see a star during daylight. I once did it myself with Venus - I pointed a spyglass on it about an hour before sunrise and kept adjusting the spyglass every couple of minutes so Venus would remain in its field of vision. I kept doing that until more than an hour after sunrise and I could still see Venus, not only in the spyglass, but with the naked eye as well, by looking along the spyglass\u2019s tube (slightly above it), which was my reference to Venus\u2019s exact position. Venus is the easiest object to do this trick with, because it\u2019s the brightest, but the same can, reportedly, be done with Jupiter, Sirius, Canopus, Vega, and Arcturus, at the least. In fact, here\u2019s a video claiming to have viewed Vega during the day:  ",
