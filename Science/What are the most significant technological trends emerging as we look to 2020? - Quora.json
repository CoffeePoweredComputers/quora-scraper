            "answer_text": "A2A Autonomous Vehicles: This will be a HUGE change. Within the 2020\u2019s fully autonomous vehicles will become legal. As that happens taxi services (like Tesla Network) will launch, providing lower than Uber cost transport and making owning a car an unnecessary expense. This will have secondary effects: Safer roads (driving deaths and medical care plummet from their current levels)Faster commutes, that are productiveParking space becomes 1/5 of it\u2019s current issue: from residential garages to mall parking lots+6\u201312% to unemployment as drivers, mechanics, auto-manufactures become unemployedVirtual Reality (v2) and Augmented Reality: VR is available now and is great for games. VR.2 will have 4x the resolution and allow much more \u201cusable\u201d functionality. Working in a current VR system sucks, working in a VR 2.0 system will be pretty good. Augmented Reality will grow out of Virtual Reality and by 2029 we\u2019ll have mixed reality glassesinput devices for VR will be a moving target during this timeframe with more devices moving towards a head mounted leap motion arrayNext Generation Search with Natural Language Question Answering and Proactive Search: Right now Siri/Cortana/Google Voice (Digital Assistants) are all stupid, they understand words, but can\u2019t answer anything unless it\u2019s been programmed explicitly. The next generation of these DAs will be useful. So if I ask \u201cwhat was the average GDP per capita growth in the US from 1947 to 1980\u201d Siri can\u2019t help me now (but does point me to websites)\u2026questions like this will be things Siri can answer\u2026in addition to this, I forsee the Digital assistants being able to leverage all the applications that you\u2019ve installed on your device. When you are searching via a browser, you\u2019ll be able to have a side window pop-up details about whatever it is you\u2019re looking for, with links. Hover-over a word and see a definition or a link to a commercial site. Nanotube Electronics: In the next decade we\u2019re going to change the memory structure in hardware (from phones to super computers) so that RAM and Storage (and maybe CPU) merge. Even though clock speeds won\u2019t change much we\u2019ll begin to see substantially faster computing (like the difference when we moved from Hard Drives to Solid State Memory). This will also shrink the packaging of machines as more and more functionality collapses into the main chip. 3D printed manufacturing: In this timeframe we\u2019ll see 3D printing in the home become radically better, enough so that most people under 40 will buy 3D printers of some kind. Professional printers will be able to scale to produce complex electromechanical parts at a speed that rivals traditional die-casting (but with more complex geometry), many parts that are currently assembled will be completely printed. Cell Cultured biotech products: leather, milk, meat, silk, towards the end of this period we\u2019ll see at least one of these products become cheap and ubiquitous. I believe we\u2019ll see massive strides towards organ printing in this time period, but we\u2019ll still only be able to print cartilage type tissues (but more complex ones\u2026people may be able to replace knee or spine cartilage in this timeframe). Automation will take over the manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy. These sectors will become almost entirely automated and employ very few humans (<3% total employment across all 3 sectors). Solar power (the march of Swanson\u2019s Law) will supply more than 16% of electricity worldwide (this includes usage from batteries). Battery technology will improve: costs will be less than 80% of current costs on a $/kwh basis. Atomically precise molecular manufacturing: while not yet mainstream by 2029, will have built nano machines used inside a human body, ",
