            "answer_text": "Coriolis acceleration [k\u022fr\u00b7\u0113\u2032\u014d\u00b7l\u0259s ik\u201asel\u00b7\u0259\u2032r\u0101\u00b7sh\u0259n] An acceleration which, when added to the acceleration of an object relative to a rotating coordinate system and to its centripetal acceleration, gives the acceleration of the object relative to a fixed coordinate system. A vector which is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of the first definition. Coriolis Acceleration A rotational acceleration, a part of the total acceleration of a point that appears in the so-called composite motion, when the transferred motion, that is, the motion of a moving frame of reference, is not translational. Coriolis accelerationappears as a consequence of a change in the relative velocity of a point \u03bd rel in the transferred motion (motion of the moving frame of reference) and of the transferred velocity in the relative motion. Numerically, the Coriolis acceleration is Wcoriolis = 2\u03c9trans \u03bdrelsina where \u03c9 trans is the angular velocity of rotation of the moving frame of reference about some axis AB and a is the angle between Vrel and the axis AB. As a vector, the Coriolis acceleration is given by  The direction of the Coriolis acceleration can be obtained by projecting the vector Vrelative on a plane perpendicular to the AB axis and rotating this projection by 90\u00b0 in the direction of the transferred motion (see Figure 1, in which the velocity of the point M along the meridian AMB of a sphere is (\u03bd relative) , while the rotational velocity of the sphere about the AB axis is \u03c9). It should be emphasized that the Coriolis acceleration is the part of the acceleration of the point relative to the fixed frame of reference and not to the moving frame of reference. For example, for motion along the surface of the earth, owing to the earth\u2019s rotation a point will have a Coriolis acceleration with respect to the stars, not to the earth. The Coriolis acceleration is equal to zero when the motion of the moving frame of reference is purely translational (o\u03c9 trans = 0) or when \u03b1 = 0. The concept of Coriolis acceleration is used in solving various problems in kinematics and dynamics. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of Newton\u2019s mechanics there is no such force. It is imaginary. Fire a rocket due north from a point A in Africa just above the equator. The green arrow shows the rocket\u2019s constant velocity, which is its speed in a northerly direction. Assume the rocket is slow and takes a few hours to travel. Meanwhile the earth rotates from west to east (to the right) underneath the high flying rocket. (Shown by the violet arrow).   The rocket has only traveled due north in a straight line. The earth rotated to the right underneath it. So it seems that the rocket has been pushed by some force to the left. The rocket reaches its destination after some hours at point B.  If we were to connect start to finish we would say the path of the rocket definitely swerved to the left. We could describe this as an imaginary or pseudo force pushing the rocket to the left. This \u201cconvenient fiction\u201d of a sideways force explains the end result very well. In Physics, if an idea gives the right answer, then why not use that idea. A force pushing to the left also helps to explain why cyclones in the northern hemisphere spin anti-clockwise or counter-clockwise.  Physics is not about the truth. It is about being useful because it tells us how a thing works. At a certain level we end up being able to say how it works but not necessarily why it works. So this Coriolis force is useful because it works. It gives us the right answer. So if people want to use it, why not? We say that the gravity force pulls us down. But no-one knows how the gravity force works. But if we say it pulls us down, then we get the right answer. So carry on saying that the gravity force pulls us down. It works, and that is what Physics is about. Does your theory work and get the right answer? Then it is useful, even if it is not necessarily correct. ",
