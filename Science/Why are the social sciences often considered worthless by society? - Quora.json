            "answer_text": "tl;dr\u2014People don\u2019t like the social sciences due to anti-intellectual bias, violations of expectations for simplicity, intellectual tasking, fundamental misunderstandings surrounding math, and because they are often critical of institutions that people want to be able to trust. The social sciences are often considered worthless because people often want things to be simpler than they are (often due to anti-intellectual sentiment), and resent the social sciences for making the components of their lives complicated. Certainly here in the US, many of the narratives we tend to pass around the issue of social, political, and interpersonal behavior focus on individual behavior and pass off one sentence, one factor motivations as being responsible for complex situations, so that there\u2019s no particular need for any deeper study of those phenomena than to toss a ridiculously reductive slogan at it and ignore it. The social sciences tend to complicate the study of social, political, and interpersonal phenomena, and often come to provisional, complex, and partial solutions as a result, which require considerable effort to understand. People are often used to being given simple to understand solutions or explanations, and when they encounter something that violates their expectations, they tend to reject it. Atop that, the social sciences require a functional understanding of statistics, which many people distrust for being explicitly partial and provisional in nature. People often expect numbers themselves to be concrete\u2014they expect math of any kind to result in a single number that is the only right answer and won\u2019t change, because their exposure to math is limited to, often at most, pre-algebra or some simple algebra, in the K-12 system. In their grade school math classes, math had one right answer that they were forced to reach else the problem was wrong, and as such when they encounter error ranges, confidence intervals, or any of the other components of statistics, they fundamentally distrust it for being what they understand to be a complete violation of the way math works. Finally, the conclusions to which much of social science comes with regard to the way people and societies work violate many of the narratives aimed at the general public. This is not just a function of the focus on individual action, it\u2019s also often the case that social science conclusions are critical of fundamental social institutions in ways that violate the just world hypothesis (the assumption that the world is fundamentally fair), and the institutions that people rely on in order to have social, political, religious, or economic stability. The social sciences often fundamentally disorder or upset the world around us, and as a result are actively resented, if not hated, for their role in making the world a little less what we expect, want, or need, with regard to stability.

            "answer_text": "Hello Jeanne, They aren\u2019t worthless, just not very credible, and this has nothing to do with society being anti-intellectual and wanting simple answers. The social sciences have a serious credibility problem because, in too many instances, their published research is unable to be replicated.[1] The papers may be impressive and garner interest, but then is called into question as other top social scientists do the same studies and get different results. Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients). Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (green) and nonsignificant (red) effects.  They have always had to contend with the label of being \u2018soft science\u2019[2]because it often appears to be based upon opinion rather than fact. any of the specialized fields or disciplines, as psychology, sociology, anthropology, or political science, that interpret human behavior, institutions, society, etc., on the basis of scientific investigations for which it may be difficult to establish strictly measurable criteria. I admit to having similar prejudice(s) as both a physicist (and briefly a psychological researcher), but then, even social scientist can\u2019t agree on how best to conduct and evaluate so-called replication projects of studies.[3] That lack of credibility affects the public and policy makers\u2019 confidence alike. I\u2019ve learned over the years to read advancement in any social science as \u201cisn\u2019t that interesting,\u201d and move on. For example NASA SYSTEMS ENGINEERING BEHAVIOR STUDY [4] wanted to : \u2026to identify the characteristics or behaviors frequently observed in highly regarded SEs at NASA. Data from this study will be used to design or update systems engineering training, development, coaching and mentoring programs to develop these behaviors in SEs. This data will also help NASA Engineering Leadership to more quickly identify and support the development of high potential future SE leaders. and develop a program to \u201cbuild\u201d some more. Sometimes you just want to laugh and cry at the same time\u2026 talk about cognitive dissonance. However, that is the short of it. Social Sciences lack the solid credibility to be relied upon for making the important decisions. In some cases cultural values may be more reliable. Ciao.
