            "answer_text": "Positivity is the other side of the negativity. I have found them existing together in people. Kindly see the following picture of Yin-Yang  In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang (\"dark-bright\", \"negative-positive\") describes how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.[1] Positivity and negativity, optimism and pessimism; inferiority and superiority complex are all connected in the similar fashion. When you are extremely positive of life, you are more likely to feel negative later. I have seen many people having extremely high expectations from others. They are the ones who start hating others most when their expectations are not fulfilled.In the same way, when you expect too much from yourself, you are highly likely to fall under negativism and depression when you fall short of your own expectations.The problem with negativity is that it is far more painful and far more lasting. The positive feelings tapers off soon, but negative ones don\u2019t leave you. Negative emotions are like a wound in one part of your body. They won\u2019t allow you sleep or enjoy your life even if hundreds of other body parts are perfectly healthy. It is for this reason that one must avoid extreme and manufactured positivity. We must try to be indifferent from the highs and lows of life. This state is described in Bhagawat Gita as the state of Sthitipragya. Lord Krishna says, When one discards all selfish desires and cravings of the senses that torment the mind, and becomes satisfied in the realization of the self, such a person is said to be transcendentally situated (Sthitipragya). One whose mind remains undisturbed amidst misery, who does not crave for pleasure, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom. (Gita 2: 55-56)[2] A wise person develops neutrality in life to avoid negativism and pessimism in life.

            "answer_text": "It is human tendency to think about what can go wrong rather than what can be right. While learning to drive a car two things comes to our mind I can drive the car and soon will get a license.Oh I might hit someone or something.There is no further thought for the first choice but how we can hit someone gives rise to thought process and slowly to fear \u2026panic \u2026etc i.e. we tend to overthink,we start planning how to react when we do something wrong. But it all depends upon how we perceive things. There are many type of perspectives like: A pessimist is often viewed as a negative person, but in reality this isn\u2019t the case. Most people confuse pessimism with fatalism which is the root of this misconception. By definition a pessimistic person is usually a skeptic or doubter, someone who needs proof before they jump on board. Whenever they hear something new, they are the first to scrutinize it before they will accept it. Can be frustrating to some (especially optimists), but often they are the ones that facilitate the level of quality and change. Investigators and scientific people often represent this group. A fatalist is someone who constantly spews out doom and gloom in just about every turn you take, no matter the situation. They are almost always at odds with something or someone (bone of contention) and are the hardest group of people to satisfy. Doomsday preppers tend to embody this group. Optimists are often touted as the best way to be and are usually shown to be well adjusted and happy. They tend to look on the more favorable side of life and events expecting the most favorable outcome. Their outlook hinges on idealism and often overlooks the basic nature of people. Because of their upbeat mindset, they are often the most likely to be gullible and naive. They are the kind of people politicians like because they can be easily persuaded. Which leave the realist. A realist is someone who tends to view or present things as they really are at this moment in time. They normally don\u2019t worry about what was (even though they are aware) and also don\u2019t dwell on what could be. They work and live in the moment, what is currently at hand. Even stranger is pessimists view them as optimists, and optimists often view them as pessimists. - See more at: Difference Between Optimists, Pessimists, and Realists - Glowball Web Network The best remedy is to think best and positive outcome in every situation even though it's probability is very small because our mind tends to attract and match the frequency of our thought process to our action and there are many books provided to help expertise in the technique of positive thinking. So it actually depends upon us what we choose.\u2661 ",
