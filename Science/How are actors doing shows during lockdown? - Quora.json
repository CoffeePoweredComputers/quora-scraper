            "answer_text": "BBC says: \u201cSince Covid-19 closed auditoriums worldwide, theatres have been picking tapes of shows from the library shelf to stream online for those feeling play-starved. But a few performers are attempting something more radical - regularly live streaming performances from home.

            "answer_text": "One of our local theatres has begun doing shows from their rehearsal room, which has large windows that face the street. (It was formerly a store.)
