            "answer_text": "I see some good answers to a badly framed question.The problem with the question is hidden in two words \u201cthe map\u201d. A geopolitical map tells you nothing about volcanic eruption risks.A topographic map might tell the viewer a little bit because volcanoes can sometimes look like volcanos on a map. A geologic map does not tell you much about the future risk. A road map tells you about roads but little if anything about road construction. A hazards map for volcanoes is a good place to start.U.S. Geological Survey: Natural Hazards Since the USGS tries to avoid politics it may be necessary to overlay a geopolitical map. N.B. one active volcano on the Antarctic continent has no country. So if a volcano in a place that has no country causes global warming does it count? Island volcanoes have emerged in the middle of the ocean too. The United States Geologic survey is not the only authority on this. Each nation may have experts aware of issues unknown to the USGS. Publications from the USGS have a long review cycle so some updates take a while. This is ok because geologic time takes the long view back in time and with great caution into the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Volcanos tend to be in two types of locations. One is at the edges of the earth\u2019s plate boundaries, and the other is where there are hotspots, which are on top of plumes of heat coming up from the earth\u2019s mantle. Hot spots are a minority of the active volcanos, but they are some of the most active. Hawaii and Iceland are two of them, and they are the most frequently erupting volcanoes on the planet.   The top map shows where active volcanoes occur. The bottom map shows where plate boundaries occur. There are a lot of chains of volcanoes that occur along the margins of plate boundaries. They occur most in places where oceanic crust is being subducted under continental crust. When two of the earth\u2019s plates are pushed together, one gets forced under the other \u2014subduction. As one gets pushed into the hotter depths of the earth parts of it begin to melt. The contained water in the sediments helps this melting process and also makes things flow, so it gets forced up through the overlying plate and forms volcanoes, either on land, as on the west coasts of North and South America, or as an Island Arc as in Indonesia.  So, countries that commonly have active volcanos? Here\u2019s a partial list mainly from memory. USA \u2014Hawaii and less frequently along the west coast from California to Alaska   Above photo is Mt. Rainier in Washington State Iceland \u2014probably the most active vulcanism in the world Canada, Mexico and all of the countries of the Americas that border on the Pacific Ocean. Indonesia has island arc volcanism, and it has had the most violent volcanic explosions in human history \u2014Krakatoa. There is a really good book written about this explosion and how it impacted the whole world.  The Philipines shares the same island arc volcanism as Indonesia. Mt. Penatubo\u2019s eruption in the 1980\u2019s lowered the earth\u2019s temperature for a few years due to the amount of dust blown into the higher parts of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Japan has a lot of volcanic activity. It\u2019s also related to a plate boundary. Italy has a couple of volcanoes. The African plate is being pushed up to collide with the Eur-Asian plate. In Africa there are several volcanos, some related to a rifting that will pull the continent apart eventually. They are in Rwanda and places like that. Also Mt. Kilimanjaro is a huge volcanic cone. Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania. New Zealand has a lot of volcanic activity. It\u2019s along a strike slip fault where two continental plates rub past each other. There have been explosive eruptions there in the past. The Rotorua hotsprings area is a result of this as well. Where in the world are the volcanoes?

            "answer_text": "I need a little clarification. I think you must mean the world map, and by counter you mean country. (The auto spell program is such a jerk.) National Geographic published a map of the tectonic plates that also indicates what sorts of boundaries they have (convergent, divergent, etc.): The Earth\u2019s Fractured Surface. Consulting that map can give you some idea where volcanic activity is taking place. And that\u2019s why I think a better way to look at it would be more general and to ask what sorts of areas are unlikely to have volcanic eruptions. Off the top of my head I would have to say the dense cores of continents, the cratons. They\u2019re super-thick. Many geologists suspect if the Canadian Shield eventually passes over the Yellowstone caldera, the chances of it erupting will decline drastically. The middle parts of tectonic plates usually don\u2019t have volcanic activity either, but the Hawaiian Archipelago is an exception to that rule, because a mantle plume is ascending in the middle of the Pacific Plate and creating those islands. The passive borders of continents are also unlikely to have volcanic activity. In the U.S., the passive border is the eastern edge. No subduction is occurring there. ",
