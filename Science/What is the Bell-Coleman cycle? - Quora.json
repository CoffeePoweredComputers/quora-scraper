            "answer_text": "The Bell Coleman Cycle (also called as the Joule or \"reverse\" Brayton cycle) is a refrigeration cycle where the working fluid is a gas that is compressed and expanded, but does not change phase. Air is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in this gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapour compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas heat exchangers ",

            "answer_text": "Also known as reverse Brayton cycle. In general, the Brayton cycle that is driven in reverse direction is known as the reverse Brayton cycle. Its purpose is to move heat from colder to hotter body, rather than produce work. In compliance with the second law of thermodynamics, heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold system to hot system without external work being performed on the system. Heat can flow from colder to hotter body, but only when forced by an external work. This is exactly what refrigerators and heat pumps accomplish. These are driven by electric motors requiring work from their surroundings to operate. One of possible cycles is a reverse Brayton cycle ",
