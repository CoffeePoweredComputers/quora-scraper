            "answer_text": "Q; How can Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory influence the following fields in modern times: economy, economy, agriculture, Political Science, religion? A: First of all, Darwin\u2019s theory is a bit old. 160 years or so. It has been supplemented and improved since with understanding of heredity and genes, DNA and the mechanisms involved there, genome mapping and so on. So the question is a bit like asking how steam power has influenced modern railways. That said, the theory of evolution is the basis for modern biology, so everything that has anything to do with biology is affected. Agriculture: A lot in agriculture has been touched by evolution, and since ancient times. The reason that we have wheat and not grass, or why the dessert banana you eat is not green, small, bitter and full of seeds, or why you have broccoli and cauliflower instead of wild mustard, is due to selection. With the understanding of the mechanisms involved in evolution, mapping of genes and gene editing, agricultural scientists can now create entirely new crops, like golden rice (rice plus a gene for beta carotene) or wheat crops that can survive saltier soil. Economy: The effects of the understanding of evolution has not only resulted in agricultural giants in economy, but also medical giants. Both of these are major influences in local and global economy. Trade deals are done around protection of medical intellectual properties and agricultural produce. Religion: Except for a few fundamentalist denominations, mainly parts of the US Evangelical community and the Middle-East Muslim communities, religion has mostly shrugged its shoulder. Those fundamentalists have seriously got their knickers in a twist. Political science: Directly, there\u2019s little influence. Indirectly (se Economy and Religion) the effect is huge. Global economy, and hence global politics, involves those trade deals mentioned. The knowledge base of those sciences and the economical advantages they gain is in conflict with some of the religious base voters in those areas, which in turn has contributed to an ongoing shift in global and economical power to regions that doesn\u2019t have as much fundamentalists in power.

The brains produced another information tool amidst of genes. Evolution with minor genetic differences between primates cannot explain huge functional differences to other primates. Evolution has been needed up to the extent of excellent co-ordination of brain functions a)\twith hands and other muscles \uf0e0 producing technologyb)\twith throat, mouth and facial muscles \uf0e0 producing tools for communicationc)\twith cortical memory and expressions \uf0e0 creativity, consciousness, communication and learning But thereafter these big brain functions have created a basement for an efficient memetic information system. This has liberated humans very much from genetic evolution. People can discover some tools such as eyeglasses, cars or robots, if genetic systems cause difficulties to see, or move or function, but also as an extension of senses and functions. Although the memetic information system is built on the genetic basement, it continues to function very independently and has developed in huge steps into completely new dimensions compared to the genetics. Brains were just a tool to create other more efficient information tools; not only to accumulate information, but to create information tools to accelerate growth and selection of information:\u2022\tDoubling of accumulation of complexity in Eukaryote genetic system has taken c400 million years (Sharov & Gordon 2018).\u2022\tBut human functional complexity has doubled in 20 years (Sharov & Gordon 2018). The number of patents has doubled in the periods of 25 y (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent)\u2022\tScientific literature has doubled in 15 years 1900 -1960 since 1710 (de Solla Price, 1971).\u2022\tThe number of integrated circuits doubled every year during 1958-1965 (Moore 1965: \u2018Moore\u2019s law\u2019). Similar exponential trends are shown for other technologies as speed of DNA sequencing, hard disc capacity, and bandwidth of networks. The role of information differs from the role of evolution 1)\tInformation by its definition is meaningful, not random or blind as mutations have thought to be. Meaningless \u2018non-information\u2019 is \u2018noise\u2019. 2)\tInformation can liberate humans from slow and disastrous evolution in some extent.3)\tThe freedom caused by the growing resources of information challenge the human kind to be responsible, to regulate the free will.4)\tThe free will challenge the role of ideologies and religions to choose between meanings and to target certain long-range meanings.Both evolution (E) and information (I) theory could be applied positive (E+, I+) or negative (E-, I-) way. Better understanding of evolution theory and slow evolution/adaptation of genomes could improve agriculture, economy, and politics. Also many new discoveries and more efficient information systems are necessary to proper management in agriculture, economy, politics and religion, moral responsibility. 1a) Agronomy: A lot of information in human brains and huge economic chains didn\u2019t produce much benefits for domesticated animals or plants, who have suffered in wrong treatments (I-). Better understanding of evolution could improve animal health and happiness and more balanced ecology of cultivation as well as production of organic foods and human health (E+). So information technology could co-operate with understanding of evolution to create a new, happier agriculture (I+, E+).1b) Information technology can lead to genetic manipulation and produce more effective \u2018agriculture\u2019 as tissue cultivation without animals or plants, but with the risks of misunderstanding of our own genetic balance (I-, E-?). 2a) Economy: A nation or a company could apply the evolution theory as fighting for survival and by exploiting weaker economies as their resources (E-).2b) The scientific technological progress can be used for the whole human kind for to combat the common problems e.g. poverty, diseases, air/water pollution and for recycling to save resources (I+).3a) Political science could use the evolution theory to rule or even to destroy the weaker units (E-) but also for better understanding of human happiness and to avoid conflicts (E+).3b) Improving information could be use by politics (caretaking of common problems) for to relocate resources and to produce peace, respect of human rights, religious freedom (I+). 4a) Religions could be seen as an evolutionary process from primitive to advanced monotheistic religions and how they would fit for survival (E+), but also as a battle field to destroy others (E-). Evolutionism as a religion or ideology has caused racism, eugenics, and genocide (E-). Some evolutionists rejoice of human disasters as a chance for recovery of nature. Humans have been understood as the worst and most disastrous species without any privilege, which should disappear for saving the nature (E-). Proper information and projects could save many species from extinction (I+).4b) Proper utilization of huge information resources should create common rules for global responsibility (I+). Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists should agree about responsibility of free will, religious freedom, and human values. Jesus Christ came to teach about love. He died for love and for the salvation of humans. Humans can start from religious repentance to political awakening to global economic responsibility and mutual respect. Strong human rights and Christian love could help caretaking of poor, sick and weaker parts of humanity (I+). ",

            "answer_text": "Agriculture is just a subset of biology with a business attached, so evolution affects it at the most basic level. In order to cultivate plants, it helps to know what makes them suited to their environment and what factors could make them more or less productive if you begin to modify them through selective propagation. Early humans began doing this without any concept of evolution, but our modern understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in organisms has enabled much more deliberate and targeted modifications. As for the other fields you mentioned, change in living organisms from one generation to the next won't affect them, as they are abstracts in the human mind, but that mind has been shaped by evolution and the things it does are often explained by the environments in which past humans lived. Hence, it is possible that evolutionary psychology can inform our understanding of those fields. Note that the paragraphs to follow are speculative. For example, compulsive spending despite limited funds may stem from a previous survival advantage conveyed by hoarding food and other supplies at any sign of scarcity. It's not adaptive now, but the brain doesn't know that at the instinctive level, and even looking at numbers that represent things like overdrawn bank accounts may not send a strong enough signal to overcome the instinct. Similarly, our evolutionary past appears to have shaped us to go along with our social group even if we suspect they might be wrong, because being ostracized could be even more dangerous than picking a bad spot to forage or not hunting the best game. When you hear people say they \u201csupport XYZ, right or wrong\u201d, that is quite possibly why: at our core, we are social animals and the loyalty of our peers is valued higher than even factual correctness. Obvious examples spring to mind in religion, politics, organizational behavior in business and government, and other fields. ",

There is a terribly clueless and naive view that Darwinian Evolution (DE) is somehow \u201cScience\u201d; it\u2019s not, at least no more than Theology is Science (definitions and consistency?). DE has an implied world view, that of naturalism and materialism, the naive assumption that matter is all that exist and that it's possible for matter to be self-existent. Darwin\u2019s final edition of his famous book is nothing more than one long argument for Naturalism. So you ask, how does his long argument for naturalism influence other fields? The short answer is, immensely. Not because it is \u201cscience\u201d but because Darwin gave the world an alternative which seemed more attractive to many, those that do not like the ideas and implications associated with not-naturalism. It is easy to show that Naturalism and Scientism has done immense damage to science and to other fields such as the economy, agriculture, political science and religion. The short answer is that false presuppositions and false hypothesis are detrimental to the world, false beliefs cause people to shape reality in the wrong direction and causes great harm. That is why the reformation and enlightenment did the world so much good. If one worships the Truth, then beliefs have to be based on evidence and reason, not mere dogma falsely called science just because it pertains to matter, albeit the apotheosis thereof. ",

And politics uses any means to advance it's cause, including evolution. Hitler used genetic supremacy of his race, for starting WW2 and the elimination of Jews. Religion: Some aspects of evolution can contradict religious concepts, such as a god having made all the millions species on this planet. Including humans. And then leaving a fossil and genetic record of evolution. Perhaps the biggest impact of evolution, is religion coming up with rebuttals, with such concepts as Intelligent Design and Creationism. What's important is that evolution is just a scientific fact. It does not care how we use it. For better or for worse. Did I mention that evolution is a scientific fact? ",

All the rest is less logical, even potentially harmful. When people look at economics, politics and religion and imbue it with some of the thoughts behind the theory of evolution and the forming of species, they tend to emphasise the competition, the tooth and claw aspect. It\u2019s never about empathy, symbiosis, attraction etc. So, let ideology and the humanities be more than the simplest of stories and if you really want to base them on a scientific theory outside the field, make sure you really know and understand that theory instead of getting stuck at \u201c\u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d  .

Not on your list are medicine and biology, both of which are largely dependent on an understanding of evolution to advance. ",
