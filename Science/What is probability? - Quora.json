            "answer_text": "Probability is a deeply weird and disturbing topic. The harder I look at it, the weirder and more disturbing it becomes. I find the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to be the least weird and disturbing way to think about it. Let me tell you a story. In ninth grade math, we took a break from all the trigonometry to do a little section on probability. It wasn't anything exotic, just the likelihood of pulling certain cards out of a deck, stuff like that. I had been a straight-A math student my whole life until that point, and I couldn't wrap my head around probability at all. I could memorize the equations well enough, but I was used to intuitively understanding the rationale behind the equations, and with probability I just could not do it. When you flip a coin and it winds up tails, where does the heads outcome \"go?\" How does the coin \"know\" it's supposed to converge on a fifty-fifty ratio of heads and tails as you flip it more and more times? I almost flunked the test on that unit, I was so baffled. I forgot the whole thing until more recently when I started learning about quantum mechanics. That's where the probability questions get to be way more philosophically disturbing than in coin-flipping and card-choosing.  The situation is summed up best by the famous double-slit experiment. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment In this experiment, you shine light through a screen with a pair of slits in it onto photographic film. You get a stripy interference pattern as the waves of light coming from each slit overlap each other, the way overlapping ripples in a pond do. In this case, what's \"waving\" is the probability density of a given photon passing through a given slit and landing at a given spot on the screen. Just the thought of probability having a physical density gives me intense vertigo, but it gets worse. If you shoot a single photon at a time through the slits onto the film, the result looks like this:  Each individual photon somehow \"knows\" that there are two slits, and that the probability waves emanating from each slit interfere with each other. So even when the photons come one at a time and don't interact with each other at all, they still obey the same probability distribution as if you fired them all at once. What's even weirder is that you can get this same result with any quantum particle, and even entire molecules like buckyballs. You can interpret this situation to mean that the probability waves are some sort of physical entity, a \"pilot\" wave that tells each photon what to do, which somehow extends forwards and backwards in time. I find this idea repugnant. You could also interpret the experiment to mean that space and time are nonlocal in some way that lets the single photon go through both slits at once. I also find this idea repugnant. The only explanation of the double-slit experiment that makes any sense to me is the many-worlds interpretation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_many-worlds_interpretation Because the left-slit universe and the right-slit universes are so similar, they overlap and mutually interfere, and that's what produces the stripy pattern. It took me some time to get used to many-worlds, but once I got comfortable with it, I've become much more relaxed when I think about probabilities. Now I just see the different possible outcomes as all happening in some universe, and the \"probability density\" is just the density of the different universes. If I flip a coin, there's an equal number of universes where it lands heads or tails, plus a very small number of universes where all the particles in the coin spontaneously jump into the Andromeda galaxy.  I'm not a mathematician or a scientist. I'm just a humanities guy who likes math and science. So if you're a professional in one of these fields and you can correct me or clarify what I'm trying to say here, please do, I want to understand this stuff more clearly. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything is probabilistic! One day I was explaining probability to my younger brother and I realized that although we use certainty as the default tone in our statements, everything that is yet to happen is probabilistic and never certain. When someone says \"I will be in office in half an hour\", they are simply rounding off the very high probability of reaching office in half an hour to certainty. In practice, certainty does not exist. Consider this: toss a fair coin into air. As soon as it leaves your hand, all factors affecting its outcome are potentially fixed. The torque, the coin itself, its landing spot, etc but still, for humans watching the coin in the air, the probability of both the outcomes are equal. Its because even if we know that now that the coin has been tossed the probability is not 50/50, we don't know which event is more likely to happen. So, a call of heads or tails even after the coin has been tossed is a fair call. You see, what makes it fair is our ignorance to the bias and not the absence of the bias itself. Just think about it, on one side we say that truly random events do not exist and on the other we say that everything is probabilistic, for those statements to be true simultaneously the observer needs to be of limited intelligence - that's us by the way! Probability has a lot to do with what we expect than what actually happens. For example, even if you could get your hands on a \"fair coin\", will it never fall and stand on its edge? If it could, even if once in a million tosses, why don't we have it in our mathematics books? The answer is simple: we do expect it to happen once in a while but then, a coin having a probability distribution of 0.49, 0.49 and 0.02 is mostly useless. So we call that 0.02 an error outcome and divide the probability into all desirable outcomes i.e. heads and tails. Simply put, probability derives from expectation (please don't confuse expectation with desire). That's it's definition. That is how it is used. We apply our knowledge to increase the probability of desirable events. Although, \"What should one expect? \" is a very difficult question and this is what makes probability complex. Our expectations are dependent on our subjective knowledge and our capabilities to draw inference. Probability is difficult because it forces us to be creative and think of possibilities and then assign ranks to them. With more factors to consider, setting an expectation becomes more and more difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "Probability is simply a useful description (in the form of a mathematical model) for experiments whose exact outcome is difficult to predict in advance. When you toss a coin, it's tough to know in advance if a head or a tail will appear (or if the world will end while the coin is still bouncing on the ground).  When you can't predict the exact outcome, it's often useful to try to characterize EVERY outcome that COULD occur along with a numerical description as to which are the most likely to occur.  The numerical description you choose can be based on your past experience, a knowledge of physics, what makes for easy calculations, or many other factors. The usual model for the coin toss is to say that Heads and Tails are possible. (We ignore the possibility of the world ending or the coin landing on its edge or any other REALLY unlikely scenario because including them seems to complicate the model without much useful payoff).   We then guess that heads and tails should be about equally likely (based on physics and our own experience flipping coins) so we assign them the same numerical measure of that likelihood (called their probability).  That equal value turns out to be 1/2 (instead of 2 or 25 or -1.7) so that we can interpret probabilities as a proportion or frequency.  (Choosing the total probability measure to be one has some other nice properties as well.) ",

            "answer_text": "Probability: It is a measurement of likelihood that a particular event will occur. It ranges between 0 to 1 where 0 means event is impossible to occur and 1 mean event will for sure (certain) will occur. But wait!! Why we are going to study probability? Why should we bother about likelihood of any event? Is there any practical implication in real life? Before answering those questions let me quote you Charlie Munger here. If you don\u2019t get elementary probability into your repertoire you go through a long life life a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. Charlie Munger  Let us take one example\u2026 Let says there in Annual National coin flipping contest happening in your country.  This contest will last for 20 straight days and hey there are limited seats so only 1048576 people can participate and each has to contribute 5$ to play this game. Every time head comes you won and will qualify for next day and if it tails then you are out of the game. Quite interesting and easy? Isn\u2019t it? The one who will win throughout 20 days will get prize of 1 Million dollars!!  Yeah you heard it right!! With 5$ of investment and 20 days of hard work (flipping the coin each morning once) you may become millionaire. We cannot exactly tell how the game will turn each day but from likelihood is that half of the people turn Heads and another half tails. Below is the list of likelihood outcome. Days People Participated People threw Heads People Threw Tails 1 1048576 524288 524288 2 524288 262144 262144 3 262144 131072 131072 4 131072 65536 65536 5. 65536 32768 32768 6. 32768 16384 16384 7. 16384 8192 8192 18 8 4 4 19 4 2 2 20 2 1 1 Here is our Winner!!!!  This Winner may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties he will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what his technique is, and what marvellous insights he bring to the field of flipping!! Now the important question is, Should you try your luck with 5 $ for this contest?? Probability says you should not!! Yes you heard it right!! You Shouldn\u2019t!! You Shouldn\u2019t (Yeah I am screaming You Shouldn\u2019tJ) I know your mind has already released dopamine by looking and Imagining 1Million dollars and you are thinking right now BUT WHY??? Let probability itself answer this question\u2026 Likelihood of your winning this contest is  Which means 1 out of 1048576!! Which means if you play this game 1048576 times than you have chance to win one time!!! And if you play this game for 1048576 times then you will have to spend 5242880$ which is more than 5 million Dollars!! Do you still want to get into the game where you need to spend more than 5 Millions to earn 1 millions dollars( Also don\u2019t forget pain of hard work of flipping coin for 20971520 (20X1048576)  I know you are still thinking its just 5$ bet and you should not go into this type of thinking!! But wait!! Because of you and people like you who don\u2019t think in this way are creating wealth for all the casinos around the world!! They are making loads of money because of you! Remember the people who are organising this annual contest are getting 5$ from each of the contestant who participate which means 5X 1048576 = 5242880$. And what is the prize Money they are paying ? 1 Millions dollars What is the Net profit to them in just 10 days = 4242880$ (Which is more than 4 Millions dollars) And this profit is for sure(Certain) and probability of earning this money for organizers is 1. If you don\u2019t care spending 5 $ without considering rationality based on Probability it will effect your course of actions next time for similar type of bets and you will get to play more and more bets in future in one way or other and slowly this will result into more losses. I know what you are thinking!!But there is only one Annual contest!!! If the organiser can earn more than 4Millions dollars for sure why not they start this contest every month? Why not every day? Why not every minute? Why not every 30 seconds?.. The more the Games will be played more will be their earnings right? By starting it every 30 seconds there will more than millions game in one year ( 1051200) Now its upto you how many games you want to play to earn 1 million dollars? But probability says you need to play 1048576 Games. Do you want to play those many games for earning 1 million dollars? Because if you play less than chances are that you will loss all those games? How any game you want to play ? 1 means you will loss 5 $ 2 means you will loss 10 $ 1048576 means you will loss 4 more than million dollars So in this game there is no profit and only loss!!

            "answer_text": "What is probability? Hume begins \u201cOf Knowledge\u201d by saying: \u201cThere are seven [Part I. Sect. 5.] different kinds of philosophical relation, viz. RESEMBLANCE, IDENTITY, RELATIONS OF TIME AND PLACE, PROPORTION IN QUANTITY OR NUMBER, DEGREES IN ANY QUALITY, CONTRARIETY and CAUSATION.\u201d A critical point: \u201cOf these seven philosophical relations, there \u2026[are]\u2026 only four, which depending solely upon ideas, can be the objects of knowledge and certainty. These four are RESEMBLANCE, CONTRARIETY, DEGREES IN QUALITY, and PROPORTIONS IN QUANTITY OR NUMBER. If we fast forward to \u201cOf PROBABILITY, AND OF THE IDEA OF CAUSE AND EFFECT\u201d, we find this: \u201cThis is all I think necessary to observe concerning those four relations, which are the foundation of science; but as to the other three, which depend not upon the idea, and may be absent or present even while that remains the same, it will be proper to explain them more particularly. These three relations are identity, the situations in time and place, and causation.\u201d Very next paragraph: \u201cAll kinds of reasoning consist in nothing but a comparison, and a discovery of those relations, either constant or inconstant, which two or more objects bear to each other. This comparison we may make, either when both the objects are present to the senses, or when neither of them is present, or when only one. When both the objects are present to the senses along with the relation, we call this perception rather than reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the thought, or any action, properly speaking, but a mere passive admission of the impressions through the organs of sensation. According to this way of thinking, we ought not to receive as reasoning any of the observations we may make concerning identity, and the relations of time and place; since in none of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present to the senses, either to discover the real existence or the relations of objects. It is only causation, which produces such a connexion, as to give us assurance from the existence or action of one object, that it was followed or preceded by any other existence or action; nor can the other two relations be ever made use of in reasoning, except so far as they either affect or are affected by it. There is nothing in any objects to perswade us, that they are either always remote or always contiguous; and when from experience and observation we discover, that their relation in this particular is invariable, we, always conclude there is some secret cause, which separates or unites them. The same reasoning extends to identity. We readily suppose an object may continue individually the same, though several times absent from and present to the senses; and ascribe to it an identity, notwithstanding the interruption of the perception, whenever we conclude, that if we had kept our eye or hand constantly upon it, it would have conveyed an invariable and uninterrupted perception. But this conclusion beyond the impressions of our senses can be founded only on the connexion of cause and effect; nor can we otherwise have any security, that the object is not changed upon us, however much the new object may resemble that which was formerly present to the senses. Whenever we discover such a perfect resemblance, we consider, whether it be common in that species of objects; whether possibly or probably any cause coued operate in producing the change and resemblance; and according as we determine concerning these causes and effects, we form our judgment concerning the identity of the object. Here then it appears, that of those three relations, which depend not upon the mere ideas, the only one, that can be traced beyond our senses and informs us of existences and objects, which we do not see or feel, is causation. This relation, therefore, we shall endeavour to explain fully before we leave the subject of the understanding.\u201d So, he thinks causation is the special relation and as it is the stuff of probable reason, which gives us the goodly part of our understanding and a priori the wee, it consumes most of our mind. The brain is \u201ca massively massive parallel processor\u201d (probably) because this is the processor type necessary to do probable reason. Adam Smith\u2019s system is clearly the work of probable reason with just a wee bit of a priori reason. The following is related to this answer. It is Smith\u2019s thoughts that are of evolution: \u201c\u2026self-preservation, and the propagation of the species, are the great ends which Nature seems to have proposed in the formation of all animals. Mankind are endowed with a desire of those ends, and an aversion to the contrary; with a love of life, and a dread of dissolution; with a desire of the continuance and perpetuity of the species, and with an aversion to the thoughts of its entire extinction. But though we are in this manner endowed with a very strong desire of those ends, it has not been intrusted to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason to find out the proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts. Hunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, the love of pleasure, and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends which the great Director of nature intended to produce by them. We are forced to feel our way through life and this means that certainty that comes from reason is not as important as our suspicions that come from feelings. In fact it is our suspicions from our feelings that directs our reason to determine if our suspicions are right and it aids us in discovering wholes of truth such as Smith\u2019s system of perfect liberty \u2014 the system necessary for the survival of the species.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s first ask ourselves: \u201cWhere did probability come from?\u201d. To find out we shall go back in time to 16th Century. We are now in Italy at private party organized by aristocrats - known as ridotti. This is the first time in history that different ways to gamble were possible at one place. It was great fun for aristocrats, as easy way for adrenaline rush. Gambling became popular with poor people too, as the way to get rich. Soon people started noticing that there are cases in which they lose more than they win and vice versa. Mathematician Gerolamo Cardano tried to describe this phenomenon mathematically, and he tried to predict what games are the best to bet on. His idea was to represent likelihood to win as ratio of total number of favorable and unfavorable outcomes . Probability was introduced with the same idea and purpose, but written with formal terms - so it became ratio of number of favorable outcomes and total number of outcomes. So people started finding probability to help them win gambles? Yes, at first. But they soon realized it\u2019s potential was infinite. With the same method we could almost predict if something is going to happen. In the human nature is to always be prepared for what is coming, so we can make right decisions. For example, let\u2019s say there is 93% chance that it will rain tomorrow. If i go outside tomorrow, i would take umbrella with myself. If we didn\u2019t have the probability, we would have to look up at the sky and wonder if it will rain\u2026 The same idea can be implemented in lots of examples: disease spreading in medicine, risk assessment in finance, and many, many more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "To calculate the number of total outcomes and favorable outcomes, you might have to calculate a combination. Remember, a combination is a way to calculate events where order does not matter. Let's look at an example. To enjoy his movies, John decides to order a pizza. Looking at the menu, John sees the Pizza King offers eight different topping (four meat and four vegetables). The toppings are: pepperoni, ham, bacon, sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions and olives. John has a coupon for a 3-topping pizza. Choosing ingredients at random, what is the probability of John selecting a pizza with meat only? John is looking for the probability of selecting a meat-only pizza. In order to do so, he will need to calculate the total number of favorable outcomes over the total outcomes possible. Let's first calculate the total number of outcomes. To calculate the total outcomes, we will use the formula for combinations because the order of the pizza toppings does not matter. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r! * (n - r)!, where n represents the number of items, and r represents the number of items being chosen at a time. John is selecting three toppings from the eight offered by Pizza King. 8 would represent our n term, and 3 would represent our r term. So, our equation will look like 8C3 = 8! / 3! * (8 - 3)!. To solve this equation, we need to subtract 8 - 3 = 5. So, our equation now looks like 8! / 3! * 5!. Next, we need to expand each of these factorials. 8! would equal 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, divided by 3! * 5!, which would equal 3 * 2 * 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. ",

The space of potential outcomes may be the roll of a die (outcomes 1\u20136) and that space is governed by a uniform distribution (ie the outcomes have identical probabilities). Easily you can deduce the probability of any roll, for example. Knowing this, in the more general case of any outcome, any space and any distribution you can calculate the probability of anything. This may sound intimidating, but the usual spaces are often well-known (discrete events from 1 to .. N or real numbers or higher dimensions of these) and the most frequent distributions are similarly well-described (uniform, normal/gaussian, poisson, binomial and a few others). Things become more complicated if \u201canything\u201d is conditional (depends on other events) or if \u201canything\u201d is a sequence of events etc. Probability can quickly become very counter-intuitive.

            "answer_text": "Lets say you are studying a complicated process, and there are many possible things that YOU THINK may happen (even if, in reality, there is only one specific thing that will happen). So you write out all the possibilities, perhaps even drawing a pretty tree diagram. Unfortunately, there may be way too many possibilities to draw! (The fact that there are so many is your first hint that mathematics might be useful in taming this beast.) Maybe you notice that some possibilities share the same properties, so in hopes of making your life easier, you put all the possibilities that have a particular property into one group, and you call it an EVENT. Unfortunately, even then there may be way too many events!  Nonetheless, you feel that you are getting somewhere. Now you want a way to compare different events, so you do the most obvious thing - count the number of possibilities in each event. If event A has 345 possibilities, while event B has 12 possibilities, then you conclude that event A is 'more likely'. You may wonder: is this reasoning justified? Well that clearly depends on what 'more likely' means. But you realize that 'more likely' doesn't have a precise definition. So you decide to make one. And of course, you decide to make the definition be exactly what it needs to be to support the claim you made earlier. So you have decided that event A is 'more likely' than event B if event A has more possibilities than event B. But how much more likely? Well you figure that if event A has 40 possibilities, while event B has 20 possibilities, then A is twice as likely as B. And if event A has 5 possibilities,while event B has 20, then A is 1/4 as likely as B. Now you feel very happy, for you have just developed a theory. All that is left is to give it an awesome name. How about the theory of Probability? Sounds awesome. Armed with these new ideas, you realize you can now describe anything you see! Maybe you decide to describe the stock market, so that you can predict where it goes and make a lot of money. However, you may end up losing all of your money, because your predictions are based on assumptions of what is 'more likely' using the definition that YOU came up with, and the universe couldn't care less about YOUR definition...

So, in this case, the exhaustive cases are 2 namely {Head, Tail}. Now, you can calculate the probability of getting a head as Favorable cases/Exhaustive cases = 1/2 = 0.5 is the probability Note that favorable case(s) of getting a head is only one. Example 2: Suppose you throw a dice then the possible outcomes namely, the exhaustive cases are 6 namely {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Now, if you consider getting an odd number as success then let us find out the favorable cases. The favorable cases are {1,3,5} Now, you can calculate the probability of getting an odd number as Favorable cases/Exhaustive cases = 3/6 = 0.5 So, the required probability is 0.5. Example 3: Suppose you draw a card from the well shuffled pack of 52 cards. Let us say that you are interested in finding out what is probability that you get a Jack. Then as a first step find out the favorable cases: The favorable cases are 4 namely Jack of Heart, Spade, Clubs and Diamond. The Exhaustive cases = 52 cards Favorable cases/Exhaustive cases = 4/52 = 0.077 So, the required probability is 0.077 ",

            "answer_text": "Scientists always think that a perfectly accurare model can predict any event before happening. And if given a chance, we would come up with one true model of the universe which will help us predict everything. Sadly we realized that there is infinitely many complex scenarios in which an event can happen. So, it makes it high impossible for us to predict every event. We might one day solve this problem. Or we may not. But, can we predict a simple event before happening ? Ofcourse, the stock market is too complex to be predicitve. But, how about a coin toss or throwing a dice ? Are these simple enough to be predictive ? What is a simple event then ? Any event with the number of possible outcomes being finitw can become a simple event. So, we could predict the coin toss. But, even then we have a problem. We can never predict them accurately. If an event has two possible outcomes, then at any case the event happens , we can never say that only one possible outcome can happen however unlike the second outcome may be. So, how do we predict events then ? By saying which event is a more possible outcome ? Or how much unlikely is one event compared to all other events? It sound like one of the ways we can use to predict things, right ? Probability can be defined as assigning likelihood to the outcome of an event with finite possible outcomes. That's what probability basically means. That's how it originated. To put it in a proper definition format, Probability can be defined as the extent to which an event is likely to occur, measured by the ratio of the favourable cases to the whole number of cases possible.

For eg. Probability of someone dying at age 60 is say 10% . This does not mean that every person will only be alive 90% after age 60 , this does not make sense. But , what this means is that out of 1000 people , probability of death is 10% i:e 100. So, on an average 100 people will die at age 60 , 900 won't. Similarly , if I want to calculate the chance of me reaching office on time, which can wary depending on traffic , I can calculate the time taken for past month , each day, and see how many times I reached within half hour and how many times I took more. So when I am telling my boss I will or will not reach on time, I can say with some probabilistic measure that I will reach on time. In real life it helps us prepare for all possible scenarios. I may not be sure of something , hence by gauging the chance of it occuring gives me a way to measure the certainty and compare it with other options I have. Hope this helps. ",

The first definition is from the Oxford English Dictionary : Math. As a measurable quantity: The amount of antecedent likelihood of a particular event as measured by the relative frequency of occurrence of events of the same kind in the whole course of experience; estimated by the ratio of the number of successful cases to the whole number of possible cases. Also, used of quantities which are derived logically by inferential or inductive reasoning, when mathematical concepts may be inapplicable or insufficient. Here are also two definitions from the Collins dictionary of Mathematics : (Statistics) a measure or estimate of the degree of confidence one may have in the occurrence of an event, measured on a scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty). It may be defined to be the proportion of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes if these are indifferent (mathematical probability) , or the proportion observed in a sample (EMPIRICAL PROBABILITY), or the limit of this as the sample size tends to infinity (RELATIVE FREQUENCY); measures of subjective probability are also used.also called axiomatic probability, the formal study of random or chance events, usually in terms of PROBABILITY MEASURE, independent RANDOM VARIABLES, and their generalizations. This arises in part from the study of permutations and combinations, and its results are applied to the analysis of empirical data by the construction of statistical tests, and are further developed in GAME THEORY and INFORMATION THEORY.",

            "answer_text": "I happen to have four text\u2019s on my desk that all give some semblance of definitions. Let\u2019s start with \u201cIntroduction to Probability: Theory and Applications\u201d by Scheaffer and Mendenhall, publshed by Duxbury Press 1975. Let\u2019s go to Chapter 2 Probability section 1 Probability. \u201cTo most people, \u2018probability\u2019 is a loosely defined term employed in everyday conversation to indicate the measure of one\u2019s belief in the occurrence of a future event. We accept this as a meaningful and practical interpretation of the term\u2026 \u2026 *examples of tosses of fair and unfair coins* \u2026 The relative frequency concept of probability is intuitively meaningful, but it does not provide a rigorous definition of probability. Many other concepts of probability have been proposed, including that of subjective probability, which allows the probability of an event to vary depending upon the person performing the evaluation. We shall devote no more time to this point, because the practical meaning of probability is a matter of philosophy that can be argued endlessly. For our purposes, we accept an interpretation based on relative frequency as a meaningful measure of one\u2019s belief in the occurrence of an event, and we shall now examine the link that probability provides between observation and inference \u2026\u201d Not much of a definition there but nearly an appeal to Aristotle. Probability is indication of the measure of one\u2019s belief in the occurrence of a future event. As a term they let it be defined by its use. Now let\u2019s take a look at \u201cStatistical Treatment of Experimental Data\u201d by Hugh D. Young Published in 1962 by McGraw-Hill. Again to Chapter 2 Probability Section 4 The Meaning of Probability. \u201cIf we throw a penny up in the air, we know intuitively that the \u2018chance\u2019 of its coming down heads is one-half or 50%. If we roll an ordinary die (singular of dice) we know that the chance of the number 5 coming up is one-sixth. What does this really mean, though? On each flip of the penny it comes down either heads or tails.; there is no such thing as a penny coming down half heads and half tails. What we really mean is that if we flip the penny a very large number of times, the number of times it comes down heads will be approximately one-half the total number of trials\u2026\u201d Another appeal to common use but here was have the workings of a strict definition. Probability is the fraction of a particular result taken over the total number of results when performed a very large number of times. Here we have something that might be hinting at limits in the definition. Let\u2019s look at some straight physics books\u2026 and maybe something published more recently. [Sadly my 1937 edition of First Principles of Physics doesn\u2019t have anything approaching a definition of probability] Let\u2019s start with my old thermo text. \u201cClassical and Statistical Thermodynamics\u201d by Ashley H. Carter published in 2001 by Prentice-Hall. All the way in Chapter 12 Statistical Thermodynamics Section 1 Introduction. \u201cThe number of microstates leading to a given macrostate is called the thermodynamic probability. It is the number of ways in which a given configuration can be achieved. This is an \u2018unnormalized\u2019 probability, an integer between zero and infinity rather than a number between zero and one. For the kth macrostate, the probability is taken to be [math]w_k[/math]. A true probability [math]p_k[/math] could be obtained by dividing [math]w_k[/math] by the total number of microstates [math]\\Omega[/math] \u2026\u201d So we\u2019re at something similar here. The true probability is the ratio of the number of ways a particular macrostate (I think fair to replace with \u2018observable\u2019 in this context of the total number of mircostates. The number of ways that something can happen divided by the number of ways anything can happen. I think that\u2019s my favorite one so far. Now I\u2019ve also got two quantum texts here that I think help make the second definition above a bit more strict. Let\u2019s start with \u201cUnderstanding Quantum Physics: A User\u2019s Manual\u201d by Michael A. Morrison published by Prentice-Hall in 1990. Oh this one looks promising Chapter 3 First Postulates Section 3 Probabilities: A Review subsection \u2018Probability Defined\u2019 \u201cWith all this chit-chat about ensembles out of the way we are at last ready to define a probability. For the sake of clarity, we\u2019ll start with a position probability; we can trivially extend this definition to any observable\u2026 \u2026 To calculate this quantity we merely divide the number of systems that exhibit [math]x_j[/math] \u2014 the number [math]n_j[/math] \u2026 \u2014 by the total number of experiments N: [math]\\frac{number\\:of\\:experiments\\:that\\:yield\\:x_j}{total\\:number\\:of\\:experiments} = \\frac{n_j}{N}[/math] \u2026 A more general quantity is the absolute position probability P(x), the generalization to an infinite ensemble: [math]P(x) \\equiv \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{n_j}{N}[/math] \u2026\u201d So this appeals to ensembles which I didn\u2019t include the definition of but are it essentially uses limits to formalize the second definition from above. Probability is fractionally how an experiment would turn out if we did it an infinite number of times. So I think we\u2019ve arrived at a solid three definitions from these books that aren\u2019t exactly the same but aren\u2019t completely incongruous. 1.) Probability is one\u2019s belief in the occurrence of a future event. 2.)Probability is the ratio of microstates that exhibit an observable out of the total number of microstates. With what I hope is a fair rephrasing, probability is the ratio between the number of ways a particular thing can happen in a particular situation and the number of ways anything can happen in a particular situation. 3.) Probability is the limiting ratio of an experimental result occurring and the total number of experiments. These definitions all have their merits. 1.) is great for conversational use, 2.) is rigorous and makes no appeal to experiments. That is to say that it allows for probability to exist independent of experiment or measurement. 3.) Gives a definition that can be approximated from experimental data. If I were forced to make a choice I think the second definition is my preferred. Oh we can also take a look at what Merriam-Webster has to say for a definition. Definition of PROBABILITY: Definition of probability plural probabilities 1 : the quality or state of being probable 2 : something (such as an event or circumstance) that is probable 3 a (1) : the ratio of the number of outcomes in an exhaustive set of equally likely outcomes that produce a given event to the total number of possible outcomes (2) : the chance that a given event will occur b : a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of probabilities 4 : a logical relation between statements such that evidence confirming one confirms the other to some degree Edit: I hope I fixed the equations ",

We can predict only the chance of an event to occur i.e. how likely they are to happen, using it. Probability can range in from 0 to 1, where 0 means the event to be an impossible one and 1 indicates a certain event. Probability for class 10 is an important topic for the students which explains all the basic concepts of this topic. The probability of all the events in a sample space adds up to 1. For example, when we toss a coin, either we get Head OR Tail, only two possible outcomes are possible (H, T). But if we toss two coins in the air, there could be three possibilities of events to occur, such as both the coins show heads or both shows tails or one shows heads and one tail, i.e.(H, H), (H, T),(T, T).

Then to determine the probability of some complicated event, or a set of events, you count up how many of the atomic events each contribute to your event of interest. For a simple example, what is the probability of rolling 3 dice and getting a sum of 4? The atomic event is that the three dice land on numbers {i, j, k} for i, j, k each between 1 and 6. There are exactly 6*6*6 = 216 different atomic events, all equally likely. The atomic events that contribute to the event A = \u201csum of 4\u201d are: {2,1,1}, {1,2,1} and {1,1,2} only. So Pr[A] = 3/216 = 1.4%. ",

            "answer_text": "Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of a given event's occurrence, which is expressed as a number between 1 and 0. An event with a probability of 1 can be considered a certainty: for example, the probability of a coin toss resulting in either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1, because there are no other options, assuming the coin lands flat. An event with a probability of .5 can be considered to have equal odds of occurring or not occurring: for example, the probability of a coin toss resulting in \"heads\" is .5, because the toss is equally as likely to result in \"tails.\" An event with a probability of 0 can be considered an impossibility: for example, the probability that the coin will land (flat) without either side facing up is 0, because either \"heads\" or \"tails\" must be facing up. A little paradoxical, probability theory applies precise calculations to quantify uncertain measures of random events. ",

Probability models are the nexus between mathematical probability and its real world applications: one posits a probability model which is intended to accurately represent the behavior of the system in question, and then mathematical probability provides tools for performing a wide variety of calculations for the model. The results of these calculations will only be useful insofar as the model is good. For example, to model a random die toss, we might use [math]\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}[/math] to represent the set of possible results and assign a probability value of [math]\\frac{1}{6}[/math] to each result. If the die is fair, predictions made based on this probability model will be reliable. If the die is weighted, however, these predictions will be inaccurate. ",

Or there are possibilities to different degrees the event may occur. An event that occurs for sure is called a Certain event and its probability is 1. An event that doesn\u2019t occur at all is called an impossible event and its probability is 0. This means that all other possibilities of an event occurrence lie between 0 and 1. This is depicted as follows: 0 <= P(A) <= 1 where A is an event and P(A) is the probability of the occurrence of the event. This also means that a probability value can never be negative. Every event will have a set of possible outcomes. It is called the \u2018sample space\u2019. Consider the example of tossing a coin. When a coin is tossed, the possible outcomes are Head and Tail. So, the sample space is represented as {H, T}. Similarly when two coins are tossed, the sample space is {(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)}. The probability of head each time you toss the coin is 1/2. So is the probability of tail. link for further info https://viden.io/knowledge/maths-probability-chapter ",

Also 3 floor is better than 5 floor is what our intuition tells, and to formalize this institution by quantifying it we introduce the concept of probability.

In other words you try to predict something on the basis of probability. You're not sure of any event. That is why we need probability which says at some confidence say 95% that what you're trying to predict will happen. Because one cannot simple predict future outcomes at a stake. That is why we need probability. ",

The frequentist view sees probability as a relative frequency: if you repeat an experiment a large number of times, and count how many times the event A occurs, the ratio of the number of times A occurs to the number of times the experiment was performed gives the probability of event A. In the Bayesian view, probability reflects a degree of belief. You look at the evidence and update your belief based on the evidence. This view is useful when there is no experiment to perform. It allows answering questions such as \u201cWhat is the probability that earth is older than X years?\u201d. ",

I got sent here after a question about flips. To answer event probability or probability distribution, I will just say that if you describe an an event that either does or does not happen, better to say will or will not happen, then probability is basically a number between 0 and 1 that answers what fraction of the time it will happen. Certain occurrence gets P=1, certain nonoccurrence gets P=0. P=1/2 means the event happens half the time. ",

Here 6 is not number balls but those are events. In this scenario events are scoring run. Which would be 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6 or 0 runs. Total events are 6 so, probability or chances to hit six is 1/6. More simply, if you toss coin probability of getting head or tail is 50%. I hope you undersood. Thank you! ",

Where if probability shows for an event are 0 then it means that there is no chance of occurrence of that event and if probability shows 1 then there is surely the certain chance of occurrence of that event. That\u2019s it, In the case we haven\u2019t met before, I\u2019m Krishna Singh Thanks! ",
