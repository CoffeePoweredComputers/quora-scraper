            "answer_text": "Not in any biological sense since air molecules are simple, don\u2019t \u201cdie\u201d and don\u2019t need nourishment, etc. The oxygen in air provides the energy needed to drive aerobic biological processes, and the nitrogen the basis for protein, and ultimately the bases that form RNA/DNA. Thought not alive itself, air supports life. But air does move, both horizontally and vertically, with the impulse for this being the uneven heating of the earth\u2019s surface by the sun, it\u2019s humidification, mostly by warm ocean water, buoyancy caused by a gravitational field acting on the differential density of air masses, and the spinnng of the earth, which introduces Coriolis Forces that introduces vorticity (cyclonic action). Without this movement, heat would be more concentrated near the equator and \u201ccold\u201d near the poles. ",
