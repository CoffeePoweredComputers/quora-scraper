            "answer_text": "I must confess that no spectacular example sprang to mind.       There is a notorious bromide that great scientists do their great work in their 20s and spend the rest of their lives trying futilely to build on it. Many examples are cited, of which Einstein is probably the most famous.      Going the other direction is less common, so I don't recall ever reading a book or article that stressed an elder scientist's contribution. However, on its face, it seems unlikely that a brilliant fountain must always dry up quickly.      I can think of three broad categories of success \"later in life\":      (1) Some very important researchers die young, so everything they accomplish is late in life and we cannot know what they might have done past middle age. One example is Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography studies were crucial to revealing the geometry of DNA. She died of ovarian cancer at 38, before she got the credit she deserved...including any chance to share the Crick-Watson-Wilkins Nobel (Nobels cannot be given posthumously). Over the centuries, there have been a LOT of tragedies like this in science.       (2) Some scientists never have an \"annus mirabilis\" early or late, but plug gamely on with a steady stream of good work. Collectively their efforts may be important, even if no single result is \"Nobel worthy.\" An example might be Benjamin Franklin, who did some of his electrical research in his late 40s. He was in his 60s when he published a chart of the Gulf Stream which, had it not been ignored by British sea captains for decades, could have shaved weeks off Atlantic voyages. Of course, Franklin didn't do much original research in the last 20 years of his life; but he can be forgiven perhaps, having been tied up helping to found a new kind of nation. Nonetheless, just four years before his death, he did compile all his oceanographic studies into a comprehensive book. Another example: Darwin worked many years on evolution before publishing his most important book, The Origin of Species, at age 50. He did other important follow-up work before his death 23 years later. Archimedes seems to have been productive all his life, and he had so many \"biggies\" that even if one came late in life, it's the whole corpus of his work that would matter most.       (3) Finally, a scientist might do average work for decades and then make a remarkable discovery just before retiring. In this category I draw a blank. I notice there is another link here relevant to that topic: Which famous scientists have done a lot of their creatively significant work late in life? I have resisted the temptation to cheat by looking at it. However, I'm going to do so now; and recommend that others do so, too. ",
