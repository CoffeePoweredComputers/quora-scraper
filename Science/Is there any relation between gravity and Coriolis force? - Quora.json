            "answer_text": "No. You will also experience this force far away in space in a rotating spacecraft. The Coriolis force is related to inertia and is a pseudo-force. In Newton mechanics when you are in a rotating frame of reference in absolute space, inertia wants you to move in a straight line while you are rotating. The net effect is that you will feel pseudo forces like the centrifugal force and the coriolis force. ",
