            "answer_text": "\u201c2001\u201d in Cinerama. If you haven\u2019t seen it in Cinerama, you haven\u2019t seen it. Would you say you\u2019d seen \u201cGravity\u201d if you\u2019d only watched it on your tablet? Even IMAX is no substitute for the magnificence of 3 full sized screens joined seamlessly. I saw it 13 times that way and the immersive quality has no match. I know everything wrong with it\u2014from a science POV especially the way astronauts move on the Moon\u2019s surface and the fact that the ancestral species we come from walked fully upright, not hunched over. And tapirs weren\u2019t found in Africa, nor in deserts. Stuff like that. OTOH even The Martian didn\u2019t capture how humans would move on Mars\u2014like nothing\u2019s been learned about making sci fi movies since then. But what\u2019s right with it trumps (so to speak) its failings. It\u2019s actually science fiction, and the more science you know the more obvious this becomes. One way to tell: the spaceships make no noise in space. The only other sci fi movies I can recall that obey this basic fact are Fobidden Planet and Serenity (both great in their own right).It has gravitas. Have you heard astronauts describe their spacewalks or even sitting in the observation port of the ISS gazing out at the universe? Kubrick, without the benefit of any CGI whatsoever, managed this through the use of deep-focus cameras and incredibly time-consuming cinematography of the deep space sequences. The result is that nothing on this planet\u2019s surface delivers the feeling of the astronaut\u2019s in-space experience like watching the deep space portions of 2001 in Cinerama.Best music score (again with a nod to Forbidden Planet): Richard Strauss, Josef Strauss, Aram Khatchaturian, Gyorgi LIgeti\u2014an awesome combination. Richard Williams is fun, but this is the real deal.Best use of silence. Most notably when Hal unplugs the astronaut and the sounds you\u2019d been hearing from inside the astronaut\u2019s suit abruptly cease, followed by a looong sequence as his body disappers into the infinite night. Conversely, when the other astronaut has to re-enter the space ship the hard way, you don\u2019t hear the explosive bolts but just the sound gradually coming up in the airlock as it shuts and fills with air. This is master film-maker stuff, applied to the science fiction genre.Best FTL visualization\u2014with no GCI!No exposition\u2014like Mary Poppins, Kubrick never explains anything.Best \u201cship life\u201d portrayal. The shadowboxing sequence is a tour de force.Kubrick understands that there\u2019s more to a movie than plot and action sequences. Atmosphere matters\u2014even when it\u2019s a vacuum.Pity you can\u2019t see 2001 now. Except through, in effect, a pinhole.  ",
