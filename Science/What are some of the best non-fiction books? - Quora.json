            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have one favorite, and I haven\u2019t yet read that many. So here are a few: Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond was one of my first non-fiction books. I should probably be ashamed but (a) I started reading late in life, and (b) I knew almost nothing about evolution (though religion was too weak in my country to have filled the void with anything beyond \u201cwe are made from god\u201d. Almost like the big bang. God clicked his fingers and puff). Anyway, after being blown away by this book I started reading more evolutionary books and I remember stopping and, almost talking to myself, this bit is like what Jared said. It really was a fantastic introduction for me. Walden Thoreau, Henry David my kind of guy, my kind of book, my kind of everything. Big Magic Gilbert, Elizabeth, nothing special here but honestly I still think about it and smile. Prisons We Choose to Live Inside Lessing, Doris. I finished this very recently and I loved it. I listened to it, I am going to read it again to make notes but as far as I remember its a call to use the knowledge we have and are gaining in the sciences to free ourselves from our tribal mentalities. We cannot expect a government to say to children, \u201cYou are going to have to live in a world full of mass movements, both religious and political, mass ideas, mass cultures. Every hour of every day you will be deluged with ideas and opinions that are mass produced, and regurgitated, whose only real vitality comes from the power of the mob, slogans, pattern thinking. You are going to be pressured all through your life to join mass movements, and if you can resist this, you will be, every day, under pressure from various types of groups, often of your closest friends, to conform to them. \u201cIt will seem to you many times in your life that there is no point in holding out against these pressures, that you are not strong enough. \u201cBut you are going to be taught how to examine these mass ideas, these apparently irresistible pressures, taught how to think for yourself, and to choose for yourself. \u201cYou will be taught to read history, so as to learn how short-lived ideas are, how apparently the most irresistible and persuasive ideas can, and do, vanish overnight. You will be taught how to read literature, which is the study of mankind by itself, so as to understand the development of people and peoples. Literature is a branch of anthropology, a branch of history; and we will make sure that you will know how to judge an idea from the point of view of long-term human memory. For literature and history are branches of human memory, recorded memory. \u201cTo these studies will be added those new branches of information, the young sciences of psychology, social psychology, sociology and so on, so that you may understand your own behaviour, and the behaviour of the group which will be, all your life, both your comfort and your enemy, both your support and your greatest temptation, since to disagree with your friends\u2014you group animal\u2014will always be painful. \u201cYou will be taught that no matter how much you have to conform outwardly\u2014because the world you are going to live in often punishes unconformity with death\u2014to keep your own being alive inwardly, your own judgment, your own thought \u2026.\u201d Well, no, we cannot expect this kind of thing to be in the curriculum laid down by any state or government currently visible in the world. But parents may talk and teach like this, and certain schools may. And groups of young adults who have run the gauntlet of state education, or private education, and survived with enough of their critical faculties intact to want more than they have been given, may teach themselves and each other what they will. Such people, such individuals, will be a most productive yeast and ferment, and lucky the society who has plenty of them. This kind of thing fills me with joy. ",

            "answer_text": "The Seven Mysteries of Life. Guy MurchieThis book was a huge influence on me. A tome of a book that examines life from multiple perspectives. Fascinating. Redefining our definitions of life.The Dancing Wu Li Master, Gary ZurkovOf all the books exploring our new relationship with the sub-atomic world and how this colours our understanding of reality, this was the most fun and most accessible.Doors of Perception, Heaven and Hell, Aldous HuxleyAlso a huge influence on me, not so much on the nature of hallucinogens, but on how we perceive and what creates peak experiences and how this has shaped our culture.The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, Michael PollenI like everything this guy writes or produces. But this one was a nice combination of history and personality and sense. Three sections about food. Fast food. Organic food. Hunter gatherer food.Music, the Brain and Ecstasy, Robert Jourdain. There were a number of books I read that explored the magic and mystery of music and what it does in our brain\u2026 again, this was the most fun and accessible.The World Without Us, Alan WeismanI dunno. Kind of a weird idea for a book, but if we suddenly all disappeared, how long would it take for the planet to restore itself. Ever since Diamond Dogs, I\u2019ve always fantasized about what cities would look like in total decay.The God Delusion, Richard DawkinsNo description needed. Thanks, Dick, for writing this and getting things moving.The Laughing Jesus, Tim Freke and Peter GandyA very cool book. Part one explores the three Abrahamic religions and questions the historical Jesus. This was the first I realized that there isn\u2019t much (if any) evidence for a historical Jesus. Part two explores Gnostic texts that the authors find far more interesting. These were omitted from the Bible.The Occult, Colin WilsonCan\u2019t remember much about it except that I thoroughly enjoyed it. A fascinating history of magic through the centuries, though it gets a bit weird at the end when he gets into his pet theory about a \u2018Factor X\u2019.Virginia Woolf, a Biography. Quinton BellI was a big Woolf fan back in the day, and immersing myself in the Bloomsbury Group was quite the treat.",
