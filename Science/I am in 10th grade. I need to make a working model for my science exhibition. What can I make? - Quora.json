            "answer_text": "This is very low tech, and a kids game based on completing a circuit. Take a shoe-box, make holes on the lid. Thread a wire thro' one hole (W1), and hook to a say the + of a battery (batt holder, if you can get one) take another wire (W2) connect the - of the battery to one 'pin' a bulb (get one from your festival decoration) Take a third wire (W3), connect to the other 'pin' of the bulb and thread it out of second hole on the lid of the shoe box.  Tape the free end of W1 on the upper part of lid (of the shoe-box). Before taping it, give it some turns and make it squiggly. Loop the free end of W3 around the squiggly wire. When the wires touch the bulb should glow. Ok You might want to make one more hole on the lid to stick the bulb out. When you place the lid of the box, the battery and connections go in and wont be seen.Aim of your game; move the loop  of W3 on W1, if the light comes on you lose. A million points for doing it correctly, so make it really squiggly! Note: It's harmless and fun. But do it with some supervision, at least be careful! Follow sage advice. Don't cut yourself with wires or trying to cut wires. Use appropriate batteries to get the bulb going. For goodness sake, don't connect to anything of high voltage and get yourself fragged.  Keep safe, have fun. I'm not responsible for your messing up. ",

It doesn't have to be expensive as well. It can be made from common household items like cardboard, tissue rolls etc. ",
