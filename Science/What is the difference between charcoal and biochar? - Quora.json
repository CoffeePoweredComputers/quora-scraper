            "answer_text": "The easy answer to this question- what is the difference between biochar and charcoal - is -biochar is used as a soil amendment, and charcoal is used as a fuel. A more complete answer is this - Charcoal is made by heating wood in the absence or near absence of oxygen (pyrolysis), so that it releases volatile compounds (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) as well as water vapor and soot (basically, what the wood is releasing is a volatile form of smoke). Some of this \"smoke\" is directed to a place within the process where it is combined with air, and it burns, creating more heat, to drive the process (heating more wood) forward, while some of this \"smoke\" is fed back into the cooling or cooled, blackened (carbonized) wood, and the carbonized wood absorbs and collects this \"smoke\" - making the resulting charcoal easier to light, and increasing the energy content (the re-absorbed \"smoke\" also gives charcoal a characteristic \"greasy\" feeling against the skin, and the blackness left on the skin will most likely need to be washed off with soap and water) For biochar production, the \"smoke\" is used similarly, to drive the process, but none of the \"smoke\" is directed back into the cooled char - instead, the surplus \"smoke\" can be piped somewhere else and burned to produce heat for a separate process, or it can be used to fuel an internal combustion engine, or condensed into wood vinegar. Biochar, if rubbed against the skin, should not feel \"greasy\", and should not require soap to wash it off - just water should wash most of it off. Well made biochar will be lighter in weight, and contain less BTUs per volume than charcoal. ",

            "answer_text": "  Charcoal is a fuel that is used for cooking and other heat-generating applications and created by heating biomass, typically wood, under conditions of limited oxygen. In general, charcoal burns hotter and with less smoke than the starting biomass while in the case of biochar it is made in the same manner as charcoal, but it is intended for utilization as an adsorbent and/or a soil amendment. Basically, the key is the end use of the material. It is charcoal if it is intended to be used as a fuel. Though it is becoming more well-liked for cooking in places where cooking with wood fire is a daily occurrence. The main intent of using biochar is to improve soil functions, as well as to decrease the emissions from biomass, which would naturally degrade into greenhouse gases. Biochar also improves water quality and quantity by increasing soil retention of nutrients and agrochemicals for plant and crop utilization. More nutrients stay in the soil instead of leaching into groundwater and causing pollution. I will recommend biochar over charcoal anyway. Because it has following benefits over Charcoal1. It improves the productivity of soil to achieve a higher yield.2. It helps in the creation of fossil fuels.3. Increases water retention.4. Management of waste ",
