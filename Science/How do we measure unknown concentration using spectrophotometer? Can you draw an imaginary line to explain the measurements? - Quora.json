            "answer_text": "It depends on the sample and the substance whose concentration you want to find. If the sample is a solution of a pure substance in a liquid that does not absorb visible or ultraviolet light, it could be possible if the substance does absorb visible or ultraviolet light. If you give me a solution of caffeine in water, I can find its concentration using a spectrophotometer, because caffeine absorbs ultraviolet light. a cup of coffee and ask me to find the caffeine concentration, a spectrophotometer will not help, because the coffee has other compounds that also absorb ultraviolet (and visible) light. If you give me a solution of sugar in water, a spectrophotometer will not help because sugar does not absorb ultraviolet light. For my measurement I want to compare solutions of unknown concentration with solutions of known concentrations, measuring the light absorption of both in exactly the same conditions. Ideally, we want the readings and concentrations to be somewhat similar for the solutions d unknown and known concentration. If someone already designed a method, as may happen in the analysis of an injectable medicine, the lab work is just following an established procedure. The method will be designed so that you get the right concentrations and readings, and that the instrument measurement is proportional to the solution concentration. After measuring, you would get the unknown concentration from the absorbance readings for solutions of unknown and known concentration. If the reading for the unknown solution is 1.1 times the reading for the known solution, the concentration of the unknown is 1.1 times the known concentration. Easy math. THE DETAILS: In cases where I can use the spectrophotometer, I will need a reasonably pure version of the substance whose concentration I want to measure. I call that my \u201creference standard\u201d and the company who sold me that may even have labeled as \u201creference standard\u201d, and labeled with its purity and information about its impurities and their levels. I will make a solution of known concentration by accurately weighing an amount, and dissolving in an appropriate solvent and diluting with that solvent to an accurately measured volume. If the solution I can make that way is too concentrated for my use, I will call it a \u201cstock standard solution\u201d, and I will have to make one or more accurate dilutions from it for my measurements. The dilution with the \u201cright\u201d known concentration will be my \u201cstandard solution\u201d. If someone has already designed a method for the type of sample and the substance to measure, I will know what concentration I need and how to measure. If not I will have to figure it out by trying. In either case, I would start by filling a spectrophotometer cell with the solvent I am using (maybe water). I will have the spectrophotometer adjust absorbance readings for that solvent to zero at all wavelengths of possible interest (typically 200 to 400 nanometers). We call that scanning the baseline or zeroing the baseline. The instruments I use nowadays will do it for me automatically (great progress from 40 years ago). Then, I will scan my known solution to get a graph of absorbance as a function of wavelength. We call that curve the spectrum. I will look for a good wavelength to measure absorbance (maybe 250 nanometers) where the absorbance graph has a maximum looking like the top of a rolling hill. I want the absorbance there to be a \u201cgood number\u201d too (generally 0.4 or more, but less than 1, and preferably no more than 0.8). I want the absorbance of all known and unknown solution to be in a similar range. If I am designing the method for a new substance without much information, the first solution I try may be too concentrated. If the absorbance reading around a maximum is too high, I will accurately make a dilution. For example if I see absorbances around 2.5, I may dilute about 3-fold (maybe 8.0 milliliters to 25 milliliters) to get a 0.7 or 0.8. It could take more than one try. If I do not know enough about solutions of the substance in the solvent chosen, I will make other dilutions and verify that absorbance is really proportional to concentration. I could graph absorbance readings as a function of known concentrations. If the graph is a straight line going through the origin, absorbance is proportional to the concentration and I can base my calculation on just one standard solution of known concentration. IF the graph is not a straight line or it does not go though the origin, I could still \u201cread\u201d unknown concentrations by comparing to that graph, but we do not like to do that if there is an option. Beer\u2019s Law says absorbance readings are proportional to concentration, but we like to verify. If the substance ionizes partially when I get it in solution, light absorption could be different for the ionized and non-ionized forms. Although Beer\u2019s Law should apply (separately) to each form, the percentage of each form could change depending on concentration, and the absorbance I read may not be proportional to concentration. If that happens, I may have to choose my solvent carefully. I may want to use a buffer. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to make a standard curve using known concentrations of a substance that you want to analyze. The spectrophotometer must be set at the correct wavelength for your compound. Then take your your unknown and read it\u2019s transmittance on the spec. Go to your standard curve and take that transmittance and read the concentration. It has been many years since I had my students do this experiment and there are probably more modern ways to do this now but that\u2019s what I remember. The less the transmittance the higher the concentration. Again you must set the correct wave length as just using any random wavelength will foul the results. To make your standard curve make a series of maybe 8 different concentrations of your solution to analyze then read each one in a clean spec tube recording the transmittance of each one. Now create a graph of the concentrations vs the % transmittance and you have your standard curve. It will not be a straight line and with today\u2019s computers you can find a program to give the best fit curve for you on your graph. Have fun because this is real chemistry. ",
