            "answer_text": "What does it mean to be a solid? Physics is about defining things and then looking at the logical consequences of such definitions. The ancient Greeks did away with the concept of solid when they saw that the concept of a solid brought with it the concept of infinity. A \u201csolid\u201d should be infinitely divisible. So they came up with the idea of some limit to such division of the solid, and called it an atom. You may have realised that we have actually gone beyond the atom to the subatomic, but the principle has been kept. We've got building blocks that cannot be divided. Now what are the important properties of these building blocks? They must interact with eachother by way of forces. That's why physicists look for fundamental forces of nature. Forces describe how the building blocks affect each other. When Newton wrote down his equations of motion, there were only two properties that mattered: Forces and momenta. Together those properties defined how things change/interact. Objects are associated with a momentum and they interact by way of forces. We also find that energy, like momentum, describes how a system changes. So objects can have momentum and energy. Next we introduced mass as a way to link these concepts with measurements. So objects can now be associated with momentum, energy and mass, and interact by way of forces. Notice that we're not even talking about quantum physics. We're just looking at fundamental concepts and building on them. Nowhere is there a notion of what is a solid. Once the Greeks introduced the concept of the atom, the idea of an infinitely divisible solid disappeared. Physicists have long since figured out that what's really important are forces. What you consider to be fundamental particles are not some sphere that you can cut into slices. It's a concept of an indivisible point-like object with a few fundamental properties. That's why questions about atoms being mostly empty space are flawed, because they are assuming some notion of \u201csolid\u201d, which has long since been dispensed with. I'd say the notion of a solid was finally dispensed with when Einstein revealed that Brownian motion proved the concept of atoms. But it was really the ancient Greeks that has long ago decided that the notion of a \u201csolid\u201d was untenable, and that happened long before quantum mechanics was developed. This is really something that could be and should be dealt with in highschool physics, because it's a lesson that the Greeks taught us more than two thousand years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Your assertion is incorrect as stated. Nevertheless, there is an insight behind it: if the world is \u201cfuzzy,\u201d how do we get \u201crigid\u201d objects in the real world? The \u201canswer to the question that does not answer the question\u201d is emergence - properties of the macroscopic system (such as \u201cphases of matter\u201d) exist that are not properties of the subatomic system.  The longer answer is interactions. Different parts of the system interact with each other in complicated ways (various particles pushing and pulling on each other, or wavefunctions interacting, equivalently). This means that a large system is very complicated, and so we try to describe it in terms of its \u201caveraged\u201d statistical properties. Then, we can ask the question: how do these \u201cstatistical properties\u201d behave? Well, we find that they do not obviously relate to the underlying physics; the relation is complicated, and there are all kinds of ways to derive things. In the case of solids, the emergent mostly-localized \u201catoms\u201d (a result of electron-proton interactions at low energies) have specific distances that are energetically preferred, and hence a large system of them makes a lattice (or something vaguely like it, depending on the solid). The \u201cstrength\u201d of this preference (which depends on the interactions) determines the \u201csolidity\u201d of the object.  There\u2019s then one more key to the story: renormalization group flow. The details are complicated, but in essence, this says: which terms in our interactions are most important at large distances? Perhaps we can neglect many details. In fact, we can, and in the case of interactions, the important thing is that many details average out to a \u201cresistance to deformations\u201d that can be expressed in a small number of terms, such as the bulk modulus. In essence, these are the only terms which do not approach zero as the \u201cscale\u201d goes to infinity (whereupon we work in the approximation, appropriate in the statistical case, that we are \u201cinfinitely bigger\u201d than atoms, and then consider corrections from our finite size).

We know that the solidity of what we call solid objects is due to the magnet-like attraction that electrically charged molecules have for each other, and that solid becomes liquid, gas and even plasma with enough heat energy is pumped into it, so like everything else, the state of being solid is relative to temperature and the strength of the EM bonds between molecules. But to keep going down in scale, eventually you are right, there is nothing physical anymore; there are just fields and fields are the physical expression of opposing forces, which is why fields oscillate, and the peaks of those oscillations we call quantum excitations of the field. What\u2019s so hard about that? It seems simple enough; there are no particles at that scale, so what? ",
