One of them is the JNF, the Jewish National Fund, which has been in operation for 113 years and has done incredible environmental work in the area of water recycling (85%!), forestation (you can honour someone by buying a tree in their name to be planted in Israel), land and soil preservation, and R&D into farming technology. If this is your passion, start here: Jewish National Fund. Israel\u2019s technology on water use has been breathtakingly effective, and she exports expertise to other areas of the world to help out, including California and Massachusetts: Israeli water tech reaching America\u2019s biggest states An Israeli company pioneered \u2018drip\u2019 irrigation systems that are having a profound impact in \u2018water-challenged\u2019 areas around the world: What Israeli drips did for the world Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "It is definitely one of the most technologically advanced nations in agriculture. They have over 500 Agricultural Technology startups active in their country. I would argue Israel will become the most important geography for Ag-Tech. The US is certainly by for the most significant from a financial standpoint. Israel accounted for 2% of funding for Ag-Tech startups in 2016, whereas America accounted for 58% of funding dollars. But Israel are uniquely positioned to lead an Ag-Tech revolution because of their history, identity, and physical location, and they could act as a bridge between the east and west. I go into far more detail in this blog post I have written in work: The Agricultural Technology Revolution and how Israel are uniquely positioned to lead it ",
