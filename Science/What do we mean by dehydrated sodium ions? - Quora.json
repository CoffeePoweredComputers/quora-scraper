When we put e.g. sodium chloride in water it forms hydrated ions: i.e. sodium is surrounded with water molecules which stabilizes the cation.  Sodium hydration is rather strong; when the cation moves around in solution the water molecule shell moves with it. So in water sodium is hydrated. I can only guess in which context you are asking about \u2018dehydrated\u2019 sodium. but e.g. take crown-ethers: depending on the cavity some are capable of forming a strong complex with sodium. If you would put such a crown ether in an organic solvent together with the salt. They are able to make the salt soluble in the organic solvent. You could call it \u2018dehydrated\u2019 sodium-ions This is e.g. used in making so-called \u2018purple\u2019 benzene: KMnO4 in benzene using a crown-ether: you end up with \u2018naked\u2019 permanganate, this can be used to oxidize products in an organic solvent.

            "answer_text": "The question is hard to pin down for meaning. If you are referring to an anhydrous sodium salt, such as Na2SO4, it could refer to the water-free form of the salt that forms hydrates (with a specific number of water molecules incorporated into the crystal lattice). For example Na2SO4.7H2O and Na2SO4.10H2O (Glauber\u2019s salt) are stoichiometrically fixed hydrated salts. Above a certain temperature (usually a bit above 100 C) the water disappears leaving \u201canhydrous\u201d sodium AND sulfate ions. ",
