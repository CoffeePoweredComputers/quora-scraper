            "answer_text": "According to Heiman, falsifiability can be defined as the requirement that the test of a scientific hypothesis can possibly show that the hypothesis is incorrect.\" It always helps to test whether or not a hypothesis can be incorrect prior to submitting for publishing. It is also very important to test for falsifiability because this would help to avoid any possibly lawsuit and possibly the chance of someone else proving you wrong in your own research experiment. In order to check for falsifiability, we first have to check to see whether or not an experiment is testable. If an experiment is not testable, then there would not be a way to check for falsifiability. ",
