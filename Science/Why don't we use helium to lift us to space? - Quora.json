            "answer_text": "It is not possible to get into space by just using a helium-filled balloon. In principle, you could lift a rocket on a balloon and then ignite the rocket at high altitude. In practice, the benefit is not worth the added cost and complexity. It is much easier to add a little propellant to the rocket than to launch a very large balloon. It\u2019s also a whole lot cheaper. Most of the energy needed to get into orbit around the earth is not climbing up in altitude. Most of the energy goes into accelerating to more than 7 km/s once you are in space. Let\u2019s do a very simplified analysis. Assume gravity is constant as you go up. We know it goes down, but just to be conservative, use the surface value of 9.8 m/s^2. In fact, make it even easier and more conservative. Let\u2019s use 10 m/s^2. The work done to lift a mass to an altitude of say 400 km is mgh. Well use 1 kg, but we could scale to any mass we like. So the energy of raising that 1 kg a height of 400,000 m is 1 kg x 10 m/s^2 x 400,000 m = 4,000,000 J = 4 MJ. Now let\u2019s compute the kinetic energy for 1 kg moving at a speed of 7500 m/s. That\u2019s a typical speed in low earth orbit. KE = 1/2 m V^2. For our 1 kg mass, that kinetic energy is 0.5 x 1 kg x (7500 m/s)^2 = 28,000,000 J = 28 MJ. So the kinetic energy is about 7 times the potential energy. It actually takes a lot more energy than this to put 1 kg of mass into orbit because the propellant needed weighs a lot more than 1 kg, so you need propellant to accelerate the propellant and raise it\u2019s potential energy too. But the point is that getting a few tens of km up into the atmosphere, which is about the best you could possible hope to do with a balloon, would offset the energy needed by a very small fraction. And it would require a balloon much larger than any balloon every flown for even a modest sized rocket. We just cannot make a balloon big enough and light enough to be useful. And the added launch complexity would be overwhelming. It\u2019s just not worth it. We don\u2019t even bother launching from the top of mountains because of the complexity of going up winding roads with large pieces of equipment. And that would be much more feasible than the large balloon launch. Another drawback is that we have a limited supply of helium. We\u2019ll save it for other things. ",

            "answer_text": "As J.T. indicated, helium is a terrible propellant. It is a noble gas so doesn't combine aka burn. The only thrust would be from being under pressure. And this would absorb heat. And it is expensive to buy or store. But you likely meant using a balloon to go into space orbit. This was used in an early SF story a few hundred years ago I seem to recall and some what more recently by Edgar Alan Poe in a couple of thinly veiled news articles, but the accounts and the idea are completely unworkable plot devices and fiction.
