            "answer_text": "Q: Why don\u2019t we use lightning electrical energy? It will power the world for free. It's very interesting that some of the answers say there's plenty of lightning energy to power the world, and some say it is only enough for a few seconds for a city.From purely electrical charge calculations: 1. Each lightning strike has on average (as at least one answer already accurately suggests) only 5 Billion Joules. That\u2019s seems like a lot, you say? Well, that is equivalent to only around 1,400 kWh of energy if we assume zero loss in transfer and storage (zero loss is impossible but is used to make a point). Converted to kWh units of electrical energy that we are familiar with and use daily (household electricity meter). 2. Lightning strikes over a year are around 1.4 billion, and of those, only about 25% are actually ground strikes since most (75%) are intra-cloud, cloud-cloud, and outward towards the upper/outer atmosphere and cannot be harnessed. That leaves only 350 million lightning strikes that could possibly be harnessed. Also, again assuming an impossible 100% harnessing of all lightning strikes, i.e. no loss in capture, transfer and storage, that is 490,000,000,000 kWh/Year. 3. In 2009, the world used around 20,279,640,000,000 kWh. Over 40 times the electrical energy that all the (impossible) best case hypothetically harness-able land strikes contain. So basically all the lightning we can hypothetically capture in a year will give the world enough electricity for only 9 days! And that is an unreasonably high overestimation of the all the power available through lightning on this planet because we cannot capture or harness 100%! Nowhere near enough to be feasible or even useful! That should suffice for the answer as to why we don't. But there is more! If you want to see how much it would cost to do that: To capture each and every lightning strike (land strikes only) we would most likely have to put extremely tall towers (think Eiffel tower) around a mile apart in a grid formation covering the entire globe. Yes, entire globe as many strikes occur over the oceans and seas . That is one tower for each of the almost 200,000,000 square miles of the earth's surface. The equipment to capture the electrical energy in a strike would have to handle the extreme amount of charge in only around 30 milliseconds, (approximate duration of a lightning strike). To handle that kind of instantaneous power, heavy conduction rods would need to be used and with ultra-heavy duty electrical circuits and huge arrays of storage super-capacitors that would be able to capture any of that power in that time frame! Although we do not have that technology in electrical energy storage yet, lets assume we do, and lets also assume that the energy system is 100% efficient, (understanding that most electrical systems when working optimally are less than 70-80% efficient at best and since we have no prototypes of such a system, we have no idea what the efficiency would be, quite likely in the 10\u201330% range), then we can imagine (pulling out of the air here) cost for each tower and electrical circuitry storage would be around US$ 500,000 (conservatively low, guessing mass production and efficient manufacturing procedures). That is only US$100 TRILLION for the land equipment only, i.e. with no flotation device for ocean and sea versions. Not to mention installation costs and regular maintenance as well as the wire grid connecting all the towers together, and the havoc that will cause with air traffic and numerous other industries . . . IT WILL COST MORE MONEY THAN THE WORLD HAS!!! For an unlikely maximum of only 9 days (more likely less than 2 days due to system losses) of electrical power a year?!?! Wait...I think the explanation was clear enough halfway up the page. No, it is not feasible! To more accurately answer your question:Yes, we probably could, and No, it would not go a long way in meeting our power needs. In comparison, most of our planet is exposed daily to sunlight, one hour of which has the same amount of energy that we use in a year! We have much more power available from the sun and we only need our rooftops to accumulate all we need. Especially with the advances and improvements being made with solar panel system efficiency. Now ask the question, \"Why haven't we covered all the roof tops with Solar panels?\"! ",

            "answer_text": "First let's have a brief idea about WHAT IS LIGHTNING? Almost everyone has heard about the famous experiment of Benjamin Franklin flying a kite with a key in a thunderstorm, to prove that lightning was a phenomenon of static electricity...!  He basically attached his kite to a silk string, tying an iron key at the other end. He then tied a thin metal wire from the key and inserted the wire into a Leyden jar, (a container for storing an electrical charge). Finally, as the sky darkened and a thunderstorm approached, he attached a silk ribbon to the key. Holding onto the kite by the silk ribbon, Ben flew the kite and once it was aloft, he retreated into a barn so that he would not get wet. The thunder storm cloud passed over Franklin's kite, where upon the negative charges in the cloud passed onto his kite, down the wet silk string, to the key, and into the jar.  Ben however, was unaffected by the negative charges because he was holding the dry silk ribbon, insulating him from the charges on the key. When he moved his free hand near the iron key, he received a shock.. Why? Because the negative charges in the key were so strongly attracted to the positive charges in his body, a spark jumped from the key to his hand. You can experience this same reaction when you rub your feet on a carpet and reach for a metal doorknob. SOURCE: Ben Franklin's Kite Experiment To understand simply how lightning is formed refer this link http://www.sciencemadesimple.co.uk/activity-blogs/lightning  See a typical lightning strike discharges about 1-10 billion joules of energy and produces a current of 30,000 \u2013 50,000 amps.Unfortunately, if we rely on lightning bolts to power our TVs, fans, bulbs, refrigerators etc, it will not be cost effective.Because the energy in lightning is contained in a very short period of time, only a few microseconds.  Let's see what all problems we will face while harnessing energy from electricity: To store that much amount of energy, one would have to handle a voltage of several billion volts. We need to build a huge bank of super capacitors or batteries capable of charging very quickly. Technological advancement in today's capacitors has not reached that mark yet.Attracting a lightning bolt would take much more sophisticated equipment than an iron key at the end of a silk string.Tall metallic rods extending high above the ground would do the trick, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee a lightning bolt is going to hit it.We never know if an upcoming lightning strike is going to carry a positive or negative charge, capacitors and rectifiers would also be necessary to equalize the currents of incoming strikes.Thus some sort of mechanism is required to make sure that the positive charge of one bolt didn\u2019t cancel out the negative charge of another.SOURCE: http://engineering.mit.edu/ask/there-way-harness-electricity-lightning Hence it\u2019s simply not economical to build the infrastructure required to capture a lightning bolt to power our homes, which is why no company has ever successfully commercialized lightning as a source of electricity....!!!
