            "answer_text": "Before we proceed any further, you should be aware that several elements have anomalous electron configurations \u2014 that is, their ground-state electron configuration is not what you\u2019d expect from a straightforward application of the Aufbau principle. Take the following diagram with a grain of salt, especially where transition metals are concerned:  Generally speaking, if you want to write out the ground-state electron configuration of an element, you work your way up to the element\u2019s atomic number, adding and filling sublevels as you encounter them. Suppose you want to write out the electron configuration of rubidium (Rb). Starting with 1s, it looks like this: [math]1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^{10} 4p^6 5s^1[/math] Some people prefer to group the sublevels by principle energy level, but remember, that\u2019s not the order in which sublevels fill in electrons as you move across the periodic table: [math]1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 3d^{10} 4s^2 4p^6 5s^1[/math] And of course you can always substitute the first 36 electrons with the symbol for the noble gas krypton. [math]\\text{[Kr]}5s^1[/math] You know\u2026if you\u2019re in a hurry or whatever. What if you have to write out an electron configuration and you don\u2019t have this handy (mostly accurate) table in front of you? Well, no worries. Here\u2019s how it works. As you move across the s-block (the first two columns of the periodic table and, loosely speaking, helium), you\u2019re adding electrons to the s-type sublevel that corresponds to the row you\u2019re on. So for example, hydrogen and helium are filling in their 1s sublevels, since they\u2019re both on the first row. Lithium and beryllium are filling in their 2s sublevels. The p-block (right-most six columns of the periodic table, excluding He) are similarly filling in the p-type sublevel that corresponds to the row of the element. The elements carbon through neon are filling in their 2p sublevel. (Notice that there are no p-block elements on the first row, which is related to the fact that the first energy level has no p-type sublevel.) The d-block (popularly known as the transition metals) are filling in the d-type sublevel that is one level below the number of the row on which the element is found. The elements scandium through zinc are on the fourth row, but they are filling in their 3d sublevels. The elements yttrium through cadmium are on the fifth row, but they are filling in their 4d sublevels. The f-block (or inner transition metals) are filling in the f-type sublevel that is two levels below the number of the row on which the element is found. Remember that the f-block tucks inside the d-block, specifically on rows 6 and 7, so these elements are filling in their 4f and 5f sublevels, respectively. As I said before, there are plenty of anomalous ground-state electron configurations that defy the simple predictions made by this table. The lightest element with an anomalous electron configuration is chromium. You would expect chromium\u2019s electron configuration to be: [math]\\text{[Ar]}4s^2 3d^4[/math] or [math]\\text{[Ar]} 3d^4 4s^2[/math], but really, it\u2019s [math]\\text{[Ar]}4s^1 3d^5[/math] or [math]\\text{[Ar]}3d^5 4s^1[/math], as you prefer. So it\u2019s not a perfect system, but it can give you a rough idea of how electrons are distributed in a ground-state atom, provided you know where on the periodic table the element is located. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, somewhat incorrectly. It does not help that the Bohr/Schrodinger Models are fundamentally flawed. Electrons do not resove around the nucleus but are an Extension of it. This may sound ludicrous but actually the current model explains almost nothing by comparison with the Dumbbell Model, but there are the necessary parallels. ",
