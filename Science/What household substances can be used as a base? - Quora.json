            "answer_text": "In addition to John Burgess' (excellent) answer, bleach is also a base. Household bleach has a pH of around 12, compared to 13-14 for lye. That's the most common strong base. Ammonia is also a base, with a pH of around 11. Lime (used in gardens) is around 12. Egg whites are basic, barely; it matters slightly in cooking. So are milk of magnesia (used as an antacid). ",
