            "answer_text": "If you mean the work at standard temperature and pressure, then the work component of the standard enthalpy of reaction is the change in the system pressure times its volume.  Liquid water is about 40 mL while the reactants are 3x22.4L or 67,200 mL. Enthalpy  My estimate is -67 L*atm of work or the system receives 67 L*atm (6.8 kJ) of energy from its collapse under atmospheric pressure as it is cooled to standard temperature. ",
