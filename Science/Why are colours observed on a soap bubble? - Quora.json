            "answer_text": "When light falls on a soap bubble, part of the light gets reflected. Some light enters the bubble and gets reflected from the other side of the bubble surface. Some of the light rays gets refracted. When we look at a bubble, we are seeing all these light rays. Since the bubble film is very thin, the the reflected rays gets a little out of sync with each other. Since the light travels in the form of a wave, this going out of sync causes some of the waves to cancel out or reinforce each other. White light is made up of seven colours with each colour corresponding to a particular wave length. When the light waves cancel out or reinforce, some of the wavelengths gets a boost and some disappears. This gives rise to the colour of the bubble of the colour of an oil film on water. Since the bubble or the film is not uniformly thick, each region of the film produces a different colour. The phenomenon is called interference in physics. ",

            "answer_text": "The colours are caused by interference (Interference (wave propagation) - Wikipedia) The bubble is formed by a thin film of water and soap and it has an outer and an inner surface. An amount of light is reflected by each surfaces and the waves of both reflections interact with each other, sometime adding up and sometime cancelling each other. Since the interference pattern is caused by the relation between the wavelength of the light and the length of path it takes through the film and that light of different colours will have different wavelength the interference will amplify the light of different colours at different angles of light source, bubble and observer. It is the same phenomenon observed in films of oil on water. ",
