            "answer_text": "Sometimes, the Avengers is science fiction, and sometimes it is not. Many Avengers stories are science fiction or close: The Kree-Skrull War (from 1970) - invaders from the Skrull world infiltrate Earth as part of this storyline, and there are awesome battles in space . Awesome art in this storyline from Neal Adams and Johnl Buscema)Operation: Galactic Storm (1992) - the East and West Coast Avengers vs. the Shi\u2019Ar Imperial Guard and the Kree. One of the first times any of these characters had ever met or battled the Kree/Shi\u2019Ar and opened the door for future intergalactic crossovers for the AvengersSecret Invasion (2008) - Skrull Invasion via infiltrators from the Skrull homeworld. The Avengers were central to this storyline, and there is a twist at the end that upsets their status quo that I\u2019m going to leave you to read the story to find out.The Korvac Saga (1978) - great storyline involving the entire Avengers team and the Guardians of the Galaxy vs. Korvac (superpowerful cosmic being)Any of the battles with Thanos and/or his daughter Nebula (e.g. Avengers Annual #10, Marvel Two in One Annual #2, the Infinity Gauntlet storyline)Some Avengers stories are based more on mythology and mysticism: Avengers #100 (original series) deals with a battle between all existing members of the Avengers and the god Ares, the Enchantress and all other kinds of mystical/mythological beingsHercules (who is based on the Greek god Hercules) has been an ally of the Avengers and a stalwart member from the 1960s onward (off and on)Avengers #1 (1998) dealt with a gathering of all of the Avengers (everybody alive who was available and who had ever been on the team) to battle the mystic threat of Morgan Le Fay. All the Avengers (thank you George Perez for drawing all of the Avengers multiple times in this storyline, including all of the Avengers in medieval costumes!) Even the one-off or less recognized members were in this story.The story where the Avengers brought back the hero Black Knight into modern-day world is very much grounded in British folktales and history. It\u2019s interesting to see how outmatched the Avengers are against the Fomorian Giants (who are from Irish mythological traditions)\u2026 and how much they need Black Knight\u2019s timely aid (see Avengers #225)There are many Avengers stories that are grounded in politics/Earthbound occurrences in the Marvel Universe - any of the stories where they are dealing with: interference from Henry Gyrich/the US Government (1980s primarily). His introduction in the late 1970\u2019s-early 1980s was a hoot, and brought attention to how sloppily the Avengers handled their mansion security, and about what happens when the Avengers have their membership mandated by an outside organization. He was a thorn in the Avengers\u2019 side for years, and they couldn\u2019t harm him, because he was not a villain (although he often undertook villainous methods against the team)when their villains like the Lethal Legion or the Masters of Evil attack (in some of John Byrne\u2019s and John Buscema\u2019s best artwork on the series) . These are largely earthbound gangs of villains/masterminds that get together and go on a rampage or enact a plan to destroy the Avengers - usually not based on scient fictionwhen they are running one of their membership drives (or forced to reduce their membership \u2026these stories are largely not science fiction. There are a fair amount of fill-in Avengers stories that just show the heroes training or arguing (which they used to do a whole lot when Hawkeye first joined the team back in the early 1960s).The varied heroes/villains of the Avengers and their forays into science fiction and other genres are one of the things that has helped this title last for over 50 years!

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d put a hard \u201cno\u201d on this. The super hero genre isn\u2019t fiction about science, it\u2019s fiction about heroism. On the Moes scale of science fiction hardness, it rates a 1, sometimes a 0. 1 is like Starwars, where the plot line takes place in a high tech setting, but isn\u2019t about any of the science, or even the implications of the science. Anything Dr. Strange does is a 0 because it doesn\u2019t even pretend to be technology. Asgardian tech is probably a 0.5 on that scale because they SAY it\u2019s tech, but they still don\u2019t tech the tech. Put another way, the suspension of disbelief threshold for the super hero genre is way too high for it to be considered science. They don\u2019t even bother with sensible technobabble. ",
