            "answer_text": "(This answer was originally written in 2017, it was updated in April 2019, following the release of the EHT image of the black hole at the centre of M87)  Of course, by their very nature, you cannot have a photo of a black hole. Light cannot escape them, and thus they do not form an image. However - you can take a picture of the stuff surrounding a black hole:  That's a photo from Hubble, showing what is believed to be a cloud of dust and rock (an \u201caccretion disk\u201d) falling into a black hole at the centre of NGC 4261. As this material falls into the black hole, it heats up - and glows. We can then see this hot, glowing material, and thus infer the existence of a black hole. Ironically, given they emit no light themselves, black holes form some of the brightest objects in the sky (particularly in the radio spectrum), because of the way they interact with their surroundings. There is lots and lots of evidence for the existence of black holes \u2014 it would take a veritable miracle for it all to be proved erroneous.  EDIT: 10th April 2019 This answer is now very much out of date! Just under one hour ago, at the time of writing, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team released an incredible image \u2014 the first ever direct observation of the event horizon of a black hole:  The image on the left is the EHT image, a false-colour image composited from VLBI radio observations. The center image shows a computer simulation of what it actually looks like, based on previous measurements of the properties of the SMBH. The right hand image is a blurred version of the central image, showing what we would expect to measure. As you can see, there is very close agreement between the model, and the observational data. Incredible! ",

            "answer_text": "Any time you use a singularity to describe a physical phenomenon, it usually turns out to be wrong. Just think about the equations governing water swirling around in a basin. If you use one type of equation, you get a singularity in your basin and if you use another type of equation, you don\u2019t Are Singularities Real?. That the whole universe is full of singularities floating around in space requires a suspension of disbelief with which I am not really comfortable. I am not alone in this, apparently. Researcher shows that black holes do not exist and NASA Says Indian Scientist's Theory Is Correct, Black Holes Don't Really Exist I know the links aren\u2019t perfect, but you get the picture. Some of the other answers to this question here on Quora show a picture of a galaxy with a dark spot in it and then follow that up with a simulation showing the same picture. There is something important to know about simulations. If you have a picture of something, it is easy to make a simulation that copies the picture. What is hard is to make a simulation of something you have never seen before, predict how and where you will see it, and then record an observation of it. That is really the only way to do science. Any other route can lead to self-trickery. From Paul Tiede\u2019s answer:  Saturation effects must be rather difficult to deal with in such images, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from ending up on the front page of newspapers across the world. How are black holes imaged? Here is a study which claims to support the existence of black holes, but really just tracked some stars near the center of our galaxy. They write \"The stars in the innermost region are in random orbits, like a swarm of bees,\" says Gillessen. \"However, further out, six of the 28 stars orbit the black hole in a disc. In this respect the new study has also confirmed explicitly earlier work in which the disc had been found, but only in a statistical sense. Ordered motion outside the central light-month, randomly oriented orbits inside \u2013 that's how the dynamics of the young stars in the Galactic Centre are best described.\" Unprecedented 16-Year Long Study Tracks Stars Orbiting Milky Way Black Hole I believe their measurements, but I don\u2019t always believe the interpretation which scientists give to their results. A lot of money goes into making these sorts of simulations and studying black holes, so one should expect resistance to any change in belief. Why is science loaded with hypotheses which are assumed to be facts? Although the author of this video does not come out and question the existence of black holes, I like how he describes the way in which astronomers pick unlikely scenarios out of thin air and use them to explain the qualities of blurry blobs of light. I find it amazing how \u2018artist\u2019s renditions\u2019 and just-so stories pass as science in this day and age.  -Kirsten Hacker ",
