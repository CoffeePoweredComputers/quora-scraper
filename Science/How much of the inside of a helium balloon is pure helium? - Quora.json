            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A - even if it is a bit odd! Assuming ou mean a normal rubber party balloon, I\u2019d say you were looking at around 99.9% helium. A foil balloon (increasingly common now as they last a lot longer) possibly as low as 99% The helium used in balloon gas cylinders is very high purity. For safety and for the reason that people inhale it in order to give themselves a high pitched voice, it has to be pure enough for humans. The grade used is N 4.6 which is four \u201c9\u2019s\u201d and a 6: 99.996% pure. An inflated standard balloon - is around 5 or 6 litres. If there was a few mL of air (at most around 5mL I\u2019d say) inside at the time of inflation, this would result in a helium purity of at least 99.896%  For a mylar/foil balloon, these are less elastic, so there\u2019s the potential for a larger volume of air to be present, for a given size of balloon.  So this could bring your purity down to 99% or even below, depending on the size of the balloon (50mL of air before inflation to 5L = 98.996%). But no matter how you slice it, pretty pure! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cpure\u201d is a very exacting standard. It allows for nothing else. Helium sold is undoubtably purefied but not absolutely pure. And I\u2019m sure it is sold in grades, of which more pure grades are more expensive than lower grades. For Helium balloons - and most non-technical/non scientific work, the lowest purity grades would be purchased. I\u2019m not a chemist/ chemical supplies specialist but I\u2019m sure its going to be somewhere around 95\u201399 % pure which allows for some molecules of air or other gasses to be present. And when you stick the nozzle in the balloon you are going to let some air in because the valve is not right at the nozzle. But It certainly won\u2019t be as impurer as 50% air and 50% helium. ",
