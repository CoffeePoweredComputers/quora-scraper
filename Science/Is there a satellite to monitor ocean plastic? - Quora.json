            "answer_text": "There is no specific satellite to do such a thing. Satellites are very expensive and they don't tend to be extremely high resolution. Measuring plastic could be a research project for someone at a university somewhere but I don't know if anyone has proposed it as a thesis. There are multi-spectrual research satellites which I imagine could be tested to see if they can see large concentrations of debris. Perhaps UV absorption/reflection of the oceans changes due to surface plastics and someone could measure that? Perhaps larger rafts of plastics could be visually observed and tracked? ",
