            "answer_text": "Well, the concept of a particle needs to be understood before your question can be answered. Per Wikipedia, a particle is a minute fragment or quantity of matter. In the physical sciences, the word is used to describe a small localized object to which can be ascribed several physical or chemical properties such as volume or mass\u2026 The word is rather general in meaning, and is refined as needed by various scientific fields.  Matter demonstrates its existence as a source of force by its action on other matter. The easiest matter to imagine is spherical particles. The easiest forces to imagine are those of attraction and repulsion. The force vectors lie on a line connecting the material points. The force between any two given particles depends only on the distance between them. Success of mechanics has contributed to the belief that it is possible to describe all natural phenomena in terms of simple forces between unalterable particles.  A magnet behaves like an electric dipole (two oppositely charged spheres separated by an insulator). But the magnet consists of very small elementary magnetic dipoles which cannot be broken into separate poles. Order reigns in the magnet as a whole, for all the elementary dipoles are directed in the same way. The dependence of magnetic attraction or repulsion on distance is the same as in Newton's law of gravitation and Coulomb's law of electrostatics. We see again in this theory the application of a general point of view: the tendency to describe all phenomena by means of attractive and repulsive forces depending only on distance and acting between unchangeable particles. The concepts that are generally assigned to a particle are that they are discrete, small and localized (quanta). It can be used to make simplifying assumptions concerning the processes involved. Planck used Bose-Einstein statistical equation to empirically come up with the curve that matched the experimental results. Then he had to think up a reason why that worked. Since the statistical equation applied to distribution of particles, Planck assumed energy to behave like particles. That is how the idea of energy quanta was born. It is possible that an energy quantum is formed only at the point of absorption and emission. It may not exist otherwise. It  is formed because the interaction requires integral numbers of wavelengths as in resonances.  Tying energy with frequency makes it discrete like a particle. I am sure you can make a guess at the answer to your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no, it is a bit complicated and depends on what you mean by \"particles\". By definition: a particle is an excitation of a quantum field. But a field can have some inherent energy that is not bound in real particles. This is what we call a ground state of a field. The Higgs field for example, gives some particles their mass even though they do not interact with the Higgs bosons directly but by interaction with the ground state of the Higgs field which has some non-zero energy. But every field even in its ground state is not completely still and there are fluctuations in it resulting in constant production and annihilation of virtual particles. This means that all energy does not have to be manifested as real particles but always is manifested at least as virtual particles. ",

            "answer_text": "From a strictly quantum-field viewpoint, there is no vacuum without (some content of) particles. The root problem is a precise definition of existence. Objects that have some degree of existence in QFT do not exist in usual sense. If we have, say, an electrostatic field (let put its source out of considerations), then it has energy density and is thought to be composed of virtual photons and electrons (alongside other flavours of charged particles). But actually, in spite of existence of the field, there are no things we could describe as particles. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u2018energy\u2019 without particles, per MC Physics. The only energy in that theory is kinetic energy (KE=1/2*M*V^2) and the potential to cause KE. That requires mass, ie particles. The only force to cause KE is electro-static that is from and only between those mass particles. It is the electrostatic charge strength that gives those particles inertial mass. More on this at www.mcphysics.org. ",
