There is a series of short books, \u201c A very short introduction to\u2026\u2026.\u201d Fields Medalist Gowers has written a short book in this series : \u201cA very short introduction to mathematics.\u201d It's a lucid introduction. Terence Tao is exceptional in his ability to explain complex topics in mathematics in understandable way, and he has done this job excellently in the book Princeton Companion to Mathematics. He is the chief contributor to many terms in mathematics and he has explained some advanced concepts lucidly. Ian Stewart is another mathematician who writes incredibly well. His book \u201c Concepts of Modern Mathematics\u201d is a must addition to mathematics books.  \ud83d\udc46This book treats topics from congruences in number theory upto concepts like Hecke operators on space of modular forms. The authors have written with exceptional clarity and simplicity. Their other books Elliptic Tales and Fearless Symmetry introduce elliptic curves, modular forms, L- functions, Galois representation and Birch-Swinnerton Dyer conjecture. These books are the popular books on these concepts and yet they have actually managed to construct Galois representations in some simple cases! Galois representations are the building blocks in the proof of FLT by Wiles. A feast for number theorists. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude03 ",
