            "answer_text": "U can check diamond's colour by colour shade paper. Example.  U can check diamond's purity by Eye glass, loupe or microscope(microscope is used to see a very small kind of inclusion in the diamonds). If you aren't a professional then i suggest u to go for a loupe or a eye glass. Example.  Upper shown image is of one of the best loupes in india.using this loupe u can easily see small inclusions of the diamond,but if u want to see inclusions of better than vvs2 or vvs1 purity than i suggest u to go for a microscope. There a re many factors of purity -If the inclusion is placed in between of the table The purity number will go weak  This is Emerald shape diamond u can see that there's natts(black carbon spot)in the diamond.the purity will go weak in this kind of inclusion.if this inclusion placed near to the girdel purity number will be better than table inclusion.

            "answer_text": "I think when you say \u201cpurity\u201d you really mean clarity, or the amount of any internal flaws in a diamond. Purity would refer to the atomic composition and how much nitrogen or other impurities (boron, etc) are present, but that requires substantial equipment and is not something GIA or other gem labs evaluate for gem diamonds during grading. Assuming clarity, internal inclusions (flaws) are evaluated by how easy they are to find using 10x magnification. If you have a similar magnification available you can review your diamond but there\u2019s a lot of technique involved and usually requires taking a course with practice diamonds to fully do. I would recommend finding a local GIA accredited gemologist and have them grade the clarity for you. Otherwise if you want to learn more directly, the GIA website has a great explainer page here: GIA 4Cs Clarity Hope that helps. ",
