            "answer_text": "This is phenomena observed in tensile behaviour of a material. Visualise this set up of tensile measurement.  Exert positive tensile load on it. It will show the normal effects. It will initially show elastic behaviour [i.e. return to original shape if load is removed], and plastic behaviour, if further load is applied[ i.e. retains any new shape given to it, when load is removed]. Now, remove the load during plastic behaviour. If you resume tensile loading as before, it will requires greater force to continue stretching it. However, if the load is reversed i.e. compressive force is applied, it deforms easily, needing less force than if the sample was compressively loaded from the start. Essentialy, as the sample takes more tensile load, it becomes more resistant to further tensile load but, becomes weak to compressive loading. This is what is macroscopically observed in Bauschinger effect. The microscopic events and causes, needs some background in crystal structure and material deformation to understand.  This phenomena is explained by Dislocation theory. However, understanding this is not easy. ",

            "answer_text": "The phenomenon in materials in which plastic deformation in one direction affects the response in the other direction (that is, yield strength in one direction increases at the cost of the reduction in yield strength in the opposite direction).  Now, in the figure above, the material is at first subjected to a tensile loading, followed by load reversal and then a compressive loading and reversal and so on. So, the tensile cycle happens first and then the compressive cycle (As indicated by the arrow marks). Let x be the yield limit in the compressive regime. Note let us assume that the magnitude of x in the compressive regime is the same as the magnitude of a in the tensile regime originally, where a is the yield limit in the tensile regime. Plastic flow should begin beyond x had compression been the first cycle in the process experienced by the material. But let us assume a case wherein we first have a tensile cycle and then the compressive cycle. So, you apply a tensile loading wherein the applied loading passes the yield point \u2018a\u2019. So there is plastic flow. The tensile load is unloaded. Since the material went into the plastic regime, there will be some leftover plastic deformation and hence it will not exactly return to point \u2018o\u2019 on unloading. It will rather take up a point \u2018c\u2019 on unloading. If the stress is removed from the specimen during a test, the stress strain curve during unloading has a slope equal to that of the elastic part of the stress strain curve. Now we apply the compressive loading. The new yield point in compression would be \u2018d\u2019 and post \u2018d\u2019, the plastic flow would begin in compression. Please note that had compression been the first cycle, the yield point would have been \u2018x\u2019 but now it has shifted to \u2018d\u2019. This shift is due to the precedence of the compressive cycle with a tensile cycle. Next time you carry on the tensile cycle again, you will see that the tensile yield limit would have increased from a to b. So, the tensile yield is increasing at the cost of a reduction in the compressive yield limit. This is the bauschinger effect. ",
