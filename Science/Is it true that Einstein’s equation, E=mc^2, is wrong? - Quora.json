            "answer_text": "The only wrong thing is the belief that Einstein invented E=mc^2. The equation, in different form, existed for about a year before Einstein published his first paper. The equation is derived from and contained in Henri Poincar\u00e9\u2019s thought experiment equation, M=S/c^2. for the momentum of radiation. It\u2019s a 1 kg light emitting apparatus(LEA) that shoots, like a cannon, 3 million joules of radiation in one direction with a LEA recoil of 1cm/sec. \u201cM\u201d is momentum(radiation). \u201cS\u201d is radiation flux. Where things get confusing are 1: Most people believe Einstein invented it, and 2: is some sort of fantastic mystical equation about time dilation and worm hole Star Trek science. It is nothing of these sorts. The major difference between a cannon that shoots a material mass projectile and Poincar\u00e9\u2019s 1kg LEA is light has no discernible mass. It is regarded as massless. Big problem for Poincar\u00e9. To solve the problem he invented E/c^2 to represent \u2018apparent\u2019 mass of light. With radiation mass(apparent)=E/c^2, the momentum of a 1kg LEA shooting 3 million joules of radiation = E/c^2 *c. Envision a light emitting cannon (apparatus) that fires 3 million joules of radiation in one direction. The light energy, departing at c, induces a 1cm/sec recoil on the 1kg material mass apparatus in the opposite direction. If the laws of nature are true, 3 million joules of energy shot out in one direction must impress 3 million joules in the opposite direction. For every \u2018moment\u2019, there is an equal and opposite \u2018moment\u2019. Poincar\u00e9 invented M=S/c^2 to establish that light radiation obeys the conservation of momentum. In so doing, invented the mass-energy relation, frequently misconstrued as mass-energy equivalence. M and E are not equals. Max Planck and Friedrich Hasenohrl pulled E=mc^2 out of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s radiation momentum, verifying Poincar\u00e9\u2019s mass-energy relation. All E=mc^2 means is that mass measurably increases at a rate of E/c^2 on absorption and decreases by the same on emission. But since light radiation energy is continuously absorbing into and emitting from mass, is impossible to pin down a definite mass number. It\u2019s just an equation. A very misunderstood one, but one all the same. ",

            "answer_text": "I see two possible critical comments about the equation if you want to very strict as to the intent, or how it may be used incorrectly, but the question may open Pandoras\u2019s box and raise questions about the most fundamental ideas about the Universe. The first comment is that the equation defines energy as a function of mass a nd the speed of light. This is the reverse of the process that mass is a property of matter, in that it reacts to force by absorbing energy from a source by accelerating in space. The equation states that the mass is defined as the ratio of energy to the square of speed, and specifically the speed of light. The equation could be changed to M= e/c^2 . The second comment is that the equation refers to changes in mass and energy as in the fission of heavy nuclei and the reduction of the mass. It is not necessarily true of the actual values. Changing it to dm = de/d(c^2) would accomplish this. These comments do not necessarily make the equation incorrect, but they may make it more meaningful. Usually there is no problem, but it introduces a more fundamental issue and that is the definition of energy itself. Energy is thought of, at least by non-scientists, as relative to the mass of the Earth and, because of the Earth\u2019s large mass, compared with the mass of the body being studied, the Earth has no significant potential energy and no movement or kinetic energy. But energy is not the property of a body but of the relationship between two bodies, as it evident in the equation for potential based on Newton\u2019s constant g. The equation has the masses of two bodies and the constant g has one mass and the square of the period. Energy is thought of, at least by non-scientists, as relative to the mass of the Earth and, because of the Earth\u2019s large mass, compared with the body being studied, the Earth has no significant potential energy and no movement or kinetic energy. But energy is not the property of a body but of the relationship between two bodies, as it evident in the equation for potential based on Newton\u2019s constant g. The Universal gravity constant is defined as the cube of length divided by the mass (of the \u2018central body) further divided by the square of the time period of the system. This constant, calculated using the values of all of the planets in our solar system, gives a value that is consistent to four significant digits, making g a good engineering constant but not necessarily a natural constant. The root of the problem is the strong association between mass and energy, with each being a function of the other. Both appear in the list of natural constants, energy in Planck\u2019s constant and mass in Newton\u2019s. Both cannot be natural variables. My preference would be to redefine and to keep energy, and to replace mass (as a natural variable) with a dimensionless variable to represent the number of units of matter in a body. Mass would then be a function of energy, length, and time per unit of matter. A conversion constant would be needed for each planet to convert weight to the dimensionless unit of matter and use it to calculate the amount of matter in a body. So, the question of the correctness of Einstein\u2019s equation may be a something to discuss. ",
