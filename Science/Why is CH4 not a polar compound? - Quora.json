            "answer_text": "Whether or not a compound is polar or non polar determines on how large the difference in electronegativity is between two bonded atoms. Electronegativity is a measure of how much a bonded atom has an attraction to the bonded pair of atoms or in other words, how much it pulls the bonded pair or atoms towards itself. Elements which have higher electronegativity are said to be slightly negative and elements which have lower electronegativity are said to be slightly positive. When two identical atoms are bonded together, such as a H2 molecule, the atoms are identical and so it the electronegativity, so the molecule is non polar. On the other hand, HCl is a polar molecule, since the difference in electronegativity is around 0.95. This means that there are permanent dipole-dipole interactions. With CH4, the Hydrogen has a lower electronegativity than carbon. The difference is around 0.35, however this difference in electronegativity isn\u2019t significant enough for Carbon to have a much larger attraction to the bonded pair of electrons than Hydrogen, hence why the molecule is non polar. Although it\u2019s hard to tell at what point a covalent bond becomes a polar covalent bond, the difference in electronegativity must be atleast above 0.4 TL;DR: CH4 is non polar due to the fact that the difference in electronegativity isn\u2019t large enough to make it a polar molecule ",

            "answer_text": "Molecular polarity is a result of the vector sum of the individual bond dipoles. [math]CH_{4}[/math] consists of non-polar bonds, however, [math]CCl_{4}[/math] consists of POLAR [math]C-Cl[/math] bonds. Nevertheless, BOTH molecules are NON-POLAR molecules, given that top-to-tail vector addition of the bond dipoles gives a ZERO resultant. And the same situation pertains to the NON-POLAR [math]CO_{2}[/math] molecule. On the other hand, chloroform, [math]CHCl_{3}[/math], and methylene chloride, [math]CH_{2}Cl_{2}[/math], are BOTH polar solvents\u2026the individual bond dipoles do not cancel out upon addition\u2026 ",
