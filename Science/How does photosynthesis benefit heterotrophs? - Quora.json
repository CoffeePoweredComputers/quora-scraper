            "answer_text": "Heterotrophs cannot create the energy needed to fuel the biochemical reactions that occur in their (our, since we, humans, are hetetotrophs, too) that keep their bodies alive. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another (Law of Conservation of Energy). Phototrophic autotrophs (green plants and photosynthetic algae, for example) absorb the energy of sunlight, and through the process of photosynthesis, convert it into the energy of chemical bonds found in sugar. They also use water and carbon dioxide in this process. The chemical formula for this is: Water + carbon dioxide + energy(that's what the sunlight provides) yields sugar (usually glucose) + oxygen. Heterotrophs eat the plants, and through the processes of hydrolysis and then either anaerobic or aerobic respiration, break the bonds if the glucose molecules and use the energy provided to keep their bodies alive. Some Heterotrophs eat the plant eaters, and the cycle continues. The process is a little more complex than I explained here, but that's a quick explanation. Without photosynthesis, many of the organisms that exist now and in the past could/would not have existed. It fascinates me how plants and animals are actually dependent on each other. Through photosynthesis, plants make the fuel that most other organisms use to stay alive AND produce the oxygen animals need to breath in order to stay alive. Every time an animal exhales, they actually produce the carbon dioxide needed by the plants to produce the sugars used by the animals. I admit that I feel like I've just done some high schooler's biology homework. I taught high school biology for many years, and this question sounds like one of the homework, and test, questions I'd ask my students. ",

            "answer_text": "Photosynthetic organisms are known as the \"PRIMARY PRODUCERS\" of the food chain. They are the foundation on which all other organisms depend. In general, the food chain moves from plants and other autotrophs to herbivores, and then to omnivores and carnivores, which eat the herbivores. Heterotrophs and Photosynthesis In contrast to autotrophs, heterotrophs survive through respiration, using oxygen and an energy source (carbohydrates, fats or protein) to produce ATP, which powers cells. They depend on other organisms for food and oxygen. Photosynthesis benefits heterotrophs in several different ways. First, photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide (a waste product of respiration) and produces oxygen (necessary for respiration). Heterotrophs therefore depend on photosynthesis as a source of oxygen. In addition, photosynthesis sustains the organisms that heterotrophs consume in order to stay alive. Even if a heterotroph is strictly carnivorous and does not eat plants, it must eat animals that eat plants to survive. Maintaining Balance The complex interactions between different types of organisms in a given environment make up an ecosystem, where all the species are dependent on each other. Although the energy flows in a given ecosystem may change over time or differ greatly in comparison to others, a stable ecosystem exists in a careful balance. Loss of a single species, pollution, or destruction of habitat all can throw off this balance and make the ecosystem less functional and more prone to collapse. ",
