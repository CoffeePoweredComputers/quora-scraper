            "answer_text": "Some can be treated without medication, some cannot be successfully enough treated without it. Schizophrenia, for example, I\u2019ve seen dozens of quack cures come - and go. None of them work. Megadoses of vitamins, enzymes, minerals, psychotherapy (sorry, Burt), scream therapy, adversive therapy, gestalt, double bind theory, mental hygiene, patterning, big doses of pine tree oil, bleach, spirulina, cannabis, nuthin\u2019. I\u2019ve watched the quack cure for autism and schizophrenia game for 50 years now. It\u2019s big money. Cures people tried before that didn\u2019t work, even come back for another go-round every 20 years, where money is concerned hope springs eternal, I guess. Many of these things are due for another go round this year, lol. No one has tried anything new and none of it actually works. It\u2019s all garbage. The only thing that treats the illness is medication. As a teen, I was 100% against medication (except cannabis, LOL). When I realized how wrong I was, I changed my tune. Most people are too stubborn to do that. Once the person has medication in board, he can benefit from all sorts of things. Medication may bring his relapse rate down 90%. Want to bring it down to 99%? Add supportive housing, physical training, nutrition, family education, remedial cognitive therapy (I\u2019m gonna bet on it being a winner). Try it the other way - all that stuff, but without medicine, it just doesn\u2019t work. Most studies measure success of a treatment by relapses(having to go back to the hospital). If it helps a guy with severe mental illness stay out of the hospital longer or reduces hospital stays, it\u2019s recommendable. Many, many years ago, back east where I lived, a guy, let\u2019s call him \u2018Dave\u2019, down the road from me, had a \u2018pet.\u2019 Dave\u2019s \u2018pet\u2019 was a severely mentally ill paranoid schizophrenic man, an older man named Joe. Dave didn\u2019t believe in medication for his \u2018pet.\u2019 Dave could talk Joe into whatever he wanted - like I said, Joe was pretty ill. Joe was usually closed up in a room in the back of the house. People stopping by to buy tomatoes scared him to death. Once in a while Dave would take his \u2018pet\u2019 with him when Dave went to the gas station or the store. Joe was extremely paranoid. He\u2019d cower in the seat of Dave\u2019s truck, cringing every time a car got near, muttering to himself. Once a school bus crossed the road ahead of them. \u201cKill, them,\u201d Joe muttered, \u201ckill them all.\u201d Dave loved stuff like this. He thought it was hilarious. Dave LOVED to tell every visitor to his farm about his \u2018pet\u2019 and how agitated \u2018it\u2019 would get. He started bragging to me about his \u2018pet\u2019 when I just stopped by to buy some tomatoes. Every once in a while, Dave would let Joe drive the car. Joe would shake in terror, gripping the steering wheel, muttering about how he was going to run into them, blow them up. Dave loved it. No medication for Joe, Dave said, hell no, if he took medication, Joe would tell Dave to go eff himself, get his own apartment, and be totally independent. No more hilarity for Dave, being amused at Joe\u2019s agony. No more having a human \u2018pet.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what happened to Joe. Someone told me eventually Dave got tired of his \u2018pet\u2019 and dumped him off somewhere in the city. By then Joe would have been in pretty bad shape. I know a lot of people like Dave. They like using the mentally ill for their own amusement. Get well? Good lord no. That would end all the fun. My hope is that Joe got treatment, and told Dave to go eff himself, and started living his own life. That\u2019s what I pray for, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Medication does have a part to assist mental illness; if not from the chemical company, from a herbalist or naturopath, perhaps out of a garden. Be extremely careful to accurately identify plants. Then there are demonstrable vitamin or mineral deficiencies that impact mental wellbeing . A cup of ginger and lemon, chamomile, or mints can be enjoyed in place of caffeine for example. Try sweetening if desired with a little honey. Maintaining healthy habits, or changing lifestyle might prove helpful. Continue or commence a healthy lifestyle, including all aspects. Physical, mental, emotional, social, spiritual, vocational, financial. Lots of suggestions on reputable Web sites. Likely you'll discover mixing 2 or more intervention techniques are of more benefit than pursuing a single modality. A talking therapy plus something active plus creative for instance to engage as many parts of the brain as possible. Find someone you trust to share. Seek an advocate. Someone who knows you well. They can record information, support and even defend your decisions. Advocate needs to be available to accompany you to appointments. Talk with health professionals to see what suits you best. There are many different types of therapy. You'll need to address issues underlying symptoms. Go slowly as too much too fast can be counter productive. Explore creative therapies such as music, art, drama. Find reasons to greet each day. As much natural light as possible, including early morning daylight. There are many self paced books available. Dr Neil Nedley's \"Depression - the way out\" is an excellent resource. However, i don't know current price. Counsellors such as social workers, psychologists, are unable to prescribe medication. Read their biography, areas of speciality, to determine best fit. Having said that, having good rapport is necessary. You need to feel comfortable in their presence. While you need to have confidence in therapist , it is not necessary to follow advice if it seems out of your comfort zone, inappropriate for now, or plain feels wrong. Adapting ideas to suit is fine. Being challenged is part of healing. Beware of being pushed too much. Listen to yourself, trusted others. For example, i don't entertain hypnosis as a potential approach. Others do. That's okay. You need to be true to your standards, values. This query really is impossible to answer more specifically because each person has their individual circumstances. What really benefits person A might be a negative experience for person B. Generally, CBT is a helpful tool. Makes me feel worse. Just one example. One hint that does appear almost universal is to find a way to cut through unwanted thoughts in order to enjoy quality sleep. That method again depends on each person. The resulting rest assists. May all go extremely well. ",
