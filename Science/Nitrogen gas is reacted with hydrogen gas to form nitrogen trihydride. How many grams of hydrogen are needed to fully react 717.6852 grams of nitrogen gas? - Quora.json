            "answer_text": "Since this question appeared in my inbox today, I assume you may still be unsure about how to proceed. Here\u2019s a simple approach: Start with the balanced equation for the reaction. N2 + 3 H2 \u2013> 2 NH3 then read it in terms of molecules: 1 molecule of N2 reacts with 3 molecules of H2 to form 2 molecules of NH3. Scale it up to moles: 1 mol of N2 reacts with 3 mols of H2 to form 2 mols of NH3. Using the molecular masses, translate it into grams: 14 g of N2 reacts with 3 x 2 = 6 g of H2 to form 2 x 17 = 34 g of NH3. Hopefully you can take it the rest of the way. By the way, I agree with the comments of the previous answerer. You should be coming to us not to provide the answers to homework problems, but for understanding of the strategies used to attack them. If you only get the answer without understanding how it was arrived at, the next time a similar problem is posed to you, you\u2019ll be just as stuck. ",

(Note: nitrogen trihydride, NH\u2083, is more commonly known as ammonia.) For this homework question*, look up the molar mass of nitrogen; use it to compute the number of moles present. Then note the mole ratio of nitrogen to hydrogen here, to find the number of moles of hydrogen. The use the molar mass of hydrogen to get the number of grams. *Don\u2019t post homework questions here without doing some work, and showing what you have already done. We can give guidance if you get stuck, but we\u2019re not here to simply do all of your work for you. ",
