            "answer_text": "The one that gives you the light that you want. A larger umbrella is going to give you softer light. A white bounce umbrella is going to give softer light than a silver bounce umbrella of the same size, but you\u2019re going to lose power. A white shoot-thru is going to be even softer but in a small room you\u2019re going to have a lot of spill which is going to affect the exposure. My favorite umbrellas are the Paul C Buff PLM system. I have several, but I mostly use a 64\u2033 soft silver PLM with a front diffuser. This gives a very similar light to a large octobox but is much easier to transport. ",

            "answer_text": "The newer umbrellas now have fiberglass spokes which is helpful if used outside and they get blown over in the wind. I\u2019ve had several umbrellas with metal spokes bend under these conditions. And once they bend they are practically useless! Be careful not to go too big in size as the steel shaft that the spokes connect to still isn\u2019t strong enough in my opinion.
