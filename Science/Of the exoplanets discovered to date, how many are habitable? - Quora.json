            "answer_text": "I think we need to wait a few more years to get a definitive answer to this question. Maybe when the James Webb Telescope becomes operational we'll have a better understanding of the conditions on these planets (see link). http://exep.jpl.nasa.gov/presentations/12-09Apr21_greene_JWST_transits.pdf  We do know that a couple of these newly discovered exoplanets are near the \"Goldilocks zone,\" (See Gliese 581) but there are many other things to consider when determining if the possibility for life exists. Venus for example, is near the habitable zone, but greenhouse effects on prevent the possibility for life (as we know it).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_581_ghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone  Another consideration is that, although it's unlikely for life (as we know it) to form on gas planets, it may form on a gas planet's moon(s). Tidal forces acting on a moon can cause the moon to generate heat from within, such as on Jupiter's moon Io. And, just as we think there could potentially be life in the oceans on Saturn's moon Enceladus, there are probably pockets of habitability in other solar systems as well, even outside of the Goldilocks zones.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_%28moon%29#Possible_water_ocean When life is discovered on other worlds (and I surely believe it will be) it will have huge implications on philosophy and religion (a topic for another discussion). I look forward to the day when we can look through a giant interfermetric telescope and see a green and blue ball many light years away. ",

            "answer_text": "NASA has found some that COULD be habitable. In the way that Mars COULD be habitable. Exoplanets are so far away, it's amazing we could detect them at all. When NASA says COULD be habitable, it means that a planet similar sized to earth, and orbiting in the habitable zone of its star. See the problems here? The only way to know for sure is to wait for interstellar travel. Life has so many different forms that is impossible to quantify the habitability of a planet. There is, however, an Earth Similarity Index that measures how similar a planet is to earth. This could help if we're looking for planets habitable to us and other earth life. Earth is 1, Mars ranks 0.797. This site has information on exoplanets with highest ESI ratings. HEC: Data of Potentially Habitable Worlds - Planetary Habitability Laboratory @ UPR Arecibo It's amazing, really. Kepler 438b has a number of 0.84. ",
