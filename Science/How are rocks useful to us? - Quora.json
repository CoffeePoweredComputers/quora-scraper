Before the first metal (copper) was known to man, Rocks were the only hard substance used for different purposes. The periods of usage of rocks has been studied under three sections namely Paleolithic (Old Stone age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone age), and Neolithic (New Stone age). Later Copper was discovered and the Chalcolithic age started. Early human used rocks for hunting, shaping softer rock with harder ones, making spear tips, sharp-pointed hammer type tools for piercing skull of animals, flat-edged rocks for cutting flesh and other stuffs as such. The usage of rocks has a total different perspective in modern days and it has improved gradually and slowly. Buildings are entirely made of Rocks, for instance, The Taj Mahal (made up of white marble, a metamorphic rock), floor are decorated with polished igneous rocks such as granites, railway tracks are laid down by billions of tonnes of Basalt, flat slate and sandstone slabs are laid down for roofing buildings, etc. etc. in construction. Besides what I have mentioned, rocks of economic importance contains expensive minerals such as corondum which finds its application as hard abrasive material and as Gemstone (ruby, sapphire). Limestone a sedimentary rock which is a prime constituent of Cement, Coal - the combustible rock, In fact we eat Rock everyday in the form of Salt which is nothing but a rock called Halite. One could go on writing about the use of Rocks by man but I would like to end up with a quote \u201cWhen a king reigns it is thanks to the people, when a river sings it is thanks to the stones\u201d. Malagasy. Hope I did justice to your question. Thank you. ",

More than that, our economies revolve around silicon information networks and gold. We used to trade heavily in gold, but now it even makes up the most important calculation devices on the planet instead. It is still worn and regularly given as a sign of eternal love, one of our highest cultural virtues. That is why rocks are important to humans. How?
