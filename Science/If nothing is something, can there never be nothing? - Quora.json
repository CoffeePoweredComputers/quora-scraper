            "answer_text": "Yes. For people who are used to function in this densed reality, Nothing will mean emptiness. Everything that arise will fall to Nothingness (Empty). When you start to detach your perception of this world into higher truth, something and nothing cannot be separated. They are like glass half full or half empty. If you deny Nothing, nothing still exist as a subject. Nothingness as emptiness feels like a void. In fact it is often said that you should A-Void the void. But void cannot be avoided because it is the construct by which all manifestation arises and dissolves. Emptiness is borne from Attachment. Fear, Greed, Obsession, and any hold on fix views are all aggregates to suffering and will lead to emptiness. If you say you feel unhappy, feel unloved, feel unimportant, attached to everything about this world that is not even permanent, etc. And dwell on this mindset, give it life by projecting similar feeling to other people, it will feel emptiness. To change this, one must allow and commit to accept that life is not about amassing wealth, or think highly of oneself, or have apathy. Having right views is paramount. Having to understand what joy is to give, joy will naturally multiply, humbling and true. From nothing, You came to life with nothing, Life gave you something. Something mold you to the persona you think you are. Something can make you feel empty and feel nothing. Feeling nothing while existing in this life can cause you to be callous. Understanding what Nothing is, make you tame, calm and assured that Life is not some dumb force. It is very Inteligent. This intelligence make the very soil grow all produce, grow all lifeforms for food, and all expressions that life can show that it is alive and Inteligent. Many think that God must be far, science say it doesn't exist. Religion say we own God. Man just swallow everything and say this is truth. This is very wrong. Test it, try it, work it. And see if statements still agree with your reasoning. If it does, it has seeded and be enliven by it. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as nothing. Can you truly imagine nothing? When you attempt it you still imagine something. Simply, existence exists. Non-existence doesn\u2019t exist, by definition. So there is no such thing as non-existence. There is no \u201cnothing\u201d. The idea of \u201cnothing\u201d exists. The idea itself is not nothing. It exists. And it exists only as the opposite of something. It is like the idea of a negative (of a photograph). It is spoken of only relative to \u201csomething\u201d. How could there ever be nothing? What would produce it? Existence can\u2019t produce non-existence. ",
