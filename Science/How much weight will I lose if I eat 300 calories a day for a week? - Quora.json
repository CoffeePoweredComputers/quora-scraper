            "answer_text": "Not enough to be worth it. What will happen is you will loose if you spend 2000( if you are a male, female its closer to 1500\u20131750, it depends on your activity levles) calories a day that would be 3.4 pounds in the week, exept that you are starving yourself, thus your metabolism will lower a lot and you will end up loosijg 1.5\u20132 pounds for starving yourself out for a week. Then you will eat normally and take back all the weight as your body will keep as much stored as possible just in case you starve again. And you will also take back weight because your metabolism is lower and you will be spending 1500 calories instead of 2000 per day. The good way to diet is take the amount of calories you spend in a day( go calculate it on internet), take that number and remove 500. So if you spend 2000 a day, eat 1500. That way you won'r starve yourself and you will loose around 1 pound of fat a week, keep that for a couple of weeks/months depending on how much you want to loose and you will achieve your goal in a healthier way and your body will not be traumatised.

            "answer_text": "It depends on a lot of variables. The main thing is how many calories are you expanding each day. Let\u2019s say that your expenditure of calories per day is 2300. That put you at a 2000 cal deficit. So a pound of fat is 3500 cal in a pound of muscle is about 750 cal. You\u2019re going to be burning through a combination of muscle and fat at that level of a deficit. So let\u2019s say your burn rate is 2 pounds of fat to everyone pound of muscle. So every 3 pounds is going to be 7750. Got your 2000 cal deficit that\u2019s going to happen every four days. Seven days in a week so that\u2019s gonna put you somewhere right around the 5 pound mark. ",
