            "answer_text": "This answer is going to speak in generalities, which will automatically make it contentious. I will try anyway, but at least I warned you. This very much depends on two things: Your personal identification with the term liberal or the term conservative; and your own confirmation bias. I hear conservatives all the time complaining about the \u201cLiberal media\u201d. Except for Fox news. They tend to think Fox news is just great. I hear liberals all the time complaining about Fox news. They think Fox news is just the worst. Media persona tend to be more liberal minded, but they are employed by businesses and corporations who, in general, support a more conservative view. No media outlet is going to be without bias. Objective journalism is a concept without a real world example. It is an ideal worth striving for, even if it will never truly exist. If you find yourself nodding in agreement with the news you watch, and you really want to know the truth, then change the channel. The closest you can ever get to the truth is to view it from all sides and then figure it out for yourself. This isn\u2019t easy and is often excruciating in practice. It is said that the truth will set you free. What is unsaid is that the freedom gained comes with a lot of anguish and is often unpleasant. Very few, if any, can withstand a full dose of unvarnished truth. Very few, if any, could survive their own scrutiny if they used it on themselves. All news is biased. But they don\u2019t hold a journalist convention and decide on which way they will go with it. Owners of media do tend to favor content that will sell papers or achieve ratings. What you won\u2019t see is media reporting that shows it\u2019s ownership in an unflattering way. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important to note that opinion shows featuring commentators such as Sean Hannity on the right or Rachael Maddow on the left are NOT news programs. These are opinion formats. Open any newspaper to the editorial and opinion pages. You will find such commentators in that section. These people are paid to stir the pot for higher ratings and on line hits. In essence, they are entertainers who must produce ratings. The best way to do this is by being provocative. Because the public supports this format, the outlets supply it. News outlets, strictly speaking, tell you what happened, not why. When news outlets bring guests in to explain, say, a political or military event, you must keep in mind this is one side of the story. Even if they bring in \u2018two sides\u2019 you owe it to yourself to google their background. For example, it\u2019s been shown some retired military commentators also work for think tanks and have agenda based opinion. They are not at all objective, as you might think! Here is an in depth look at how news outlets are rated. One big problem with rating these sources is only a handful are well known. In this article, for example, a source not even mentioned is The Christian Science Monitor. Which news organization is the most trusted? The answer is complicated. Complicating this more when examining articles rating outlet bias, there is variation partly due to the bias of the reviewer. You must consider them only as rough guides. Perhaps the best guide is the ideological placement of each outlet\u2019s primary audience. Here s a graph showing the ideology of the audiences for the more now outlets.  Bottom line, we must each consider our own bias before trying to determine an outlet\u2019s bias. You must also look closely at data and charts when they are presented and not take them at face value. For example -  Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, projected this chart during a high-profile congressional hearing investigating Planned Parenthood. (Chart taken from Americans United for Life's website) But look closely at the numbers! Abortions did not rise at the rate this graph purports to illustrate. Her is the corrected chart. They remained pretty flat.  And this doesn\u2019t begin to provide the big picture. See below.  Abortions still remain nearly flat. So remember, there are, \u201cLies, Damned Lies and Statistics\u201d. original source uncertain. ",
