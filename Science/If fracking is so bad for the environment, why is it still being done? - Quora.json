It doe NOT cause shifting of the earths strata with resulting earthquakes. It does NOT poison ground water. Fracking occurrs far, far lower than ground water. Millions have been spent addressing these \u201cissues.\u201d They didn\u2019t exist. Have you wondered why there is not much negative anymore about fracking? Because they were just completely made up stories by the radical left which always\u2026\u2026 Always\u2026\u2026ALWAYS has to find things wrong with our country whether true or false. They cannot exist without a long litany of horrors about to befall our nation. Gender issues, racism, bad schools, climate emergency\u2026..the list goes on and on. Not to say we don\u2019t have issues that need to be addressed. We do but I, for one, prefer to address them in a common sense, rational way\u2026\u2026not with endless histrionics carried out with demonstrations and all-to-frequent violence. But\u2026.sadly\u2026.. our society, especially media, politicians and others, have lost their minds. They can\u2019t firgure out how to think and discuss anything rationally any more. And those of us who are normals have to put up with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Its not bad. In fact it is why the US is now a net exporter of gas and oil U.S. Manufacturing costs are almost as low as China\u2019s, and that\u2019s a very big deal \u201cMade in the U.S.A\u201d is becoming more affordable. The reason? Fracking. U.S. Manufacturing costs are almost as low as China\u2019s You don\u2019t need to a Nobel Prize in economics to know that the fracking revolution has been good for the U.S. What\u2019s not so well known is just how competitive cheap oil and gas has made American manufacturing. BCG, the Boston consultancy, estimates the average cost to manufacture goods in the U.S. is now only 5% higher than in China and is actually 10% to 20% lower than in major European economies. Even more striking: BCG projects that by 2018 it will be 2% to 3% cheaper to make stuff here than in China. Part of the reason for the narrowing gap is that wages have been rising in China. And American companies have been boosting their productivity faster than many of their international competitors. But perhaps the single largest factor is that fracking has helped dramatically drive down the price of oil and gas that\u2019s being used in energy intensive industries such as steel, aluminum, paper and petrochemicals. BCG calculates that U.S. industrial electricity prices are now 30% to 50% lower than those of other major exporters. \u201cA 5% price discrepancy in manufacturing between China and the US doesn\u2019t amount to much,\u201d says BCG\u2019s David Gee, \u201cwhen you consider that US manufacturers face the risks of delay when shipping from China, the threat of port strikes, and the local investments and partnerships that Beijing often requires of foreign companies doing business there.\u201d  ",
