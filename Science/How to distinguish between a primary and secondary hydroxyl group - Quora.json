            "answer_text": "If the formula is given, one simply counts the number of carbon atoms that are bonded to the C which is bonded to the OH group. Primary alcohols have one carbon attached to the C-OH. For example, propan-1-ol CH3-CH2-CH2-OH. The bold carbon is bonded to the OH group, and the italicized carbon is the only one directly bonded to the bold carbon. Secondary alcohols have two carbons attached to the C-OH. For example, propan-2-ol CH3-CHOH-CH3. The bold carbon is bonded to the OH group, and the two italicized carbons are directly bonded to the bold carbon. There are also tertiary alcohols. These have three carbons attached to the C-OH. An example is 3-methylpentan-3-ol, CH3-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hopefully you understand this in-line formula: the -C(OH)(CH3)- means that there is a hydroxyl group and a methyl group attached to the carbon at the 3 position (which does not have any hydrogen atoms bonded to it). If given an unknown sample in a lab, you can distinguish these three types of alcohols with aqueous chromic acid, written as CrO3(aq) or H2CrO4(aq). This reagent is often prepared by adding sulfuric acid to potassium dichromate moistened with water. This reagent\u2026 oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. does not oxidize tertiary alcohols. ",

            "answer_text": "What is Primary Alcohol? Primary alcohols are the alcohols in which hydroxyl group is attached to the primary carbon of the alcohol molecule. This is the simplest form of alcohol. Primary alcohols can be oxidized to form aldehydes (RCHO) under mild conditions. However, when stronger oxidants are used, primary alcohols first transform into aldehydes and then rapidly transform into carboxylic acids (RCOOH). The reactivity of primary alcohol is less than that of a secondary alcohol. In Lucas test, primary alcohols do not form oily layers, unlike secondary and tertiary alcohols. However, they form volatile alkyl halides upon heating. Examples of primary alcohol include, methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc.  Figure: Methanol, an example of primary alcohol. What is Secondary Alcohol? Secondary alcohols are the alcohols in which hydroxyl group is attached to the secondary carbon atom of the alcohol molecule. Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones (R2CO) upon oxidation under mild condition. Stronger oxidants, however, lead to the formation of acids or mixture of acids. With Lucas test, secondary alcohols form oily layers within about five minutes. Secondary alcohols are more stable and more reactive than primary alcohols. However, secondary alcohols are less acidic than primary alcohols. Some examples of secondary alcohol include isopropyl alcohol and butyl alcohol.  Secondary alcohol. ",
