            "answer_text": "What causes a virus to become ineffective is simply that bits and pieces of it fall off and fall apart. Viruses are large assemblages of complex molecules. Over time, more and more of these molecules fall apart from one another, until the virus no longer has the physical integrity necessary to infect a cell. This same kind of molecular degradation occurs to living things as well, to everything from bacteria to humans. But the difference is that living cells have the ability to self-repair. They can synthesize new proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and use them to replace the damaged ones. Viruses have no metabolism and no biochemical machinery for molecular synthesis, so any damage to them simply accumulates over time. That is why viruses don\u2019t last very long. If they cannot reach a new host within a few days, they become permanently inactive, or \u201cdead\u201d. ",
