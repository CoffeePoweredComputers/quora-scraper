            "answer_text": "Mr. Goodman may be correct that it is easier to wash soap off with soft water, but it sure doesn't feel like it! I know the feeling: soft water just doesn\u2019t dissolve the fatty deposits that a soap will leave on your skin, and after the soap is washed away, the surface tension of the water is too high to wet the fat, so it feels like you need a scraper to get a clean feeling. It takes for-ev-er. A little bit of hardness takes some of the surfactant out of commission so the fat that precipitates from the soap is tied up with the Ca/Mg precipitate in bigger clumps. If the hardness is extreme, you get a ring around your bathtub and poorer washing. But there are nonionic surfactants that do very well in hard water, and aren\u2019t too difficult to wash off. ",

            "answer_text": "Using soap with hard water will result in the formation of the hardest salts, such as magnesium and calcium, forming a curd like substance with the soap. Thus a insoluble soap film is left on the surface of the skin. When using soft water, there is no insoluble films left on your body resulting in a clean, but slippery, surface. ",
