            "answer_text": "BOND PAIR : a pair of electrons (two electrons) responsible for bond formation between two atoms. LONE PAIR : a pair of electrons resides in the valence shell of an ATOM and not participates in bonding . Here is the example  In HCL (hydro chloric acid ) there is two atoms :hydrogen atom (H) and chlorine atom (Cl) here 1 electron in the valence shell of H & 7 electrons in the valance shell of Cl . Each atom shares one electron in formation of bond .now 6 electron left in the valence shell of electron means three lone pairs of electrons . NOTE :Lone pair means \u0924\u0928\u0939\u093e ,\u0905\u0915\u0947\u0932\u093e . ",

            "answer_text": "Every elements have electrons in their atoms. These electrons are in shells that are located outside the nucleus. One shell can have one or more orbitals. The orbitals that are closest to the nucleus are s, p and d orbital. An orbital can be divided into several sub-orbitals. One sub-orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. When there are no electrons, it is called an empty orbital. When there is one electron in a sub-orbital, it is called an unpaired electron. When the sub-orbital is filled with a maximum of two electrons, it is called an electron pair. The electron pairs can be found in two types as bond pair and lone pair. The main difference between bond pair and lone pair is that bond pair is composed of two electrons that are in a bond whereas lone pair is composed of two electrons that are not in a bond.  ",
