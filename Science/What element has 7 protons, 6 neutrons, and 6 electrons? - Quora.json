            "answer_text": "In a neutral atom, irrespective of the element it belongs to, the number of the protons must be the same as that of the electrons. As for neutrons, in naturally-occurring isotopes of any element, the number of the neutrons exceeds or is equal to that of protons, with the well known exceptions of protium and helium-3. Any other isotope with less neutrons than protons is synthetic, and usually unstable and short-lived. Summing up, the chemical species proposed in the question should be a single-charged cation of nitrogen-13, a synthetic isotope of nitrogen. ",

            "answer_text": "A singly ionized less abundant isotope of nitrogen. Here is why; a nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 electrons, the most abundant nitrogen isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in its nucleus, but a nitrogen with 6 neutrons means it is an less abundant isotope. Also all the elements have equal number of proton and electrons but your question contains \u201c6 electrons\u201d so it is singly ionized. ",
