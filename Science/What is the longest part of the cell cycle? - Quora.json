            "answer_text": "Interphase(I-Phase) It is interval between two successive divisions of a eukaryotic cell in which growth and synthetic activities prepare a cell and it's nucleus to divide again. It is a non-dividing phase and also known as resting phase. Why it is the longest phase?  Cell doubles up it's components and prepares itself for cell division. Synthesis and storage of energy rich compounds, especially ATP. Replication of DNA, division of centrosomes and formation of two centriole pairs in animal cells and cells of some primitive plants. Intermitotic interphase utilises 75\u201395% of the generation time(consider 24 hours is required to divide, then it is about 22.15 hours in humans) It has three stages namely G1, S and G2. ",
