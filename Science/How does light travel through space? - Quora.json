            "answer_text": "Light does NOT travel through SPACE at all, light travels through TIME, and time alone. In the same way your state of health is a time phenomenon, not a spatial one. Light is the excitation state of something, and that something is clearly not vacuum, which is defined as pure nothing. So, the first thing you have to erase from your hard drive is the term and concept of \u201cspeed of light in vacuum\u201d because it poisons and kills every chance to ever understand light, or anything else for that matter, repeating it over and over eventually ruins your cognitive capacity. If you have an epidemic moving through a population - which true enough takes up space - you are inclined to talk about the epidemic as moving \u201cacross\u201d the country, but it isn't, the state of health of individuals (for the sake of clarity let\u2019s imagine them as being stationary) is evolving in time, and this evolvement is offset by yet a factor of time from the neighboring individual, which creates the illusion of a movement through space. But it is not a velocity, it is a RATE, where the time between infection of the first and the last individual is divided by the space separating them, giving you a unit of time per space, days per kilometer, or seconds per meter [s/m]. Together with this misleading concept of light, you may go and also erase the misleading concept of electricity running in wires from your hard drive: there is no such thing as electricity per se - C.P. Steinmetz already in 1900 called it prehistoric superstition - there is only the conjugate, inseparable, dual phenomenon of dielectricity AND magnetism, where magnetism IS spatial expansion, and dielectricity IS counter spatial acceleration (about that later). The basic concept of J.C. Maxwell is, that the Electrical Activity is contained solely within the Dielectric Medium, NOT within the metallic portion of the geometry which bounds it. A photon is not a thing in itself, it is the junction of two conjugate time phenomena, and thus a pure time phenomenon in itself . Light transports the image of its source through time - not through space. Would light be a bunch of individual photons scattering through space, any imagery would be impossible. What separates you from the image you see is time alone. While we are getting rid of unnecessary and nonsensical stuff, let\u2019s throw in for good measure space and time as the dimensions we are used to: Space does not HAVE dimensions, space IS a dimension, and it is ONE, a metric one, without substantiality. Time is ONE dimension, also a metric one, and both exist only to quantify. What you are used to think of as dimensions are metric instructions to guide you through a dimension, not the dimension itself. The substantiality of milk, for instance, combined with the metric dimension of the carton gives rise to the combined dimensionality of a gallon of milk: \u2026..and if you want to make cheese, you add a metric, temporal dimensionality. The compound, conjugate, inseparable Phenomenon of Magneto-Dielectricity thus can be described two fold: The substancive dimension of the Dielectric Induction (\u03a8) in Coulomb, is combined with the metric dimension of the Capacitance (C) in Farad, giving rise to the compound dimensional relation of the Electro-Static Potential (e) in Volt. In other words: The Farad \u201coperates upon\u201d the Coulomb, giving rise to the Volt.Likewise, the substancive dimension of the Magnetic Induction (\u03a6) in Weber is combined with the metric dimension of the Inductance (L) in Henry, giving rise to the compound dimensional relation of the Magneto-Motive-Force (I) in Ampere. In other words, the Henry \u201coperates upon\u201d the Weber, giving rise to the Ampere.Thus we arrive at two laws of proportionality: The Law of Magnetic Proportion with the dimensional relation: Weber \u2261 Ampere\uff65Henry And the Law of Dielectric Proportion with the dimensional relation: Coulomb \u2261 Volt\uff65Farad In physical reality, any system displays its material properties as gradients of the above: The Gradients of the (Magnetic) Inductance and the (Dielectric) Capacitance, are given as, for the Magnetic: Henry/cm or [\u03bc] also called Magnetic Permeability And for the Dielectric: Farad/cm or [\u03b5] also called Dielectric Permittivity When we substitute these into the above mentioned laws of proportionality we arrive at: Weber \uff65 Coulomb/cm^2 \u2261 Volt\u30fbAmpere\u30fb\u03bc\u30fb \u03b5 But we also know that: Weber \uff65 Coulomb \u2261 Planck thus arriving at Planck/cm^2 \u2261 Volt\u30fbAmpere\u30fb\u03bc\u30fb \u03b5 and we know that V\u30fbA \u2261 Planck/s2 thus arriving at Planck/cm^2 \u2261 Planck/s2\u30fb\u03bc\u30fb \u03b5 Do you see where this is leading us? s^2/m^2 \u2261 \u03bc\u30fb \u03b5 Keep in mind that these are NOT EQUATIONS , these are EXPRESSIONS - something mathematicians have a hard time to grasp - expressions of physical realities and properties operated upon by the \u201cdimensional operators\u201d space and time. And here ends the buck: \u03bc\u30fb \u03b5 = 1.11265006 e-17 [s^2/m^2] What mathematicians do in their bottomless ignorance of physical reality is the following: first they turn the term upside down: [1/(\u03bc\u30fb\u03b5)] and then they pull the square root \u221a1/(\u03bc\u30fb\u03b5) which then comes with the coveted, but totally nonsensical unit [m/s] and this then is called a velocity - which, spelled out, reads like the equivalent of \u201csquare root of per inductivity\u201d which is nonsense of course, but what to mathematicians care about sense? Now, when I ask you to throw your junky \u201cspeed of light\u201d term into the cremator, you know why: it has no physical representation, it is a mathematical artifact. And with it goes the most nonsensical term of all times: E=mc^2 Energy has nothing to do with what generally is called mass, energy is particle free and mass free. J.J. Thomson for instance calculated the energy content of a hydrogen atom long before fuzzy head Einstein, and did so without relating it to mass. Here\u2019s how energy works instead: the Total Electrification(Q) in Planck of the Ether (today code named \u201cvacuum\u201d or \u201cquantum foam\u201d) is the product of two conjugate inductions; the Magnetic (\u03a6) in Weber and the Dielectric (\u03a8) in Coulomb Q = \u03a6\u30fb\u03a8 Because Induction is a process, and a process is a something evolving in time, we get two Inductivities changing in time: The total Dielectric Induction (\u03a8) per Time (t) that is, the RATIO of the substantial dimension of Dielectric Induction (\u03a8) to the metric dimension of Time (t), the Dielectric Induction over time (\u03a8/t), or the time rate with which the Dielectric Induction is produced/consumed is the DISPLACEMENT CURRENT I=\u03a8/t (Ampere)\u2026\u2026. Maxwell LawThe total Magnetic Induction (\u03a6) per Time (t) that is, the RATIO of the substantial dimension of Magnetic Induction (\u03a6) to the metric dimension of Time (t) , the Magnetic Induction over time (\u03a6/t) or the time rate with which the Magnetic induction is produced/consumed is the ELEKTRO-MOTIVE-FORCE E=\u03a6/t (Volts)\u2026\u2026\u2026..Faraday LawThe total electrification of the ether thus manifests as the Quantity of Plancks (Q) being produced or consumed in time: Q/tBecause Q=W\u30fbs^2 it follows that Q/t=W\u30fbs and that is Energy: Energy thus is defined as the time rate of the production/consumption of the Electric Induction orW = Q/t That is an expression that reflects physical reality, and if you can compute what you read, you will realize that energy is NOT a fixed quantity in the universe, but a time derivative of Electrification. Energy can be produced, not only converted. Energy providers may be excused for not letting you in on this \u201cdirty\u201d little secret, but you as consumer have less of an excuse not to read the following, over a hundred year old papers (except E.P. Dollard) written by the fathers of our electrified civilization. 1. \u201cElectro-magnetic Theory\u201d Vol. 1 by Oliver Heaviside. 2. \u201cImpulses, Waves and Discharges\u201d by C.P. Steinmetz. 3. \u201cElectricity and Matter\u201d by J.J. Thompson. 4. \u201cRecent Researches Into Electricity\u201d by J.J. Thompson 5. \u201cDischarges In Windings\u201d by E.P. Dollard 6. \u201cOccult Ether Physics\u201d by Layne To the Newtonian billiard ball brains we carry around on our shoulders, some of this hundred year old stuff reads like pure science fiction, like O.Heaviside: \u201cThe law of continuity of energy is maintained when the energy existent at one time disappears but reappears at another time.\u201d etc\u2026.. Fuzzy head Einstein has been on purpose elected and elevated to the status of god in science, because his poison called \u201cspace-time\u201d completely and successfully ruins your capacity to understand the phenomenon Heaviside describes here, and subsequently to understand anything at all that matters. Einstein is a sedative, it is poison - or at least what has been made of him is. Nikola Tesla: \u201cIf you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.\u201d \u201cNature has stored up in the universe infinite energy. The eternal recipient and transmitter of this infinite energy is the ether. The recognition of the existence of ether and of the functions it performs, is one of the most important results of scientific research\u2026.\u201d that is why Tesla has been branded as a fool and his findings confiscated. If you think that Einstein would be able to live out his life sticking to his youthful aberrations (like the 1905 papers) you are mistaken: he went on international lecture tours promoting himself as an ether-physicist: \u201cLight propagates through the sea of ether, in which the Earth is moving. In other words, the ether is moving with respect to the Earth\u2026\" Tokyo 1923 And in \u201cA. Einstein, L. Infeld, The Evolution of Physics\u201d (1938) we read: \u201cOur only way out seems to be to take for granted the fact that space has the physical property of transmitting electromagnetic waves\u2026.\u201d so he has to admit that space must have physical properties to allow light to propagate, which therefore can no longer be called a vacuum, which has per definition no physical properties. That Einstein was a mystic and not a scientist becomes clear in the continuation of this very sentence: \u201c\u2026.and not to bother too much about the meaning of this statement. We may still use the word ether, but only to express some physical property of space\u2026.\u201d So, ether yes, but the moment you have made this necessary concession, forget about it and pretend it not to be important\u2026. that is mysticism, not science! What about Photons and Electrons and the entire CERN Particle zoo? all figments of imagination, mathematical artifacts, confabulations\u2026. In case of CERN this is a simple conclusion: the machine is powered by Gigawatts of particle free and massless electric energy, yet produces - \u201cfinds\u201d as they call it - elementary particles\u2026. ok? In case of Photons and Electrons, Maxwell and Thomson give us the answer: The Maxwell/Thomson concept of Electric Induction, and the concept of the Ether which engenders this Induction, comes from experimentation and observation - not from \u201cthought experiments\u201d mind you - and considers the Dielectric Lines of Force, and the Magnetic Lines of Force, as CONCRETE PHYSICAL REALITIES.  Eric Dollard: \u201cThese lines can be considered \u201ctubes of force\u201d, a hydro-dynamical vortex tube of sorts. Here we find the \u201chydro-dynamical model of the ether\u201d as given by James Clerk Maxwell. Understanding of this sort has been buried by the relativists and quantum car mechanics. From the initial concept of Faraday, thru the theoretical reasoning of Maxwell, into the experimentalist like Crookes and J.J. Thompson, it gave an ENGINEERABLE CONCEPT of the primordial aether. Finally Nikola Tesla, Oliver Heaviside, and Carl Steinmetz turned this into today\u2019s electrical technology.\u201d Thus, the CROSS PRODUCT, of a single tube of DIELECTRIC INDUCTION (\u03a8) with a single tube of MAGNETIC INDUCTION (\u03a6) gives birth to a single unit of ELECTRIFICATION (Q). This idea embodies the concept of the PHOTON, a QUANTUM UNIT of E.M. Induction. That means, a photon is not a thing, it is the crossing point of magnetism and dielectricity, like two spaghettis crossing. You wouldn\u2019t call that point a thing either, it is an event. A PHOTON is and EVENT, and events evolve in time. As for the ELECTRON, Thomson considered it to be the terminal end of one unit line of Dielectric Induction. Like the end of a spaghetti: you can point at it, you can describe it, measure it, but it has no independent existence, it is an aspect of another reality, the spaghetti. So, light does not travel through space and electricity does not travel through wires. Physically, there is neither exclusively the one or the other, only the combined, conjugate induction phenomenon of magneto-dielectricity, the polarization of the ether between space and counter space, where magnetism IS spatial expansion and dielectricity IS counterspatial acceleration. The term acceleration here is NOT acceleration THROUGH space, but OF space, it is the collapse of magnetism (i.e.space) into counter space. That is why objects do not resist this acceleration, whereas they resist all acceleration through space. Newton applies only to acceleration through space, not to acceleration of space. What is called gravity is acceleration of space, bodies do NOT resist falling, whereas they resist to be thrown. Gravity is not a Newtonian phenomenon, but a Faradayan one. As with the seemingly plausible but utterly misleading image of electricity running through wires, or light having a velocity, we are kept asleep in the complacency of the ad hoc plausibility of the compass needle pointing north and thus indicating poles of earth as being physical realities. This is also misleading and on purpose not clarified: the earth is called a magnet with magnetic North and South Pole, but magnets accumulate material at their poles, which earth\u2019s alleged poles do not.  Compass needles are NOT attracted to the poles - no accumulation=no poles - they orient themselves north south, but that does not mean that there is a north-south thing going on, on the contrary, this indicates that the earth is like a solenoid, that there is an east-west thing going on, to which the compass needle reacts by orienting itself orthogonally: below we have a left-right thing going on but the needle would orient itself up-down without being attracted to neither up nor down.  How does light travel through space? there is no such thing as space in the classical meaning of independent emptiness within which things are happening, space IS the thing that is happening, or rather, one aspect of the conjugate event called Magneto-Dielecricity, it is the magnetic aspect, responsible for giving rise to volume. An atom is NOT mostly empty space as is claimed, it is Volume, and this Volume is not a thing, it is an event. It is motion, force, dispersion of energy. It\u2019s conjugate counterpart is \u201canti volume\u201d if you want, it is absolute rest (i.e. inertia), acceleration, concentration of energy \u2026. The polarization of the ether then can be described as force and motion opposite inertia and acceleration and with these two principles the rest of all phenomena can be understood - if understanding is the goal. The primordial substance called ether has no extension and no duration, a concept difficult to grasp for post Einstein minds, but Poincare could still think in these terms and we should try to regain that capacity: \u201cTime and Space \u2026 It is not nature which imposes them upon us, it is we who impose them upon nature because we find them convenient.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Light is made of spherical waves of energy. This is how it is emitted from atoms. Waves need medium to propagate as all waves do in nature. So how can waves of light propagate through vacuum pf space? There is no medium in vacuum of space. Before scientists believed in medium of aether in space. But there was no evidence of aethter in space. This idea was finally discarded by scientists. Then came the concept of \u2018space time continuum\u2019 to replace \u2018aether\u2019. Waves of light and gravity can propagate through this medium of \u2018space time continuum\u2019. Actually \u2018space time continuum\u2019 is a new, fancy, modern, scientific name given to old concept of \u2018aether\u2019. There is no evidence of fabric or medium of \u2018space time continuum\u2019 in vacuum of space. The question of light still remains. To solve this problem, they declared light, traveling as electromagnetic waves which do not need medium as these waves can travel pushed by alternating electric and magnetic field strength. The problem with this is that no one found evidence of electric or magnetic field in light. Waves of light do not disturb iron particles with its energy fields. Let us go back to birth of light in atoms to find the answer. As we know, light is emitted as spherical waves of energy from atoms. There are trillions of energy waves of light in just one second. As they travel away from the source, spherical waves get bigger and bigger. Light propagates as spherical waves of energy, each kicking the one in the front. The wave length is so small, these waves make their own medium by traveling in trillions per second. If we compare this wave length with distance between particles of any other medium (i.e air, water,etc.), we can conclude that light makes its own medium to propagate through vacuum of space. Light does not need any other medium. Light makes its own medium and this is how it travels through vacuum of space. ",
