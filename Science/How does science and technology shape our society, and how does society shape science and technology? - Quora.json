            "answer_text": "Just think of past two decades, when there were no mobile phones. Can you think of a day without phones today? A huge difference. A little backwards and there was no internet, and no computers. Today you cannot do anything without them. Your social life depends on them, and all your knowledge and interactions with outer world depends on them. Now go back little over hundred years back, when there were no roads, no vehicles, no trains (planes were not known). All travel on horseback or bullock carts. Communication used to be first through bearers, then by post. Now postal ways also have changed and communications systems and ways changed, and written letters have become thing of the past. All food used to be made at home, and there were no eateries. Lodging or staying in hotels was unknown. Clothes have also changed, so also the ideas of beauty and wealth. Jobs and services have also totally changed from what they were. All the changes you see over these time periods is due to science and technological developments. So one need not think about a life without science and technology. We just can't imagine what will come next and how the new changes will appear. ",

            "answer_text": "Mutual relationship between Science & Society: A great example of Science shaping the society is the Second World War. Japan was not surrendering & the US was irritated with such stubbornness. So they dropped two nuclear bombs one each in Hiroshima & Nagasaki which is known to everyone. The destruction they caused is unable to be framed in words. That scene of mass deaths and radioactive impact on the posterity prompted the world leaders to review their scientific achievements and aroused the need for a social peace-keeping organization called the United Nations. Similarly, when dynamite was discovered by Alfred Nobel, the discovery was appreciated by the Science community. But when a French newspaper mistakenly published his obituary (instead of his brother's) titled The Merchant of Death is Dead in 1888, he was astonished & horrified by the way the world will recall him. So this made him think about the society & hence, in his will, he proposed the concept of prizes in his name to the people contributing for the welfare of the society. This validates that science and society go hand in hand and influence each other when it comes to serving humanity. ",
