            "answer_text": "When you are looking at reactants in a chemical reaction and products it would be nice to know exactly the ratio of the amounts of each species. if you just use mass it does not give any indication of the actual numbers of atoms, molecules or ions reacting together to give a certain number of atoms, molecules or ions as products. I mole of anything contains the same number of whatever it is you are looking at. This is the Avogadro number 602,250,000,000,000,000,000,000 o4r if you like 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1. That is 6.022 x 10^23 per mole. This is a constant amount that is why it is also known as the Avogadro constant! e.g 2H2(g) + O2(g)\u2014->2H2O(l) here we have moles of hydrogen gas reacting with 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of liquid water. or 2 molecules of hydrogen gas reacting with 1 molecule of oxygen gas to produce 2 molecules of liquid water. If we use mass we have 4 g of hydrogen gas reacting with 32g of oxygen gas to produce 36g of liquid water. the latter method does not give any indication of the ratio of the amounts of each species reacting together to give a specific amount of liquid water. The former method does! This is the reason why the mole was developed! I hope this has helped you Good luck Aidan. ",
