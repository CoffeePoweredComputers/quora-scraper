            "answer_text": "It can't be, because that would violate the principle of causality. Nevertheless, tunnelling has been a tricky beast to pin down, because the mathematical description of tunnelling is a nonpropagating solution, which begs the question; what is the speed of a non propagating solution? The answer to that is subtle, but still found in the mathematics. The tunneling solution always shows a lower probability than the equivalent free space propagation. It's an attenuation of the free space propagation of influence. Thus an influence can't travel faster than the speed of light because it's been attenuated. All the confusion arises from there being no simple method of calculating a tunneling speed, or tunneling time. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum objects do not have a well defined position until they are detected. So we dont know where/when they were on the inside of a barrier and we do not know what progress they make through the barrier- most likely they dont progress, they just appear outside the barrier. So the question does not really make sense. We dont know where the particle set off from/when it set off ( as it does not have a well defined position). All we know is we detected it outside the barrier, but it had a probability of being outside the barrier all along so in that sense it never moved. However, once detected outside the barrier, the particle instantly is anywhere else. This is just like a photon passing through a slit- the photon has a probability of arriving at different places on a screen. We detect it at one place, and it instantly has zero probability of appearing anywhere else. That does not mean it moved anywhere instantly! ",
