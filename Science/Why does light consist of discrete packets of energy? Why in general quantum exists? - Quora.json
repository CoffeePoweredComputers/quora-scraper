            "answer_text": "The quantum exists due to the fact that energy,in quantum physics, is quantized,not contieous.This fact was discovered by Planck,in 1900, when he was studying the physical phenomenon of the black body radiation.He found the energy is proportional to the frequency,where the frequency is 1/T where T is time period.The proportionality was found to be of the value 6.623 X 10^-34 joule ,sec.Therefore the energy of each quanyum was found to be E=hf,where h is the proportionality constan mentioned above.In 1905,it was discovered that when light incidents on a metal,an electron is ejected,this is interprated by Einstein in 1905, as a aphoton of light(quantum) collides with th electron,overcoming the work functin and ejecting the electron out of the metal.This is called the photoelectric effect,this is based on the quantization of energy as discovered by Planck.Accordingly light is an elecromagnetic waves(as maxwell discovered it 1865) quantized as quanta(made of stream of quanta called photons).So these packets are the photons(quanta).

            "answer_text": "The discrete packets about which you are talking is known as \u201cphoton.\u201d The photon is the fundamental particle of visible light. Each photon contain energy In some ways, visible light behaves like a wave phenomenon, but in other respects it acts like a stream of high-speed, submicroscopic particles. So, photon contain energy from which light can propogate. At the level of atoms and sub-atomic particles objects behave very differently and quantum theory is an attempt to describe the behaviour of matter and energy at this sub atomic scale. So, QUANTUM EXIST. THANKS FOR READING. HOPING THAT IT WILL CLEAR YOUR DOUBT ",
