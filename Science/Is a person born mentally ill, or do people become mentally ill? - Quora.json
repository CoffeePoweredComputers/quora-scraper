            "answer_text": "Yes. People are born mentally ill and people become mentally ill. Observe: A small child exhibits strange behavior from the time ze is very young. Ze has trouble in school, trouble communicating, and has an oddly extended fantasy world. For example, when ze gets home from school, ze will carefully act out everything that happened in school that day, often repeating the exact words that were said. Ze goes on to finish high school, but then, in hir late teens, ze has a sudden mental health crisis, is hospitalized and eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. A small child has no obvious mental health or behavioral issues. One day, as a teenager, ze goes to visit a friend and finds her dead, having shot herself in the head. Ze is understandably devastated and traumatized, and soon begins having nightmares and flashbacks about this incident. Ze becomes suicidal, is hospitalized, and eventually diagnosed with PTSD. Both of these are people I know, though obviously I'm not mentioning their names. I know many, many other people, myself included, who had very minor mental health issues from childhood, then developed true mental illness from traumatic or painful circumstances. Basically, mental illness isn't born or made. It's both. Sometimes, as in the examples above, you can sort of tell where the problem came from, but mostly you can't. One day, we'll have the genetic and neurological understanding necessary to be able to answer this question more definitively. Until then, mental illness is both born and made, and that's about all we know. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people with mental illnesses don't get them until they are older. It is controversial, but some doctors now think even older children can be diagnosed. Typically, it was thought that most mental illnesses did not start until the late teens.  Disorders such as bipolar disorder do run in families, so it is thought there is a strong genetic component. However the genetic predisposition is towards a disorder, it doesn't have to be the same disorder as the parents or grandparents had.  Even if you have the genes for it, you won't necessarily become mentally ill. It takes certain types of stressors to activate the genes and allow a mental illness to appear. It may even be that most people have the genes that allow them to become mentally ill, but they never suffer from the stresses required to make the illness appear. My psychiatrist once told me that there is a certain allele that appears in most mental disorders. What this means, he would not speculate. I think it means that if the genes don't necessarily determine the form of the illness. But they do give you a predisposition for illness. It's really a combination of things that cause mental illness. Genes and stress help. And there's a lot still to be learned, so even though I say it's genes and stress, that may turn out not to be the case. It's just what seems likely. ",
