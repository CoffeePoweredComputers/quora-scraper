            "answer_text": "There are many ways to check the purity of a substance. One of the best ways to do this (assuming your compound has a melting point between 40 and 350\u00b0C) would be melting point analysis. Do do this you simply observe your substance in one of these handy melting point apparatuses:  This will tell you the range at which your substance melts. If the range is under 2\u00b0C (an arbitrary parameter but the standard nonetheless) than your substance is pure. This is because impurities cause a widening in melting point range of a substance. If you know what the melting point of your product should be, then you can compare to the values obtained from our little test here. In addition to having wider ranges, impure substances will also have lower melting points. Other notable ways include various forms of chromatography. Depending on what substance you have and what phase it is easiest separated in you can go with either gas or liquid phase chromatography. This will tell you not only if your substance is pure or not, but also tell you how much impurity you have relative to your desired product. Coupled with mass spectrometry you could even find out exactly what your compounds are! ",

            "answer_text": "There are different detection methods for different substances. When a substance is prepared, it can be judged by side reactions and chemical equilibrium. There are many methods for testing purity, and they need to be selected on demand. If you buy reagents produced in chemical plants, the packaging will be marked with content and standards.Generally divided into several grades: SP PT GR AR CP LR\u2026\u2026 ",
