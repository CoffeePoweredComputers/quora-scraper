            "answer_text": "This minute? Nothing you would notice. You wouldn\u2019t feel any difference. Your mental powers would not be enhanced. Your physical ability would not be improved. For a day? You probably wouldn\u2019t notice. But already the oxygen is beginning to subtly harm your lungs. Oxygen causes damage to all cells by oxidising the contents of the cell. Natural antioxidants oppose this process, but we only evolved to deal with 21% oxygen (see edit below) so these defences become overwhelmed. Lungs take the brunt because they get exposed to the greatest amount. After 24 hours, breathing would be uncomfortable. You would have a dry cough. Your chest might feel tight. After a few days, permanent damage starts to occur. The light spongy lung tissue begins to scar and become firm and stiff. Even if you went back to breathing air, your lungs would not return to normal. At pressures greater than 1 atmosphere, such as in a hyperbaric chamber, breathing 100% oxygen causes seizures after a couple of hours. So people who require this therapy have the atmosphere changed to a lower oxygen content, every hour or so, to reduce this risk. Edit: Since this answer is getting a lot of views, it\u2019s worth clarifying this point. Oxygen toxicity depends, not on oxygen concentration but on partial pressure. Partial pressure is calculated by ambient pressure multiplied by concentration. At atmospheric pressure this works out at 21kPa. Breathing 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure gives a partial pressure of 100kPa which is gradually toxic. And a partial pressure of 300\u2013400kPa (in a hyperbaric chamber) leads to seizures. But breathing pure oxygen at one fifth of atmospheric pressure gives a partial pressure of 20kPa, which is safe to breathe for indefinite periods. Some space vehicles have had this composition of internal atmosphere. ",

            "answer_text": "Our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, with some oxygen, carbon dioxide, and a bunch of other gases thrown in. The only gas in the mixture that we need to live is, of course, the oxygen. It makes up about 21% of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. So, we\u2019ve evolved to use a mixture of air that is 21% oxygen, at a pressure of one atmosphere. Our bodies ignore the rest. The oxygen is the active ingredient, and the rest can be considered inactive ingredients. We don\u2019t need them to live. The idea is to not change the average amount of oxygen you breathe. Too much, or too little, might be harmful long-term because we aren\u2019t adapted to it. A pure oxygen atmosphere at standard pressure (more about this later) would be too much oxygen (100% vs. 21%) if breathed full-time, although it can save your life if you are injured or you have damaged lungs or other health problems that impair your ability to take in oxygen. But an average healthy person should try to keep the amount of oxygen the same as the average person breathes. (There\u2019s another reason to avoid 100% oxygen at standard pressures \u2014 enhanced fire risk. Most things will burn lots better when in an atmosphere with more oxygen available. This is what killed the Apollo 1 astronauts.) Now we need to introduc the concept of partial pressure. This is the idea that you can think of the total pressure of a mixture of gases (like the Earth\u2019s atmosphere) as the sum of the pressures contributed by each gas. We want to know the partial pressure of the oxygen in our atmosphere. Since the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi)(non-USA folks, use the number you prefer), and 21% of that is oxygen, then if we\u2019re breathing pure oxygen at 21% of normal pressure we\u2019d be getting the same amount of oxyten as we would on the Earth\u2019s surface. Since 21% of 14.7 is around 3, that means if you breathe pure oxygen at 3psi you will be getting the normal amount of oxygen. You can\u2019t just strap on a low-pressure oxygen mask, though. It\u2019s pretty hard to breathe a source of 3psi air if you\u2019re surrounded by a 14.7psi atmosphere! Your lungs would be full of 3psi, but your torso would be compressed and you would suffocate. (Math: 14.7psi - 3psi = 11.7psi difference, for a chest area of 1 square foot, that\u2019s 144 square inches * 11.7psi = 1684.8 pounds squashing you flat.) You will need to be in a pressurized chamber filled with 3psi oxygen, or some kind of iron lung contraption. Or a spacesuit, surrounded by a vacuum. And hey, this is pretty much what they do for spacewalks on the outside of the International Space Station, although they mix some nitrogen in to reduce the danger of the astronauts suffering from the bends. Low-pressure spacesuits are easier to design, weigh less, and their air supply lasts longer. ",
