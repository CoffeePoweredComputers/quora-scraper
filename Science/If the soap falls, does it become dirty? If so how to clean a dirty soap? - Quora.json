Don\u2019t worry about it though, soap is designed to get wet and can easily be rinsed off. Bar soap is also designed to be slippery. Sooner or later it will slip out of your hands, go skipping across the floor and land in a heap of dirt, hair or whatever is on the floor. Soap also leaves a wax residue on shower doors and walls. So if you want to eliminate the soap falling on the floor, the wax residue in the sink and shower, and the chance of it falling, switch to a liquid soap. ",
