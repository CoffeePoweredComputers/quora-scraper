            "answer_text": "As Jayaruwan and Alfred point out, Mendeleev noticed the some of the elements had certain properties that suggested they might be somehow related to each other. For example, halogens are a group of acrid-smelling elements that are highly reactive with many metals, and which form powerful acids when combined with hydrogen. Some metals, such as sodium and potassium, also seemed related, forming powerful bases, difficult to isolate chemically, and combining enthusiastically with halogens. Mendeleev looked for ways to arrange the elements into a table that placed these apparently related elements in the same columns, while still ordering them by their atomic weights. When he hit upon an arrangement that captured these relationships among elements, he saw that he could predict properties of elements not yet discovered (and, of course, where they fit in the table), and he could see new patterns among the related elements. The elements fell so neatly into place that he could even detect cases where published measurements of atomic properties were likely wrong, and later corrected some of these incorrect measurements. Mendeleev wasn't the only chemist to suspect a pattern, a periodicity, to the arrangement of the elements, but he perceived the pattern more deeply and predicted new elements. What makes this all the more remarkable is that he had no idea why this periodicity exists. Only later was it discovered to stem from the number of electrons in the outer shell of each atom. ",

            "answer_text": "The rows in the periodic table are called periods. The periods are often defined as recurring sets of behavior. They are arranged in proton ascending order. When the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the modern periodic table (there were several versions before this) many elements weren't even discovered. However, he realized that some are in fact missing. Thus he actually accommodated for the missing elements in his periodic table. Genius. ",
