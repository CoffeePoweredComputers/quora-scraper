            "answer_text": "Thanks for the answer request Josh Gwin! This question is difficult to answer because it depends heavily on a few things, namely: How much money you are willing to live off of?How much risk you are willing to take?What your definition of a good work life balance is?What your definition of work is?What is your education level?For example, what about the CEO who loves revolutionizing the world with his new technology and has no problem working 14 hours a day, 7 days a week? OR What about the surf instructor making $30,000 who is very content with his life and only works 4 hours a day? OR The college student who works a hour part time job, while attending classes, and is creating a blog on the side. S/he used to be working 16 hours days for 4 years but now only needs to work 4 hours a week as s/he travels the world living off the revenue from the mature blog?  I am going to assume that you want to make the average American wage of $60,000/year or more, and you only want to work a max of 8 hours a day. I will also assume you don\u2019t want to deal with extensive travel. Keep in mind that not putting in the extra hours will likely prevent you from moving up the corporate ladder and extra education can go a long way. Here are a few options: Accountant Business Analyst Physician Assistant Personal Trainer Event Planner Medical Writer Wellness Program Administrator Software Engineer Speech Language Pathologist Nurse Psychologist Chiropractor Occupational Therapist Audiologist Pharmacist Dentist  If you are interested, you are welcome to join my facebook group to learn more about resumes, interviews, and finding the job you deserve.

            "answer_text": "there is no such thing as career \"providing\" the best work-life balance..it's like a unicorn - a mythical creature that is told to have existed.. it is up to each person to make sure that the balance exists.therefore, it makes a difference to research the company and the prospective boss before taking up the offer (up to and including requesting interviews with the prospective team members to learn about the culture).. the issue comes down to this: if you have a pre-existing commitment (be it caring for an ill family member, a sick spouse/child or just having had promised friends to make it to the next gathering), will you be able to say to your boss, \"i have to leave now\" and actually leave the premises? if the answer is yes - either an understanding boss, or your confidence making a statement, or a work culture within the company allowing people to have a life - then you're good.. if the answer is no - either you cannot bring yourself to stand up to your boss, or the culture is to work 24/7, or you are just afraid of the perceived consequences, or the life outside work is just not important enough to even start asking - then no matter what career it is, there won't be a balance at all.. ever.. as they say, we teach others how we want to be treated - and ability to speak up and drawing boundaries around professional and personal lives is up to each person to determine..there are no careers when the boss gently taps on the shoulder and reminds that it's 6pm now and it's time to leave.. at least i am yet to hear about one..
