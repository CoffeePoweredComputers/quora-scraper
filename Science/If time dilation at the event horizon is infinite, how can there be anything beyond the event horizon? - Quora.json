So the question becomes \u201chow can anything else fall in past the event horizon\u201d. That\u2019s where the human mind decides this aspect of the universe doesn\u2019t make sense. This is one of those things that makes sense to me when I read an explanation but is beyond my ability to express in my own words \u2014 so I\u2019ll leave that to others with better expertise. What I will add is that from the perspective of a distant observer, there isn\u2019t actually a singularity because from outside the falling material slows to very close to zero, so it never actually reaches the center. This is why before the term \u201cblack hole\u201d caught on the term \u201ccollapsar\u201d was suggested: it\u2019s a collapsing star that from the perspective of a distant observer never finishes collapsing.

            "answer_text": "I know the \u201cGeneral knowledge\u201d answer is about that the person that crosses the event horizon experiences time \u201cnormally\u201d unlike an external observer. But this does not take into account that relativity is a two-way street: if the person actually accelerates to light-speed (or as near as possible) during the fall to the Event Horizon, then they should have to experience the entire remaning life of the universe in a single second - the time their image is \u201ctrapped\u201d in the event horizon is the outside-time that actually happens when they are there, even if they just experience it was normal time and not at an slowed down rate. This is similar to people doing insterstellar travel experiencing time as normal, BUT outside time is faster to them - while they aged a single year a twin could have aged ten. If this is indeed true then it also applies, and more radically, at accelerating towards the speed of life while approaching an Event Horizon. YOU would experience YOUR time normally, but you would experience OUTSIDE time accelerating exponentially.This roughly means you should NOT ever experience passing trough it IF that implies becoming pure energy (a light-like interval). The black hole SHOULD indeed evaporate BEFORE you cross the event horizon. The only possible exception would be the event horizon crossing you from radius increase, but this is more fuzzy. If indeed relativistic time dilation approaches infinity towards an event horizon, the end of the universe should come before you \u201cpass\u201d it, even if you experience just the free-fall consciousness of a few seconds. Again: Relativity is a two way street. If others can see you nearing the event horizon for an indefinite amount of time, you WILL be there as it regards the external universe, and you will even be able to observe the external time during this period passing (to you) much more rapidly, as for the outside observer your time happens much more slowly.
