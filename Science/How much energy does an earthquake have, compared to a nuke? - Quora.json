If you go to wikipedia to TNT equivalent - Wikipedia there\u2019s a table there that lists the released energy of a mess of different phenomena. Some of these are (MT is megatons TNT equivalent): Little Boy on Hiroshima - .02 MT All the explosives used in WWII, including nukes - 3 MT tropical cyclone, 1 minute - 8.6 MT total yield of Mt St Helens - 24 MT Tsar Bomba - 50 MT Krakatoa explosion - 200 MT total global arsenal of 15,000 warheads - 1,460 MT total global sunshine received per minute - 62,500 MT last eruption of Yellowstone supervolcano (640,000 years ago) - 875,000 MT 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami - 9.32 million MT 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (Boxer Day) - 9.56 million MT Chicxulub meteor (wiped out dinosaurs, 65 million years ago) - 100 million MT ",

The short version: the Hiroshima bomb had the energy equivalent of a magnitude-6 quake. The largest bomb ever tested, the Tsar Bomba  had a yield equivalent to a Magnitude 8.5 quake. ",
