            "answer_text": "Did anyone tell Trump that COVID-19 was likely to be a major problem for people in the United States, or did he come to that conclusion entirely on his own? There are several opportunities to get a jump on this epidemic. DOD made note of something going on in Wuhan in November of last year. There were articles in science journals in the beginning of December about a new contagion causing server pneumonia in the Wuhan region of China. Dr. Rick Bright sent out a warning in January about the encroaching pandemic and urged those in HHS to ramp up on supplies, such as masks and gowns. His boss, Alex Azar, refused to take these warnings to Trump and to finally shut Dr. Bright up he essentially removed him from his position. Now some will say the Trump acted decisively by closing down travel from China the a few weeks later from some European Countries. But the Virus has already been in the country since December. After reviewing medical records it has now been determined that the first death due to Covid19 was in January in Santa Clara County. Italy has determined that their first death occurred in December. Florida has determined that there were cases in that state in December. We have an administration that has the idea that they know more about anything than anyone else. The president sports an invisible sign on his back that says, \u201cKiss my ass -or else!\u201d As the knowledgeable people get winnow out because they spoke truth to power and replaced by the most unqualified toadies to fill those positions. Like Alex Azar who was a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry who hired a dog breeder from Texas to manage Covid19 response team a HHS These are the backgrounds that have our safety under their leadership. Trump did not come to any conclusion on his own and only acted when it became apparent that it will have a negative impact on his re-election efforts. He had daily briefings, which were not about the pandemic but him. He has also spent the last month trying to hang blame on everyone and everything else because he, of course, is blameless and takes no responsibility for the current dismal situation we are now in. But the sad matter he is totally responsible for ruining the FDA, HHS, USDA and the pandemic task force put in place by the previous administration. He also could not see the need to renew the service contracts to maintain the US inventory of medical equipment like ventilators. I cringe every time he put members of his family in charge of anything. Kushner\u2019s heading up the pandemic response team has to be the most laughable failure of Trumps response. When this level of incompetence runs the country when an emergency we see what happen 72,000 people dead in two months and there is no end in sight. ",
