            "answer_text": "Right I'll state from the outset I hate trump, but bear out the rest of the answer. Trump is not entirely to blame for the failure to act quick enough and severely enough. Shock horror I hear you gasp! In this situation trump really doesn't have a clue\u2026 no one does as it's an event that only happens 1 in every 100 years. Scientists have encountered this particular virus for the first time and are continually learning different facts about it. So Trump really doesn't have a clue (sorry I did say I hate trump!). He's not a scientist. He's not a virologist. He has absolutely NO medical knowledge what so ever. So what happened. Trump has to listen to his GUT and advisors. Now as Trump doesn't have a clue, his gut is pretty useless. So he listens to people\u2026. Yes trump DOES actually listen\u2026 so who's he been listening too? Jarred Kushner, Ivanka, Kevin Hassett, Steven Munchkin, Bill Barr, Scala, Wilbur Ross, Azar, pompeo, Mike Pence, Fox & Friends et al. None of these are scientists, virologists, or medical people. They don't understand the nature of the virus. They don't understand what the impacts of the virus would be. They are money men. Businessmen. They employ people. They don't look after or care about the average Joe (until just before an election). They are only interested in big business and lining their own pockets. Has he listened to anyone else\u2026 yes. Dr Fauci, Dr Birx and a few others at the CDC. These people include virologists, scientists and medical experts in many field. So where did it go wrong? From the outset the business brigade (for easy reference) didn't believe the virus was as bad as it was. They didn't want to go to the lengths the scientists were saying necessary to contain the pandemic from its beginnings in the us. Trump listened to both camps, and like most people Who don't have a clue, erred on the middle road between the two factions. He did a half way house plan. Stop the Chinese coming in from China. Yes that was good! He didn't stop Americans travelling to and from China in this same time frame\u2026 That was bad. we have learned over the last few years, who ever speaks to Trump last tends to be the information trump will acton. This is invariably a member of the business brigade. It was obvious that in the early weeks of the outbreak trumps business brigade had the biggest part of trumps ear, and trump himself may not have believed how bad it was. So we had the \u201c oh the 15 will become one\", \u201ceverything is under control\" spin. Unfortunately this continued for too long. It was denial, pure and simple! Finally by mid / end of March, the severity of the problem set in and trump listened to the medics more! So Trump alone isn't to blame, his business brigade are also guilty. Trump is guilty of ignorance. Ignoring the scientists from the outset - mid december onwards, lost valuable planning time. Trump is on public record saying he's not to blame. The buck doesn't stop with him. Well 100,000 deaths later, I would strongly disagree with that. ",

            "answer_text": "Its twofold. First, he doesn\u2019t trust the information of his experts unless they are in his inner circle. He had information, but then he asked his \u2018trusted\u2019 advisors who then told him \u201cIf we just do this, we\u2019ll be ok\u201d. Or at least that is what we assume he did. The scary version? He didn\u2019t listen to anyone and just decided to do the little he did all on his own! He restricted travel from China, FOR CHINESE ONLY! Anyone other nationality it was, \u201cHey, how ya doin\u2019? Yeah, just come on in, hope you brought your dollars with you!\u201d. He doesn\u2019t govern, he doesn\u2019t know how. For him, its all about the imagery. All he cares about is how he is perceived and whether he gets positive feedback. That\u2019s why he has done nothing for three years but campaign for re-election. So, being this close to the election cycle, he wants nothing that will affect his \u2018numbers\u2019. If he takes an aggressive action, it could affect the stock market - which is his barometer for the economy - which would affect his numbers. And thats why he kept down grading its impact here, hoping it would blow over, at least until the election. ",
