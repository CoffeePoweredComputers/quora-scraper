            "answer_text": "Yes, I would say.But the complexity depends on what you actually mean. Is it abstract, or is it physical. I'll discuss both here. Case (i)-Insanely PhysicalSo you wish to go inside the game completely? That's insane, but nevertheless possible(After all, you're talking with one of greatest thinkers of future :-P). Still, it is really far. REALLY far, and I doubt this biological species would survive till then. Now, that makes possible 3 subcases.Subcase (a)Life becomes completely extinctNo, it is not possible. :-D And I'm sure and serious about that.Subcase (b)Humans(or other biological species) surviveYou would need a system that can convert you to electricity or some other usable form of energy by moving your particles at speed of light(by Einstein's equation of Relativity), then convert that energy into proper binaries, and finally reverse the process when game is over. I wasn't joking when I said it's insane but possible.Subcase (c) Earth is ruled by a mechanical/information speciesIf it is mechanical, read subcase (b). If it is an information species, it is as simple as simply entering the game. Now THAT can be fairly near. Case (ii) Completely abstractThat's actually pretty hard, the best to do would be that(according to the modern intelligence and research, I believe only this idea may exist on so far) you create a memory in your mind that you entered the game, and play the game directly(by using brainwaves if you may) or indirectly(crete your virtual brain and make it play). Other 2 subcases(Extinction and Information Species) are same as previous case. Except machanical one. In that your intelligence can go to play.Case (iii) Instead of going virtual, make it realI guess it is self explanatory, so I would only answer how it may work and why I considered it here.It can work using holograms(3D projections) and you being equipped with appropriate equipment.I considered it, even though it's not like going in and out, because it's the most viable option for now. And still, if we improve the equipment, it could be a lot like that(except controlling the speed, but who said that's impossible! We still have the good old Einstein's Relativity with us!). Just take care that you do not get trapped inside the game. I hope it was helpful! ",

            "answer_text": "That's sort of what happens when we play any game -- we pretend that the rules and world of the game are a temporary, or virtual, reality. If you mean, is it possible to design a game that uses virtual reality gear to display an artificial world -- a head-mount display and earphones -- then, yes, of course it is. There is a great deal of interest and excitement in this technology, which is finally becoming cheap enough and good enough for general consumer use. I'm not sure about \"stepping,\" however. You don't want to be walking around in the real world while your vision is obscured. Some fancy VR setups include a treadmill and a safety cage that let you step in place while wearing VR gear, giving you the illusion of movement.   ",
