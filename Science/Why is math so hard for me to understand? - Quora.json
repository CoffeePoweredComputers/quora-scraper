            "answer_text": "Math is difficult for most of us, because its purpose is to fill a big gap in the way we naturally and normally observe the world, and think about the world. Our normal way of thinking is driven primarily by our emotions and by our social instincts. This way of thinking works pretty well for us, most of the time, because we all spend a lot of our waking lives dealing with other people. But that natural, social, and emotionally-driven style of thinking isn\u2019t so great at guiding us, when we need to manipulate the physical world precisely. Such precise thinking, drained of emotion, really is pretty unnatural for us. So yes, mathematical thinking is hard, even for those of us who love to do it. Part of the trouble is that math, unlike everyday life, usually requires perfection. Too often an imperfect calculation is way off, so far out of whack as to be useless. There is a place for approximate calculations, but that\u2019s a delicate art in its own right, with different rules. Math\u2019s expectation of perfection is very unlike everyday life with people. With social and emotional thinking, we accommodate to imperfections all the time, and our brains are good at accepting these situations and adapting to them. For math, the best analogy I know of is music. In classical music, a demand for perfection rules; some expressive departures from perfection can be allowed, but only within limits. The analogy goes further: If you want to get better at math, the way to do it is very similar to the way one gets better at music: you have to practice, a lot. In math, \u201cpractice\u201d means reading proofs and solving problems, lots of problems. Not only that, but to be successful in math, you have to enjoy practicing, just as successful musicians enjoy practicing their music. If instead you practice math only dutifully, the result will be similar to what comes of merely-dutiful music practice. In high school, when I was studying trig, pre-calculus, and calculus, I would just solve all of the problems in the textbook, as a matter of course. Once I\u2019d been doing that for awhile, it became easier, so it was relaxing and fun. ",

            "answer_text": " Math is one of those fields that keeps building on its foundation. If that base isn\u2019t sound, each additional layer causes things to get more wobbly. There\u2019s no way of stating for certain if this is your problem but it could be. You know adding and subtracting pretty well, possibly multiplication and division a bit less, the math associated with fractions even less well, etc. You get through the classes but have a bit less comprehension each time. Unfortunately, each succeeding class will require these skills and add to them. If you have problems dealing with subtracting mixed fractions or dividing them, what will it be like when throwing mixed fraction variables into the mix? And that\u2019s the rub. Unlike some other subjects, math keeps going back to the well and forcing you to redraw some water. In history class, once you\u2019re finished with Roman history, you\u2019re off to medieval and you don\u2019t face the Romans again. And then to the Renaissance and again, the Romans are in the past, ya-da-ya-da-ya-da. Or English where you learn parts of speech but as you go on, you graduate into literature and reading Austen, you don\u2019t get quizzed on nouns or adverbs. But in math, you\u2019re always led back to that well which has exponents and fractions and the rest of the stuff you learned earlier in life. This may not be your issue but it is certainly for some folks. I volunteer tutor at the community college and one source of the inability of students to keep up with the teacher is by spending too much time trying to work the basic mechanics of number manipulation, they aren\u2019t paying attention to the new concepts being taught. All I can suggest is check and see if you\u2019re really proficient and confident in the basics and if not, spend some spare time getting fluent in this area. It could be a grade saver. ",
