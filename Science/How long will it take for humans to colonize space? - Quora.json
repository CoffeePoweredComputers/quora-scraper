Heres how I came up with a quarter century: Elon Musk is determined and more capable of pulling this off than any nation or company except Blue Origin owned by the world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos who isn\u2019t interested in Mars. Besides, Elon is working on his 5th prototype of his Mars rocket, Starship. He has 2 more prototypes nearing completion. He is determined to colonize Mars in his lifetime, now 50ish with a quarter century to go IF God is willing. He plans on cargo to be on Mars surface in 2022, humans in 2024. So, if he\u2019s a few years late, that\u2019s rocket biz! As a physics engineer similar to Elon, it\u2019s apparent to me that his Tesla Cybertruck will make a marvelous manned Mars rover and cargo truck.His Boring Company digging machine can excavate hundreds of tons of precious mineral resources for earth export in Cargo Starships with their capacity of 150 tons per ship or in the passenger version, 100 people Per ship every 26 month launch window. cargo can ship anytime. Needed are field geologists to find the resources. But there\u2019s even more that Elon can contribute to colonization such as SpaceX Mars outside suits, Starlink modified for cell phones, GPS and Mars Internet.His Boring Company can dig tunnel pressurized passageways between habitats But the habs will require unforeseen time to test and prove. During this time, Starship, that the colonists arrived in, can serve as living quarters. One more thing as Colombo used to say, Tesla solar panel power, hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts with batteries to store the solar energy. Elon is well positioned to colonize Mars very soon. It\u2019s difficult to predict where Neuralink computer chip to brain interface will fit in. We are only a few years away from colonizing Mars with NOTHING but bad luck to slow or stop him. Naysayers can scream in their closets to no avail! Mars or Bust. Elon has 6 sons, the oldest twins, Griffin and Xavier are 16, so in 25 years, 41. Elon\u2019s genes in his cousins, parents, grandparents and siblings exhibit hereditary high intelligence and talent . Elon started an elite private school for his sons to accelerate their education. Amazing, isn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "The asker demonstrates a pre-existing understanding that surpasses that of many who might answer this question, by asking which 'companies' would spearhead progress rather than which 'nations' would. The investment of nations will always be determined by prestige projects as fickle as public opinion, and the limited lobbying of science special interests. None of this will likely ever be enough for major endeavors. The interests of entrepreneurs however is a totally different story. Many entrepreneurs are interested solely in profit, others use profit as a tool for their dreams. Space colonization will be pioneered by the later and ultimately funded by the former. Once any human activity in outer space is found to be profitable without government subsidy, human presence in outer space will explode very rapidly. The single overriding factor for anything to happen with regard to human colonization of space is launch costs. What has been achieved thus far has been achieved despite ridiculously huge costs to put payloads into space. Till now only robot satellites have been profitable and space is teaming with privately funded satellites as a result. If launch costs can come down enough however, a great many other activities, human activities, will become profitable. Chief among these will be asteroid (and possibly moon) mining and micro-gravity manufacturing, both of which will require a human element to manage intricacies. SpaceX has successfully soft landed first stage boosters, commercial boosters that actually put a paid payload into orbit, something many putative space experts said was impossible. Recently, they have relaunched such boosters! This is a HUGE step towards space colonization, every bit as huge as landing men on the moon. The fact that the rest of the world has barely noticed is completely irrelevant, as public funding and therefor public awareness is completely unnecessary. Being able to recover and reuse launch rockets will ultimately reduce the cost of access to space so much, that regular human launches will become completely routine. We will soon (likely within the next decade) see the first privately funded pilot projects in space based manufacturing and asteroid harvesting. Elon Musk (the owner and CEO of SpaceX) has a personal goal of colonizing Mars. His plan is simply to come up with a completely reusable transportation mechanism that can move people to Mars by the hundreds, and by virtue of it being reusable, sell tickets to Mars for a price wealthy individuals can privately afford. He has done his own market research and found that his plan is in fact viable if he can get the ticket costs low enough, there is enough demand. Sadly that existing demand exists to a large degree on people's dreams of adventure, and I am far from convinced the dreams will survive reality. I strongly suspect that any permanent Mars habitat will be largely the domain of scientists, tourists and superwealthy retirees. The problem with Mars is that there is nothing to do there (other than the afore mentioned science and tourism) that cannot be done more profitably elsewhere, and therein is the crux. This is not the death knell for space colonization however, it merely will require that Elon Musk have his transportation system have destinations other than Mars. Chief among these I expect will be Ceres. Ceres is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, much easier to land on actually than Mars. It has just enough gravity that things parked near to it won't float away, but so little that sending material from Ceres to anywhere else in the solar system will be extremely inexpensive relative to the cost of getting stuff out of planetary gravity wells. It also has lots (and I mean LOTS) of water, along with every other element you could possibly want. It is located in the asteroid belt so it could be home base for other asteroid mining activity as well. A colony on Ceres could be hugely profitable, able to supply oxygen, water, rocket fuel, building materials, etc., to any and all space projects, most especially including microgravity manufacturing factories operated by space colonists, making products profitably for sale on Earth and elsewhere. (A Ceres colony would build a rotating torus inside the planetoid to create an artificial gravity for it's inhabitants. This would be quite easy as the microgravity would create little structural stress. The mass above the torus would have relatively negligible weight requiring only minimal support. That mass would shield the inhabitants from the hazards of the space environment every bit as well as does Earth's atmosphere.) SpaceX obviously will be a huge part of this. Other companies to watch will be Bigelow Aerospace who will likely build the first privately funded space stations. Virgin Galactic who will likely 'pay' for those first private space stations to house tourists and private researchers. Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries will both likely be making rapid strides over the next ten years and both will likely return asteroidal material within that time. As first movers within their industry, those companies hold a serious advantage over what competition will inevitably emerge once they demonstrate profitability. However they will face competitors some of whom will achieve success either by being very scrappy and innovative, or by virtue of having access to hundreds of billions of dollars of capital so as to leapfrog the bootstrap investments of those first movers. It is anyone's guess who those new entrants might be. Within the lifetimes of most people reading this, the human race will have a permanent, self sustaining human presence off the Earth. That presence will continue to grow. It is very probable that the growth in human population will be such that building O'Niell colonies will be necessary and profitable, again within the lifetimes of people reading this. The dreams of many science fiction writers will soon bear fruit.  Photo Credit: Don Davis/NASA ",
