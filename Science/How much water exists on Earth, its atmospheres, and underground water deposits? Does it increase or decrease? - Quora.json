            "answer_text": "First we present the (almost) obligatory water-drop graphic:  The mass of the oceans totals to about 1.4 \u00d7 10^21 kg, 10000 times the atmosphere\u2019s water content. Note that they don\u2019t mention the underground water resources. That is in large part because we really don\u2019t know how much water is trapped in the crust and upper mantle. Some of that trapped water is captured molecule-by-molecule in the solids (much like \u201cwater of hydration\u201d is trapped in concrete). Some studies have suggested that there\u2019s an equivalent amount of water underground as there is on the surface. The usual number i see cited is 30% of fresh water is underground (10.5 million km3) and over twice that amount of saline (23.4 million km3). Those two amounts are included in the 1.4 billion of the graphic. As the oceanic tectonic plates are dragged into the earth at subduction zones, they\u2019re also carrying down saturated layers of ocean sediment. Much of that water returns to the surface as steam components of volcanic eruptions \u2026 including as the \u201cfoaming agent\u201d of pumice. Since water is a by-product of the combustion of hydrocarbons (such as oil, natural gas (methane) and gasoline/petrol), it is continuously created as we burn those fuels. When plants photosynthesize, they\u2019re \u201cconsuming\u201d water to create the sugars they will metabolize later in the process of respiration. At that time they\u2019ll release water vapor \u2026 but those are \u201cnew\u201d molecules instead of the old ones that were used earlier. Some of the consumed water will end up as the plant\u2019s structure (such as wood). As others have written, some water is, indeed, lost to space \u2026 this happens when the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light breaks apart those few water molecules high in the atmosphere. First it knocks off one hydrogen ion, which is lost to space. Then the remaining HO- radical can get broken down and the second hydrogen is lost. Whether or not the lone oxygen atom manages to couple with another to create a neutral O2 molecule is a roll of the dice. But the \u201cwater\u201d that was there before is now gone. (Don\u2019t worry too much \u2026 the sun\u2019s \u201csolar wind\u201d is blowing a continuous stream of hydrogen ions in our direction that will help replenish the lost hydrogen. But it\u2019s still a net loss). ",

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t argue with the posts citing the volumes of water in, on, and floating around the Earth because, for the most part, they\u2019re are fairly much in agreement. What I\u2019m not seeing much of is the answer to \u201cDoes it (the amount of water) increase or decrease? It\u2019s decreasing. I can provide evidence of this from a satellite picture :  \u201cThis is an ultraviolet image of Earth's dark hemisphere with the Sun behind it, taken from NASA\u2019s Dynamic Explorer I spacecraft at 19,700 km altitude above 13\u00b0 N latitude, on February 16,1982. The extended red glow around the planet comes from hydrogen atoms that have escaped to the exosphere. A northern auroral oval and equatorial glow are due to emission from atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen. Isolated points are stars that are bright in the ultraviolet.\u201d (From Catling & Zahnle, \u201cThe escape of planetary atmospheres\u201d, Scientific American, 2009, photograph courtesy of NASA). The picture provides evidence that the earth is shedding hydrogen to outer space. Although the Earth is able to maintain most of the hydrogen, as the escape velocity from Earth (10.8 km/sec at the exobase), is usually much higher that what hydrogen atoms can achieve (at 1000 K, hydrogen atoms have an average speed of 5 km/sec,). Still, the dissociation of water molecules release enough hydrogen to appear in these photos, or about 102,500 tons of terrestrial hydrogen that escape each year. As the Earth is not getting back nearly this amount from outer space, I would conclude that the Earth is slowly drying up. ",
