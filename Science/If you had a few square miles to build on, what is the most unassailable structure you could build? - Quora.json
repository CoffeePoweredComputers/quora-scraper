The result is a set of nuclear bombs that will go off if anyone tries to disable them, cut the firing cable, turn off the power to your complex, or alter the signal (you have to cut the fiberglass to get at the signal wire, which itself sets off the bombs). The term \"fail-deadly\" means that you have a positive signal running through the wire, and if that signal stops the bomb goes off. Maximum retaliatory damage will stop attacks before they happen.
