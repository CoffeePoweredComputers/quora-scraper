            "answer_text": "It probably just happened. And then in the opposite direction. First, you have to define what is \u201ccloser\u201d. I mean as the Earth rotates, parts of it get closer to the Sun, others further way, in part because the surface of the Earth is obviously not perfectly smooth. Heck, if you live in a two story house, you can easily get close to 9\u2032 closer just by walking up the stairs. If you want to get 2cm, stand on a thick book. In addition, I believe the Sun pulses in size larger than 2cm. And as others, our orbit is far from circular. Right now we\u2019re heading closer to the Sun on average and perihelion will occur in January around the 3rd. We\u2019ll be about 91.4 million miles from the Sun. (Yes for folks in the Northern hemisphere, believe it or not, we\u2019re closest to the Sun in the winter!) About 6 months later we\u2019ll be at aphelion when we\u2019ll be about 94.5 million miles from the Sun. So 2cm\u2026 is nothing. ",

We shift more than 2cm closer or farther from the Sun perhaps as quickly as every minute. Also, the Sun is a gas ball, not a solid object.

At perihelion (when the Earth is closest to the sun) we are at a distance of about 91,398,199 miles (147,091,144 kilometers). At aphelion (when we are farthest) we are at 94,507,635 miles (152,095,295 km). Note the distance is a LOT more than 2cm! As it happens it does mean there is a slight difference in the length of seasons. Winters are five days shorter than summer in the Northern Hemisphere, while summers are five days shorter than winter in the Southern Hemisphere. But temperature wise the difference is hardly noticeable \u2014 the effect of land and water distribution is much greater. ",

There are about 2.5 cm to the inch, if cm means centimeters n your question. as a centimeter is 1/100th of a meter and a meter is a litle over 3 feet. The Sun, if you made it a cookie jar, could hold about 1 million three hundred thousand cookies, and the cookies I am suggesting would each be the size of the Earth. The Sun is about 93 or so million miles away. Hmmm..based on the numbers you pose, I would have to assume nothing measurable, as bear farts would create a bigger disturbance, for anyone orbiting around them.  ",

In January the distance between the Earth and sun is roughly 147 million km. In July (summer for me) the distance is around 152 million km. That 2 cm isn't really important.
