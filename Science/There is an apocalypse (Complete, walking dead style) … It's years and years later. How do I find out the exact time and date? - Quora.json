            "answer_text": "Keeping time in a joke-of-an-apocalypse like the Walking Dead is childs play. That being said, if it comes to real ends of our society: The simple fact is, someone will keep counting. Someone, somewhere, will keep counting. If they won\u2019t maintain clocks, they\u2019ll count days. They\u2019ll count years. If that is all you have to work with, people doing it manually, you\u2019ll have to be clever. You\u2019ll have to collect several sets of data. The more the better. The calendar is bound to drift timekeeper to timekeeper. They will lose days here and there. The more of them you have, the more precisely you can get the correct date. Our original time keeping was completely nature-based. There\u2019s the position of Mars (it\u2019s in certain places at certain times of a two-year long cycle). But, the most useful are the equinoxes and solstices.  They are easily observable and you can use them to center your calendar. Once you have days, months and years, all you need is hours, minutes and seconds. You can recreate hours by the use of sun dials. Sun dials which you can now construct and read correctly because you established what time of year it is.  Hours are all you need to start rebuilding the society. When you start getting into better technology, you\u2019ll need minutes and seconds. To get those, just use your exact hour counter and build basic clocks. And presto, you\u2019ve got yourself the exact time. Of course, there might be better ways of getting the time. The easiest way to find the exact time and date is to find a functional watch. There\u2019s plenty of wristwatches that can last for decades without a battery change. Things like Casio G-Shock come to mind. As long as it is somewhere where it can get light, it will keep on ticking. Not only that. It will automatically sync itself through radio-signal. It communicates with GPS satellites, which are basically hyper-accurate clocks in orbit. These bad boys would stay up there for decades and decades before breaking up. Without long term control input, I wouldn\u2019t use them for navigation\u2026 But they\u2019ll do just fine to set the time. This leads me to another point. We have a crapton of satellites in orbit around Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. Each and every one of them is a computer with a functional clock. Some will deorbit, some will burn in the atmosphere, and some will stop working. But one of them is bound to keep working. Find a way to establish a link, and you\u2019ll get the time. It will drift a bit, but you can make it work. Then there\u2019s the 10 000 year clock Jeff Bezos is building in the deserts of Nevada. It\u2019s gigantic and built to check itself for corrections. Take a trip there, and you get the time.  ",
