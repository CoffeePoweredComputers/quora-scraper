(the crucial ones are Proximity, accelerometer, Gyro, and Compass)Battery to power this up. type Li-ion or Li PolymerDisplay with digitizerChassis in the correct size.Software, you can use Android only. as iOS is not an open source OS.Other goodies you\u2019d like to have in your phone. like a fingerprint sensor, Face scanner. FaceID module. and many more!cards slot for SIMs and MicroSD (MicroSD is optional)antennas for everything.NFC module. (not exactly a must. but it\u2019s a good touch)Setup: ENOUGH money and patience to order the parts neededCoding Knowledgeteam that will aid you in building ita LOT of researchexperts that will help youA CRAZY sh*tload of guides.Please rememebr it has to pass TENAA, 3C, Bluetooth certification and WiFi Certification BEFORE you can call your device a phone. without these regulatories your device is not recognised as a phone.
