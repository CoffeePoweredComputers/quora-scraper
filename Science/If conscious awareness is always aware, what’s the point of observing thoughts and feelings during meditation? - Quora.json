            "answer_text": "You seem to have absolutely wrong bullshit ideas and seem to mix things up. Let me not go full Gnani on you and make a small example to make you understand what is that we are talking about when we talk about consciousness and awareness. Lets assume you are in a man with a Electric lamp which gives more light, the more voltage is fed to it. Right now you don\u2019t see anything but you, now you crank up the voltage, suddenly light radius increases and now suddenly there is a man standing near you, before the increase in your voltage he wasn\u2019t even in your perception now he suddenly pops up, it\u2019s not like he was never there it is simply that you were unaware because you weren\u2019t conscious to his existence. Now you go on cranking the voltage, suddenly more and more people pop up, there is furniture, there are buildings and alot of things that you never expected to be there. They have come in full view. Why is this? It is only because were never aware of them, they never existed for you. Now your energy has increased, you can now see more than you did before, now you see them\u2026you were blind before but now you can see. You just became AWARE of their existence. When we talk about awareness it is about being able to recognize things that were already there. If everyone is a god, then why isn\u2019t everyone flying around and manipulating reality and why is it that a Yogi who is sitting quietly in a corner is able to see your past, present and future effortlessly, how can he know more than you? he\u2019s doing absolutely nothing. The answer is simple, he\u2019s more conscious of what is happening within him and through that he can easily understand others. When you are told to sit down and quietly observe your thoughts, seeing the drama isn\u2019t the point. The real point is to become conscious of the drama that happens within you. The more you pay attention, the more you become conscious to your issues and more conscious you are, the greater perspective of life you\u2019ll have. If you can at-least become 10% conscious people will bow down infront you and worship you as a god because in there eyes the things that you do look absolutely magical. You have not gained some special powers or siddhis, just the perspective of life in your eyes have changed to such a degree that it seems like a different world altogether. When we talk about being conscious, we refer to your perspective in life. How much you have awakened your potential. How much aware are you of the world you are in. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cConscious awareness is always aware\u201d. Is it really? Have you looked to see if this is true? Here is Sam Harris\u2019s take: The principal enemy of mindfulness\u2014or of any meditative practice\u2014is our deeply conditioned habit of being distracted by thoughts. The problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking without knowing that we are thinking. In fact, thoughts of all kinds can be perfectly good objects of mindfulness. In the early stages of one\u2019s practice, however, the arising of thought will be more or less synonymous with distraction\u2014that is, with a failure to meditate. Most people who believe they are meditating are merely thinking with their eyes closed. (My italics) I have quoted this passage in full because I like Harris\u2019s in your face way of expressing himself but the glib statement that \u201cthoughts of all kinds can be perfectly good objects of mindfulness\u201d does not deserve a free pass. A typical meditation practice consists in focusing attention on the breath or on bodily sensations. With experience, one learns to avoid getting caught up in trains of thought by refocusing attention whenever thoughts (or feelings) arise by means of injunctions such as \u201cPay attention!\u201d, \u201cWatch it!\u201d, or \u201cLet it go!\u201d. Notice that these statements of intent are themselves thoughts. Insofar as we seek to obey them implicitly, we cannot be said to be mindful of these thoughts. Something quite unexpected happens if you take thoughts rather than the breath or bodily sensations as the focus of mindful attention. You find that mindfulness of thinking directly interferes with your ability to have any thoughts at all. (Thankfully, mindfulness of breathing will not cause you to stop breathing.) A likely neuroscientific explanation for this phenomenon is that passive thinking is a function of the Default Mode Network whereas attention is a function of the Task Positive Network. It is well known that these two networks are mutually inhibitory. Regardless of whether this explanation holds, an experienced meditator would find it easy to experiment with a practice based on mindfulness of thoughts. If you try to predict or merely observe your next thought, you will find that your mind goes blank temporarily. Do this for twenty minutes, dismissing each thought as soon as you are conscious of having verbalized it (the formula \u201cwhatever\u201d is an effective way of dismissing a thought), and you will have spent twenty minutes in a more-or-less thought-free state. If your purpose in meditating is to liberate yourself from the tyranny of passive thinking, you may be able to get results very quickly in this way. I don\u2019t know why this sort of practice is not more widely known or taught by meditation teachers. For a variant developed in a psychotherapeutic setting (\u201cWitness Thought Transformation\u201d) see Mastering Thought (Before It Masters You) by Mark Waller. As to why anybody would seek liberation from the \u201ctyranny of passive thinking\u201d, here is how David Foster Wallace puts it: That 99% of compulsive thinkers\u2019 thinking is about themselves; that 99% of this self-directed thinking consists of imagining and then getting ready for things that are going to happen to them; and then, weirdly, that if they stop to think about it, that 100% of the things they spend 99% of their time and energy imagining and trying to prepare for all the contingencies and consequences of are never good. In short that 99% of the head\u2019s thinking activity consists of trying to scare the everliving shit out of itself. (Infinite Jest)  ",
