            "answer_text": "The atomic number is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus. So if its atomic number is 13 we can be sure it has 13 protons. If the atom is not ionized, that is, if it has no net charge, then the number of electrons must be equal to the number of protons. The charges balance to zero. In that case the atom will have 13 electrons. That is a reasonable assumption, but not always true. Neutrons are tricky. For elements lighter than sodium (Atomic number 1\u201310) the number of neutrons will generally equal the number of protons in a stable isotope, but there are exceptions. For any element lighter than sodium it is a reasonable assumption that the number of neutrons will equal the number of protons. The number of extra neutrons keeps increasing as the atomic number increases. By the time you get to uranium there are about 50% extra neutrons. But since aluminum is heavier than sodium, it must have more neutrons than protons. Experience tells me that since it is only a few atomic numbers higher than sodium it probably only has one excess neutron, but you don't know for sure. You have to look it up. As it turns out, aluminum has an atomic mass of \u224827. Since 13 of them are protons, there must be 14 neutrons. ",

            "answer_text": "With atomic number you can be sure of the number of protons but not electrons and neutrons. Number of protons cannot be changed. But the same cannot be said for electrons and neutrons. A standard Al will have 13 protons and 13 electrons and particular number of neutrons. Al ions will have varying electrons and Al isotopes will have different number of neutrons. Hence with atomic number you can be sure about the number of protons. With charge you can be sure about the number of electrons. You need mass number to calculate the number of neutrons. ",
