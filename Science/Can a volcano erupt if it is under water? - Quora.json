            "answer_text": "Some volcanos do. The magma that has been flowing from Kilauea (in Hawaii) lately have created an example of a volcano eruption in the water just off the mainland. The top of the volcano is just peeking above the water lately. Other examples of a volcano erupting under water are found along the \u201cRing of Fire\", the most geologically active chained area in the world. One volcano has erupted as a sand mound near Japan and grown in height to several feet above the water. ",
