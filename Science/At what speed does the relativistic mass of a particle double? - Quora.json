            "answer_text": "This is a good question for relativistic mass increase demonstration with the speed of the mass. Any mass, not just a speeding proton will double at a certain speed which will be a certain fraction of c. You do not need the exact size of the mass to determine the speed, as doubling of the mass will make the rest mass cancel out in the equation as shown below : The relativistic mass equation is M = m/(1 - v^2/c^2)^1/2. So if a proton or any other mass is taken as m, then twice that mass would be 2m. Now solving for velocity v in the above equation gives you the following expression : v = c(1 - m^2/M^2)^1/2. So the equation becomes : v = c(1 - m^2/4m^2)^1/2, which works out to v = c(3/4)^1/2 = 0.866c ! Calculating it out further it gives a speed of 2.598 \u202210^8 m/s. This tells you that for any mass, whether a proton, or a neutrino, or a 1,000,000 Kg giant spaceship, for its mass to be doubled the mass would have to reach 0.866c in speed or a speed of 2.598 \u2022 10^8 m/s\u2026 Similarly relativistic speed for any degree of mass gain can be calculated whether tripled, quadrupled, or any higher value than the rest mass, and that mass can be lost fast also once speed goes back to 'normal speed' or zero speed. It is true mass gain due to increase in kinetic energy(adding mass), and mass loss(due to decrease in kinetic energy) back towards rest mass when speed slows down to zero\u2026 Kaiser T, MD(Life long physics, math, and science enthusiast).

            "answer_text": "The rest mass of particles doesn't change, even when they move. You can, however, consider how fast a particle needs to be going for its total relativistic energy to double. This energy includes both the energy from the rest mass and the kinetic energy of the particle. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the following expression:  E=p2c2+m2oc4\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221aE=p2c2+mo2c4 In this case, p is the relativistic momentum of the particle, c is the speed of light, and momois the rest mass of the particle. We can set this expression equal to twice the energy from the rest mass and then solve to find the speed we're looking for: E=p2c2+m2oc4\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a=2moc2E=p2c2+mo2c4=2moc2 p2c2+m2oc4=4m2oc4p2c2+mo2c4=4mo2c4 p2c2=3m2oc4p2c2=3mo2c4 p2=3m20c2p2=3m02c2 p=3\u2013\u221amocp=3moc Now, we need to convert from momentum to speed. At low speeds, momentum is approximately just the product of an object's velocity multiplied by its mass, but at relativistic ones it's given by: p=mov\u03b3=mov1\u2212v2c2\u221ap=mov\u03b3=mov1\u2212v2c2 Substituting this in, we get: p=mov1\u2212v2c2\u221a=3\u2013\u221amocp=mov1\u2212v2c2=3moc v=3\u2013\u221ac1\u2212v2c2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221av=3c1\u2212v2c2 v=3\u2013\u221ac2\u2212v2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221av=3c2\u2212v2 v2=3(c2\u2212v2)v2=3(c2\u2212v2) 4v2=3c24v2=3c2 v2=34c2v2=34c2 v=3/4\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221ac\u22480.866cv=3/4c\u22480.866c So, an object traveling at a speed of about 86.6% of the speed of light will have twice as much total relativistic energy as it does when it is stationary. Note that this answer doesn't depend on what object we're talking about. The answer is the same for other massive particles as well, not just electrons. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems that you are asking: \u201cAt what relative speed does the total mass [mTotal] of an object equal to twice its rest mass [mRest]?\u201d From hyperbolic functions we can immediately obtain the result. The important notion that we have to introduce here is the proper speed of an object, which we designate as vpr. That quantity has the function of an angle, and angles can be added. We remember from high-school trigonometry that the tangent function converts an angle to a slope. To convert a given value of the slope to an angle, we use the arctan function. An identical approach in hyperbolic functions uses the tanh and arctanh functions and can be employed to solve many of the problems that are posed. Therefore your question is answered as follows: (1) Express the mass equation in terms of vpr: mTotal = mRest*cosh(vpr/c) We set mTotal = 2 mRest, giving cosh(vpr/c) = 2, or vpr/c=arccosh(2) = 1.3169579 Finally, the usual speed is defined by converting the \u2018angle\u2019 vpr/c to conventional \u2018slope\u2019 form v/c by using the tanh function: v/c = tanh(1.3169579) = 0.8660254 ",

This is simple algebra, so I'll skip the steps a jump right to the solution: v=3\u221a2\u224886.6v=32\u224886.6. The complicated way: rest mass doesn't change. I know you weren't asking about rest mass; but I've excised the concept of relativistic mass from my lexicon, and I believe everyone else should, too; and without a distinction between rest mass and relativistic mass, I'm just going to use \u201cmass\u201d to mean what used to be called \u201crest mass\u201d. I might be willing to acknowledge that the concept of kinetic energy is still acceptable, in which case I can say that total energy equals intrinsic energy plus kinetic energy, or: mc2\u03b3=mc2+Ekineticmc2\u03b3=mc2+Ekinetic \u2026where mm is what used to be m0m0. We can ask at what speed kinetic energy equals intrinsic energy, which is another way of asking when the total energy is twice the intrinsic energy (if Ekinetic=mc2Ekinetic=mc2 then mc2\u03b3=2mc2mc2\u03b3=2mc2). From this, we easily get to \u03b3=2\u03b3=2 and this v=\u00bd3\u2013\u221av=\u00bd3. But chances are that if I'm not willing to accept the notion of relativistic mass, I'm also not willing to accept the above formula for energy. Instead, I'm going to insist that E=mc2E=mc2 is incomplete, and that the correct formula is: E2=(mc2)2+(pc)2E2=(mc2)2+(pc)2 \u2026where p=mv\u03b3p=mv\u03b3. I'm probably pushing this formula because it has a close connection to the concept of \u201cfour-momentum\u201d, a Relativistic notion that intrinsic energy can be thought of as the time component of a four-dimensional momentum vector. It's a very elegant concept, and definitely worth exploring in its own right; and it can be made to do the job here by rephrasing the original question appropriately. Check Aaron's\u200b answer for the worked solution using this approach. Bottom line, there may be conceptual purity in the latter approaches; but I don't think it's always worth the added hoops you have to jump through. ",

However, I\u2019d like to point out here that \u2018relativistic mass\u2019 is just a term developed by physicists to make it easier for students to understand relativity. This just helps us to have an intuitive idea why can\u2019t we travel through space faster than the speed of light. It basically says that as you travel faster, the relativistic mass increases and it becomes harder and harder to further increase the speed of the object. So this term has its pedagogical importance. However, it can be misleading sometimes. For example, if you say that the mass of the object increases as it travels at higher speed, you might plug this higher mass in the Newton\u2019s gravitational law and think that if this object passes near another massive object, it will experience more gravitational force due to its increased mass than it would otherwise at lower speeds. This is just not true. Therefore, the only true mass of an object is the one we measure in the rest frame of that object. ",

There was a very short period of time when Einstein considered the possibility that it might be useful to consider mass to be a quantity that depends on relative speed, but he soon abandoned this. Rather than simplifying the physics, taking relativistic mass as a valid concept makes the physics problematic in multiple ways. You might want to know the speed at which a particle\u2019s \u201cmass-energy\u201d is double its mass.

Einstein introduced relativistic mass into his equations to provide a reason why matter cannot exceed the speed of light. It is a false belief, because when mass phase changes to electromagnetic energy, mainly in the form of magnetic energy travelling at the speed of light and referred to as Gamma rays or a gravitation wave, it is the momentum that undergoes a relativistic phase change of state.
