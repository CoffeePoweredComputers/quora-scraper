            "answer_text": "For starters, we wouldn\u2019t be reading this on a computer screen. Fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas are attractive because of their energy density, meaning they deliver more energy per gram than wood, or animal dung, or peat, which is kind of a pre-fossil fuel. It would be very difficult to make steel without coal, and without steel it\u2019s difficult to make turbines for water power, wind power and steel structures needed for solar power. Without generous electricity, one cannot refine aluminum. Rail transport can be done with wood-fired locomotives, but you won\u2019t get far, or fast, and you\u2019re going to run out of wood pretty quickly if you\u2019re trying to build an industrial base. Without an industrial base, you cannot grow and ship enough food to support a large population. Plastics are made from oil and gas, so that avenue is closed. If you had an industrial civilization somewhere else, and could ship in the materials, you could skip fossil fuels and go directly to nuclear power. ",

            "answer_text": "This has been asked a few times before  Unfortunately still behind a paywall The industrial revolution as well as general scientific advancement would start in places with and would be severely constrained by the availability of cheap abundant energy. Without fossil fuels this means hydropower initially followed by maybe wind power to a small extent followed by fission. And even those would be limited as you need energy to make steel and concrete. Instead of coal rich England, the industrial revolution would be in places with a lot of hydro. Perhaps northen europe ff by north america. And it would be unable to spread rapidly, only at the pace at which dams and high voltage electricity grids are built. Instead of the British Empire, a scandanavian empire maybe maybe and one that is much smaller. CO2 emissions would of course be much reduced, countered by the much higher usage of biofuels including wood from cutting forests and all the CO2 release that entails. But most likely it would be a net reduction. Plastics would be rare expensive stuff made from biological raw material which is more valuable as biofuel or food. Speaking of food. Expect lesser population and more famines as you cannot use large amounts of energy all over the globe to increase food production, i.e. no farm mechanization, no artificial fertilizers, limited transport capability. Limited transport means a less global world, with transport near hydro regions by electric trains and transport outside via sailing ships and animal power. Expect a world many decades to a hundred or more years behind present day 2018 in tech terms. ",
