            "answer_text": "IVC = Intermediate Vocations Course: It contains computer science, electronics, electrical, MLT, dtc etc., IVC will give you 3options, after this you can join engineering or degree or diploma (second year directly). But There is one course in this called bridge which contains maths, physics and chemistry, you have to pass this course then only you can go to engineering or diplomacy else only degree is the option. Which means other than technical subjects you have to study extra subjects as a bridge to engineering and diploma. Intermediate: Depends on the group/branch you can chose engineer or MBBS etc etc., Example if you chose MPC further can study engineer, if you chose BiPC further can study MBBS Like that. ",
