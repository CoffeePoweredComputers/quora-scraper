            "answer_text": "If we enclose a liquid in a container, it establishes equilibrium with its vapour, i.e. some part of liquid constantly vapourises while some part of vapour condenses. When rate of condensation and vapourisation become equal, the pressure exerted by the vapour of liquid is called vapour pressure.  The figure (c) shows equilibrium state. On increasing temperature, vapour pressure increases. The temperature at which vapour pressure becomes equal to atmospheric temperature is its boiling point. Thus on increasing atmospheric pressure, vapour pressure too has to be increased and hence boiling point is elevated. ",

            "answer_text": "If the atmospheric pressure increases the boiling point of a liquid increases and if the atmospheric pressure decreases The boiling point also decreases as they are directly proportional to each other. so we use pressure cooker to increase the boiling point of water to cook food fast.

So if the pressure is increased, the vapor pressure needed to get a boiling liquid increases, and that happens at a higher temperature. ",
