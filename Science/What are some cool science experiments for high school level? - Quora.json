            "answer_text": "A tasty experiment to measure the speed of light[1] . Materials required: A microwave oven, a microwaveable ceramic plate, a piece of chocolate. Ever thought why microwaves are clumsy in evenly heating up food? Or why most of them have a turntable inside that rotates so that all portions are \u201cmicrowaved\u201d and heated properly? That\u2019s because the microwave oven uses electromagnetic waves.  Imagine the central line axis as the axis of a bread loaf. It will get heated up only in the spots where the red and blue waves intersect the axis. This is why we keep rotating the food on a turntable in the microwave so that it eventually gets heated up uniformly. Courtesy of Twitter user CentrlPotential (David Beradooooo)[2] who experimentally verified that this property can be used to find the speed of light! Microwave the chocolate for about 20 seconds. The chocolate starts to melt in a wavy fashion.   Now, measure the distance between these two waves. These are the adjacent points where the wave pierces the chocolate. Meaning, that distance is half the wavelength of the electromagnetic (EM) wave used by the machine. That is, twice that distance is the wavelength (=12 cm) Most microwaves have their EM frequencies rated behind them. Now, use the equation: velocity = frequency*wavelength.   And voila! You have estimated the velocity of light to an accuracy of 98%!! Pretty cool, right?  PS: All pictures are taken from the original Twitter post.
