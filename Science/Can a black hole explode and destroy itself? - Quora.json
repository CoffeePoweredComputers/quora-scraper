            "answer_text": "The leading theory right now is that they evaporate through Hawking radiation, the other theory suggesting black holes could explode is known as the Quantum Bounce. To quote Nature regarding Quantum Bounce theory : The theory suggests that the transition from black hole to white hole would take place right after the initial formation of the black hole, but because gravity dilates time, outside observers would see the black hole lasting billions or trillions of years or more, depending on its size. If the authors are correct, tiny black holes that formed during the very early history of the Universe would now be ready to pop off like firecrackers and might be detected as high-energy cosmic rays or other radiation. In fact, they say, their work could imply that some of the dramatic flares commonly considered to be supernova explosions could in fact be the dying throes of tiny black holes that formed shortly after the Big Bang. Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity predicts that when a dying star collapses under its own weight, it can reach a stage at which the collapse is irreversible and no known force of nature can stop it. This is the formation of a black hole: a spherical surface, known as the event horizon, appears, shrouding the star inside from outside observers while it continues to collapse, because nothing \u2014 not even light or any other sort of information \u2014 can escape the event horizon. Because dense matter curves space, \u2018classical\u2019 general relativity predicts that the star inside will continue to shrink into what is known as a singularity, a region where matter is infinitely dense and space is infinitely curved. In such situations, the known laws of physics cease to be useful. Many physicists, however, believe that at some stage in this process, quantum-gravity effects should take over, arresting the collapse and avoiding the infinities. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a phenomenon caused by quantum fluctuations which can be seen as a pair of virtual particles pop into existence then annihilate each other because their charges are opposite to one another and the energy they carry will ultimately return to the fabric of space. However, in extreme cases such as at the event horizon, some pairs of virtual particles can pop into existence right at the border and travel at opposite directions, if one of them head directly outward and has enough velocity, it can escape from the edge of the black hole and its gravitation while the another one is trapped by the black hole, extreme gravitation between inside and outside the event horizon is enough to kept them apart. But since the two particles are seemingly created out of nothing, the black hole now owe a debt in energy worth of the escaped particles, as the bill come due, the black hole pay such bill by losing mass. The escaped particles are known as \u201cHawking radiation\u201d which come in various forms, preferably subatomic particles such as quarks and photons. Hawking radiation will happen until the black hole lost all its mass, at that very moment, the black hole will spectacularly explode into boxes of subatomic confetti flying into the space. However, the rate of hawking radiation is so slow in larger black hole that a black hole with the mass of the Sun will only completely evaporate into hawking radiation in 10^64 years, which is the reason why we have never observed such phenomenal bursting yet. PS. \u201ccan be seen\u201d in the first line means that those virtual particles are actually waves in quantum fields that neutralize each other in normal spaces but unable to do so in warped space like that of a black hole, resulting in non zero net amount of pulses of wave coming out of the event horizon. Since I\u2019m not enrolled in formal quantum theories classes, I might be terribly wrong. It would be highly appreciated if someone correct this for me. ",

            "answer_text": "By its very nature, a black hole cannot explode.  As of yet, science can't fully explain what happens in a black hole, only approximate it.  Physics as we know it breaks down near them, light can't escape and the larger they get, the more intense a hold they have on everything around them.  They are the greedy hoarders of the universe and they like to keep what they take. Given this, no matter what you feed them or do to them, they just keep getting bigger. Stephen Hawking theorized that they do, however, radiate a certain energy.  This is called, appropriately enough, Hawking Radiation.  This means that small black holes, given enough time and with no feeding at all, can literally evaporate away, but they have to be small and it can take billions of years. As for the Big Bang, no one is actually sure of what it was that became the universe.  There is much speculation and many ideas (String Theory for one), but they are really just intelligent guesses.  In lieu of a better explanation, the thing that became the universe is called the \"singularity\", meaning it is a point with no dimensions.  This term is also used to describe black holes, but does not constitute a relationship in any way.  Math can describe what happened fractions of a moment after the inflation of the singularity began, but not the initial state. ",

By the end they might end their lives by transforming into their exact opposite \u2014 'white holes' that explosively pour all the material they ever swallowed into space. The theory suggests that the transition from black hole to white hole would take place right after the initial formation of the black hole, but because gravity dilates time.

Many physicists, however, believe that at some stage in this process, quantum-gravity effects should take over, arresting the collapse and avoiding the infinities. Also the physics of the Universe breaks down in General Relativity. Also have been theorizated that hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. Hawking radiation is such a small effect that it has never been measured. Micro black holes (MBHs) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes (and should thus shrink and dissipate faster) ",

But lowering mass will definitely lead to a blast. Most likely \u2014 but we do not know yet this for sure \u2014 black hole inside (center core) has neutrino gas and a sphere of electron gas right under accretion disk. If that is true, then big asymmetric gravity (like two-three other black holes approaching) may cause electron-neutrino blast and black hole will evaporate. Also black hole own mass reduction to about 2x value of our Sun mass will brake gravity lock condition (gravity forces becoming weak compare to electrical) and black hole will blast radiating electrons and neutrino. Evaporation time for the smallest known black hole is unrealistic though. ",
