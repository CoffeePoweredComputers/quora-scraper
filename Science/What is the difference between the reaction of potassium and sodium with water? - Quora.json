            "answer_text": "First difference: Potassium reacts more vigourously and explosively with water while Sodium reacts less violently with water when compared to potassium. Second difference: Although both Group I metals form metal hydroxides when reacted with water, however, they form Sodium Hydroxide (for sodium metal) and hydrogen gas, and potassium hydroxide(for potassium metal) and hydrogen gas respectively.

            "answer_text": "The reaction of potassium metal with water is far more VIGOROUS than the reaction between water, and sodium metal\u2026. [math]K(s) + H_{2}O(l) \\longrightarrow KOH(aq) + \\dfrac{1}{2}H_{2}(g)\\uparrow[/math] SMALL quantities of sodium metal, when added to water, will react vigorously, but you are unlikely to see flames. Addition of potassium WILL produce flames, especially when the dihydrogen combusts\u2026 And I hope you have seen these reactions in the laboratory\u2026 With ethyl alcohol, you can destroy LARGE masses of sodium metal with reasonable safety according to the reaction\u2026 [math]H_{3}C-CH_{2}OH(l) +Na(s) \\longrightarrow H_{3}C-CH_{2}O^{-}Na^{+} +\\dfrac{1}{2}H_{2}(g)\\uparrow[/math] You do not attempt this with potassium metal \u2026 a fire will result \u2026 other strategies are employed to destroy potassium residues\u2026 ",
