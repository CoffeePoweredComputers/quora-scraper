            "answer_text": "Additional thoughts to add to the photon emission discussion. Plasma exists in 3 modes dark, glow and arc. Light is only emitted in the glow and arc modes, fluorescent tubes operate in the glow mode, employing the fluorescence properties of the tube coating to create bright light. If enough energy is supplied plasma will form an arc discharge which is an intense light source. Probably what is happening on the Sun\u2019s photosphere surface. My own limited experience of arc plasma is as a cinema projectionist. In the old days we used carbon arcs which were electrically driven to keep a set distance apart. The replacement which is used everywhere now is the zenon arc lamp. Again I must emphasise that the only reliable means of energising plasma is via electricity. That goes for cinema projectors and stars. ",

            "answer_text": "Plasmas are gases that are hot enough that the atoms are ionized - the electrons and the positively charged ions all mix together, but the ions remain charged. Periodically, for a short time, an electron will rejoin an ion. As it falls into its spot, a photon is released that is equal to the energy that was released by the electron in this transition. If this photon is in the visible range, then we can see it. In fluorescent lights, there is a plasma where the photons emitted are in the UV range. The glass tubes are coated with phosphors that absorb the UV light and emit visible light. The photons that are emitted when an electron drops into a lower energy shell around an atom are called Xrays.  ",
