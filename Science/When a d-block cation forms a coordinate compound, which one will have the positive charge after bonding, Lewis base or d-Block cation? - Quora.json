            "answer_text": "When a d-block cation forms a coordinate compound, which one will have the positive charge after bonding, Lewis base or d-Block cation? A co-ordinate complex is formed by the insertion of lone pairs of electrons on the ligand into the vacant d orbitals of the central metal ion (or metal). No electron exchange occurs under the normal understanding of the process, although sometimes a water ligand may dissociate to form an OH^(-) ligand with the loss of a proton - this is NOT charge from the central metal ion but ionisation of water under the influence of the electric field DUE TO the charge on the central ion. The charge on the ion (and hence its oxidation state) remain the same and positive. ",

            "answer_text": "An interesting question. Strictly, for a Lewis acid-base adduct, some of the positive charge is transferred from the cation to the base. You can see this if you look at the acidity of aqua complexes. Those of M(III) cations are quite acidic:  This is still a simplistic approach. For a coordination compound, if you use crystal field theory, the assumption is a 100% ionic interaction and the question does not arise. The cation retains its charge and oxidation state. If you use molecular orbital theory, again the question does not arise as the charge is spread out over the entire molecule. ",
