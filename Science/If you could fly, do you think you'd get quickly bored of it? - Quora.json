            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for this fun A2A! If I were given the ability to fly, I know that I would never, ever get bored of it. First of all, I have to go to school everyday. Why take the 40-minute long bus ride to school when I can fly there in a matter if minutes? It lets me wake up later, eat for longer, and finish up any homework three minutes before heading out. I can also fly anywhere to buy anything I want: food, clothes, games. Heading out, there\u2019s no need for a front door, when I can just shoot-out the window! My lazy butt would take advantage of this skill every hour! But lastly, and most importantly, I can travel anywhere I want, everyday. If I don\u2019t lose any energy while flying, I can read a book or play games while traveling across the world. EXAMPLE! It\u2019s July 18, the middle of summer break. I don\u2019t want to study today, don\u2019t feel like playing games\u2026. Ah! I should go to the Grand Canyon in Arizona!    I should be back my dinner! *flies to America* *tours Grand Canyon* *bored so comes back to Korea* See how easy it is to travel? The next day I could go to Greece, the next I go to Japan, the next I go to Tanzania. I can\u2019t travel much because, you know, *m o n e y*, but money would hardly be a problem if I could fly! It would normally cost about $500\u2013600 to ride a plane to Arizona. Flying to the grand canyon would cost absolutely 0 dollars! Thanks for reading, and if you liked it, please hit that upvote (\u2312\u25bd\u2312) ",

            "answer_text": "If I could fly, I would amuse myself with aerial photography often and lavishly. And while there may be legislation in place against flying drones over people\u2019s properties, there is none about flying civilians.  It would probably also be a much nicer workout than jogging, and it would totally beat the treadmill. ",
