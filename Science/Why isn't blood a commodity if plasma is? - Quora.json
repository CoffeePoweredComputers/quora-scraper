            "answer_text": "Hospitals do charge the patient for blood. There has to be a charge to cover collection and processing costs. Most blood banks are nonprofits however and most plasma centers are for profit companies but not always. Blood banks that collect whole blood for transfusion process the unit of blood by separating the plasma and platelets from the unit leaving what is referred to as packed red cells. This nearly doubles the shelf life of the red cells and provides much needed platelets for patients and the plasma they sell to the same plasma fractionation companies that buy and collect plasma from plasma centers. This also helps the blood banks recover operational costs and helps out the plasma supply. As for the donation it comes down to synantics really. Blood banks say their donors are volunteer only but find creative ways to entice and compensate their donors. Plasma centers also consider their donors as volunteers but openly compensate them monetarily for their time spent at the center. Plasma donation takes much longer than a whole blood donation so without the compensation for that extra time there would be a major shortage in the life saving drugs that are made from plasma. ",
