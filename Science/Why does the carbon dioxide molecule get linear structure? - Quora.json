            "answer_text": "CO2 has a linear structure because it has no lone pair electron.The Lewis structure, carbon is bond by double bond oxygen making it two pairs electron. Water (H20) is bent not linear because hydrogen has a lone pair electron. Methane (CH4) is tetrahedral of carbon bond with four hydrogen NH3 is trigonal pyramidal, Nitrogen is having a lone pair electron. However, it was proven by some books that NH3 is tetrahedral as it has the ability to move the lone pair electron from its original state. ",
