            "answer_text": "Pavlov\u2019s experiment. Pavlov was a Russian psychologist, and the developer of classical conditioning. His experiment started out as a research into the salivation of dogs as they were being fed. Midway through, he realized that the dogs actually started salivating before they even saw their food. In fact, they would begin to salivate every time their feeder stepped in the room. He started to wonder about the conection between the feeder and the salivation, and discovered that the dogs had learned to associate the person with the food, and thus discovered conditioning. As soon as he realized the importance of this discovery, he set out to further research. He began to sound a bell each time he fed the dogs, for days on end. Eventually, he just sounded the bell, and found that the dogs salivated exactly the same, even though no food was present. He had found the conection between a neutral stimulus (the bell) and a biological response (salivation), which went on to earn him the 1904 Medicine Nobel Prize.   And why is this important? Because we\u2019re all conditioned, one way or another, in our daily lives. Conditioning is why you associate red with danger, pink with \u201cgirly\u201d, and a broken glass noise with actual broken glass. Conditioning is known for it\u2019s potential uses for \u201cevil\u201d, as was explored in Aldous Huxley\u2019s novel \u201cBrave New World\u201d. In the book, it was used as a tool of indoctrination, as children were played the same movie night after night, and conditioned to repeat it whenever doubt sprouted in their heads; it was used to maintain the caste system.

            "answer_text": "There are many but two stick in my mind. First is the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887. This has gone down as the most famous experiment of all time that came up with a negative result. Basically, they were trying to measure the ether that everyone thought was the medium through electromagnetic waves were transmitted through. Since they also assumed that the Earth was travelling through the ether, they decided if they transmitted light at different angles relative to the ether, the difference in lightspeed would reveal information about the ether. Unfortunately, they discovered that it didn\u2019t matter which direction light was transmitted, the speed of light was found to be constant. The end result of the experiment was the special theory of relativity in 1905 when Einstein realised the implications of this negative result. Michelson\u2013Morley experiment The second one for me was performed Alain Aspect in 1982 to test Bell\u2019s Inequality which had been derived in the 1960\u2019s by John Bell to resolve an argument between Einstein & Bohr over the fundamental nature of Quantum Mechanics. The experiment showed that Bell\u2019s inequality was being violated and thus Bohr was right and Einstein. See the link for more details but one of the consequences of this is that teleportation (a la Star Trek) has actually been achieved already at the individual particle level and it will be interesting to see if it is possible to build a full transporter.

It was the best and easiest series of experiments I have ever experienced. It was smooth sailing from end to end. I have never had a similar experience since. Smooth sailing. And because it was such smooth sailing I oddly do not remember much of it. A boring but loved experience. And it occupies a very small section of my lab books. ",

If you take a light source and illuminate a piece of paper with two holes in close proximity and look at the image that\u2019s formed, you\u2019ll see an interference pattern instead of a projection of the two holes. This simple, elegant experiment provided convincing proof that light had wave-like properties. It began a revolution that would eventually lead us to Maxwell\u2019s equations and quantum mechanics. There have been many game changers over the centuries, but this one sticks out the most. I\u2019ll also throw in the Eddington\u2019s measurement of starlight deflection in 1919. Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity predicted that large masses would deflect light. Eddington measured that deflection during a solar eclipse, thereby providing supporting evidence for Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. ",

Galvani found that the legs of a dead frog twitched when a machine which created static electricity was turned on in the laboratory. He then went on to see that an electric current passing directly through the leg of a frog caused it to twitch. Galvani correctly concluded that some form of electricity must run through the body in order to \u2018power\u2019 it and make it move. It is not only an important physical and biological discovery, but it was also the event that inspired Mary Shelley to write her famous Frankenstein after hearing of Galvani\u2019s work. It therefore had impacts in science and literature. For another famous experiment, see Flor Diaz\u2019s excellent answer. ",
