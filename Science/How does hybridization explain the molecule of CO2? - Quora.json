            "answer_text": "The carbon atom needs to hybridize itself into 4 sp orbitals, each orbital needs to have 50% s character and 50% p character in order for the bond to be linear. The oxygen then hybridizes its 2 half full p orbitals and its full 2s orbital into 2 sp orbitals. They would look like this Carbon1s2, 2sp4 oxygen 1s2, 2sp2,2p4 The more electronegative atom when two approach for bonding wins, by wins I mean it controls what happens. So there are 2 oxygens that each needs 2 electrons, they will do as little work as necessary to make that happen. What they will do is promote 1 2s2 electron to the p orbital leaving a half full 2s orbital and a half full 2p orbital which hybridize to form 2 2sp orbitals. The carbon simultaneously promotes 1 of its 2s2 electrons into the p orbital leaving each orbital in the second shell half full, these will hybridize into 4 2sp orbitals. Let me know if that helps at all. ",

            "answer_text": "In its ground state carbon has the electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p2. You can consider one of the 2s electrons to be excited to fill the other empty 2p orbital to give a configuration of 1s2 2s1 2p3. Each 2p orbital, 2px 2py and 2pz now hold one electron. The 2s and one of the 2p orbitals, say the 2px can hybridize and form 2 sp hybrid orbitals which lie along the x axis.  Oxygen has the electron configuration 1s2 2s2 2p4. Two of the 2p orbitals, say the 2px and the 2pz only hold one electron. The 2px can now overlap with one of the sp hybrids from the carbon to form a \u03c3 bond. The 2pz can now overlap with the unhybridized 2pz on the carbon to form a \u03c0 bond.  The same thing can happen on the other side of the carbon forming another \u03c3 bond with oxygen\u2019s 2pz and a \u03c0 bond with the 2py orbitals from each atom. Anyway, that\u2019s the theory even though hybridization isquantum mechanically unsound. ",
