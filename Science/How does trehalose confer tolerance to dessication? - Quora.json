            "answer_text": "Of all the broad types of molecules in a cell, proteins are by far the most delicate. A protein's function is (to a very good approximation) entirely dependent on its shape and structure; these are established and maintained by a network of thousands of weak intra- and inter-molecular interactions. The majority of these interactions are dependent on water -- the parts of the protein that face outwards do so because they're capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules, while the parts of the protein that face inwards cannot (and thus, are energetically favored to interact with each other, instead of water molecules.)  If you take away all or most of the water in a cell, many of the forces that hold delicate protein molecules in their functional shapes will disappear, causing the proteins to lose their \"folded\" structures and adopt conformations that not only aren't functional, but are also liable to form aggregates with other similarly afflicted molecules. What makes this particularly problematic for desiccation is that, once formed, many of these aggregates are irreversible. So, even if a dried out (yet unprotected) cell is put back into a wet environment, the damage done by desiccation can't be fixed.    Trehalose. There are some molecules that, when present at very high concentrations (~5-10% of the cell's wet mass!), can protect a cell during long periods of desiccation. Trehalose, which is a type of sugar molecule, is one of these. The precise molecular mechanisms of how it acts as a desiccation protectant are unknown, but here's a reasonable idea:   Trehalose, like most sugars, is capable of forming a glassy, amorphous solid when dried out. This means that, instead of forming periodic crystals (that would look similar to the crystalline form of table sugar), they instead have a \"random\" structure with individual molecules of sugar oriented in a lot of different directions. This is the key, because it ensures that delicate proteins (which depend heavily on interacting with water for their structure!) are surrounded by a solid material that has hydroxyl groups (the -OH parts of the molecule above) pointing in every direction.  The hydroxyl groups of sugar are capable of forming the same sorts of weak interactions with the surface of protein molecules that liquid water molecules are -- they're essentially forming the same sorts of hydrogen bonds that are present in aqueous solutions. So, the material that all of the proteins in a desiccated cell are encased in retains the same sort of interactions that would be present in a normal cell -- which prevents catastrophic unfolding and aggregation of protein molecules.  Thus, when conditions become wet again, the trehalose amorphous solid can be redissolved, and the proteins present are close enough to their \"correct\" structures that they can refold and function once again.
