It is a place where we are far enough away from our sun that we are not a ball of fire, and close enough to our sun that we are not a ball of ice. Don't think that this is even remotely common. It is so rare we haven't found it again. And as far as we we know, with the maybe exception of silicon based life, which seems ridiculous given the abundance of carbon in the universe, we are pretty unique, but we have limited vision. It is likely that we, given the size of what we can see, are one in a million, or more. With lots of other water planets. ",
