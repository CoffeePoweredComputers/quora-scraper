            "answer_text": "An analogy is useful to answer this question. Think of an atom as an apartment building with several floors. Electrons are the \u201cinhabitants\u201d of this building. Each floor is a \u201cshell\u201d and rooms are \u201corbitals\u201d. There are different types of rooms (orbitals) in each floor (shell) - each type of room in a floor is a \u201csubshell\u201d. Below is how it would look in the apartment renting lingo: First Floor (Shell 1): Room Types (S subshell), Rooms (one S orbital), total rooms (orbitals) in first floor:1Second Floor (Shell 2):Room Types (S Subshell, P subshell), Rooms (one S orbital, three P orbitals), total rooms (orbitals) in second floor:4Third Floor (Shell 3): Room types (S Subshell, P susbshell, D subshell), Rooms (one S orbital, three P orbitals, five D orbitals):total rooms (orbitals) in third floor:9etc.The landlord of this apartment building (Aufbau) does not allow more than two electrons to live in each room (orbital). From this apartment analogy we see that orbitals are the \u201crooms\u201d the inhabitants (electrons) \u201clive\u201d in and a subshell is just the type of room in a floor. Moreover, which \u201crooms\u201d the electrons live in determines the hustle and bustle of the buildings\u2019 activities (i.e., electron configuration). ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, orbitals and sub shells are different things. Outside the atomic nucleus, electrons reside in certain places and structures depending on 4 quantum numbers: the principle quantum number, the azimuthal quantum number, the magnetic quantum number and finally the spin quantum number. The principle quantum number (I will use qn to denote quantum number) determines the energy and therefore the shell that an electron resides in (I\u2019m sure you know the electrons further from the nucleus have more energy as they have a higher principle qn). Electrons with the same principle qn are in the same shell. This is important. The azimuthal or angular momentum qn determines the shape and orbital angular momentum of a orbital given a certain principle qn. Electrons the same azimuthal qn are in the same subshell. Note: T he electron itself does not have this angular momentum, it is part of the subshell with this angular momentum. The third qn is the magnetic qn. This determines the spatial orientation of an orbital depending on the previous 2 qns. Electrons with the same magnetic qn are in the same orbital. Note: the electron itself does not have this magnetic qn, but is part of the orbital with this magnetic qn. Finally, the 4th qn is the spin qn. Spin in this context means intrinsic angular momentum. It determines the orientation of spin of an electron itself. It is an inexplicable fundamentality of nature. There are two electrons per orbital and no two electrons can have the same spin, either spin up or down. You may be wondering how this relates to you question. Well, the question sort of doesn\u2019t make sense, because subshells define orbitals. Orbitals are described by two components: a number that is the principle qn and a letter that is a subshell. Take the 3s orbital. The s refers to the azimuthal qn and the the 3 means the principle qn. There is only one of these types of orbitals, and it contains 2 electrons each with the same magnetic qn and either spin up or spin down. Have a look at the table in this link and things will be clearer. Quantum Numbers, Atomic Orbitals, and Electron Configurations ",
