            "answer_text": "YES you can but you can\u2019t be completely sure that the indications which I am going to share is one hundred percent correct. Wierd sounds during callsIn case you hear wierd sounds like distant and static voices or clicking sounds. It can be an indication of someone tapping your phone. However this is not normal with modern networks.They work on a digital network and thus hearing of weird sounds is next to impossible. But still you can hear fragmentary voices and thus there can be a possibility of a tapping software installed. Decrease in capacity of the batteryThe decrease in the capacity of the battery is another great indication of a tapped mobile phone. Any tapped mobile phone will be recording all your activities and be transmitting them to a third party device. This will mean an increase in the usage of your cell phone battery and the battery will be losing life much faster Your Cell Phone take long to shut downAny cell phone will always have to complete any task it was performing before it shuts down. In case your mobile device has been transmitting data to someone, it will need more time to complete the process before it can shut down. This will make it take longer time to turn off especially when you have just sent a text message, received a call, an email or after web browsing. There are chances it could be sending data to a third party device. The Battery Temperature risesThe temperature of your cell phone battery can also be a good indicator that your cell phone has been tapped. In case the phone feels warm when you have not used it, there are chances that, it has been transmitting data to a third party device. When you are Receiving Usual SMS messagesAre you receiving weird text messages that contain characters, symbols or random numbers? In case such a thing happens more often, there are chances that your phone might be tapped. Increase in Data UsageThere is cell phone spy software that uses extra data in order to rely information that has been collected from your mobile phone. Hence, it is advisable that you look out for unexplained increase in the usage of data in your phone. These reasons can tell you a lot about your phone tapping but they can\u2019t be releied upon.

            "answer_text": "If it is your government, police or security services and you live in a modern country? You can't know, modern exchanges are digital and tapping your call is just a matter of copying data bits. If you are worried about illegal taps by other people they are often imperfect and you sometimes hear a click but even hearing a click doesn't mean much, that could be caused by something else. If it is a cell phone? No chance of you detecting it because cell calls are digital. It is possible to intercept cell calls with expensive equipment and skill, or with a legal process and cooperation of the phone company. ",
