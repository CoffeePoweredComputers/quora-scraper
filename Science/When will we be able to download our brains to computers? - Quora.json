            "answer_text": "We can begin by assuming that we can simply save all of the atoms in our brain, and the location of them. Then, we\u2019ll basically have a giant grid of\u2026 well\u2026 brain. If we can put it in stasis (that\u2019ll probably take some time to happen) and be able to analyze the location of each atom, then we can download the brain itself. One human brain has a few trillion TRILLION atoms, and contain x, y, and z coordinates, so it\u2019ll take around\u2026 Based on the extreme precision you\u2019ll need to get, it\u2019ll take probably a googol of bytes. Information compression will probably make that possible to store reasonably, around 2300. So this method will be possible, maybe around 2400. Here\u2019s another idea: Storing the brain cells and their states. In case we can\u2019t get there quickly, we can always sequence the human genome, and compress it in a rather small fragment of a solid state drive. It can be stored rather easily. SD cards are awesome! Plus, we can make a model of the brain cell, and map a few points that tell us where the cells are. This time, we don\u2019t need to be as precise, and we can store where a human brain is by cell in a few yottabytes. However, the technology of doing that will mean that it won\u2019t be possible until the distant future. So\u2026 sorry. Oh yeah, and you can also just TELL your computer, write a diary there, do all of the uploading yourself, and use the crude interface called a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. That\u2019ll do it. So you can do it right now. But if you want it to be perfect, and create an interface where the computers do the work, instead of you, you can wait for neuroscience to find a way to know what the heck the electrical impulses mean, in a precise way. I\u2019d say that computers will only be able to read your mind without you telling them what is in it around 2200, long after you die (unless something weird happens), or even later. But you never know\u2026 Technology might surprise you. ",

            "answer_text": "Top of the line MRI scanners have a resolution of 1000 neurons. And even if you could scan down to individual neurons, you have a problem. Each neuron has a unique genome and we don't know why yet. Also, each synapse is tagged by protein markers. We know synapses can be torn down and replaced, we also know they can amplify/suppress signals, but if that's stored in the markers, we don't yet know how. In principle, the deadline 2040 deadline set by a Russian inventor for downloading his own brain is doable, but it will take serious investment and a gallon or two of luck. A much more likely approach will be to go for nanotech or surgery. Instead of scanning the brain remotely, tag the DNA so you can separate it out, slice the brain up, scan each slice, extract and sequence the changes to the DNA, then reassemble computationally. It's messier, but we know we can photograph individual cells and synapses. Explore | EyeWire Although this is called a game, you actually are tracing real mouse neurons. It will give you an idea of the complexity of the problem. It will also help researchers get closer to downloading brains. That's part of what their research is for. ",
