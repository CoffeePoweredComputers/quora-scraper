            "answer_text": "Spiritual rebirth has NOTHING WHATSOEVER in common with those stories about spirituality. All of them are connected with either a deity or the Universe. None of them focuses on YOU. Real spiritual rebirth starts with you and ends with you. YOU are the GOAL of it. You may make a certain impact on other people, the nature or even the Universe, but it is not THEM that your spirituality or your spiritual birth depends on. They are just the field, your spirituality will be manifested for a short time, as long as you are in this Reality. But spirituality is not about them, it doesn\u2019t start with them, it doesn\u2019t end with them, it isn\u2019t focused on them and it doesn\u2019t depend on them. Spirituality is not about A SPIRIT outside of you, that would lead you into a better life or a better future. No, spirituality is about YOU BECOMING A \u201cSPIRIT\u201d. Spirituality doesn\u2019t mean that you are supposed to become one with SOMEONE ELSE - be it other people, God or the Universe. No, spirituality means that you are supposed to become one with YOURSELF. Not divided inwardly, as all people are from the moment on when they get born, but WHOLE. And that \u201cwhole\u201d doesn\u2019t mean a unity of body, Psyche and Spirit, but SPIRIT THAT CAN MANIFEST ITSELF THE WAY IT WANTS. Spirituality starts with YOU, is focused on YOU, and its goal is to make you capable of CREATING YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL REALITY. ",

            "answer_text": "consider Adi Shankar and Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. while coming down and live, which one should hold? either you should hold Bhakti or Vidyaahama. without this you cannot come back and live. /Because other objects like Karma, Jnana, Bhakti and rajayoga gets burnt, even no ashes. Adi shankar depended on vidya aham for living. Sri ramakrishna Paramahamsa living on both vidya aham and bhakti. when you get inside of you, means i of you, at core nothing is there except self or atma or Brahma. To reach there living seed of this living and next birth living to be burnt. Once burnt there is no chance from coming down from atma. When target is reached there is no useful content left over to come down the life. Some people inspired by atma or Brahma or God, by his direction live to uplift the disciple only. This is like splitting the banana plant. reaching core this is like cutting mango fruit, reach to its seed. \u201csanyasta Khila Karmani Prasavandya Prayantnitah\u201d sanyasi first become depregnated, means \u201caprasurvandya\u201d in sankrit, means kills the seeds of this birth, as well as of future birth, once done the self or atma remains. it is like colorless light. he reaches the core of atma or Brahma. Once reached there, there is no taste, no sex, no desire, it is blank, no content. Once reached their the yogi die hanging there, with in twenty one days. for coming down from the core is called re-pregnancy, prasurvandya means holding greed of the creation and coming down to living.
