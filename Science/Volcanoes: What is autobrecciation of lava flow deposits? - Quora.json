            "answer_text": "Yes, the level of autobrecciation is related to the velocity of the flow and the relative cooling of the lava. It occurs when the lava cools at the surface rapidly but is broken apart and engulfed by its significantly less viscous inner core. The repeated fragmentation and resorption is autobrecciation. And it is beautiful to watch. ",
