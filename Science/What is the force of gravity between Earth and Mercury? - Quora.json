            "answer_text": "Pls.. search on Google the mass of mercury and earth and distance between them and the value of \u201cG\u201d and put them in the law by Newton of gravity as in this whole universe everything attracts or repel each other and gave a relation : F= GmM/(D*D) Where : F is force , G is gravitational constant, m and M are masses of planets and D is the distance between those planets. Pls do the calculations and get the appropriate force between these two planets By the way there is another law just same as above one called coulomb's law. If you don't know about it go on Google and study it. If you're interested. ",
