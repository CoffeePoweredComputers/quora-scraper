            "answer_text": "Cane Toad(Rhinella marina ), also known as the giant neotropical toad or marine toad, is a large, terrestrial true toad which is native to South and mainland Middle America , but has been introduced to various islands throughout Oceania and the Caribbean , as well as northern Australia. It is a member of the genus Rhinella, but was formerly in the genus Bufo, which includes many different true toad species found throughout Central and South America. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among anurans , of both dead and living matter. ",
