            "answer_text": "The reason black holes are called black holes is because we cannot see into them past the event horizon.  In fact as any object falls into the black hole we will never even see the object get to the event horizon.  It turns out the strong gravity of black holes results in the appearance of time passing more slowly on the object for an observer who is watching the object fall down to the horizon.  This is the gravitational time dilation which is a well measured and understood effect even here on the earth. One effect of the gravitational time dilation that we would observe for objects falling into the black hole is that the light we will see gets shifted to lower frequencies (red shifted) and will also become less intense.  So if there were a blue light laser on the object falling in, it will appear to shift down the spectrum to red, then to infrared, microwave frequencies and finally radio frequencies.  In effect the objects falling into the black hole become blacker and blacker as they approach the event horizon. Another effect of the gravitational time dilation is that for an observer watching an object fall into the black hole it will take forever for the object to \"reach\" the event horizon.  So the object falling into the black hole will get blacker and blacker and take forever to reach the event horizon as seen by observers outside the black hole. On the other hand if you are sitting in the space ship which is falling into the black hole, you will not notice anything unusual as you approach and pass the event horizon.  However as you approach the center of the black hole you will get torn apart by gravitational singularity there. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers have to do with what you would see from the outside, and they're correct. You wouldn't see anything straight on, but you would probably see things behind the black hole due to gravitational lensing. However, if you fell through, what would you see? It would depend on where you turned your head. For about a hemisphere (more the deeper you are in), well, you'd still see nothing, but what would you see if you could see anything? You'd see the singularity, no matter where you looked. As you turned your head, though, the singularity would be closer or farther away, until at the edge of the hemisphere, it would appear to be at infinity. Still, what would you see in the other hemisphere (or less)? That's a puzzle. Geometrically, it would seem that you could see the entire universe outside the black hole. But when? Would it be a blur of the entire future history of the universe? And think of this. An outside observer would never see you fall in. Yet things do fall in. Furthermore, the outside observer would see the black hole evaporate by Hawking radiation and explode before they saw you fall in. So, for the outside, the death of the black hole would happen before you fell in. The time dilation is real; it isn't just an illusion, and this would seem a paradox.  What does this mean for time? Would time wrap around, so you would see the birth of the universe? If I had a terminal illness, I think I'd try it, but I wouldn't be able to tell you what I saw. ",
