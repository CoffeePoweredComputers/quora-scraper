            "answer_text": "What has been written here about what enzymes do is correct and helpful but your question why does an enzymatic reaction stop if the enzyme is inhibited. Enzyme inhibtion means the enzyme that catalyzes a certain process is prevented from occurring. What an enzyme does can be summarized by the reaction below: E + S -> [ES] -> [EP} -> E + P This a scheme where the enzyme (E) binds a substrate (S) to form the enzyme-substrate complex [ES]. The enzyme does its stuff and converts S to the product (P) to give the enzyme-product complex [EP] and then the enzyme releases the product to regenerate the enzyme. (Note that the enzyme is acting like a catalyst in that converts a S to P which would not otherwise happen and is regenerated at the end of the process.) There are compounds that can bind to an enzyme like S but the enzyme cannot convert them to P. These compounds are called inhibitors (I) and they just sit in the enzyme because they bind and just stay there. E + I -> [EI] -> no reaction At the same time, if I binds more tightly, S can\u2019t get in. Of course, the E+S and E+I binding is reversible (usually) so sometimes S will sometimes find its way in so I will just slow the process. There are some inhibitors that bind irreversibly by forming a covalent bond to the enzyme. This functionally kills the enzyme. ",

            "answer_text": "A fundamental task of proteins is to act as enzymes\u2014catalysts that increase the rate of virtually all the chemical reactions within cells. Although RNAs are capable of catalyzing some reactions, most biological reactions are catalyzed by proteins. In the absence of enzymatic catalysis, most biochemical reactions are so slow that they would not occur under the mild conditions of temperature and pressure that are compatible with life. Enzymes accelerate the rates of such reactions by well over a million-fold, so reactions that would take years in the absence of catalysis can occur in fractions of seconds if catalyzed by the appropriate enzyme. Cells contain thousands of different enzymes, and their activities determine which of the many possible chemical reactions actually take place within the cell. ",
