            "answer_text": "Well, first of all, different elements react for different reasons, so it isn\u2019t very fair to use a single scale of reactivity to judge all elements. However, the most important, is probably Electronegativity. The most electronegative element is Fluorine. It has an En of 4.0, which means that it will react with just about any non-inert substance in order to complete its outer shell. For this reason, hydrofluoric acid is one of the most acidic substances on earth, and Fluorine is rarely found in elemental form, as there is little in nature that can break a bond with Fluorine, without bonding to it itself. Of course on the other end of the spectrum, you have Caesium, the least electronegative element. Caesium really wants to get rid of its single valence electron, so that it\u2019s outermost shell is filled. Caesium is extremely reactive, but most chemists would agree that Fluorine is even moreso. Diatomic Fluorine F2, is one of the weakest covalent bonds, and therefore is easily reactive with other substances to form fluoride salts and minerals, which make some of the strongest bonds. However, the reaction of fluoride with other substances is highly exothermique and dangerous, hence why several people died attempting to isolate Fluorine. Because of the extreme difficulty to metabolise Fluorine compounds, they are typically quite toxic to humans, and the chemical is sparsely used in biochemistry, despite the relative abundance of the chemical on earth.

            "answer_text": "Oxygen [edit:] When I answered originally I happened to be in a hurry and thinking along the lines of oxygen/oxidation/chemical bonds/aging. While oxygen does hold true in that context, it doesn't fit the bill across the board.  The question itself is a bit general, as different elements can be more (or less) reactive depending on the conditions and the other element present as well as a variety of other factors. So, on a Google adventure I went.  This is a small snippet from The Naked Scientist forum that I found enlightening. \"Fluorine. It can burn substances which are generally thought of as nonflammable, such as glass, water and sand. It is the most electronegative of all of the reactive* elements and therefore has an extremely high attraction for electrons. As a consequence, compounds formed from fluorine are often quite stable, such as Teflon and fluorine salts. Lithium and potassium are also extremely reactive, but in a different way since they are electropositive instead of electronegative. Fluorine also reacts more readily than these two elements because it is a gas at standard conditions whereas the alkali metals are solids. Uranium and plutonium aren't even close. *Helium and neon have higher electronegativities, but are normally not reactive.\" [ Cited: http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=49244.0 ] ",

            "answer_text": "Caesium and fluorine. Group I metals are the most reactive metals as they only have one electron in their outer shell which is easy to lose; they get more reactive as you go down the periodic table as the electron is further from the nucleus and shielded by the inner electrons. The halogens are the most reactive non-metals for the opposite reason - they only need one electron to fill their outer shell, and that is easiest for fluorine as it is the smallest and thus the incoming electron sees more of the nuclear charge. Francium is probably more reactive than caesium, but with a half-life of 22 minutes, we can't get enough to test. ",

The most reactive metal would be caesium. It is so reactive that it would ignite when exposed to air and explode when exposed to water. More information can be found here: Caesium - Wikipedia. The most reactive nonmetal would be flourine. Flourine is very reactive because it will react with mostly unreactive substances like glass fragments and water.

This means it pulls you electrons towards it stronger than any other element. Looking at metals, theoretically the most reactive metal would be francium. However, as francium is highly radiactive with a very short half life, the most reactive metal is one up in the periodic table - caesium. Caesium has the highest electronegativity of all stable metals. Caesium is also far more reactive than lithium. By dropping each group 1 element on water, the reactions become more violent. Lithium merely fizzes whilst sodium fizzes a little more violently. Going down through potassium and rubidium the reactions become more explosive. Caesium is the most explosive of the group when mixed with water. ",

If reaction between 2 elements it depends. The EMF tables are in aqueous solutions so they might not apply to neat reactions and there are mechanistic hurdles to overcome. I will still give the nod to fluorine because of its weak bond in F2 and it's small ion size. The cation is more difficult Cs is a good choice but the larger ion size might lower lattice energy so Sr or Ba might compete. heat of formation of BaF2 is more than twice that of CsF while SrF2 is half so let's try the reaction of Ba and F2. LiF has a higher heat of formation than CsF but may be kinetically restrained by a higher ionization potential. ",

Lithium and potassium are also extremely reactive, but in a different way since they are electropositive instead of electronegative. Fluorine also reacts more readily than these two elements because it is a gas at standard conditions whereas the alkali metals are solids. Uranium and plutonium aren't even close. *Helium and neon have higher electronegativities, but are normally not reactive. Hope it helps\u2026 ",

I now find that Francium has a half-life of 22 minutes (MINUTES) so it is not a subject for study. For Francium read Caesium! The reason for this reactivity is that each of the metals has a single electron in its outer electron shell, which the atom is happy to shed to leave a nice neat complete outside shell. The further down the series you go the more loosely the extra electron is bound and the keener the atom is to lose it. Have fun . . . ",

Ceasium is the direct opposite of fluorine .It is very reactive but unlike fluorine it gives away electrons. But then why is fluorine so ahead of ceasium? Ans: because fluorine in majority of conditions will rip away the opposite's electron but ceasium can only give 1 electron if the opposite has vacant orbital space. Thus ripping away is dependent only on the ripper but pushing depends on both the pusher and the one who is pushed. Thus fluorine reacts with much more particles than ceasium ,even 0 group's!!!

            "answer_text": "I personally don't like the term but there are two main ways that reactivity is taught at a young age. The first is in terms of the reactivity series. This shows the order of elements in terms of their reactivity. This just refers to how reactive they are towards water and weak acids. For example:  S Of course every element reacts differently to every other element, compound etc. This isn't really very useful. A more general way of thinking about it might be in terms of electronegativity. I.e. the more desperate an element is for an electron(s), or is desperate to get rid of an electron (s) the more reactive it is. ",
