            "answer_text": "Soil pH affects soil fertility* by influencing the availability of the factors that contribute to fertility, which are commonly nutrients, organic matter, etc. Depending on the pH level, some nutrients are more available than others (see figure below). Because some elements precipitate in the soil profile at extreme pH levels, soils can become especially saline. Additionally, pH also influences the presence of microorganisms that decompose biomass/organic matter, which is a huge part of soil fertility.  *Assuming soil fertility is defined as a soil\u2019s ability to sustain plant growth and yield by providing a sufficient rooting medium with available water and nutrients.
