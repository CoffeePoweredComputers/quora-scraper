            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy is a form of energy that results from an object's motion. There are many types of motion that use kinetic energy: translation (moving from one place to another), rotation, and vibration. The measurement of kinetic energy in an object is calculated based on the object's mass and velocity. It is measured in Joules. Examples of Kinetic Energy: 1.\tAn airplane has a large amount of kinetic energy in flight due to its large mass and fast velocity. 2.\tA baseball thrown by a pitcher, although having a small mass, can have a large amount of kinetic energy due to its fast velocity. 3.\tA downhill skier traveling down a hill has a large amount of kinetic energy because of their mass and high velocity. 4.\tA golf ball sitting on a tee before it is struck has zero kinetic energy because its velocity is zero. 5.\tAn asteroid falling to earth at incredible speeds has an enormous amount of kinetic energy. 6.\tA car traveling down the road has less kinetic energy than a semi-truck traveling at the same speed because the car's mass is much less than the truck's. 7.\tA river flowing at a certain speed possesses kinetic energy because the water has a certain mass and it also has velocity. 8.\tAn insect flying has a small amount of kinetic energy because its mass and velocity are relatively small. Potential energy is a form of energy that results from an object's position or arrangement of parts. It is stored energy that can become kinetic energy. It includes potential electrical, chemical, and nuclear energy. The measurement of potential energy in an object is calculated based on the object's mass and its height or distance. It is measured in Joules. Examples of Potential Energy: 1.\tA rock sitting at the edge of a cliff has potential energy. If the rock falls, the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy. 2.\tTree branches high up in a tree have potential energy because they can fall to the ground. 3.\tA stick of dynamite has chemical potential energy that would be released when the activation energy from the fuse comes into contact with the chemicals. 4.\tThe food we eat has chemical potential energy because as our body digests it, it provides us with energy for basic metabolism. 5.\tA stretched spring in a pinball machine has elastic potential energy and can move the steel ball when released. 6.\tWhen a crane swings a wrecking ball up to a certain height, it gains more potential energy and has the ability to crash through buildings. 7.\tA set of double \"A\" batteries in a remote control car possess chemical potential energy which can supply electricity to run the car.

            "answer_text": "Energy in general is often defined as the capacity to do work. Potential energy (PE) is \u201cstored\u201d energy that an object has by virtue of its position. Kinetic energy (KE) is energy associated with motion. There are several types of PE. Gravitational PE, like a hammer has when you lift it over your head. It then loses PE as the height decreases and gains KE \u2026 energy associated with motion \u2026 the KE increases as you allow it to fall back down and its speed increases. This KE is then converted to work when the hammer head strikes the nail and drives it into a board. (NOTE: This is a gross oversimplification; some energy is converted into things like heat and noise and does not become useful work). Energy is said to be conserved, which means that it remains constant \u2026 it doesn\u2019t increase or decrease; rather, it is converted from one form to another. Of course, this is an \u201cideal\u201d example; in reality, energy tends to \u201crun down,\u201d as forces like air resistance and friction convert it into heat \u2026 energy that moves from a warmer body, such as the head of your hammer \u2026 to a cooler body, such as the air around you. It isn\u2019t lost; it\u2019s just hard to re-capture. I tell my students that those warmed air molecules are really small \u2026 and moving fast \u2026 too hard to grab them back! (A \u201cheat pump\u201d actually does this very thing, capturing heat from outside air and bringing it into your house to warm it \u2026 but it requires electricity to run it, so there\u2019s no free lunch there, either.) There is also elastic PE, the energy that is stored in a spring that has been stretched or compressed. A toy dart gun provides a good example of elastic PE. When you push the dart back into the gun, it compresses the spring, which stores the PE. Pressing the trigger releases the spring, which forces the dart out, doing work on it and accelerating it to some speed. The dart now has the energy, which has become KE. Again, this KE becomes work, as the dart strikes its target. The springs in your car actually get warmer as they stretch and compress. And don\u2019t even think about touching your brakes after a drive \u2026 they will burn you! A few other forms of energy include stored chemical PE (as in the fossil fuel in your car), electric PE in the AAA-cells in your calculator, thermal energy, stored in the Earth\u2019s core, bond energy between atoms in a molecule, and the nuclear binding energy that holds the protons (and neutrons, if I recall correctly) together in a nucleus. It\u2019s really a big area of physics, and I have done little more here that scratch the surface. Your local library will no doubt have books with far better explanations than the one I have provided here. But I hope I have helped. I am going to go do some work outside now, if I have enough energy. Apologies for omissions and typos. ",
