At 4 Deg C it is maximum; at 3 Deg C and 2 or 1 deg centigrade it decreases; at 0 deg C it becomes ice and floats. \u201cAnomalous density of water \u201c. God designed this way so that marine animals don\u2019t die due to freezing and can live below the ice sheet; some however get caught and get frozen-ed so that other animals that live on fish only can hunt for them and could have fresh \u201cfrozen fishes\u201d!
