            "answer_text": "Unpopular? Well, some research findings have been a \u201cbummer\u201d for those who like simple models (e.g., cost-benefit ratios where the cost is in terms of money and the benefits are in terms of savings). The bummer is that this does not capture all that motivates many people. There are many intangibles, such as personal gratification or\u2014 the opposite\u2014 the approval or respect of others. When someone says that something is \u201cpriceless,\u201d they may mean this literally: no price can be assigned to the benefit because the measure is not monetary. Another bummer is that the Horatio Alger stories of the poorest people changing their lives to wealth through nothing more than hard work are, in the United States, myths. Economic research has proven this time and again, however. Still, it is a mythology that persists and makes some people frustrated, often blaming \u201cothers\u201d for their failure to advance. Yes, we can point to a very few individuals who managed to overcome a childhood of abject poverty to achieve some measure of success (which may not be financial). But for the most part, it\u2019s very difficult to escape poverty. It\u2019s very difficult for most people to move from the working class (defined as those with jobs that are mostly hands-on and do not require a college education) to the middle class (defined as those jobs that are mostly knowledge-based and require a college education, such as those working in some fields of technology or engineering). Social science research gives us some of the root causes of class immobility. ",

            "answer_text": "The Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem which proves that the demand curve in a supply and demand diagram can be any shape at all and intersect the supply curve at multiple points. The neoclassical economic consensus assumes that the demand curve for a single product or a single economy (treated as a single profit) is a smoothly downward-sloping line that only intersects the supply curve at one point. The theory suggests that prices will tend towards an equilibrium determined by that intersection. The underlying assumptions that lead to a smoothly sloping downward demand curve are wrong - consumers simply do not behave as the fictional homo economicus. Economics has fundamentally misunderstood humanity (although economists will point to behavioural economics as a partial solution, they still haven\u2019t really taken on board the conclusion of SMDT). SMDT shows that such a price equilibrium is unlikely to occur in practice. But modern economic theory always assumes the existence of such an equilibrium. Basically, supply and demand theory is bunk. This is all explained in detail in Prof. Steve Keen\u2019s book Debunking Economics, which I highly recommend. ",
