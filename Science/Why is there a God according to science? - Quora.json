            "answer_text": "There is scientific evidence of the existence of God. However, it\u2019s not accessible to everyone, nor should it be. If you understood precisely who or what God is, or what source is, what would be the point of coming to this planet to learn or teach lessons? But the idea of God is knowable; as one spirit guide put it \u201cGod is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend, it\u2019s just not physically possible.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful afterlife\u201d) However, you can experience God.\u201d So ponder this for a moment. If God is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend (too much input, too many factors, too many levels of awareness) but a person can \u201cexperience God\u201d - then that puts God into the realm of science. Because we can experience jumping into an ice cold pool of water - we can\u2019t describe it to anyone who hasn\u2019t done it - there aren\u2019t enough words to adequately describe it - but we can experience it. We can\u2019t describe unconditional love to anyone as a definition - but we can experience it. In like form, we can experience God. How does one experience God? According to this guide; \u201cYou can experience God by opening your heart to everyone and to all things.\u201d What does that mean? Unconditional love towards everyone. Easy to say, hard to do. But beyond opening our hearts to \u201call people\u201d - to all things. That tree deserves to be here as much as any human does. If you open your heart to all things, it\u2019s going to be hard to navigate the planet. But it\u2019s worth contemplating. Everything that exists is worthy of our unconditional love, or \u201copening our heart to.\u201d How do you \u201copen your heart?\u201d We all know how to do it - we all know how difficult it is to do it. We choose not to. But if you want a scientific proof of what or who God is - start by opening your heart to all people and all things. Voila. ",

            "answer_text": "The very term 'science' and even the enterprise as played out is a mental apprehension of the physical world that cannot be understood mathematically, experimentally or with any physical thing or law. Mental substance including understanding can only be known by having a mind. I find it most ironic that . . . in an age where science continually shows the need for mental creativity in creating lifeforms and the unique computational processes in the human brain that give rise to (and aren't itself) the mind that allows man do science and even more know anything exists, science thinks the mind is just brain activity emergent from its unique neural based structure. Even ancients knew better than to make such a glaring equivocation of two basically different stuff. So science and philosophy IN DEPTH lead to God as Bacon, the father of the scientific method, rightly noted but the materialism rampant in science stops many (even some gullible religious scientists) from seeing that connection.
