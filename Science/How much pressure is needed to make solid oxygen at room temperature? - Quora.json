            "answer_text": "See Solid oxygen - Wikipedia \u201cSix different phases of solid oxygen are known to exist: [1] [6] \u03b1-phase: light blue \u2014 forms at 1 atm, below 23.8 K, monoclinic crystal structure.\u03b2-phase: faint blue to pink \u2014 forms at 1 atm, below 43.8 K, rhombohedral crystal structure, (at room temperature and high pressure begins transformation to tetraoxygen).\u03b3-phase: faint blue \u2013 forms at 1 atm, below 54.36 K, cubic crystal structure.\u03b4-phase: orange \u2014 forms at room temperature at a pressure of 9 GPa\u03b5-phase: dark-red to black \u2014 forms at room temperature at pressures greater than 10 GPa\u03b6-phase: metallic \u2014 forms at pressures greater than 96 GPa\u201dFWIW, 9GPa is about 1,300,000 psi. So, yes, it can be done. Scientists have created pressures much higher. ",
