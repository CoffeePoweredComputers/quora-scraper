            "answer_text": "Geosynchronous orbit is the limit. The Martian moon Phobos will suffer this fate in a million years because tidal forces are slowly sucking it into the planet instead of pushing it out. When any satellite is inside of geosynchronous (or aresynchronous for the case of Mars) orbit, the satellite is revolving faster than the planet is rotating. Tidal forces will tug on the satellite causing a transfer of momentum from the satellite to the planet. The satellite will slowly drop in orbital distance paradoxically causing it to speed up. The result is a cascade that will cause the orbit to decay faster as the altitude gets lower. Below 300 km, atmospheric drag has a greater effect than tidal forces. The opposite is currently happening to the Moon because it is beyond geosynchronous orbit. If the Moon were magically moved to 35,786 km (22,236 mi) altitude, it could move closer or further away, but it wouldn\u2019t stay there. If it fell to 35,500 km, its fate would be sealed and will eventually break up when it fell to Earth\u2019s Roche limit and be one with Earth again. If, on the other hand, it rose to 36,000 km, its would remain a permanent fixture in the heavens, slowly moving away from Earth as it has for the last 4\u00bd billion years. ",

            "answer_text": "The moon can\u2019t crash into the earth, at least not in one piece because of the Roche Limit. Once the moon is closer than 18470km from the earth, the force holding the moon together (its gravity) will be smaller than the force of earth\u2019s gravity and the moon will disintegrate, falling into earth as many moon chunks. The moon *is* falling towards earth (even as its orbit is growing larger!) because that\u2019s what orbits are! The moon is falling towards the earth, but it has enough lateral velocity to miss and not impact. If it had no lateral velocity, regardless of distance, it would fall towards the earth, except it would probably fall into something else first and/or get enough lateral velocity not to fall into anything. BUT: in an empty universe, just the earth and the moon, with no relative motion? Regardless of distance, the moon would fall into the earth eventually. ",
