            "answer_text": "This is one way that you can earn money as a student. Find the students that are having a hard time in either a class that you have already passed or you are doing good in right now and use this script. You: Enthusiastically introduce yourself. \u201cHi, My name is _________ how\u2019s it going? Their response doesn't matter, just acknowledge it. If they say \u201cI'm having a shitty day\u201d. You reply \u201cHaving a shitty day sucks, I\u2019ve had my share of shitty days also\u201d Then you bring up the class that you know they are struggling in. I noticed that you're taking _____________, I had a hard time in that class, how\u2019s it working out for you? Their response doesn't matter, just acknowledge it. This is where you start asking open ended questions, your trying to get them to explain their pain. Then you\u2019re going to help them equate that pain with time and money. \u201cImagine what it would be like if you had someone you could work with, call anytime, get answers from, bounce ideas off of etc\u2026 Get them to describe to you what it would be like if things were easier. How they would feel if they passed the class with a good grade. How much time they could save, what they would do with extra time. How would their stress level go down etc\u2026 Now you\u2019re going to ask some qualifying questions using the information they have already given you. Here you can go big or small. You want them to tell you, in their own words, using their own math what will they gain from completing that class. Example: By completing computer science 101 I will be able to move on to 102, eventually get my degree and get a job making $100,000 a year. This means that class, to me, right now, is worth $100,000. Of you can ask for a ballpark of what it is costing me to take the class right now and how much it would cost me if I failed. Lets say I paid $350+ books for this class. If fail, it will have to pay another $350 to take it again, my GPA would go down, I might not get a $100,000 a year job, I might have to take a $80,000 a year job. Failing this class could cost me $20,350! Hopefully you are getting the point by now. If they are broke they will say something to indicated they are broke. Most people aren't really broke, there is usually something they spend money on that they don't need. For allot of people there is something they spend money on that they feel mildly guilty about. This is where you have to decide whether you want to move on or distract and divert. Distraction and diversion is where you figure out where they are spending their extra dollars. Again, you\u2019re going to do this through a series of questions. Now lets say they told you that they were thinking about getting a tutor, or that they would pay x dollars. You want to redirect them to what it would cost if they failed the class. Ask questions that have them walk you through that story again. Then have them tell you what its worth to them to fix that problem again. You are still qualifying, and you are going to ask the next question like this \u201cI'm just curios, what if you could have your time back, less stress, help when you needed it? if a solution existed that ensured you would get all those thing , completed this class, saved you $X and ensured you could earn $X in the future, and all you had to pay is $Y, but you only had 2 hours to get the money, where would you get it?\u201d. It doesn't matter what they say. They key thing is them telling you either they have the money or they can get the money. This is where you softly ask them the question \u201cdo you mind if I tell you what I do?\u201d. Most people will say yes. While reiterating the pain the described and how a solution would help them. Tell them how you help people like them solve problems like theirs they have. Typically at this point they will as how to get started. If they don't ask then there is another process we go into where we reiterate the dollar amount they gave then present our price. As long as our price is less, we will get them to pay us most of the time. From here on, all we have to do is deliver. I hope this was helpful, I recorded a YouTube video that goes into greater detail, if you're interested the video can be found here.  ",
