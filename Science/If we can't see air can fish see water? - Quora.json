            "answer_text": "Nope. Neither fish nor humans see water or air, because both water and air, are transparent. Both fish and humans can see the interface between water and air, because when light travels through the interface of two transparent mediums, with different indices of refraction, the light bends (changes direction), based on how much it slows down or speeds up (depending on whether it passes from a medium with lower to a medium with higher index of refraction, or vice versa). At the interface between two transparent materials (like water and air), there is a critical angle, which occurs when the angle that the light its the interface at is so large that instead of passing out of the material, it gets reflected and stays inside it. Beyond this angle you get total internal reflection, and it\u2019s why when you look up towards the surface of the water from below, it\u2019s reflective unless its straight up and flat.    Birds have trouble seeing windows often times, but not because they\u2019re not capable of seeing glass, but rather because they don\u2019t recognize (or understand) reflections, so they perceive the reflected sky in a pane of glass as a place they can travel to. So they often smack into the glass instead, which can injure or kill them. For the most part, most animals have roughly the same ability to receive light, in the sense that there isn\u2019t a whole lot of variation in the wavelengths of light that animals are sensitive to, and since the light we all detect is relatively the same, the materials it passes through (or not) are pretty similar too. Some insects (like bees) can see some ultraviolet light, revealing some patterns on flowers that we don\u2019t see:     Some snakes are able to detect infrared wavelengths of light that help them identify the warm bodies of their prey:  And theres some variation in the particular parts of the spectrum eyes are sensitive to, humans are mostly trichromats, meaning we have three color receptors, though common types of color blindness often reduce that to two color receptors. I think most primates have two. Birds are often (always?) tetrachromats, having four color receptors, and apparently there are some humans who are tetrachromats as well (essentially inheriting one type of colorblindness from one parent, and another from the other parent). Dogs have two color receptors. But as far as I am aware, all of these variations are still seeing pretty much the same wavelengths of light, which will mostly all transmit, reflect, absorb, or scatter, in pretty similar ways, through the same materials.

            "answer_text": "Fish, like the rest of vertebrates and many other invertebrates, have developed mechanisms to be able to perceive light, which disappears quickly with depth. Let's see the vision in fish. THE VISION IN FISH: THE WORLD FROM THE EYES OF A FISHVision is nothing other than the perception of the light of the environment that surrounds us. Because the fish live in the aquatic environment, the light quickly dies out. In addition, because they live in very different habitats, the system for perceiving light varies considerably among species. THE LOW LIGHT OF THE WATERBefore you start talking about vision in fish, it is important to understand the light pattern as depth increases. As we have said, the light disappears quickly with depth, but not all colors do it equally: red light is absorbed in the first 10 meters; orange and yellow, at 30 m; green at 50 m and blue at 200 m. For this reason, when we dive we see the starfish in black! The amount of light in the water column has made oceanographers distinguish two zones: the area where there is light is called photic and in which light does not reach it is known as aphotic (from 1,000 meters). The photic zone can be subdivided into: Euphotic zone: This is the most superficial and is the layer in which photosynthetic organisms can perform photosynthesis. Although it can vary, it is usually considered that it reaches up to 200 m.Oligophotic zone: This is the area that receives enough sunlight for organisms to see, but that is not enough to carry out photosynthesis (between 200 and 1,000 m).THE EYES OF FISHThe organization of fish eyes is similar to that of mammals, although it has its particularities.  The lenses of bony fish are spherical, while in elasmobranchs they are slightly flattened, and have a high refractive power because the cornea is in direct contact with water. In addition, to focus the images, they do not change the shape of the lens but move them forward or backward. This mechanism is also carried out by snakes. Another curiosity of the optical system is that, in many fish, the iris can not contract, so they can not close the pupil if the intensity of light increases. To avoid overexposure, the cones and rods (the photoreceptor cells, the first detect the colors and the second do not) change shape and the melanosomes (organelles with pigment) are arranged in a way that makes \"shade\". The opposite process occurs when the light is scarce. Fish can have up to 4 different cone types, one of which detects ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet cones serve to detect the plankton, although not all have them. Some only have them when they are larvae and others only during certain stages of adult life. For example, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) only have them when they live in the river.  On the other hand, there are fish that only have rods, such as elasmobranchs and deep-sea fish, so they can not see colors. Another notable difference is that in teleosts, the eyes grow throughout life and, therefore, so does the retina. In addition, the retina has the ability to regenerate if damaged. Finally, some nocturnal fish and sharks, among others, present the tapetum lucidum behind the retina, whose function is to return to the retina rays of light that have escaped from the retina, to improve vision. This also has some mammals, like the cat. CHANGES IN THE EYES IN MIGRATORY FISHESThe adaptive capacity of the fish is so great that even changes in the eyes occur in migratory fish. Lampreys, for example, are fish that migrate from rivers to seas. In each environment they have a different pigment: in fresh water, it is Porfiropsin (red color) and in the sea, it is rhodopsin (blue).  Eels, which also change habitat, can also modify their eyes. When they are about to start migrating to the sea, the diameter of the eye is doubled, the lens increases in size and the number of cones increase significantly (they only represent 3% of the photoreceptors before beginning the migration), among other changes. THE VISION IN DEEP FISHDeep-sea fishes present a set of adaptations to life in the bottoms of the oceans. In the case of vision, they also present them. The mesopelagic fishes (that live in the oligof\u00f3tica zone) are characterized to have big eyes, with wide pupils and big lenses. Some species, such as the telescope (Gigantura), also have tubular eyes.  The transparent head fish (Macropinna Microstoma) also has tubular eyes, which are usually directed upwards to detect the silhouettes of the fish. Unlike other fish with this type of eyes, you can rotate your eyes forward.  The bathypelagic fish (live below 1,000 meters) usually have, on the contrary, small eyes or degenerate them. In this case, the eyes have very large lenses, compared to the rest of the eye, which does not allow them to create clear images and, in addition, they can only detect the objects next to them. THE ADAPTATION OF THE VISION TO THE DARKNESSWhen a fish goes from being a lighted area to a dark one, the adaptation to the second condition is done in two phases: in the first phase, the sensitivity is mainly due to the cones, while in the second phase the canes dominate.  In the zebrafish (Danio Rerio), for example, the first phase lasts 6 minutes and the sensitivity is mainly due to the cones. After this time, the sensitivity is due mainly to the canes. In order for the rods to be \"working\" at peak performance, they need a 20-minute dark adaptation period. OTHER CURIOUS ADAPTATIONS OF THE EYES OF FISHThere are some species of fish that present some adaptations of the most curious in the eyes. We leave you a sample. The fish Limnichthys fasciitis is a small animal that lives in shallow and well-lit water, which is buried in the sand, and only the eyes come out to the outside. The retina is very thick, but at one point it presents an abrupt narrowing of the retina, which magnifies the images at this point. In other words, this fish has telescopic vision, that is, if it had a telescope in its eyes.  The fish Limnichthytes Fasciatus has telescopic vision, also have them adapted to the air. To get a good view out of the water, the cornea, instead of being spherical, has a triangular shape, with three flat areas. A fish with the adaptation to aquatic and aerial vision to the extreme is the four-eyed fish (Anableps anableps). This species of the freshwater swim with the upper half of each eye out of the water and with the lower half inside. Both the lenses and the entire eye are extremely asymmetrical, so they look perfectly both outside and inside the water. If you want to see this fish how you swim with your eyes half submerged in the water. As you have seen, the vision in fish is much more complex than it seems, since water largely determines the anatomy of the eyes and their adaptations. Do you know any other curious case of vision in fish? Leave your comment below. ",
