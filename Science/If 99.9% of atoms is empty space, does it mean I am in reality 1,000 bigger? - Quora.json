            "answer_text": "A very good question!! (^.^) A hydrogen atom is made from a single proton that's circled by a single electron. How big is a hydrogen atom? The radius of a hydrogen atom is known as the Bohr Radius, which is equal to .529 \u00d7 10^-10 meters. That means that a hydrogen atom has a volume of about 6.2 \u00d7 10^-31 cubic meters.  If 0.0000000000004% of a hydrogen atom is full, then the rest of it must be empty: Percent Empty = 100% - Percent FullPercent Empty = 100% - 0.0000000000004%Percent Empty = 99.9999999999996% If atoms are 99.999999999999% empty space then why don't things pass right through them? Things don't fall through other things because they are levitating on an electrostatic field! I am not kidding! When you sit on a chair, you are not really touching it. You see, every atom is surrounded by a shell of electrons. This electron cloud presents a rather negative face to the world. Remember that like charges repel each other. When two atoms approach each other, their electron shells push back at each other, despite the fact that each atom's net charge is 0. This is a very useful feature of nature. It makes our lives a lot easier. In summary, for a typical human of 70 kg, there are almost 7*10^27 atoms (that's a 7 followed by 27 zeros!) Another way of saying this is \"seven billion billion billion.\" Of this, almost 2/3 is hydrogen, 1/4 is oxygen, and about 1/10 is carbon. These three atoms add up to 99% of the total! In that, 65% is oxygen - 42.25 kg 18% is carbon - 11.70 kg10% is hydrogen - 6.50 kg3% is nitrogen - 1.95 kg1.4% is calcium - 0.91 kg1.1% is phosphorus - 0.715 kg 5 kg others. Thus, you are of the size you look in the mirror. ",

            "answer_text": "Very nearly all of it. Let's take a look at an atom of hydrogen to see how empty it really is. Of course, this diagram isn't drawn to scale...  A hydrogen atom is made from a single proton that's circled by a single electron. How big is a hydrogen atom? The radius of a hydrogen atom is known as the Bohr Radius, which is equal to .529 \u00d7 10-10 meters. That means that a hydrogen atom has a volume of about 6.2 \u00d7 10-31 cubic meters. How big is the proton at the center of a hydrogen atom? Recent studiesindicate that protons have a radius of about .84 \u00d7 10-15 meters, giving them a volume of about 2.5 \u00d7 10-45 cubic meters. We need to do a little more math to find out how much of a hydrogen atom is empty space: Percent Full = 100 \u00d7 (Volume Filled / Total Volume)Percent Full = 100 \u00d7 (2.5 \u00d7 10-45 m3 / 6.2 \u00d7 10-31 m3)Percent Full = 100 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 10-15)Percent Full = 4 \u00d7 10-13 %Percent Full = 0.0000000000004% If 0.0000000000004% of a hydrogen atom is full, then the rest of it must be empty: Percent Empty = 100% - Percent FullPercent Empty = 100% - 0.0000000000004%Percent Empty = 99.9999999999996% A hydrogen atom is about 99.9999999999996% empty space. Put another way, if a hydrogen atom were the size of the earth, the proton at its center would be about 200 meters (600 feet) across. While I wouldn't want something that big landing on my head, it's tiny compared to the size of the earth. ",
