            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to explain this using Kinetic Molecular Theory, hopefully it\u2019ll give a broad understanding. Molecular collisions are a measure of an substances Temperature, so heat it up and the molecules collide faster, cool it down and they slow down. Now in order for salt to dissolve it requires water molecules to dissociate the crystal and pull the ions away from each other, and almost hold it in place. But it can only do this as fast as the water molecules move past it, so that\u2019s why we mix it, but heating it up actually has a better advantage of making the water molecules themselves collide more often with the salt.
