            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is a proposed model used in Dewey\u2019s Scientific Method, which applies in questions of cause, classification, and localization. John Dewey\u2019s Scientific Method was originally codified in 1910 to have 5 steps: \u201c(i) a felt difficulty, (ii) its location and definition, (iii) suggestion of a possible solution, (iv) development by reasoning of the bearing of the suggestions, (v) further observation and experiment leading to its acceptance or rejection.\u201d But I think the essence of the Scientific Method really has only three steps: Ask a question of cause, classification, or localization;Devise hypotheses regarding possible solutions; andExecute experiments to eliminate hypotheses by contradiction.These steps ideally yield predictive scientific models. You certainly can add any number of additional steps, but these three steps form the critical core. A good way to remember the Scientific Method is to think in terms of example applications. As an example of a test for localization, you can use the Scientific Method to find your lost car keys. You devise hypotheses as to possible locations, and check each location until you find your keys. As an example of a test for classification, you can use the Scientific Method to identify bugs. For example, you can count legs to differentiate between six-legged insects versus 8-legged arachnids. As an example of a test for cause, you can use the Scientific Method to debug a non-working clothes dryer. You can step through hypotheses (e.g., tripped electrical breaker) to determine why it is not working. Hypotheses are not required with questions of effect, optimal value, or existence. For example, suppose that you want to find the brand of battery that lasts the longest in a particular application (as a question of optimal value). In this case, a hypothesis as to the outcome would just be experimental bias. The requirement for hypotheses is a serious shortcoming of the Scientific Method. There is no rigorous, formulaic way of devising hypotheses; hypotheses are typically a product of experience, intuition, insight, analogy, and extrapolation. The bad news is that if you don't happen to include the 'right' hypothesis, you cannot arrive at the right answer. For example, if you are using the Scientific Method to find your lost car keys (as a test for localization), you cannot find them if you don't happen to look in the right place. The role of hypotheses is one of the most misunderstood concepts in science. For example, it is common in science fairs for all projects to have a hypothesis, which is absurd. Science fair projects are commonly tests for effect or optimal value, where hypotheses do not directly apply. ",

            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is an idea or a conjecture about the reason that an observed (or sometime inferred) phenomenon occurs (note: phenomenon, in this context, doesn't imply anything extraordinary happened, just that something occurred). Imagine that you observed a mosquito flying erratically. You might conjecture different possible reasons for the ramdom seeming pattern of flight: maybe it helps them locate prey (us), maybe it is meant to help them avoid being swatted (so perhaps the ones that didn't fly erratically didn't survive to pass on their genes), maybe it is to attract a mate. Each one of these possibilities is a hypothesis. The next step is to analyze your hypotheses and determine methods of testing each hypothesis, while making sure (as well as you can) that your tests are designed in such a way that other factors are excluded \u2014 so that a positive result doesn't have a reasonable alternate explanation.
