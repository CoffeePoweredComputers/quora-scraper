            "answer_text": "My last magazine column was on why the Tantric can never win and why he or she shouldn\u2019t care. If someone comes to me and I tell them something, two outcomes are possible. Firstly, the person may or may not believe in my prognosis but either consciously or subconsciously will make changes in their lives, so that the outcome I told them would happen, doesn\u2019t happen. In that case I will be discredited as a fraud. Secondly, the person may do nothing about what I tell them and then, if the action comes to pass, they will be unhappy with me because I knew but didn\u2019t do something about it. So then they will hate me. In this way, Tantrics can never win and that is precisely why a Tantric shouldn\u2019t care what people think about them. ",

Why don't you try to be a winner?Everyone have to be good at SOMETHING. You just need to be good at more things. Then you'll fell confident in yourself.
