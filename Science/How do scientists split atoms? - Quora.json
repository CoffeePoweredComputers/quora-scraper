            "answer_text": "Here's a layman's simplified explanation of atom splitting by neutron bombardment, which other more knowledgeable people will no doubt correct. The nucleus is struck by and absorbs a neutron, and this upsets the balance of forces holding it together. The electrostatic repulsion (a property of protons) is trying to push it apart, while the strong force (a property of neutrons and protons) is holding it together. The electrostatic force follows the inverse square law and can act at long distances, while the more powerful strong force acts only over very short distances, of the order of a nucleus size. So as the acquired neutron makes the nucleus larger, the strong force loses its grip on the particles and the electrostatic force splits it apart. Usually two new elements are created, plus any leftover particles - alpha, beta or neutron.  Surplus energy is emitted as gamma rays. Note that an alpha particle is a nucleus of helium, an element, and a beta particle is an electron, possibly emitted when a neutron converts to a proton. Obviously this process works best if the original nucleus is already so large that it's wobbling on the edge of instability. A lighter element may absorb a neutron and form an isotope of the original, changing its atomic weight but not its atomic number. The new isotope may or may not be unstable and split later. ",

            "answer_text": "By hitting them with subatomic particles. Each atom has a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons. Protons have an electric charge, so two (or more) protons next to each other experience a strong electric force pushing them apart. Neutrons don't have an electric charge, so they experience no electric force. Both do experience the \"strong nuclear force\", which makes them attractive to each other, but it's not strong enough to hold two protons alone together. So atoms have a mix of neutrons and protons. Some organizations of protons and neutrons are more stable than others. Helium-4, with two protons and two neutrons, is extremely stable. So is the most common form of carbon, Carbon-12, with six of each. Carbon-14, which has six protons and eight neutrons is not stable, and will decay, but not by splitting. If you hit a sample of uranium-235 atoms with a beam of neutrons, some of those neutrons hit the uranium nuclei with enough energy that the nuclei end up with enough extra energy to overcome the binding of the nucleus, and it can break into two smaller pieces -- it is split.

            "answer_text": "Simply by firing high speed neutrons into heavy isotopes, for example Uranium-235 etc... Its called atomic fission, usually used in nuclear reactors and early nuclear bombs.  The specific isotope turns to Uranium-236, and then shortly splits into krypton-89, a stable isotope of Krypton also into Barium-144, and meanwhile releasing a huge amount of energy, thats why nuclear fission is used to generate energy for generation of electricity. That is the nooby explanation of your question, humanly understandable, for alien levels-- go to wikipedia :) ",
