            "answer_text": "In theory, not necessarily. You can theoretically have an at-rest object with no force acting upon it. In reality, however, all objects have a nearly infinite number of forces acting on them, but typically we only pay attention to the biggest ones. A book on a table, for instance, we usually consider the gravity force from Earth and the normal force from the table (really a manifestation of the electromagnetic force as the major contributor), as those are by far the largest forces acting on it. But it also has gravitational forces from you, the Moon, the Sun, Jupiter, and, really, all other objects in the universe acting upon it very weakly. Unless we find a particle that doesn't interact using any of the four known forces - highly unlikely, as all measurements we do require an interaction with those forces - then it's safe to say that all physical at-rest objects have balanced forces acting on them.

            "answer_text": "If an object is sitting on a horizontal table, it has gravity acting on it but the table says no go. to vertical motion. If you applied a horizontal force greater than the breakout friction, you could have the object move. I wrote equations for gearboxes on the Canadarm 1 on the US Space Shuttle and the breakout (stiction) was significant. Once the gearing started to move, however, the acceleration was quick for a fraction of a second, then the normal F = m*a applied - but with an offset in the system equation. Sometimes simple is not so simple! LoL ",
