            "answer_text": "Why do people fall if they accidentally step on a banana peel? A banana peel is slippery as it has a lower surface tension with than the floor and the structure of fruits is such that they have very weak bonds holding them together. When you apply uneven pressure to the banana by stepping on it, it slides on the floor causing your center of gravity to no longer be under your head and shoulders. Once your center of gravity gets to far from midline you fall. ",
