            "answer_text": "What is redox reaction? \u201cRedox reaction\u201d is a shortened version of \u201cReduction-Oxidation reaction.\u201d In the simplest terms, it refers to the net transfer of one or more electrons from one chemical species (molecule, ion, atom) to another. As an example, the reduction of cerium (IV) and oxidation of Fe(II) is an example of a redox reaction. Ce4+ (aq) + Fe2+ (aq) \u2192 Ce3+ (aq) + Fe3+ (aq) As written, the only change is the transfer of one electron from an iron ion to a cerium ion in aqueous solution. However, iron doesn\u2019t really exist as a \u201cnaked\u201d ion in aqueous solution. Depending on the anions in solution, it will likely be coordinated to form a complex ion, or else surrounded by water molecules in an inner and an outer coordination sphere. See, for example, the following paper: http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/120407/Casas_JM.pdf?sequence=1 My point is that, while useful for educational purposes, simple redox reactions like the one written above do not describe what actually happens in solution very accurately. Sometimes the species that is actually transferred from one ion to another in a redox reaction is an atom such as an oxide anion. The following review article by Dick Holm describes such reactions in considerable detail: Metal-centered oxygen atom transfer reactions As generalized in the article, such reactions may be written as: X + AO \u2192 XO + A As a different example, the following reaction describes (in a simplified way) the reaction of chlorate with sulfite (shown in the protonated form of as sulfurous acid): [ClO3]- + 3 H2SO3 \u2192 Cl- + 3 [SO4]2- + 6 H+ Note that in this reaction, the oxidation state of chlorine in chlorate is +5 and in chloride, it is -1. So, chlorine is reduced by a total of 6 electrons in this reaction. In the case of sulfur, the oxidation state of S in sulfurous acid is +4 and in sulfate is +6. So, each sulfur is oxidized through a net loss of 2 electrons in this reaction. The stoichiometric coefficients in the equation show that 3 sulfurs need to be oxidized for each chlorine that is oxidized. 3 x 2 = 6 hence the reaction is balanced. I used this example to illustrate the potential complexity of redox reactions. In this case, an atom transfer reaction occurs, rather than simple transfer of electrons. (And trust me, there are much more complex reactions that have been studied.) ",

            "answer_text": "The two terms apply to the same phenomena, just with differing levels of scope, which is why your chemist friend would seem to use them interchangeably A redox reaction is an abstract term for the movement of electrons between two substances.  With one substance losing electrons  (meaning the total charge over the substance is now deficient in (negative) electrons, meaning there are more (positive) protons overall, giving the substance an overall positive charge - oxidation)  and another substance gaining electrons  (meaning the total charge over the substance now has surplus of (negative) electrons, meaning there are more (negative) electrons overall, giving the substance an overall negative charge - reduction) These terms oxidation and reduction are a bit archaic, originating from when the process was only understood with the formation of oxides (the addition of oxygen to form an oxygen containing compound, with whatever the oxygen is added to being oxidised and the oxygen being reduced),  a concept which has been expanded to be the more general redox reactions we know today.  There are a number of ways to remember this concept but personally i tend towards OILRIG - Oxidation Is LossReduction Is Gain If the the substances charge has become more positive (electron loss - oxidation) it's oxidation number increases. If the substances charge has become more negative (electron gain - reduction) it's oxidation number decreases. In contrast to this, the electrochemical cell is a more applied/quantified/physical concept in chemistry, which brings in values to denote the amount of energy (electricity) which moves between two substances experiencing a redox reaction.  With voltaic cells proceeding spontaneously and producing electricity by transforming chemical energy into electrical energy (batteries) (positive voltage) and electrolytic cells which require the input of electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (eg. The electrolysis of water to form hydrogen and oxygen gas.) (negative voltage) In short electrochemical cells involve electricity, anodes, cathodes, potentials etc. Redox is more general and focuses on electrons and oxidation numbers, with broader applications (like understanding co-ordination complexes). They are just describing different aspects of the same phenomena, the movement of electrons between different substances.
