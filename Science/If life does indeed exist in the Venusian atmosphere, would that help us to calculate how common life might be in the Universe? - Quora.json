            "answer_text": "Absolutely. We would have two data points instead of one. It would be especially useful if we could get hold of a sample, and see whether it\u2019s related to life on Earth. It has been proven that it is not impossible in principle for life to spread between two nearby planets. If it turns out it\u2019s related to us, then further research will build on that: it is not only theoretically possible, but has actually happened. The odds for life on mars, for instance, will increase drastically, and we\u2019ll probably go look for it. If it turns out it\u2019s not related to us, then we can immediately deduce that life is likely to be extremely common. If it evolved on two separate occasions, and not only that but on the only two planets we\u2019ve been able to investigate so far, that means it probably evolves everywhere it\u2019s possible. We should expect life to be basically everywhere. ",
