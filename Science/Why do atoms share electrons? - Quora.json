            "answer_text": "Beyond the concept of stability, all atoms with Protons have positive charges and those positive charges will attract the nearest particles with a negative charge. Usually, electrons. The charges will balance. Atoms also have Neutrons that are bound to the Protons and these Neutrons hold the protons together despite the fact like charges repel. This balancing act is not quite perfect so atoms of different elements have a tendency to either have an excess or deficit of charge and either easily donate or accept charge with any other charged particles. That\u2019s why they end up sharing electrons. One pair of atoms will have a slight positive charge each and an electron fills that need of both together perfectly, then the atoms share that electron and you get a bond. Some atoms, for instance Carbon, can share up to four electrons. Some, like Nitrogen, can share 3. Or two, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the atoms, have an incomplete last orbit. In order to attain stability, they need to have 8 electrons in the outermost orbit also known as the octet state. Some elements like require 2 electrons in their outer orbit also known as the duplet state. When all the orbitals are completely filled they become stable, and do not take part in further exchange of electrons. The noble gases found on group 18 of the periodic table, have a completely filled orbitals and thus do not take part in a reaction or exhange of electrons. ",
