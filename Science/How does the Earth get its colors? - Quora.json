            "answer_text": "The earth doesn\u2019t get colours nor does anything else. Colour is our brains way of interpreting the different wavelengths and frequencies of light. Without us to interpret them there would be no colours. To elaborate a bit, most of the colours we see are mixtures of colours so they are not pure like the colours of the spectrum. If objects reflect different wavelengths we will see mixtures of them. For example browns are mixtures of reds, yellows, and oranges which may be further muted by blues and greens. As a painter I have to know how to mix the colour needed but I\u2019m always aware that what I paint is an illusion in more ways than one. Look at the green tree. Well it isn\u2019t really green. ",

[1] Blue: oceans (other colours are more strongly absorbed by water) Green: forests (plants absorb red and blue for photosynthesis) Brown: barren or desert areas. Edit: Is white a colour? Then clouds, or ice at the poles! Footnotes[1] http://www.astrobio.net",
