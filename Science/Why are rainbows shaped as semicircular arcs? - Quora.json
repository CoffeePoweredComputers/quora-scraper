            "answer_text": "A rainbow needs two things: water droplets and sunlight. Under the right conditions, each water droplet acts like a prism. This means that when a beam of sunlight hits the droplet, two things can happen: the light will simply pass through, or it will bend, bounce off the surface, and then bend again as it comes out, dispersing the white light into the seven visible colors that make up every rainbow.  A rainbow is not actually shaped like a semicircle or an arc; that is simply the shape that we see. In fact, a rainbow is a circle, but we can\u2019t see the full shape because the horizon cuts off the lower half. However, if you were flying high enough, without any disturbance, then you would be able to see a full rainbow.  The appearance of a rainbow all depends on where you stand. If you move, then the rainbow moves. For every single person, the view will be different. The range of angles at which raindrops reflect is the real reason why rainbows are curved. For you to view a rainbow properly, you have to be standing with the sun behind you and it must be low in the sky. If the sun is too high, then you won\u2019t see anything, and no one wants that! Sunlight (or rather, any form of light) will reflect from the droplet at an angle of 40-42 degrees. If you draw a geometric shape between all the droplets that reflect the rainbow\u2019s light and your eyes, the shape will be a cone with your eyes at one of the two tips; the sun will be situated at the other. Let\u2019s do some creative visualizations to understand this a bit more. Imagine that you\u2019re standing in front of the sun with all the water droplets ahead of you waiting to be struck by sunlight. Sunlight strikes the droplet \u2013 SMACK \u2013 and the colored light we discussed earlier bounces off at an angle of 40-42 degrees in every possible direction. Given that, how do you see the colors? Only the beams that shine directly at you will reveal their colors; in other words, you will see colored light only from those water droplets that are at the proper angle from both you and the sun. The only shape that will allow the light beams to shine on you at that precise angle is an arc or a circle with you at the center! Obviously, we don\u2019t see the full circle because our range of vision is cut off by the horizon.  ",

            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t, always. I was on a road trip in the Summer of 2001, had just snuck my truck over a very steep, hairy, rocky trail which was more than 14,000 ft. high and CLOSED. I'd come out the other side, begun to descend through a twisty aspen forest, when I entered a clearing. I was still up very high, there were sheep everywhere, and the dirt road in front of me headed right through the middle of a \"V\", where two peaks met. Approaching the clearing, I collected my bearings after the death-defying ascent and partially blinding, sun-dappled, strobing light of the forest, then let out a yelp, as I began to take in what I was seeing. Deep blue sky filled the center of the V, between the peaks. And connecting the top of the V, closing it off to become a triangle, was a bright, perfectly horizontal rainbow. I pulled the truck over, jumped out, and began whooping and hollering, kicking up dust. As I danced around in glee, tears streamed down my face from the unexpected beauty. Any rainbow, of course, is a miracle, but I have been fortunate to have spent lots of my life in extreme rainbow zones, seen many perfect doubles, and even triples. I remembered the day on Whidbey Island I saw my first sundog (Sept. 8th, 1987) and almost ran off the road. I hadn't known such a thing existed, but when I asked around after it, I discovered it was a sundog. Since then I've seen hundreds; they\u2019re ridiculously common in the desert. My mind drifted back to what I'd thought then: How is it we adjust to something like a rainbow? There were times when folks less scientifically informed than we are would freak out from witnessing things like rainbows, and lightning, eclipses. Now we just smile, maybe do a little dance, raise our glass, and move on. Early folks who may have freaked from seeing their first rainbows, were already taking in stride the miracle of the rising and setting sun. Though technically a rainbow is far more impressive than a sundog, the fact that I was 32 years old before I ever saw a sundog made all the difference. It was absolutely astounding, broke the rules. But all of the hundreds of sundogs I've seen since have been vertical, and none could hold a candle to this shockingly brilliant horizontal rainbow I was now witnessing. Even so, it was a straight horizontal line, stuck between two steep peaks, and could never be as technically impressive as the tremendous arc of a rainbow. But the fact that I was now 46, and had never seen or heard of such a thing before made it the most special of all. I thought all this while continuing to whoop and holler, spinning til I found the mountain echo to bounce back at me. But as touched as I was by the perfect simplicity of human surprise, the sound of my echo reminded me that I was alone, unable to share my miracle. This road trip of mine had been an escape. Peri-menopausal hormones had suddenly slapped me upside the head, and everyfuckingbody in the world was getting on my nerves. I was in the midst of building my dream house, with close friends, on 150 acres in the middle of nowhere, but began to feel like I was in a fishbowl. So I just took off, had been traveling in the wilderness for about a month, and done whatever I could to avoid human contact. I was using topo maps, and sticking to unmarked dirt roads whenever possible. But now, with this miraculous colored light before me, I felt an overpoweringly primal need to connect. \"Look! Look!\" I shrieked and pointed, \"Everybody, look!\" But I was in the middle of fucking nowhere, with nobody around for lots of miles -- just as I'd ordered it. There was nobody to look, and I didn't have a camera. I certainly wasn't going to leave, with that thing still up in the sky (not overhead, more straight ahead, but then, at that altitude, I, myself, was nearly in the clouds), so I sat on a rock and watched my own private light show grow brighter and more colorful while happy/sad tears ran down my face. I sat on the rock and wrote a poem -- about the sheep and the height, the miracle and my tears -- though, at that time, I hadn't written one in about 20 years. When I finished the poem I leapt up and screamed it into the light, wishing all the more that someone, anyone, were there with me. The magic light didn't show any signs of diminishing, and was still becoming more pronounced. I knew I could never drive away from it, and wondered if I'd be staying until dark. Then, as I was checking my food and water supply, I thought I heard a vehicle approaching from the direction I'd been heading. Sure enough, here came a car! Without thinking, I threw myself in front of it, shrieking, and waving my arms. Although I could not yet see who was driving, I may have never been so glad to see anyone. \u201cEmergency! Emergency!\" I shrieked, \"It's a miracle! Quick, get out!\" (It's times like these I'm glad I'm a woman, and not some big hairy man who'd have been shot ten thousand times in this life by now; but then I'm glad every time I touch myself, too.) It was a young boy driving, hair hanging down the back of his tie-dyed t-shirt, no more than 20 years old. \"What is it, m'am,\" he asked, \"what happened?\" \"Don't fucking 'm'am' me,\" I yelped, \"Look!\" and I spun him around to face the miracle, which was still, 45 minutes later, at least as bright and colorful as when I'd first seen it. \"Holy shit!\" he barked, \"What the fuck is THAT?\" \"A MIRACLE! What the fuck you think it is? Dayum!\" \"Shit! What the fuck?!?!\" he said. \"I'm sayin'! Hey, ya wanna get high?\" The words were out before I'd had a chance to censor them, but it's not likely I would have, as they were the right ones. \"Fuck, yeah!\" he concurred. \"Bout fucking time you showed up,\" I grumbled, as I rummaged through my shit for my stash. I filled the bowl, and gave him the first taste, still left over from the only good thing about the NorthWest. His name was Ben, and he, too, was running away, had picked a shitload of 'shrooms while at Evergreen State College, was taking the Summer off to follow Phish, supporting his travels by selling the 'shrooms at concerts. He hadn't yet told his folks that he wasn't going back to school. And what, I'm supposed to tell him to not be a fool, stay in school? Don't do drugs? This boy was obviously doing everything right in his life or he wouldn't have found himself there, with me, at that moment, witnessing a miracle! Right? He told me about school, and girls, drugs and music, life; I told him about the desert and girls, drugs and music, life. We babbled away, danced, hugged, and gave praise to our special blessing. \"You know what it is?\" I asked. \"No, do you?\" \"It's not a RainBOW, it's a RainARROW!\" \"It is! It is!\" he agreed. We giggled, satisfied, and re-lit. When the rainarrow's brightness began to diminish, we sat still and watched, both silently weeping a little. It felt like the saddest sunset of all time, as though we were the last around to witness the end of what had been a pretty spectacular world in its day. Of course we waited until there was no trace left of the thing at all, though we'd discussed the possibility that it may be sadder to do so. By then it was getting dark, and neither of us knew where we'd spend the night, though we did know we were headed in opposite directions. I told him he couldn't possibly traverse what I just had, in the dark, but he assured me he was planning to set up camp before descending. There was a town about 20 or 30 miles down, in my direction, he said. \"Wait! Before you go, I wanna read you something,\" and I read him the poem I'd written right before he showed up. \"Wow,\" he said, \"that's fucking beautiful.\" \"Yeah? Thanks. You're my son, you know.\" \"I know.\" We hugged again, and he left. I stayed until it was too dark to even think about writing, and then I left, too. Aftermath: Years later, back home, alone, in my by then completed wonderland, a world in which I\u2019d frequently witnessed all the other most spectacular rainbows of my life, a similar amazement occurred. Somewhere I have pictures, as proof, but I can\u2019t scroll through over 40,000 of them again, after just doing that yesterday to find the one of Tim. From my front stoop, I watched a rainbow arc across the valley in front of me, a common location for them. And then, I shit you not, I watched it fall. It didn\u2019t diminish in color or brightness, but simply fell to the ground, losing its arc as it did so. It just lay there strewn across the valley for a while, before eventually paling away. Poor little rainbow. So you see, not only don\u2019t all rainbows come in arch form, but some that begin that way go straight, and fall from grace. Like so many other things, rainbows, apparently, are on a spectrum.  ",
