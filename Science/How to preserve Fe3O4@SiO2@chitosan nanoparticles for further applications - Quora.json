            "answer_text": "In response to A2A, I have no specialist knowledge in this area but I found a relevant study: Stability of Chitosan\u2014A Challenge for Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Applications Despite the fact that chitosan is a unique and versatile compound, widely used in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields, there are hardly any available pharmaceutical products based on chitosan (only hemostatic dressings, preparations for wound-healing and nutraceutical products exist) (Table 2). This might be a result of the strong hygroscopic nature of chitosan and the fact that chitosan material extracted from various sources differs significantly in terms of its molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, degree of deacetylation, and purity level. Additionally, the high susceptibility of chitosan to environmental factors and processing conditions (such as heating or freezing) can impose stress on its structure and cause polymer degradation (Figure 1).  Based on the likely routes of degradation, which depend on water and oxygen, I would suggest the best way to preserve your material is to first dry it in a vacuum dessicator. When thoroughly dried store it under nitrogen, perhaps with a dessicant like silica gel in a porous bag, in the same container but physically separate. ",
