            "answer_text": " I am a big fan of Albert Einstein and though I have several engineering degrees, the reason I am such a big fan is not why he was so famous. The wisdom of Albert Einstein goes way beyond his scientific achievements. Let\u2019s start with why he is famous and then I\u2019ll explain why I am such an admirer. Here is a short review of why he was so famous. He was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, effecting a revolution in physics. For this achievement, he is often regarded as the father of modern physics and the most influential physicist of the 20th century. While best known for his mass-energy formula E = mc2(often dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\"),[he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory within physics. Very impressive indeed, but not why I am such a big fan. To see his true wisdom and value you must study the man. I group his wisdom and value into 6 interesting categories. I will use these 6 categories to highlight Einstein\u2019s true wisdom: His Personality While having a strong will, Einstein was very humble and attributed his talent to his passionate curiosity and imagination. He felt both were more important than knowledge. His view of was that the true sign of intelligence was not knowledge but imagination and believed that the only source of knowledge was experience. Views on Life A focus on simplicity was one of his main tenets and though his skill in physics was renown, he believed everything that can be counted did not necessarily count and that everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted. He believed in being a giver\u2026 only a life lived for others was a life worthwhile. Einstein was often frustrated with the state of his times and felt that the world would require a substantially new manner of thinking to survive. He felt that the world was dangerous not because evil people but because of people who recognize the evil, yet do nothing about it. His characterization of the age was that world leaders had developed a perfection of means yet had a significant confusion of ends. Views on Creativity His thought was felt that imagination was more valuable than logic \u2026 logic could get you from A to B, but imagination could take you everywhere. He was an early believer in trying many new things and not fearing mistakes \u2026 felt that someone who never made a mistake never tried new things. His view was any intelligent fool could make things bigger and more complex, but the genius and courage were in heading in the opposite direction. Problem Solving Thinking Einstein believed that if he was given 20 hours to solve a problem, he would spend 18 hours on understanding the problem and 2 hours on the solution. That is one of my favorite lessons from this thinker. He didn\u2019t think he was that smart, it\u2019s just that he had the skill of persistence to stay with problems longer than most people. Maintained a strong belief on the necessity of eliminating biases to be able to look for what is and not for what they should be. Always stated that problems required a new level of consciousness beyond the one that created the problem \u2026 he was a big proponent of change. Education Views Einstein was not a proponent of the education systems of his day. He used to say that one\u2019s education was what was left after one had forgotten what one learned had learned in school. He also felt that it was a miracle that any curiosity was able to survive formal education. His Sense of Humor He often stated that his secret to creativity was knowing how to hide his sources. The difference between stupidity and genius he felt was that genius had its limits ... and liked to say that only 2 things were infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and he wasn\u2019t sure about the former. Finally, he was a very observant person and noted that as he got more and more famous he got, the more and more stupid he also became. That he said was a very common phenomenon. So maybe you\u2019ll agree with me about the wisdom of Albert Einstein, eh? What is most amazing to me is the fact that most of his wisdom is more applicable in today\u2019s society than it was in his. He was always considered ahead of his time, wasn\u2019t he?

            "answer_text": "I think there is an effect of \"celebrity\". Ordinary folks know Albert Einstein and talk about Einstein, but they talk about Einstein, because they know only Einstein.  Do people know Hermann Minkowski, whose student Einstein was? Minkowski space-time space ideas were critical contributions to general relativity.  What about Berhnhard Riemann? A poor German fella who developed a new geometry. His work was rejected by every scientist, every university. Everybody thought his ideas were plain stupid: a straight line in curved space? Just have a curve in a straight space. Riemann died at age of 39 in poverty, unknown, unrecognized. His works allowed the development of relativity theory. Isaac Newton was so ahead of his time, that he was writing books without publishing them, claiming (and rightfully), that scientists of his time won't simply understand them. I think the most famous scientist is Leonard Euler, Beethoven of mathematics. Euler was blind for last 10 years of his life and was still working, writing books by dictating to his assistants. Euler produced so many formulas, theorems, that in many books they were often named not after Euler but after other mathematicians to avoid confusion. List of things named after Leonhard Euler What about Carl Friedrich Gauss? List of things named after Carl Friedrich Gauss These scientists were huge, but ordinary folks know Einsten, because they know Einstein. Many people don't even understand whatta heck is Relativity Theory about and how it helps them in their ordinary lives. ",
