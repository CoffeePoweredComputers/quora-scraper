            "answer_text": "Elements with lower atomic numbers are more common because universe started with only Hydrogen. In the centre of Star two hydrogen nucleus are fused into helium nucleus. Hydrogen has atomic number as One. That means Hydrogen has only one proton in nucleus. To form element with higher atomic number, you have to fuse Other smaller atomic number elements so they add up. This process is called nucleosynthesis. The process of forming new elements is still on inside every star. It takes time and requires huge energy to complete such process. Over period of time, stars  contains variety of element as they cooked. But as higher atomic number element are formed, star becomes unstable and explodes. But hydrogen still remains and as of today  hydrogen is most abundant in Universe. After star explodes, a smaller star starts Same process and remaining matter forms planets and further chemical reaction forms molecules and higher order compounds. All living Creatures are mostly made up of carbon and hydrogen and Other elements with atomic number less than 10. ",

            "answer_text": "excellent summary by raman. i just want to add a tiny note.  for lighter elements, the dominant mode is fusion. their fission energy is a lot higher. however once you get in the neighborhood of iron, it becomes easier to fission than to fuse. and thus fission becomes the dominant mechanism of nuclear reactions. it is thus extremely difficult(or impossible? don't remember) to get higher than iron by simple fusion. so that is a reason for the relatively poorer concentrations of elements higher than iron.  source: half remembered lectures of nuclear physics. how are elements higher than iron synthesized? don't remember that at all.
