            "answer_text": "Prior: I think there are bears in these woods. There definitely aren\u2019t any tigers. Data: I saw something move over there. Something big. Hypothesis: IT\u2019S A BEAR! Alternative hypothesis: IT\u2019S A TIGER! Null hypothesis: No you fool, it\u2019s a bush. Bayes\u2019 theorem: I saw something big moving. Bears are big things that move: so are tigers. But there aren\u2019t any tigers around here, and there are bears. But - then again - there are a *lot* of big things around here and I do occasionally see them move. Interim conclusion, updated prior: Given that I believe that there are bears in these woods and that there aren\u2019t tigers, and my new piece of evidence that I may have seen something bear-sized moving over there, I am now worried that there genuinely is a bear. Measurement: I will keep an eye out for bears. New data: THERE! SOMETHING MOVED! Bayes\u2019 theorem: I think there\u2019s a bear over there. If there was a bear moving over there and it moved, I\u2019d have seen it. I saw a thing moving over there. But a lot of things move. I\u2019m not 100% certain. New conclusion: Reject null hypothesis with reasonable odds, certainly compared to risk of staying this close to a bear. Executive summary: Cheese it, there\u2019s a bear! ",

Put a camera in the canteen to watch the coffee makerPeriodically analyze the sodium and/or ascorbic-acid content of the coffee, compared to a carafe that I watch get made from start-to-finishI can then turn this into a theory, if I have done the measurements and the observations match my conjecture. Otherwise, it fails. ",
