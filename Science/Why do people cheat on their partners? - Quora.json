            "answer_text": "Question being addressed: How do people cheat on one another? Hi. I\u2019m Kristin, and I\u2019m going to take you on a journey about how I almost cheated on my husband, whom I love more than life, and to whom I am very attracted, even after 19 years together. If you aren\u2019t in the mood to read mild erotica with some swear words, now would be the time to back away slowly. I\u2019m going to use words to convey the intensity of the situation, and it\u2019s going to get steamy. So I was coming back from my therapist\u2019s office in a nearby city, and I needed to pick up some things for dinner. There was a grocery store (name omitted) right down the street, so I stopped in and got the things I needed. The cashier was chatty and got me to sign up for their points program and whatnot. I casually mentioned to her that my very first boyfriend used to manage a (name of grocery store) in another city nearby. I told her his name. She smiled and said, \u201cWant me to page him?\u201d I was surprised, to say the least. I said, \u201cSure!\u201d I happened to think I looked cute that day, so what the heck. Why not say hi to the ex, right? He appeared and smiled a huge smile, hugging me warmly. We did the whole, \u201cHow\u2019ve you been!\u201d \u201cYou look great!\u201d \u201cWhat a nice surprise!\u201d thing that one does. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019m about to leave for the day, actually. Want to grab a bite next door? They have good food and I could go for a beer.\u201d I thought, well\u2026none of my stuff needs refrigeration, so why not. I have some time before I have to make dinner anyway. We both drove over to the bar he mentioned, and we settled in, ordering beers and some food. Before I continue, let me set the stage for you. This man and I were first lovers together. We went together for over 4 years, from when I was 16 to 21. We almost married. He dumped me, and I cried so hard I gave myself a sinus infection. I am now in my 50\u2019s. He\u2019s 3 years older than I am. So we\u2019re showing each other pics of our grandkids, and we\u2019re talking about our families, and about cool vacations we\u2019ve taken and all that stuff. He told me about his dog that just died and I consoled him a bit. Oh. I haven\u2019t told you yet about how he looks. This will flesh out the story for you. This guy is 6\u20194, with piercing blue eyes and dark brown hair, which is now speckled attractively with the prettiest color silver imaginable. He has clearly stayed in shape, because he still has shoulders like a damn jungle gym and a waist just as lean as when he was 24. He looks at me with the hypnotic baby blues and says, his voice dropping lower, \u201cDo you remember my \u201976 Ford Elite?\u201d Dude, I thought\u2026If you are referring to the classic automobile in the back seat of which I had my first orgasm with a man, then yeah, IT RINGS A BELL (to turn a phrase). Sheesh. I looked at him, taking a sip of my beer. \u201cRoomy back seat, as I recall,\u201d I said. \u201cI still occasionally dream about that car, as a matter of fact.\u201d Stupid, I know, but there we were. He looked at me intensely. \u201cYou still dream about THE CAR, huh?\u201d His eyes twinkled playfully at me. I scooted up a bit closer to the table and said, \u201cWell, you know, you always remember your first, um, CAR.\u201d He said, \u201cAs I recall, it as also MY first\u2026uh, car, as well.\u201d (laughter) He scooted closer too, and grinned, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have licenses yet, only learner\u2019s permits, but we figured it out, didn\u2019t we?\u201d I started to squirm, and said, \u201cMany trips in that car, my friend. Many trips.\u201d So now we had the car metaphor going strong. And in my mind, I am suddenly transported back to 1982. It wasn\u2019t difficult, because the damn bar was playing \u201880\u2019s music (of course, right?). Return to that innocent time with me, folks. Here we go. I was, uh\u2026bracing my right foot on the ceiling of the back seat of the car (ahem), and my red high heel snagged the fabric on the ceiling, so when I took my foot down, the pump stayed stuck to the ceiling of the already rocking vehicle. I\u2019m watching the shoe swaying precariously, and hoping it doesn\u2019t come loose and clonk him on the back, but I don\u2019t want him to stop because I\u2019m about to WA-BAM, see colors and swear in Sanskrit. I literally retired the shoes out of reverence after that. Back then I didn\u2019t understand about clearing energy from objects, so I\u2019m sure some poor woman put those suckers on in the Goodwill and keeled over like a fainting goat. So now I\u2019m sitting in the bar with this man, and we\u2019ve suddenly gone from grandchildren to me wanting to bang him nine ways from Sunday. I didn\u2019t even know what had really happened. I start getting montaged with all these scenes from our 4-and-a-half-year relationship, when we went from nervous teenagers to THROWING DOWN with each other for HOURS. Two years in, we were marathon grappling like a well-oiled machine. The scenes are flying in and out of my head so fast that I\u2019m reeling, and trying to keep my shit in a group so as not show that I\u2019m so turned on I can\u2019t even deal with it. Try to blink and suddenly I\u2019m not in the bar, I\u2019m in his apartment, repeatedly smacking my forehead on his gorgeous abdomen. It was so intense. Scenes upon scenes. I remembered the exact taste of a drop of sweat that I once stretched my neck to catch in my mouth as it dripped from his forehead. I was consciously not crossing my legs for fear of having an orgasm right there in the bar. Shout out to shy guys at strip clubs. I feel your pain, man. And he started pushing all of my buttons. He knew exactly where they were because he personally installed them in 1982. He is the reason I need to be roughed up and have my hair pulled. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t still have that car, but we could, you know\u2026maybe take a cruise in a rental. For\u2026old times\u2019 sake?\u201d (intense eye contact) I swallowed hard, and looked at him. \u201cWe\u2019re both married. It\u2019s wrong,\u201d I squeaked. He took a swig of his beer. \u201cMy wife will never know. Your husband will never know.\u201d It became clear to me that this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d stepped out on her. I have never cheated on my husband. See, this man did me dirty by cranking up my factory settings to \u201cDemi-God\u201d straight out the gate, and now mere mortal men can\u2019t really impress me much. I enjoy sex with my husband. It\u2019s wonderful. But it\u2019s not as intense as were my experiences with my first lover. Save the best for first, right? He naturally mastered me back then, and quickly picked up how to deftly handle my bells and whistles. He used words to drive me out of my mind. Not just, \u201cdo you like that?\u201d It was more like, \u201cThank you for the beautiful fuck, baby. So good. Relax your legs; I\u2019m going to go hard on you now. You ready?\u201d And then he\u2019d flip me over like I was nothing and I\u2019d silently scream and writhe like a butterfly on a stick pin, for what seemed like hours, but was probably much shorter in mundane reality. \u201cCum pretty for me, beautiful girl\u201d I obliged him, every time. Not sure about the pretty part, but that\u2019s subjective, I guess. Together we learned to string my orgasms together like the knotted pearls he gave me for my 18 th birthday. Then there was the night that butter brickle ice cream became an official sex toy. This is the man who taught me that I love marathon blow jobs, which is still my favorite thing in the entire universe, and few men can do that. We would breathe together to delay his orgasms and I would do it until he begged me to end him. He never swore more than when I was going down on him. \u201cGod damnit, you beautiful little bitch\u201d \u201cFuck. FUCK\u201d And I would swoon with pleasure, high as a kite on his gorgeous life force. I even came once while doing it. But I guess I should get back to the bar. Sorry\u2026I just got carried away there. I am in the bar, still attempting to control my thoughts, and he\u2019s trying to lovingly, seductively persuade me to acquiesce to his desires. \u201cYou\u2019re still so beautiful, babe. God, I miss you so much sometimes. I want to make you happy\u2026.\u201d I picture my husband\u2019s face. I try to drive out the erotic energy that\u2019s viciously consuming me. I had a realization that shit was about to get real. I was considering this very seriously, and I didn\u2019t want to lose my wonderful marriage, or hurt his wife of 30 years. We both have families who need our marriages to stay together. I felt desperate anxiety shoot through me. I had one thought. Get the fuck out of there before he leaves, because if we leave together, I\u2019m toast. This is how lives get ruined. This is how marriages get wrecked. This is it, right here, people. I managed to get out a polite thank you for the food and the beer, but I must go home now. I stood up carefully and kind of crippled my way to my car. I started it and drove a few blocks, then turned on a side street and parked. I sobbed. I\u2019m talking wracking, wrenching sobs, like when my mother died. It lasted for a good ten minutes. I felt like the lowest piece of shit imaginable. I felt like I had actually done it. When I arrived at home, I\u2019m sure I looked like Marilyn Manson emerging from a monsoon. My face was puffy and my eyes were red. I had mascara on my chin. My husband took one look at me and rushed up to grab my shoulders. \u201cWhat happened? Who hurt you?\u201d He is very protective. Always has been. He loves me. I said, \u201cNo one hurt me. I just\u2026need you.\u201d He put his arms around me and swayed me gently. Then he tipped my chin up to look in my eyes, and I saw recognition unfolding in his. There was no jealousy, no anger. There was empathy. It was then that I realized that my husband had some experience turning down sexy women. He knew by my condition, the fact that I was shaking, that I had not cheated on him. He leaned down and whispered in my ear, \u201cLet\u2019s fix it.\u201d Still holding me, he walked me to our bedroom. And there, a husband made slow, intense love to his wife. Cum pretty for me, baby I am never stepping foot in that goddamned store ever again. ",
