            "answer_text": "Scientists do not seem to know how to correlate the brain with any type of magical activity in the body. This may be because magic is rare, because most bodies are very basic, or because the degree of correlation for magic is pretty demanding. However, scientists do know that the body does some pretty magical things like synthesizing proteins and eliminating some types of toxins, as well as thinking and learning, although thinking is not yet fully understood. Scientists seem to know quite a lot about how hormones and genetics work, although it seems to me there is not a great deal of coherence about the meaning of it all. Evolution is still influential, and a good part of science goes into curing problems that seem fundamentally random or simply unfortunate. Perhaps it would be better if science tried to explain the value systems behind particular physical configurations, and the psychology behind developing problems. The psychology of problems may exist for the purpose of earning money from government, earning pity from relatives, as a form of self- or social-punishment, or because the things which seemed good were not available (that is, because of being idealistic and unrealistic, or because of a value system). There are complex problems in synthesizing knowledge, and as far as evidence-based research goes, it is fairly remarkable what has been accomplished. But it is likely large part of what is significant for individuals will remain proprietary and out-of-reach until there is something more serious for scientists to make proprietary. For example, perhaps some type of resource management or civilization-building. I personally think some things like inventing slinkies or band-aids could still be highly influential. It was only recently that someone invented an ironing board that doubles as a mirror. There is hope for radical changes, but whether science will accept it is another matter. It seems to me that there is far more room for radical theses than most scientists will admit. Simply because inventions are simple and some simple inventions have not yet been invented doesn\u2019t mean that there is no room for unusual hypotheses. So, that\u2019s my input. ",

            "answer_text": "College human anatomy textbooks are typically revised every three years, with dozens of changes. People tell me, \u201cSurely the body doesn\u2019t change that quickly!\u201d Answer: No, but our understanding of it does. Just recently, new imaging techniques have led to changes in our understanding of whether the human brain has lymphatic vessels and where most blood platelets are produced, for example. So even in a field like anatomy, where you wouldn\u2019t expect much change from year to year, we are learning all the time, constantly improving our understanding of the body as we learn new ways to examine it from whole-body imaging down to the molecular level. And as for how the body works\u2014the physiology of it\u2014don\u2019t even get me started! There is so much we don\u2019t know yet, and so much new understanding coming out every week. Scientists are going to have their work cut out for them for a long, long time to come. ",
