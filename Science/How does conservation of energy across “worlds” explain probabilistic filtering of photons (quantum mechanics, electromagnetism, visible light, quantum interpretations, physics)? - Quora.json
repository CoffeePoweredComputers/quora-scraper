            "answer_text": "In modern physics, for every new study for which there is no answer, a theory or branching out of any of the existing leading theories is created. Now I'm creating a New Unity Physics. She's the beginning of the Theory of Everything. Theory of All is a famous name, and it should be called the Model of All. In this New Physics, all processes in nature are defined as cyclical. Every existing thing has its place in nature. All cycles have a similar development, which is determined by the Model of Unity and the Standard Model for the Circle in nature. There is no cycle that makes an exception. No theories are needed here to explain any research. On the contrary, after new research has been done, these models show what development is going forward. The main dimensions in New Physics are not \"fictional\". They also develop cyclically, and their definitions correspond to the cycle in nature. The new Physics does not divide the circuit doors into the micro world, the universe, and the macro world. She accepts that physical laws are the same everywhere. Your question adheres to quantum theory. In The New Physics, theories don't exist. Although not accurate, the questions answered by quantum theory and string theory are already answered by the definitions of the basic physical dimensions and by the Standard Circular Pattern. In the New Physics of Unity, four basic physical dimensions are defined. In order of creation, these are Time, Worlds, Space, and Phenomena. These physical dimensions are related to each other, through the law of conversion. Basic physical magnitudes Definition of the new physic term Vsetzialoto: Vsetzialoto defines space and nature as one single live organism, which has all the forms of energy and matter, necessary for its existence. The terms are composed of the Slavic words for \"all\" (vse), \"whole\" (tzialo), and the suffix \"to\" meaning the only, the one, the unique, and the supreme. On one hand, Vsetzialoto includes terms such as the Microworld, the Universe, and Macro world on the other hand Vsetzialoto is divided into several (nine) levels. The existence and development of this organism are a result of distinct processes from each level, which have a similar nature. All levels are connected in this organism and are dependent on one another. Time in the Vsetzialoto is the common magnitude on all the levels and it can measure each of them. Time in the Vsetzialoto is created by dark energy, and therefore it only goes forward. On each level there is a particular life cycle, all life cycles are common throughout the different levels. The known planets, stars, galaxies, and nebulae have particular functions in this organism. Vsetzialoto is an expression of the development of space independence with time. Time Time is a tangible value. It is primordial and everything is born of it. It is the root cause of the creation of Worlds, Space, and Phenomena. Time can be divided into nine cycles. Every cycle can be measured as time is measured on Earth. There is no physical barrier between the separate levels. Each of the nine cyclical times forms its own Space. The nature of dark energy was defined as the breath of Vsetzialoto. Time is an expression of the breath of Vsetzialoto, so it only goes forward. Worlds The new concept of Worlds expresses the unity of matter and energy at each individual level in the Vsetzialoto. There are nine Worlds. They are converted into Phenomena. The Worlds are a system with dynamic characteristics! Each World has a specific matter and specific energy. Matter and energy depend only on Time because only it exists before their manifestation. One specific Phenomenon is created at each level of the Worlds. There is no World without Phenomenons and there can be no Phenomenon without Worlds. Space Space is a form and structure with static characteristics and it has seven dimensions. Each cyclical Time forms a particular Space so that in Vsetzialoto nine levels in Space can be distinguished, between which there is no physical boundary. Each level of Space has its own World and its Phenomenon. Time and Space are the dimensions by which Phenomena are measured. In the Model of Unity, the Solar system which is part of the universe is looked at as a special point in the cosmos. This would apply that the universe in its nature is anisotropic and heterogeneous. Phenomena Phenomena are a new physical concept. They have converted Worlds. Their number is nine. They are manifested by their frequency, which is the number of repetitions over a period of time, and by their specific particles. A circle at each level represents a change of Space from one initial state of an existing World to its transformation into a new World. This new World begins its converted as the old World began. During this circle and Space \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u044a\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442. Each World is converted into Phenomena according to the Space of the existing circle. Each Phenomenon has two specific fundamental frequencies, from which the whole phenomenon Phenomena. A new Model of Frequency is expected to determine the fundamental frequencies of each of the nine Phenomena in the Vsetzialoto. The specific carriers of each Phenomenon are defined as particles. Each individual carrier of the Phenomenon, regardless of the level in the Vsetzialoto, can be defined as a \u201cmale particle\u201d or a \u201cfemale particle\u201d. ",
