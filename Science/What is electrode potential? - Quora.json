            "answer_text": "Electrical potential (commonly known as Voltage) is the strength of the push or pull on electrons by the reactants in a redox reaction (reaction that involves transfer of electrons). In a redox reaction, the reactant undergoing oxidation (loss of electron) is the anode and the reactant undergoing reduction (gain of electrons) is the cathode. Now electrical potential of an electrode is by convention the measure of how strong is the electrode\u2019s pull on the electrons. And because the cathode tends to undergo reduction, ie, it\u2019s tendency is to pull electrons towards itself, by convention, electrode potential is the measure of the tendency to gain electrons (ie undergo reduction). When you hear the term electrode potential, by convention it means reduction potential (potential or tendency to undergo reduction). That is why if the E\u00b0 value is positive it means tendency to undergo reduction is high. If it\u2019s negative it means the tendency to undergo reduction is low, ie, tendency to oxidise is high. Therefore, the negative of the reduction potential is called the oxidation potential. The electrode potential of an electrode when measured under standard conditions is called the Standard Electrode Potential or Standard Reduction Potential. I hope this explains what Electrode Potential really means :) ",

            "answer_text": "When a metal is placed in a solution of its ions, the metal acquires either a positive or negative charge with respect to the solution. On account of this, a definite potential difference is developed between the metal and the solution. This potential difference is called electrode potential. In order to compare the electrode potentials of various electrodes, it is necessary to specify the concentration of the ions present in a solution in which the electrode is dipped and the temperature of the half-cell. The potential difference developed between the metal electrode and the solution of its ions of unit molarity (1M) at 25\u00b0C (298 K) is called standard electrode potential. According to the IUPAC convention, the reduction potential alone be called as the electrode potential (EO), i.e., the given value of electrode potential be regarded as reduction potential unless it is specifically mentioned that it is oxidation potential. The standard reduction potential of an electrode means that the reduc\u00adtion reaction is taking place at the electrode. If the reaction is reversed and written as oxidation reaction, the numerical value of electrode potential will remain the same but the sign of standard potential will have to be reversed.
