            "answer_text": "Research is about getting as close to the truth as possible. First, a researcher poses a question that somehow fits into the framework of established science. Second, they come up with a guess, or hypothesis, as to what the answer may be based on their prior knowledge of the subject. Then, they attempt to find evidence in support of or against this theoretical answer. This is done through observation and experimentation. I\u2019ve worked as a researcher in both a lab setting and a clinical setting. In the clinical setting, questions are at least a little more general and easy to understand so I\u2019ll use my clinical research as the example. Since I worked in oncology research, the majority of the time the hypothesis was that some drug or drug combination would be more effective than some other drug in the treatment of a specific type of cancer. To prove this, we found patients that fit into set criteria (cancer type, age, concomitant conditions, etc.) and enrolled them into studies. We would then track their progress over the course of their treatment by inputting their lab values and information from each of their visits into a database. Then, this data would be processed down the line and eventually a paper would be written consisting of what amounts to an argument for why that drug or drug combination works or not. Ultimately, the purpose of the oncology research in which I participated was to find more effective treatments for cancer. Other research may have other purposes like developing a lightweight and durable material or figuring out how some specific protein effects some chemical pathway in the body. ",
