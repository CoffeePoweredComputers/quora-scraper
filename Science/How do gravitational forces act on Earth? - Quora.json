            "answer_text": "How do gravitational forces act on Earth? Our best theory of gravity is the General Theory of Relativity. You will recall that in the Theory of Special Relativity we noticed that at high speeds, (speeds approaching the speed of light), time slows and length contracts. Remember that we can also analyze speed as kinetic energy, therefore we might say that Special Relativity says that at high kinetic energies time slows and space contracts. We also know that mass and energy are related through E=m*c^2. So if energy (in the form of kinetic energy) causes time to slow and space to contract, then we should not be surprised to find that mass (which is after all another form of energy) also causes space to contract and time to dilate. Further if space contracts and time dilates due to mass, it seems appropriate to say that spacetime warps due to the proximity of mass. Gravity then might be described as an object following the straightest possible line through spacetime. According to Newtonian mechanics, an object continuing along a straight line with no force feels no acceleration. The feeling of no acceleration is exactly the feeling during free fall, following the geodesic path through spacetime. But the frame of reference to which we are relating (the surface of the Earth) is in close approximation a Euclidean spacetime (Earth as a globe is true but only a much larger scale). In Newtonian terms (every object will remain in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force) our deviation from the \u201cstraight\u201d geodesic line prescribed by curved spacetime is the \u201cforce\u201d we feel as gravity.

            "answer_text": "Gravity has never been explained in a way that can be understood by everybody. For a long time it was simply acceoted as a part of the physics of the Universe that caused bodies of mass to accelerate toward a larger mass. The force was accepted as simply there and the study of the way in which bodies of mass fell, followed a trajectory or encircled a larger body did not lead to any explanation as to crested the force. The fact that planets and moons have orbits that are accelerations toward the central body that are inversely proportional to the distance suggested that there was an energy flow outward in all directions and lead to the idea of particles or waves being emitted from the central mass in all durations or that there is an energy field around a body that is distributed as an equal energy to each circle of the field. The problems with these distributions of energy are that the acceleration is independent of the shape and size of the bodies and depends only on their mass. The energy particles have never been measured, the energy waves have been found from far distances and the energy field has not been identified other than by the acceleration. There is no explanation for gravity other than it exists. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravitational force is result of the flow of Gravitons between interacting gravitational fields. Gravitational fields are caused by the distortion in the fabric of space, Gravitons are the virtual Particles which are responsible for the gravitational force just like virtual photons are responsible for the electromagnetic force. The question is what are Gravitons made of? According to the new thoughts experiments as shown below, the fabric of space are made of Hexagon Loops of energy called Space Particles. When different gravitational fields interact with each other, the strings of energy making the Space Particles clouds start to move between the interacting fields leading to the creation of the gravitational attractions.see the extract below: 1) The geometry of the space particles (SP) and the creation of the gravitational force.How do we explain Gravity at the micro and macro levels?The search for an explanation to the meaning of gravity is still ongoing. Newton described it as a gravitational pull between two objects in direct relations to their mass and in reverse relationship to the square distance between them. This gravitational pull is measured in terms of the weight of the objects. An astronaut in space will be weightless while his mass is the same as on earth. Einstein on the other hand defined gravity as a result of the distortion in the curvature of fabric of space-time according to his general theory of relativity. Still more recent theories of gravity explain the phenomenon in terms of particles and waves. String theory states that particles called \u201cgravitons\u201d (have never been observed) causes objects to be attracted to one another similar to the role played by virtual photons. Other theories speak of the existence of gravitational waves generated when an object is accelerated by an external force. They are in fact ripples in the curvature of spacetime generated due to certain gravitational interactions and propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light. The Singularities and Space Particles Theory speculates that gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation, a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation. The existence of gravitational waves have been confirmed in 2016.The Loop quantum gravity theory merges quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is a theory of discrete quantized units of space time because, according to general relativity, gravity is a manifestation of the geometry of spacetime. It is the leading competitor to string theory. The main output of the theory is a physical picture of granular space. The granularity is a direct consequence of quantization. Here, it is space itself that is discrete. In other words, there is a minimum distance possible to travel through it. More precisely, space can be viewed as an extremely fine fabric or network \"woven\" of finite loops. These networks of loops are called spin networks. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the Planck length, which is approximately 10\u221235 meters. According to the theory, there is no meaning to distance at scales smaller than the Planck scale. Therefore, the Singularities and Space Particles Theory predicts that not just matter, but space itself, has an atomic structure..So, it is safe to say that our thought experiments regarding the existence of SP are in line with many aspects of the Loop Quantum Gravity. Referring to the above literature, we can speculate that Gravity at the micro level is nothing but the manifestation of the bending and twisting of the space particles as they interact with the Fermion Particles, in particular the Quarks due to their non-integer charges. As each Quark has a total of six spinners made of positive and negative charges, their 6 different combinations and permutations (within the nucleus of each Quark) are responsible for the creation of the strong force confinement. The creation of the confinement provided the answer to the theoretical 6 dimensions predicted by the String (M) theory. As these micro dimensions are created, the shrinkage and distortion in the hexagonal geometry of the space particles manifest itself as the change in the curvature of the fabric of space at the subatomic level, hence gravity. Using this line of thinking, we can conclude that Gravity at the macro level is nothing but the cumulative shrinkage and distortions in the curvature of the fabric of space affected by the total atoms which make up the mass of the object in question. This is what make gravity between two objects proportional to their mass and in reverse relationship with the square distance between them.We have seen that all matters are nothing but a manifestation of the total excitation of the energy fields that permeate throughout spacetime generated by the interactions of the Fermion particles making up the objects with the relevant SP. These energy field excitations are responsible for the creation of mass and also responsible for the curvature of spacetime. This curvature/ distortion is referred to as the mass gravitational field. So, gravitational attractions between two object exist whenever their gravitational fields interact with each other. This interaction leads some of the energy making up the excitation fields of the relevant masses to flow between them. This flowing energy is what is termed as gravitons. It is responsible for the gravitational attractions between objects in the same way as virtual photons are responsible for the magnetic attractions. As to the creation of Gravitational waves, the movement of massive objects at a very high speed lead to measurable disturbances in the fabric of space, as some SP go back to their Hexagon geometry while others assume the excited state required for the continuous manifestation of the moving mass. We speculate that gravity is the weaker of the 4 forces due to the absences of any role played by the spinners.If Gravity is associated with the very existence of atoms, i.e. the creation of the observable mass and volume, then it is unthinkable to neutralize gravity. Without gravity, the cosmic dust would have not gathered to form stars and planets. However, one question remains valid. If gravity is the result of the shrinkage/ distortion in the fabric of space, and if gravitational attraction is the flow of gravitons then is it possible to create some mechanism to block the movement of the gravitons or to neutralize the distortions in the curvature of the fabric of space ",

This question has puzzled man for his entire existence, until Isaac Newton answered the question about 1700 with his famous formula:  It is said he tied together the action of the falling apple (here on earth) with the moon orbiting the earth. He developed an equation that explained both at the same time. John Walker (at Fourmilab) wondered about this as well, and developed an experiment to see this for himself. See: Bending Spacetime in the Basement where he replicates the experiments of Henry Cavendish, this article is a good read, with videos of masses attracting other masses. The answer to this experiment is the G in the above formula. ",

            "answer_text": "It is believed that anything that possess mass posses a quantum particle called graviton inside its nucleus. This particle attracts other gravitons and has no repulsive force hence any two bodies, however far will apply gravitational pull towards each other! Simply put, the more the mass of the object, the higher the gravitational pull. But the trick here is that the force exerted by the two objects will be equal. F=m.a (F is force, m mass, a acceleration). Hence the body with the lower mass will have greater acceleration and henceforth greater displacement.  This means that you and earth exert equal forces on each other but because of its massive mass, earth's displacement is negligible. The same logic applies to the moon and the sun. The sun's mass is about 333,000 times that of earth so it causes the earth to revolve around the sun even though earth exerts the same amount of gravitational pull! Hope I cleared some of your doubts. You should read about the large hadron collider experiment to discover different quantum particles if you want to know more. ",
