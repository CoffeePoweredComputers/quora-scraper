            "answer_text": "It is formed as a gas. However, if the conditions allow (temperature and pressure low enough), it will condense to a liquid. For example, Take a strong sealed container containing the correct ratio (2 moles H2, 1 mole O2) with a spark plug inside. Create a spark. The reaction generates significant heat, and 2 moles water. Notice that the reaction starts with 3 moles of gas. So if the water stayed as a gas, once the container gave up the heat and returned to the starting temperature, the container would be at a vacuum. However, what you would see is the temperature and pressure rise very quickly, an \u201cexplosion\u201d. However, as the container cools to ambient temperature, the pressure becomes lower. If the ambient temperature is below the boiling point of water (at the pressure inside the container), the water will condense to a liquid. In terms of heat energy, allowing it to condense is most efficient. You have the heat of reaction, plus a bit more from condensation. At room temperature, you would end up with mostly liquid water, in equilibrium with water vapor above it, and at significantly lower pressure. I can\u2019t think of another \u201cexplosion\u201d that would result in a vacuum, as generally more moles of fixed gas are generated. So, the final pressure would be 2/3 that of the starting pressure if the temp is above the boiling point. If the ambient temp is below the boiling point, the pressure is even lower, because liquids occupy much less space than a gas. If you started at room temp and pressure (1 atm), the final pressure would be roughly 0.3 atm, the (vapor pressure of water) ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen and oxygen are elements. What that really means is that when an atom, the fundamental unit that makes up everything, has 1 proton (a positively charged sub-atomic particle) it is a hydrogen atom, and when it has 8 protons, it is an oxygen atom. Hydrogen gas is two hydrogen atoms bonded together, H2. Oxygen gas is two oxygen atoms bonded together, O2. Water, is one oxygen atom bonded to two different hydrogen atoms, H2O. When atoms are bonded together, (H2, O2, H2O etc.) we call the total structure a molecule. Hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms are found in many different molecules, and these different molecules make up, solids, liquids, and gasses. Whether a material is a solid, liquid, or gas depends on how these molecules (made up of atoms) interact with each other. If there is strong interaction the molecules like to stick close together, and they are solids. In liquids the interactions are a little less strong, and in gases, the molecules are not attracted to each other as much at all. Source: Scienceline.uscb.edu ",
