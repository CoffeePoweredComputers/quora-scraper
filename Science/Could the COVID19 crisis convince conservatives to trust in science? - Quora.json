            "answer_text": "Conservatives do not place blind trust in anything. The belief is that it is our responsibility to be informed and educated, not to rely on others to tell us what to think. The Covid-19 sham has badly hurt the credibility of science. As has so many so called scientific papers conducted with extreme bias and using pseudo science to push an agenda. Remember the Nazis used the same science to prove the superiority of the German race. Science isn\u2019t a judge, jury, arbitrator or even source of truth. Science is a tool to examine the world and find the truth. Science doesn\u2019t answer questions, logical thinking enhanced with critical thought uses science to answer questions. Science is like statistics. You can prove anything scientifically. There isn\u2019t much that I can think of that I couldn\u2019t construct a scientific experiment and prove conclusively that my point of view was right, then take another point of view and prove it right using the same methods. The hilarious BMJ experiment that proved jumping out of an airplane with a parachute didn\u2019t improve your chances of survival illustrated how so many people have a blind and religious faith in science. It also demonstrates how journalists can take a little piece of research and blow it up into something it isn\u2019t and never was. You see this frequently with climate change scams. Seek knowledge, quit letting people and organizations lead you by the nose. Work at becoming an informed consumer of knowledge. Seek out conflicting viewpoints and examine them. Then as your skills grow place faith in your own abilities rather than others. When you are wrong and make mistakes, learn how to correct them without taking them personally. As for Covid19. The scientific community botched it so badly and the media blew up what they said into such gross exaggeration that the efforts to combat it will kill more than the disease has. Worse it has created an ongoing situation where we remained trapped in cycles of infection and lockdowns. All for political gain. The Left wants to break the economy as they see that as Trump\u2019s strength. They don\u2019t understand that people who taste freedom seek freedom. Just because their jobs went away doesn\u2019t cause people to forget what it was like to have control of their life and be on the road to prosperity, instead of waiting on hand outs and blaming others for their misfortune. The only way we are getting through Covid-19 is through herd immunity. There is no magic cure or vaccine coming. It\u2019s a virus and one that mutates rapidly. We haven\u2019t been able to cure AIDS or Hep C despite intense efforts over the last 40 years. We haven\u2019t developed a vaccine for the common cold (caused by a Corona virus in many cases). If we could, we\u2019d done so as trillions of work hours are lost every year to the common cold and thousands die every year when those colds turn to pneumonia. Why would we think we could beat this meaner version of the common cold? IF we could develop a vaccine, it\u2019d be a couple years from the day it was developed before mass vaccinations would occur and you\u2019d be lucky to vaccinate 40% of the nation. 60% is an absolute tops. Even if you vaccinated 100%, there are 3 million Illegals crossing the border each year. At least 5% of them have Covid19. It\u2019s not going away. Not by lockdowns or vaccinations. It\u2019s a fact of life like H1N1 is. All we can do is develop herd immunity and try to find a way to protect the most vulnerable from diseases like H1N1 which killed some of the \u201cCovid-19\u201d casualties, the flu, Covid-19, and 100 other diseases that kill thousands each year. AIDS still kills over a million people every year world wide. TB is starting to rear it\u2019s head again. There\u2019s a lot of ways to die. If we develop herd immunity, then Covid19 just becomes yet another of the many risks people in the high risk category face. If we magically eliminated Covid19 from the world, they\u2019d still die. Most of them were dying already when they contracted Covid. Covid just shaved 6\u201312 months off their life. Covid is not going away. Unless we seal our borders tight for the next few hundreds years, we can\u2019t get rid of it. It\u2019s going to come in from visitors, from Americans traveling abroad, from Illegals. At least we can test people entering the nation legally. We can\u2019t test Illegals. Illegals will bring it back over and over and over again until we have herd immunity or shut down the borders. I don\u2019t see the will to shut down the borders so herd immunity it is. These lockdowns advocated by \u201cscientists\u201d ignore these very basic facts. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a conceptual problem with this question. The assumption is that Conservatives don\u2019t trust science, which on face value is absurd. I\u2019m conservative and agree that evolution, germ theory and a host of other scientific posits are correct. The problem is when some claim a certain people with opposing ideology are somehow not scientifically literate as a cover or way to deflect criticism from their own viewpoints. Science is perverted for political gain, that is what most people understand and do not trust. People don\u2019t trust people, and that is a learned behavior sadly enough. ",
