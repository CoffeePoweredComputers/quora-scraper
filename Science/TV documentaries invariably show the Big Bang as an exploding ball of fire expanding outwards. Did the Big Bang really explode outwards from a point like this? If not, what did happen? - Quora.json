            "answer_text": "See what is wrong or right is not the matter of concern but the question that: What happened before the Big Bang? Does that question even make sense? When astronomers think about the Big Bang, in general they don\u2019t actually mean that one singular moment when the Universe burst into being. It\u2019s really the name given to the model used to describe what happened an infinitesimally thin slice of time after that moment. The problem is, right at that moment, at T=0, our laws of physics\u2026 well, they stall out. You wind up dividing by zero a lot, which causes a lot of headaches. You get things like zero volume and infinite density of matter and energy. It\u2019s not that this moment didn\u2019t exist physically, or that something impossible happened, it\u2019s just that the math we currently use can\u2019t describe it. And let me be clear: what happened after that one moment we can model fairly well. We may not have a complete picture, and the model may yet be supplanted (more on that in a moment), but we have a relatively good grasp on how the Universe behaved after T=+0.0000000000000\u20261 seconds. But at T=0, fudged about it. And T<0? The way the math works, that question doesn\u2019t even make sense. The basic trouble is that Einstein\u2019s relativity gives us a good description of some things (large scale gravity, for example), and quantum mechanics tells us about other things (how particles behave), but no one has ever successfully combined the two, and they must be combined to understand that First.Einstein himself tried, and failed. It\u2019s possible, now, that this has changed. Martin Bojowald, an assistant professor of physics at Penn State University, He is working on a theory called Loop Quantum Gravity, and it combines relativity and quantum mechanics. Using this new math, something amazing happens: at T=0, the volume of the Universe is not zero, and the density is not infinite. In other words, the math still works, even at The Big Moment. Loop Quantum Gravity has been around for a while but Bojowald appears to have simplified it, using different mathematical terminology. This allows solutions to be determined for what was, before, an intractable problem. And what his solution reveals is something that\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s astonishing. It\u2019s been thought for sometime that there may have been some previous Universe that existed \"before\" ours. This is a difficult idea, because in the Big Bang model, space and time were created in that initial moment. But if Bojowald\u2019s solutions are correct, it leads the way to understanding this previous Universe. It was out there, everywhere, and it contracted. Eventually it became an ultra dense, ultra hot little ball of space and time. At some point, it got so small and so dense that bizarre quantum laws took effect \u2014 things like the Uncertainty Principle, which states that the more you know about one characteristic of an object (say, its position) the less you know about another (its velocity). There are several such laws, and they make it hard \u2014 impossible, really \u2014 to know everything about the universe at that moment. What Bojowald\u2019s work does, as I understand it (the paper as I write this is not out yet, so I am going by my limited knowledge of LQG and other theories like it) is simplify the math enough to be able to trace some properties of the Universe backwards, right down to T=0, which he calls the Big Bounce. The previous Universe collapsed down, and \"bounced\" outward again, forming our Universe. No doubt the physical aspects of this previous Universe were somewhat different; the quantum uncertainties at the moment of bounce would ensure that. It may have been much like ours, or it may have been quite alien. In his equations, it\u2019s the volume of that previous Universe that cannot be determined. How big was it? It may literally be impossible to ever know. In a sense, this uncertainty wipes the slate clean after a Universe crunches back down. I want to stress that all of this is very interesting, and may possibly be borne out to be a better solution to the real physical situation of the Universe than anything we have now. Or, let\u2019s face it: it might all eventually be tossed into the toilet. It\u2019s a bit early to know. But it\u2019s fascinating, and provides a glimpse into the future of cosmology, where we may not be limited by the one singular Universe in which we live. Another theory, called Brane Theory, is similar\u2013 it posits that there are other Universes as well, and they, well, they bounce back and forth, colliding every few hundred billion or trillion years. And that\u2019s not even the weird part of brane theory\u2026 it might be able to explain dark matter and dark energy, and why our Universe appears to be accelerating. There is plenty of info on it on the web if you\u2019re interested but you have to spend some time. Also, and what\u2019s perhaps most exciting about these theories, is that they make predictions, predictions which can be verified or falsified based on observations. These are delicate experiments to be sure, but some will be possible to perform in just the next few years (for example, different cosmological origin theories predict different behaviors for the Universe at very early times, and these would imprint themselves on objects which can be observed). These theories may seem like mumbo-jumbo or magic, but they have that very basic property of science: they\u2019re testable. And of course, I have to use this to stick it to the creationists once again. One thing they love to talk about is \"fine tuning\", how so many physical constants (like the charge on an electron, and the strength of gravity and the nuclear forces) appear to be incredibly well-adjusted to produce not just our Universe, but intelligent life in it: us. Well, some of us. The creationists claim that the only way this could possibly happen is if some sort of Intelligent Designer \u2014 and let\u2019s not be coy, they mean God \u2014 set these values to be precisely what they are. Even just on its merits this isn\u2019t right. But now we see another answer to the creationists: maybe this isn\u2019t the only Universe. There might have been a string of them, reaching back in time, in meta-time beyond time. In those other Universes, maybe the electron had more charge, and stars couldn\u2019t form. Or maybe it had less, and every star collapsed into a black hole. But if you get enough Universes, and the constants change in each one, then eventually one will get the mix right. Stars will last for billions of years, planets can form, life can evolve, and on one blue green ball of dust, chemicals can get complicated enough that they could look inside themselves, understand what they see, and marvel at the very fact of their own existence. And maybe, just maybe, they can also figure out how it all came to be. This isn\u2019t fantasy, folks, it\u2019s science. It\u2019s how things work.

            "answer_text": "No, the big bang did not occur at a point it happened everywhere in the universe at the same time. This explains the reason why we don't have a center for the universe. The universe isn't expanding into anything because the universe isn't expanding like a ball of fire, there is no space outside the universe that it is expanding into. The universe didn't shrink down to a point at the Big Bang, it's just that the spacing between any two randomly selected spacetime points shrank down to zero. Well consider the unvierse as a graph scale and earth at (0,0) and some other galaxy closer to ours at that point(alpha Centauri 4.3). If we go back a 7 billion years(I'm going for the half form big bang though) you can see that the distance from that galaxy to earth might be reduced but the graph still remains infinite and if you consider it 10^-10 milliseconds after the big bang, we can see that the galaxy and the earth might be seperated by zero (0) distance but the graph still is infinite. What I want to say is that, the universe has always been infinite even at the time of Big bang universe didn't shrink to a point(quantum gravity doesn't quite give us this answer well). The universe didn't shrink down to a point at the Big Bang, it's just that the spacing between any two randomly selected spacetime points shrank down to zero. So at the Big Bang we have the very odd situation where the spacing between every point in the universe is zero, but the universe is still infinite. The total size of the universe is then 0\u00d7\u221e, which is undefined. You probably think this doesn't make sense, and actually most physicists agree with you. The Big Bang is a singularity , and most of us don't think singularities actually occur in the real universe. We expect that some quantum gravity effect will become important as we approach the Big Bang. However, at the moment we have no working theory of quantum gravity to explain exactly what happens. ",
