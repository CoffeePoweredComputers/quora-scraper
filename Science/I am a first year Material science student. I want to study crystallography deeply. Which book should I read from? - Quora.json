            "answer_text": "Modern day textbooks invariably include a section to discuss crystallography. However, the scope of that discussion is limited and always have factual errors.There are very few books which discuss crystallography in exact terms.  Crystallographers are mathematicians to core. They don't agree things without a mathematical basis. Even the most abstract terms are well qualified and covered for in crystallography. Most of the current day textbooks do not account for this and mix up things. Hence, you need to be careful in your selection of books .These books are the ones that you can find in IUCr's site.  Personally I would suggest you to start with M.J Buerger's classical treatise on crystallography \"Elementary crystallography;: An introduction to the fundamental geometrical features of crystals\". This book serves the beginner's purpose. The book as the title suggests centers around geometric crystallography. The books starts with description of symmetry operators and goes on derive the point groups and space groups in geometrical manner. The geometric manner is lucid and easy to understand. You can also appreciate similar details through group theoretical approach which I personally find daunting. 2) \"Introduction to Crystal Geometry\" by M.J Buerger. This book is written from a mineralogist perspective. I found this book helpful in understanding the crystallographic point groups, crystal forms and crystal classes. These details though they are already been covered in earlier text make a smooth reading and improve your understanding.  To complement this you can refer any of the books prescribed in IUCr's website.   Apart from books IUCr also releases pamphlets on various topics time to time. They can be found here IUCr .  I suggest you to take time to browse through the site. They have a lot of information. they have included good websites, java applets that help in enhancing your understanding. Online dictionary in the site is quiet a good resource. It gives you a quick understanding of what you are looking for. This sometimes would save your time heavily. Just in case you need any further information don't hesitate to get in touch with me. I don't claim to be an expert in crystallography but I've been pursuing this for a good time. I know where to look for what. Happy Reading!! ",
