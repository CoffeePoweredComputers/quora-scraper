            "answer_text": "Your body generates heat.  Every hour of every day, just by the process of living, your body is generating heat.  We're all constantly losing heat to the environment.  If you're generating heat faster than you can lose it (like when you're doing heavy exercise and/or you're in hot weather)  then you heat up.  If you lose heat faster than your body can produce it (like in cold weather) then you get cold. What blankets (and coats, and sleeping bags) do is slow down heat transfer, which prevents your body heat from being lost to the air around you.  That allows your own body heat to keep you warm.   Cold air tries to carry your body heat away.  Blankets form a barrier between your body and that cold air.  Since heat doesn't tranfer through the blankets very well, they keep the heat from getting out.  The colder the surroundings are, the more insulation you need to keep your body heat from escaping too fast.  As long as you're bundled up well enough, your own body heat can keep you warm even in very cold situations. Now, this only works because you're generating heat.  If you were to put a blanket around something that generates heat (say, a car engine, or a light bulb), those things would heat up, even in cold weather.  In fact, they could heat up enough to be dangerous, so don't try that.  But if you wrap a blanket around something that doesn't generate any heat (like a piano), it won't do much good.  The blanket doesn't create any heat, it just keeps the heat you're already creating inside. ",

            "answer_text": "A blanket is a large piece of woven cloth, intended to keep the user warm. our body automatically releases heat constantly throughout the day and most times we don't replace the heat as our body also generates heat constantly. So in harsh weather like winter a convection process takes place by our body losing the heat it generates to the cold environment which in turn makes us cold. In order to prevent this it's either we do something to generate the heat we are losing rapidly back or restrict our body heat from being lost to the environment so as to also maintain our constant body temperature and this can be done by the use of a blanket. Also,apart from protecting against heat being lost by the processes of convection,it also acts as a form of radiation by traping the heat from the user's body and sends the heat emiited from the body back, thus, instead of dissipating into the air, it warms the user. Blankets are characterised as very thick materials; even the thinnest blanket is thicker than the heaviest sheet. sometimes people prefer throws to the personal day blankets. ",

            "answer_text": "Blankets insulate.That is to say, they prevent heat transferring from the warmer (you) to the colder (the room) as fast as it would if the blanket weren't there. Your body generates heat by converting food...In the particular case of a blanket, much of the insulation benefit is actually that it traps some air inside it - and that air acts as another insulation layer - your body warms up the air, which is forced to stay near you, rather than moving off through the room to be replaced with air that is (on average) colder. So, if you heated two pianos, wrapped one in a blanket, and rolled them both into a cool room - and measured the temperature of each an hour later, the blanket-wrapped one would be warmer. However, if you took two pianos, put them in a room, and left them long enough to reach the same temperature as the room... and THEN wrapped one in a blanket, then an hour later, you wouldn't record a difference.
