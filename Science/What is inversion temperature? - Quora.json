            "answer_text": "Temperature inversion, a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere (the region of the atmospherenearest the Earth\u2019s surface), in which a layer of cool air at the surface is overlain by a layer of warmer air. (Under normal conditions air temperatureusually decreases with height.) Smoke ceiling formed by a temperature inversion over Lochcarron, Scot., in 2006.Johantheghost/moonblinkInversions play an important role in determining cloud forms, precipitation, and visibility. An inversion acts as a cap on the upward movement of air from the layers below. As a result, convection produced by the heating of air from below is limited to levels below the inversion. Diffusion of dust, smoke, and other air pollutants is likewise limited. In regions where a pronounced low-level inversion is present, convective clouds cannot grow high enough to produce showers and, at the same time, visibility may be greatly reduced below the inversion, even in the absence of clouds, by the accumulation of dust and smoke particles. Because air near the base of an inversion tends to be cool, fog is frequently present there. Inversions also affect diurnal variations in air temperature. The principal heating of air during the day is produced by its contact with a land surface that has been heated by the Sun\u2019s radiation. Heat from the ground is communicated to the air by conduction and convection. Since an inversion will usually control the upper level to which heat is carried by convection, only a shallow layer of air will be heated if the inversion is low and large, and the rise in temperature will be great. There are four kinds of inversions: ground, turbulence, subsidence, and frontal. A ground inversion develops when air is cooled by contact with a colder surface until it becomes cooler than the overlying atmosphere; this occurs most often on clear nights, when the ground cools off rapidly by radiation. If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result. Topography greatly affects the magnitude of ground inversions. If the land is rolling or hilly, the cold air formed on the higher land surfaces tends to drain into the hollows, producing a larger and thicker inversion above low ground and little or none above higher elevations. A turbulence inversion often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air. Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer. The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then exists. A subsidence inversion develops when a widespread layer of air descends. The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and as a result the lapse rate of temperature is reduced. If the air mass sinks low enough, the air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion. Subsidence inversions are common over the northern continents in winter and over the subtropical oceans; these regions generally have subsiding air because they are located under large high-pressure centres. A frontal inversion occurs when a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass and lifts it aloft; the front between the two air masses then has warm air above and cold air below. This kind of inversion has considerable slope, whereas other inversions are nearly horizontal. In addition, humidity may be high, and clouds may be present immediately above it. ",

            "answer_text": "A temperature \u201cinversion\u201d occurs when the air temperature increases with altitude. It would normally (at least during daytime) decrease with altitude, since the primary source of heating the air is from the absorption of solar radiation at the ground. The air doesn\u2019t absorb much, in comparison, because it is transparent in comparison. Without going into the scientific details, for example, the temperature can increase with altitude when the ground cools faster than the air above at nighttime. Inversions are common close to the ground at night, especially under clear skies, when the ground cools rapidly, radiatively. The higher up you go, the further from the ground, and the temperature does not cool as strongly. So we get an inversion. This is not the only causative factor in an inversion. If air above is sinking, it warms due to compression. This can cause the overlying air to warm as you ascend into the atmosphere. This also causes an inversion. This is a simplistic answer, and not all-inclusive. It is meant for a non-scientific audience. ",
