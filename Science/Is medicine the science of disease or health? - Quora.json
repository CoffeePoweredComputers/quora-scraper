            "answer_text": "Medicine: Science or Art? (Pub Med) Medicine is not a science. Mainstream medicine has aspirations to be a science, but is overwhelming based on authority. In former times, that authority was from people with reputations to maintain, from committees of the great and the good, and from old books which were often based on superstition. In essence, not much has changed. However, medicine does employ science. There is a thing called science based medicine (SBM as against EBM, evidence based medicine) which again is more an aspiration than a reality. Studies of SBM have found it somewhat lacking compared to seat-of-the-pants medicine. Perhaps ironically, the form of therapy that ushered in the age of science in medicine was homeopathy. This was the first form of medicine to actually test its remedies on healthy people, to carefully observe primary and secondary effects, to apply what was learnt to patients, and to feed back from clinical experience what was actually useful as compared to theory. After that, science went its own way, developing \u2018laws\u2019 and theories which surprisingly turn out to be wrong if one actually tests them. (Like the quasi-scientific theory that highly potentised homeopathic remedies contain no \u2018active ingredient\u2019 and have no effect therefore. All wrong, in fact, but highly appealing to those who know no better and refuse to experiment.) A lot of modern medicine gets very confused about which is superior, theory or practice. And will try to defend theory to the death. Meanwhile modern medicine has disappeared down the rabbit hole of Randomised Controlled Trials, an appealing construction which loses sight of the individual patient, treats patients as mere identical machines (some of whom do not \u2018comply\u2019 properly with theory), and up to now has played lip service to the patently false idea that all people react (or should react) identically. The further appeal of the RCT is that it has an intrinsic methodological bias against forms of medicine that do consider the individual as paramount. Conventional types will see this idea as preposterous, and indulge in bluster. Not science. But their intent is to preserve the status quo they profit from. Authority again, not science. Modern medicine, which has only relatively recently become known as \u2018conventional\u2019, is also foremost a business. And a controlling business, involved in finance and politics for its own survival. It pays little attention to cures it cannot own and profit from. If you sell medicine, and promote it through constant propaganda (such as those TV shows where the hospital doc is always the handsome hero, or funding the tribe of pseudo-sceptics whose hobby is to attack financial rivals with pseudo-science and follow-my-leader thinking), then there is no profit in \u201chealth\u201d. That\u2019s just an illusion. Indeed, there is not much profit in \u2018curing\u2019 long-term illness either, since ongoing \u2018treatment\u2019 is a better source of income. That\u2019s just economic fact rather than wishful thinking. Added to which, the average person might find it quite difficult to come to a working definition of what we mean by \u201chealth\u201d. Fitness is relatively easy concept to define, but it is not the same thing. Fitness is an ability to do a specific job. For medical systems that concentrate on health, one must look elsewhere. Yes, there is a thing called preventative medicine, but it often goes desperately wrong - for example, you chances of dying from a cardiovascular problem (AVE) are actually made worse by using synthetic statins and stopping them, compared to never trying them. But they are out of patent now, so we can expect to see the next thing promoted. Not health. Ayur veda (the \u201cscience of life\u201d) attempts systematically to classify and treat disease, but also to classify healthy people and to suggest healthy lifestyles including diet, exercise and mental clarity. Homeopathy attempts to use the body\u2019s natural processes to repair and produce cure (rather than ongoing treatment). Nutritional medicine attempts to promote health as well. It can also treat and cure. Conventional medicine providers hate that, and try to spread disinformation on the matter. Any of these \u2018alternative\u2019 therapies which compete for sickness-money are hugely unpopular with supporters of monopoly Pharma (which counter-intuitively is a major cause of death, killing hundreds of thousands of people a year, as well as helping many). So you will often see trolling pseudo-skeptics when these topics are mentioned, claiming to be \u2018science based\u2019. They aren\u2019t; they are false-authority-based. Is medicine the science of disease or health? No. ",

Conventional medicine and alternative medical practices as well do not have scientific definitions. Conventional medicine uses scientific techniques to measure the effectiveness of drugs - where \u201ceffectiveness\u201d generally means effectiveness at \u201cnot curing\u201d. Most clinical studies do not have any definition of CURED for the disease being studied, and if a cure occurs, it cannot be noticed, cannot be proven scientifically, cannot be documented. And health? Conventional and alternative medical practices do not have scientific definitions of health, healthiness, or unhealthiness. There is no science of health either. to your health, tracyFounder: Healthicine: The Arts and Sciences of Health and Healthiness ",
