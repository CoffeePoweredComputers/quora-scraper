Wireless electricity2. Quantum computers3. Electronics in Bio medical4. Robotics (Also consider self-driven car part of this)5. Green Electronics6. Computer Networks7. Mobile communication8. Embedded Systems9. Electronics in Aerospace and Astronomy (modern day aerospace cannot be imagined without electronics and imagine using traditional devices in a spaceship)10. Organic Electronics11. VLSI might have been become ULSI or XLSI (Extreme large scale integration) and will continue to be hot topics as demands of smaller electronics is on rise.12. Optical Circuits13. Application of Nanotechnology in Electronics and many more. Manufacturing of electronics components and devices I am not sure it may be hot or not, but it should be. It involves making production of electronics components hazard free and safe to human health involves in the production and repair. Green electronics may cover some of its parts. ",

Many of the things mentioned by other commenters are more material science with applications in electronics, or optical sciences and a lot of energy is going into making machines smarter, which is strictly speaking a matter of computer science. I can't say, what is hot, because I am not too involved in the field, but what you are probably looking for is anything involving power distribution and management, system-on-a-chip, man-machine interfaces (multidisciplinary), sensor networks and embedded systems.

            "answer_text": "Electronics is such a huge field that is not easy to answer.But the two largest trends are smaller and faster circuits.The former is hitting the wall of circuit features spanning individual atoms. The latter is hitting the wall of gates that never actually get to change state. Those are the hardest problems in pure electronics. Then, you have the problem of heat dissipation at such small scales, the problem of exploding complexity, and the problem of power consumption.A bit outside the scope is the problem of energy storage and energy harvesting, so you can have devices that stay in the field for months or years without a need to recharge.
