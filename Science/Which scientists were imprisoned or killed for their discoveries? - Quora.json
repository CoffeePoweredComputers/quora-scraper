            "answer_text": " Pappus of Alexandria wrote that the member of the Pythagorean school who discovered Irrational numbers so riled the Pythagoreans, who held that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of two numbers, that they rowed him out to sea with a stone tied to his neck and threw him overboard. Hippasus of Metapontum was a 5th-century BC mathematician known to have demonstrated that a dodecahedron can be constructed within a sphere and to have died by drowning at sea. He also lived at roughly the time and place in which the irrationality of the square root of two was discovered. It has come down popularly, though without any historical confirmation, that Hippasus was the man executed for discovering irrational numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "Hippasus. He is a student of the famous mathematician lived in Ancient Greece named, Pythagoras. Doesn\u2019t ring a bell? Don\u2019t worry.  He is the first European who discovered the relationship among the three sides in a right triangle. a^2+b^2=c^2 Hippasus however noticed something weird. Back then rational numbers were found out. Rational number means the number can be expressed by p/q, (q doesn\u2019t equal 0 and p and q are both integers). Hippasus noticed that the square root of some integers, such as 2 and 3, cannot be expressed in such a way. We later found out they are actually irrational numbers. For example, square root of 4 is 2 but square root of 2 cannot be expressed by p/q. So he asked his teacher Pythagoras why would that be. Pythagoras couldn\u2019t answer this question. so\u2026\u2026 Pythagoras tied him up and threw Hippasus into the sea. ",
