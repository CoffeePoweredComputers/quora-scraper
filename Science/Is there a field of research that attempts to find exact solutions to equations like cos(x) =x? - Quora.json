            "answer_text": "No, for reasons. Firstly, the equation itself defines its solutions. That's as exact as exact can be. Secondly, if you want a solution in some particularly economical form \u2014 specifically, a finite representation in terms of something you like, like a rational number\u2014 there is a high likelihood that there isn't an exact way of doing it. In radians, for example, there isn't even an algebraic solution to the equation. I can't lay my mental hands on a proof, but I would be very surprised to find an algebraic number of degrees which worked either. Thirdly, it's not obvious what you would be doing this for. The representations you want will probably be determined by what you do with them afterwards, but all of them will have trouble with almost all instances of, say, infinite series representations, even if they can be written compactly. Your \u201cexact\u201d value is a spare wheel in terms of most of what you can do with it. You just have to accept that there are no general approaches to getting \u201cexact values\u201d. There are approaches to getting approximations which are widely applicable, and lots of work has been done to allow some interesting constants to be evaluated, e.g. as lying between two real numbers with known decimal expansions. However, these are nevertheless little pin-point spot-lights in the general murk. The example you give is a notably easy one, using an exceptionally well-behaved function. You already have a short and handy way of specifying the value you want, and one which lends itself to evaluation to arbitrary precision, e.g. using the Newton-Raphson method. This already makes it a prize specimen of extreme convenience. Demanding something even better is not just asking for a lot, it's asking for far more than is generally available. Even if it's available, it's hard to see that it could be all that much of an improvement, except for some really quirky use down the line. General methods are of great interest. Particular cases only occasionally look interesting enough to attract attention, and they have an annoying habit of not suggesting more general approaches. ",
