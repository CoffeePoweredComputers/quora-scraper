            "answer_text": "Nothing has changed. The people who fought against the teaching of evolution in schools eighty years ago are the same kind of people who are doing it today. They\u2019ve just gotten louder and more organized. Well-funded political groups have found these people to be a very reliable voting block when it comes to pushing back against public policy that they don\u2019t like. Often policy decisions are backed up with data and scientific analysis. In order to push back successfully of these kinds of policies it\u2019s sometimes necessary to undermine the science. The most successful example that comes to mind is how the tobacco industry was able to stifle scientific consensus that cigarettes caused cancer. Today similar forces want to push back on consensus around gun reform, education, global warming, human sexuality and any host of other issues. And for essentially the same reasons. Sound public policy sometimes eats into profits. Now there are multiple well-financed marketing campaigns underway to call the science into question and to organize certain groups against new reforms. The attack has broadened from attacking specific scientific positions to attacking all science in general. Helps all these groups shape the national discussion if their efforts all reinforce the same message: science can\u2019t be trusted. These arguments have found a receptive audience in various religious communities. Some religions have always regarded science as corrosive to some of their most deeply held religious beliefs. Anti-science big business and anti-science religion have been building on this informal partnership for years. The coronavirus epidemic has started to erode the work of decades of attempting to sow doubts about science, however. Turns out that when people are dying right in front of you people are inclined to seek the opinion of a trained professional over that of a holy man or a tv ideologue. This is why Trump has been so resistant to listening to science experts. He didn\u2019t want to concede that they knew something that he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to give \u201cexperts\u201d any social power. He even started offering his own \u201ccures\u201d like hydroxychloroquine and \u201cinjecting light\u201d into the body. His base went right along with him. Refusing to wear masks and insisting that COVID-19 was like the flu. After years of being told that their gut instincts were more reliable than the opinions of any egg-headed epidemiologist, they didn\u2019t want to cede any power either. Now, after thousands have died, they\u2019re slowly remembering why they ever listened experts in the first place. For some of them science is making a comeback. ",

            "answer_text": "What has changed to make so many Americans so distrustful of science? The single largest factor are agnotological campaigns. They work tirelessly to spread misinformation and distrust of science. Basically, groups that are causing harm, or who\u2019s beliefs are in conflict with reality, which is based upon science typically\u2026 don't want any one to trust science\u2026 as science says that group is wrong. So, earliest versions started with the Radium Industry, when science found that radium was making people sick. Then other examples included the Lead Industry, the Asbestos Industry, the Tobacco Industry, and the Fossil Fuel Industry. Fundamentalist sects of some Abrahamic religions started agnotological campaigns as well, as science finding the age of the earth, and humans, and dinosaurs, etc, was in conflict with their beliefs\u2026 so, they started campaigns to spread misinformation too, just as the industries had. Foreign powers, such as Russia, have intelligence agencies, and, for example, there is a building in St Petersburg where they crank out misinformation and present it as coming from Americans, etc. They found that by politicizing science, they could actually polarize people by political identity, and take advantage of groups that naturally are anti-science, and vulnerable to conspiracy theories, etc. Basically all of the anti-science campaigns pretend that scientists are in a world wide conspiracy to pretend that asbestos is bad for you, or that climate change is real, or the earth is round, etc, as, otherwise, they get fired or don't get any grant money etc. So, those vulnerable to falling for conspiracy theories are the prime target, as if not bad enough at critical thinking skills, with enough confirmation bias errors, they will not be able to be fooled by the misinformation campaigns. But, those gullible enough to fall for a conspiracy theory (A conspiracy is required to explain why all the scientists disagree with the premise) run about knowingly telling the sheeples that the earth is flat and to wake up and smell the coffee. :D So, in the US, there are so MANY gullible enough to fall for conspiracy theories, and, therefore, anti-science campaigns, that it is like living in an insane asylum at times. :D ",
