            "answer_text": "Warning - : The answer written below was wrong, it has been corrected at the end in an edit, so don't lunge for my throat :-) I didn't remove it because for first timers to understand the answer properly the explanation for the Brayton cycle is required (I think so) It's called the Brayton cycle. The Brayton cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that describes the workings of a constant pressure heat engine. The original Brayton engines used piston-compressor and expander systems, but more modern gas turbine engines and airbreathing jet engines also follow the Brayton cycle. Although the cycle is usually run as an open system (and indeed must be run as such if internal combustion is used), it is conventionally assumed for the purposes of thermodynamic analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake, enabling analysis as a closed system. Source: Wikipedia. Edit : Apparently, the Brayton cycle and the Joule cycle are almost the same. The reversed Joule cycle is actually known as Bell-coleman cycle. Its purpose is to move heat, rather than produce work. This air-cooling technique is used widely in jet aircraft for air conditioning systems using air tapped from the engine compressors. It is also used in the LNG industry where the largest reverse Brayton cycle is for subcooling LNG using 86 MW of power from a gas turbine-driven compressor and nitrogen refrigerant. Hope that helps.

Bell-coleman cycle is a Air refrigeration cycle. Which uses Air as a refrigerant. Which is used in Aircraft cooling system. Thanks for Reading..!! \u263a ",
