            "answer_text": "No, a PhD is one kind of doctorate, but it isn\u2019t the only one. A doctor is someone who has sufficient knowledge and experience that they are able to practice, teach, and direct others in the field. The term doctrine comes from the same root. The following are the types of doctoral degrees that come to mind. These have variations depending on the country and educational institution. Ph.D : Doctor of PhilosophyThis is the primary degree for researchers in the sciences and humanities. Most doctorates are of this type, and are then further divided into the field of study. For example I have a Ph.D in Mathematics.M.D : Doctor of MedicineThe medical practitioners including everything from your primary care physician to surgeons and other medical specialists. Depending on the field they may also need another degree as well.J.D : Juris Doctor / Law degreePeople who graduate from law school and are ready to practice law (after being approved by bar) receive this degree. You will also find that many politicians have this in their background.Pharm.D : Doctor of PharmacyThis degree is required for many positions in the production and distribution of new drugs. Many Pharm. Ds also do research.Ed. D : Doctor of EducationThis is a terminal degree for those who are primarily focused on teaching and developing methods of teaching. Recently there has been some debate on if it is significantly different than a Ph.D in Education.There are also doctorates in arts, music, forestry, dentistry, social work and more. For a pretty comprehensive list you can look at the Wikipedia link for the doctoral degrees in the United States. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks goes out to Thomas Cosenza for the A2A. A doctorate (derived from the Latin docere, \u201cto teach\u201d or doctor\u2019s degree (from the Latin, \u201cteacher\u201d) or doctoral degree is an academic degree awarded by universities. In most countries, such is a research degree qualifying its holder to teach at the university level in the degree\u2019s discipline, or go about working in a specific profession. While there exists a variety of names for doctorate degrees, most commonly it is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) offered in many different fields, spanning the full range of humanities and scientific disciplines. The professional doctorate and PhD degrees are both considered terminal degrees, meaning that one has achieved the highest formal degree offered in the field. Similarly, both a doctorate and a Ph.D. degree are focusing on a single discipline or field of study since the primary difference between the two rests in their respective meanings. Whereas a doctorate is viewed as an umbrella-like rubric for connoting a degree or rank, a Ph.D. standing for Doctor of Philosophy, is classified under academic degrees. Granted, most of these degrees destine their recipients for academic careers. However, similar to the Ph.D., some of these terminal degrees also offer pursuing clinical careers, such as for example including among others, the D.S.W., doctor of social work degree. Finally, in the commonly accepted vernacular, generally speaking when one hears a graduate student observing that he or she is pursuing a \u201cdoctorate,\u201d they mean a Ph.D. or another of these research degrees. I hope that you find this information useful, and thanks again to Thomas Cosenza for the kind request. ",
