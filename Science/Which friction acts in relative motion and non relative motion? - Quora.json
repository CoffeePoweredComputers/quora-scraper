            "answer_text": "Static friction tries to oppose relative motion or slipping between two surfaces. When it cannot do so any longer and the two surfaces begin to slip (i.e., relative motion occurs between the two), kinetic friction takes over. Coefficient of static friction is slightly more than that of kinetic friction. ",
