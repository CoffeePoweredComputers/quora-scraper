            "answer_text": "For one thing, it's not like these elements had names originally - all names for these elements were neologisms in their time.  There was no \"renaming\" of these compounds, there was only a naming convention dispute.  For another thing in many languages, particularly Germanic ones (Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, German, Danish, Afrikaans) these elements still are called by these names.  The periodic table includes Na (Natrium) for sodium and K (Kalium) for potassium.  These are the historical detritus of a long-running nomenclature dispute in the late 18th and early 19th century. The tl;dr version of this is that German chemists preferred one and English/French chemists preferred another, and they were all too pig-headed to agree. The name change in English and French occurred due to a prevailing nomenclature convention in those two languages which was not followed in Germany.  German chemists preferred latinised names, while French and English chemists preferred to \"naturalize\" the words in their languages, in this case preferring to point out that the elements came from potash/potasse or soda/soude, two long known sources of alkaline substances.  Early on, Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who was familiar with the work of earlier chemists who had proven that the materials in soda and potash were different elements, proposed that the the names kali and natron be used for potassium and sodium. On the other hand, Sir Humphry Davy, who first isolated the metals, had this to say: Potassium and Sodium are the names by which I have ventured to call the  two new substances: and whatever changes of theory, with regard to the  composition of bodies may hereafter take place, these terms can scarcely  express an error; for they may be considered as implying simply the  metals produced from potash and soda. I have consulted with many of the  most eminent scientific persons in this country, upon the methods of  derivation, and the one I have adopted as been the one most generally  approved. It is perhaps more significant than elegant. But it was not  possible to found names upon specific properties not common to both; and  though a name for the basis of soda might have been borrowed from the  Greek, yet an analogous one could not have been applied to that of  potash, for the ancients do not seem to have distinguished between the  two alkalies. Basically, saying hey German chemists! *thbppppppp* suckas! Gay-Lussac and Th\u00e9nard, contemporaries of Davy who also investigated the alkali metals, called the metals m\u00e9tal de potasse and m\u00e9tal de soude.   On the other hand, Davy's articles were translated into German by one Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert.  He had this to say in his introduction (translated): ... Davy named these bodies Potassium, which I replaced by Kalium, just as Davy's name for the natron-metal, Sodium, is represented by Natronium, in agreement with German nomenclature... Short version: Our way or the highway. So at this point, we have the English and French pushing their naming system and the Germans pushing theirs. When the first elemental abbreviations were proposed by Jakob Berzelius in 1813, he used the system favored by Davy abbreviating the names of Potassium and Sodium to Po and So, but within a year he switched to the German system, abbreviating the elements with latinate names as K and Na.   The differences between the two naming traditions in chemistry persist to this day.  The Germanic countries adopted the latinate tradition and the Anglo-French influenced countries adopted the naturalized tradition.  And now when any German chemist tries to learn English or French chemistry or vice versa, we all get confused. ",

So I find it curious that exactly the reverse occurred with oxygen and hydrogen, which in German are respectively Sauerstoff (acid material) and Brennstoff (burning material) - i.e. vernacular names associated with properties, while the English (and French) went for latinised names. Can anyone explain that  inconsistency? ",
