            "answer_text": "It really depends if you are referring to selling your own properties or selling other people\u2019s properties. There is no get-rich-quick scheme for getting \u2018rich\u2019 through flipping real estate yourself. It requires a lot of work and a solid, logical understanding of markets - not to mention the fact that it generally takes years and years of mistakes and failures before you find your feet. The other way to make money with real estate you own is to buy and hold it and let a tenant pay the mortgage off for you - this is the magical way in my opinion. You\u2019ll need a downpayment - generally around 30% is advised but it depends on your market and rent:value ratios in your town/city. Speak to a good mortgage broker to get pre approved, find a property that will rent well, crunch your numbers and buy it if it works out. If you\u2019re cash-flowing or breaking even month to month (taking into account mortgage payments, maintenance, property management fees, etc) from the rent then just let it sit. If the tenant moves out find a new one ASAP. Always have a reserve of a few months rent sitting in an account just to be safe. After some time, speak to your mortgage broker about getting another mortgage for another property. Leverage the equity in that home along with some more savings and use it to buy another. Repeat repeat repeat. It sounds simple but it\u2019s not and you need to keep a level head and always think worst case scenario. Work with a real estate agent who knows how to advise you on this and always keep your loan to value ratio around 30%+. That means that your mortgages owing on the properties never go over 70% of the market value of your portfolio. This is a long game and it\u2019ll take decades to really pay off but when it does you could be sitting on a portfolio that\u2019s paid off bringing you in substantial rental income or you could sell the whole lot and pocket millions and put it in stocks or something more liquid. The other way to make money is doing what I do. Become a real estate agent and help people buy and sell homes. If you can become proficient at what you do, treat people well and work very hard you\u2019ll grow a great business and earn great money. You can then invest some of that money in one of the methods above and grow your own portfolio on the side so you can one day retire. Success leaves clues so find someone who has what you have and ask them to help you achieve what they have. It\u2019s amazing what you can do if you expect it of yourself :) ",
