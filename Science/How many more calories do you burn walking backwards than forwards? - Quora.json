Seriously try doing some proper cardio rather than bitching around with these silly things. And for God\u2019s sake, eat Healthy food with less sugar concentration. That\u2019s all you need.. Thank me later !! ",

            "answer_text": "You burn more, if anything, based on the fact that your back does more work, and is already the part of your torso that works the hardest, and you have to put more effort into extending your legs while stressing about whether or not you will get hurt doing it. I recommend normal walking. ",
