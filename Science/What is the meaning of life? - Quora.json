            "answer_text": "Two childhood friends were having a conversation: Jack: Hi, Jim Jim: Hi, Jack. What\u2019s up? Jack: What would you like to be when you grow up? Jim: Why, I\u2019d like to be a doctor. Why do you ask? Jack: Just asking... Why don\u2019t you ask me what I\u2019d like to be when I grow up? Jim: Ok, what would you like to be? Jack: I\u2019d like to be a robber. Jim: Whaaat? That\u2019s weird. You\u2019re not serious. Why? Jack: Ooh, yes, I am. Because when you\u2019re a robber you don\u2019t have to struggle so much for money. You just let others do all the hard work and then move in and collect the loot. I\u2019ve been reading so much about it lately. About all the famous robbers like Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger, and so on\u2026The risks are high, but so are the rewards. Jim: Wow! You\u2019re crazy. That\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019ll probably end up in prison, or end up dead. Who\u2019ll teach you how to rob anyway\u2014they don\u2019t teach that in school, you know? Jack: Ooh! but they do. They do it all the time without even knowing it. Besides who wants to live long anyway\u2014life sucks. Jim: Life doesn\u2019t suck if you live it well. Why waste your life too soon? Jack: Your life will be wasted anyway. People will use you, and then they\u2019ll dump you when you\u2019re no longer useful to them. Jim: Well, they won\u2019t if you don\u2019t let them. You must first go to school, get a good education and then get a good job and a good salary. That way, you\u2019ll command the world. That\u2019s why I want to become a doctor. It pays well. Jack: Well, good luck.  Jack and Jim were separated for many years after their parents went to live in separate cities. Thirty years later, Jack and Jim bumped into each other by chance. By then, each of them was married with several children. And each of them was prosperous in their own way. The only difference was that Jack was driving a Rolls Royce while Jim was driving a Chevrolet. Jim, looking shocked, said, \u201cHey there, Jack. Long time no see. What happened to you? What have you been up to? Did you become a robber or something?\u201d Jack: Ooh, yes\u2026 After the usual pleasantries and introductions of their families, they had lunch together. Later, they let their families take a walk while they enjoyed a drink. The children went to play. Over a drink, Jim asked, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve never been caught?\u201d Jack: No, I haven\u2019t\u2026 Jim: Come off it, Jack. You\u2019re kidding me. Jack: No, I\u2019m not kidding. Jim: So, what did you do? Jack: Well, I realized to become rich and never have to work again, I needed a lot of money. So, I went and studied about money in college. I read a lot of books about money. I specialized in Finance and Economics. So, here I am. I rob money from other people into my pocket. Legally. Jim: How\u2019s that? Jack: I persuade people to give me money so that I can keep it for them. After a little talk they give me the money willingly and I invest it on their behalf at an agreed return. I trade with the money, heavily, so by the time I give it back, the money has already yielded a profit. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve already made a lot of money for myself. Most of them don\u2019t know what I do and they don\u2019t care. Besides, they\u2019re happy with the profit they get from me. I get a nice profit for trading and keeping their money securely. And I get to keep a tidy profit. That way, nobody is hurt and everybody is happy. It\u2019s a win-win situation. Jim: Ooh! But that\u2019s not robbery. That\u2019s banking\u2014or investing. Are you a banker or something? Jack: Yes, I own an investment bank. You see, because you guys don\u2019t want to learn about money, you give all your money to banks to keep it for you. You don\u2019t like to take risks. Did you imagine they should keep it for you for free? They invest it, trade with it heavily, and make it work for them. When you ask for it, they return it back to you at the agreed interest rate. Meanwhile they\u2019ve used your money to earn a ton of their own money. Jim: Can you teach me how to do this? Jack: No. But you\u2019re a doctor. You\u2019re happy. You have a good family. You help save thousands of people\u2019s lives. Besides, it\u2019ll take you years to learn the stuff. Consider how many years you\u2019ve spent leaning medicine. You can\u2019t throw all that away\u2026 Jim: The hell with saving people\u2019s lives. I need the money. Lot\u2019s of it. Besides, I need money more than happiness. Let me ask you a question, \u201cIf you were given a choice between happiness, wisdom and money, what would you choose?\u201d Jack: Why, I would choose what I don\u2019t have. I already have happiness and lot\u2019s of wisdom. Perhaps I\u2019d choose money. Jim: You mean I don\u2019t have a lot money because I\u2019m not wise? Jack: No. I didn\u2019t mean that. One chooses what they don\u2019t have. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t have much wisdom, so I decided to look for wisdom. The wisdom I received resulted in money and happiness. I don\u2019t regret my choice. You see, life is short and it\u2019s important to choose a way of life you\u2019re comfortable with and won\u2019t regret later. The moment you regret the outcome of your life, this will kill you faster than the life you\u2019ve chosen to live. When I said I\u2019d like to become a robber when we were kids, I didn\u2019t know what I was saying, but I knew what I wanted. I wanted money\u2014lot\u2019s of it. So I went looking for the knowledge about money and you went looking for knowledge about treating sick people. Each one of us got what they wanted. Never regret your choice of life or the outcome. Never change course. Just find a way to make it work for you. That\u2019s how to be happy.  Photo Credit: Johnny Depp as Dillinger in \u201cPublic Enemies\u201d | GETTY ",

            "answer_text": "We don't know.  We can't know.  But... Every religion and every philosophy builds itself around attempting to answer this question.  And they do it on faith because life didn't come with a user's manual. We live our lives inside a bubble with an opaque surface.  Is there something bigger?  Were we put here for a purpose?  What happens next?  What is the end goal?  Is there an end goal?  If those answers exist they are likely outside of our perception. So, from our narrow perspective, what do we know?  Or think we know? As far as we know, we get one life.  If reality is like a video game with three lives, we don't know that (sorry Hindus).  That's as much meaning as we can perceive or measure.  One chance. So, ask yourself \"If I had only one life, how would I live it?\" and there is your meaning. WARNING: ASKING THIS QUESTION RESULTS IN SELF-LOATHING EVERY TIME ONE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, IF ONE DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH.  LIFE IS EASIER IF ONE DOESN'T ASK. No kidding.  Those three minutes during which I shave are the worst moments of every day.  The lazy, cowardly asshole in the mirror has done a piss poor job of following through with what we decided we would do if we had only one life.  But there remains a sliver of hope he might accidentally do something right. Every person is a unique miracle of odds.  They would be a different person if their parents had made love after the movie instead of before. A googolplex of variables had to line up to produce each of us as we are.  Whether that was a result of divination or random numbers, we can't know.  But that doesn't mean we can't appreciate it and be grateful for it. How would the world be different if you had not lived?  THAT is the meaning of life?  If it wouldn't be different, then your life has no meaning.  That sounds harsh, but we don't need to watch Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life to recognize that it is near impossible for an individual to make no impact on the world around them, if only in the proximity. That means we largely set our own meaning.  Our actions - our being - defines the meaning of our life.  The smallest act of kindness or the smallest act of cruelty or apathy can have cascading ripple effects.  Life is the chaos theory Jeff Goldblum prattles on about in Jurassic Park, and we are the butterfly in South America.  But chaos can receive direction if we control our path through life. On our deathbeds, we may have beliefs, but we won't know what happens next.  But we can look back and assess whether we made a difference that we can be proud of - that is the meaning of life. Whether that difference is our work, our family, our joys, our experiences, our loves, or our sacrifices is up to us.  *brought to you by Quoraing after cocktails. ",
