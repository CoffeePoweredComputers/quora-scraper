            "answer_text": "America is appearing to be worry free. And that's an understandable complexity. The most gigantic superb nation. That's America. And. With its massive in everything, it is not surprising that whatever it expresses is grand. Such a large population where every one is made to feel individually free. All has an amended structure to regulate their personal feelings, moods, etc. People in America has always felt free to be. Something they've brandish in the faces of the rest world. The dream of a functioning Democracy. Now. Whatever one thinks of America's democracy, it still remains the lesser of the oppressive systems humanity has ever endured. Democracy has done more great things than the good that's seems wobbly appearing. And. With that sort of liberty, its huge size, the influx of new sciences, cosmopolitan societies, great wealth, great power comes the flipside. For, in the art of duality, the balances are un even, in opposites. Every dollar made, is dollar a spent. So, as some becomes fortunately rich, others descend into unfortunate poverty. Well, who? Obviously the lesser conscious, the new comer, the one from outside coming in, and so forth. Certain thing are unavoidable, and systems striving to succeed, naturally gathers the best, the fittest, and the smartest. And as human nature permits, bias preferences becomes a natural. America has quickly excelled therefore. The more luxury and comforts afforded, the lesser the mental anxiety. And, so the country existed for decades feeling the breeze of fortune. Worry free. So much that, it rightly, developed an extended compassion earning the respect and the dependency on the world's lesser fortunate nations. Big \u201cDaddy\u201d America will always be forever loved. A habit that's hard to die. That's an existential fact. Every other nation, when faced with worries, consulted, pleaded, and even begs mammoth America, \u201cplease help us from our worries\u201d. Which they effortlessly deed. So worrying is not really part psyche of the Americans. You, know, old \u201chabits die hard\u201d, meaning people do not like to change things they have been doing for a very long time. Despite the new-normal Covid-19 qualities, old habits die hard. America is at an interesting clash of the two philosophies. Habits, and the Covid-19 philosophy. Let s see what happens. That ability of influence and power became open to corruption eventually. For, \u201cfleshy\u201d Man always comes to his rotten quality. And he knows not how, when and why. And, presently it's the corruption from its internal malignancies that leading in to your question, \u201cWhy America seems un perturbed over the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d? Though the pandemic is \u201creported\u201d to have effected America more than every other nation. It is impossible for the facts on the pandemic decimation in America to be correct, \u2014and still worry free? The reports on America's political quagmire is in distraction to the worry. There are millions in worry. That's a fact. So worry is there. America is in worrisome mode over the Covid-19, but the expression on what matters to the conscience, through the journalism science, shadows the worries. ",

            "answer_text": "Arrogance, ignorance with quite staggering levels of low education mix to make muricans think little of the virus that has killed more of their own in less than a year than died in their ass kicked Vietnam war mistake. There is this supremely misplaced genuine belief in many muricans that they are superior to other countries when all the evidence proves this to be the polar opposite of the truth. Having said that, a self combusting country such as this that still boasts it\u2019s the land of the free whilst having race wars across its states, deep seated political and industrial corruption and societal splits is an irony lost only on them. This virus isn\u2019t going away, it is genuinely staggering to look at the way murica has dismissed this situation as it\u2019s THE most infected country on the planet, 240,000 dead and just under 7 million infected and these numbers are growing of course despite all figures now having to go through the white house shredder for trump to lie about. Maybe with a country as riven and corrupt as the US a purge and deep cleansing was sadly inevitable, who\u2019s to know. It\u2019s being moved off the world stage discreetly and is still too arrogant to see this geo politically, best just to continue the flight and trade restrictions on the US and leave em to it. ",
