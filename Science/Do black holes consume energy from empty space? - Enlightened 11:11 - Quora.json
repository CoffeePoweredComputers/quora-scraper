            "answer_text": "According to Stephen Hawking, virtual particles pop into existence and disappear out of existence on a regular basis and are called quantum fluctuations (QFs). Sometimes, the event horizon swallows up the antimatter part and allows the matter part to escape into space as radiation hence Hawking Radiation. The antimatter part annihilates some of the mass of the black hole giving the illusion that it\u2019s evaporating. So, instead of the black hole consuming energy from space, you could say that it\u2019s being consumed by energy from space. However, if you look at this theory carefully, you\u2019ll find that the product of annihilation is energy which stays behind and not disappear out of existence as required by the uncertainty principle which allowed the QFs to happen in the first place. So, these QFs don\u2019t happen since they cause a violation of the 1st law of thermodynamics aka the Energy Conservation principle. If you look even closer at the QF formation, you\u2019ll find that the uncertainty principle that allows it actually violates the Energy Conservation principle by borrowing energy that doesn\u2019t exist. Even if you allow that to happen, the borrowed energy has to disappear out of existence which is another violation of the Energy Conservation principle. So, this QM theory like SR and GR are self-deprecating theories i.e. ones that prove themselves wrong. Mainstream science is full of them. So, if vacuum energy exist, it will eventually consume the black hole. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. The mainstream accepted Hawking Radiation because it\u2019s based on their fallacious QF theory. ",

            "answer_text": "They do, sort of. They consume whatever falls into them, and at this time in the history of the universe the cosmic microwave background radiation all around is is at 3 degrees Kelvin (three degrees above absolute zero). Black holes have a temperature, and it is non-zero, but it is VERY small (a tiny fraction of a degree K), and thus they radiate at whatever rate that temperature calls for. But that cosmic microwave background is continuously shining on the black hole, and it absorbs that energy all the time. That\u2019s more than it is radiating in most cases, so it grows. The CMB will drop to lower and lower temperatures over time, and in the far, FAR distant future that temperature will drop below the temperature of the black holes. Then the Hawking radiation they emit will exceed what\u2019s taken in from the CMB, and they will begin to \u201cradiate away.\u201d Over a very long period of time they will radiate away completely, and they will be gone. That\u2019s the very last thing projected to happen in the distant future of the universe, and when the last bit of the last one goes there will be nothing except photons in the universe. Sir Roger Penrose has a fascinating theory around this - he claims that because photons are insensitive to distance and to the passage of time, that when all that\u2019s left is photons the universe will no longer have a \u201cscale.\u201d It will literally \u201cforget that it is big.\u201d The math equations you\u2019d write down to describe that state are identical to the ones that describe the instants immediately after the Big Bang, so he things things will just \u201cbang again,\u201d and a new universe will begin to grow. He calls this theory \u201cConformal Cyclic Cosmology.\u201d Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Space is not a complete vacuum. The average density is 10^6 particles per m^3 (according to Wikipedia). Around a black hole, due to the gravitation field around it, a lot of physical matters are present and continuously being sucked into the black hole. I am not sure whether this is the \u2018energy\u2019 referred to in the question. ",
