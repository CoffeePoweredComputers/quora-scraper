            "answer_text": "Hydrogen react with water because the product - water - exists in a lower energy state than either of the elemental reactants. That said, there are several caveats. They don\u2019t react just because they are adjacent to one another. A mixture of the two would be quite stable in a rubber balloon at room temperature in the dark. The reaction must be triggered by an initiator. Once the reaction is triggered, all of the H2 and O2 react. The necessary initiator could be heat, light, a metallic surface, a free-radical initiator of some sort, a gamma ray or any other ionizing radiation from a radioactive element. One of these initiators is required to boost the reactants up to a transition state that will carry the reaction forward into the lower energy state - which is water. Once the reaction is initiated, the intermediate states will trigger adjacent molecules to so react. In the case here, it is a chain reaction: it will explode. The mechanism of the reaction has been well studied. Because the reactants and product are so simple, it has become the very \u201ctext book example\u201d of a chemical reaction. The kinetics of the reaction are studied by charging a long quartz cylindrical tube with H2 and O2, igniting one end, and studying the speed ( and other parameters ) as the fireball propagates down to the other end. For about one and a half seconds it is spectacular. ",

            "answer_text": "Electronegativity sums it up. The much bigger and exposed core of the oxygen atom usually bonds with other oxygen atoms to form O2. But as soon there is easier \u2018prey\u2019 around, the longer bonds between the Os are replaced by shorter bonds between the H and O as the hoard of electrons near the O core draw the positive charge of the H core near it and incorporate the single H electron in their party. But as with every party, the Hs start to hang around at one side (with the cool electrons) while the rest of the Os electrons gather alone one the other side. ",
