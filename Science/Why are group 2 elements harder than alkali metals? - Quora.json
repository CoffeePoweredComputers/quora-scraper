            "answer_text": "Due to the presence of stronger metal-metal bonds. Group 2 elements are harder than group 1 elements due to the presence of stronger metal-metal bonds in them. Group 2 elements are comparatively smaller than group 1 elements and give two electrons in the formation of metal metal bond between them. This leads to stronger metal-metal bonds between group 2 elements comparative to that between group 1 elements. Having stronger metal-metal bonds, group 2 elements become harder. ",
