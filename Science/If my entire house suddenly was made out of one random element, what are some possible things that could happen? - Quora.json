            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s take a look at the periodic table\u2026 There are 11 gaseous elements. For some of these you\u2019ll just take a little fall, because your house just drifted away in the wind. Some are heavy and might suffocate you if you don\u2019t quickly leave the vicinity. The problems are Fluorine and Chlorine. You\u2019ve just gassed your neighborhood. Oh, and radon might give you cancer. The 2 liquids are bromine and mercury. Bromine is toxic and corrosive, and you fell into a swimming pool of it. Good luck. Mercury is actually pretty safe if you\u2019re just touching it\u2026sadly you have a ton of mercury directly over your head. It\u2019s as heavy as bricks. Ouch. There are 5 solid non-metals and 8 metalloids. Most of them are soft, so\u2026not that great but better than the liquids. Some of the ~50 metals are fairly safe. However, there are poisonous ones, so you better hold your breath. But that won\u2019t really help you if your house immediately collapses, because a lot of the metals are either too weak to build a house out of, or too heavy to build a roof out of. If you survive a gold, silver or platinum house\u2026you might be rich! Most of the 6 alkali metals react violently with water, and you\u2019re mostly water. Lithium and sodium would be dangerous. If you got potassium, you\u2019re on fire. If you got rubidium, you\u2019re probably in little flaming chunks. If you got caesium, your entire neighborhood is probably in little flaming chunks. Let\u2019s not talk about francium. The effects of the 26 transuranic elements range from giving passersby cancer, to explosions, to removing everything within a few km radius from existence. I may be underestimating them. After all this\u2026If you survive you\u2019ll be national news and the government may want to have words with you about how you got yourself into this situation. Very strong words. ",

Any of the gasses, I hope there isn't a basement under you, regardless of toxicity of the gas.Mercury would result in catastrophic contamination of the area\u2019s water supply.The transuranic elements will kill the entire neighborhood.",
