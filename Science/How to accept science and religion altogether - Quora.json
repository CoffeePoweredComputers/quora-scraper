            "answer_text": " Mural of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei[*] I was raised as a Catholic ( hopefully, that does not scare you off!). I left my faith for 25 years. I still believed in God. I just was not convinced about any one particular manifestation of God, in any one religion. I am highly logical and open minded, therefore any \u201cfaith\u201d, that included unscientific ideas seemed absurd to me. I mean creationists, for example ( people who think the world is a few thousand years old, etc.). Since, there is overwhelming scientific evidence of the world being far older than that, that kind of \u201c religion\u201d, seemed suitable only for people who don\u2019t know how to reason very well. In any case, in a complete surprise to me, I had a dramatic conversion back to Christianity and Catholicism as well. I have studied the faith intensely for the last 20 years. It has almost like a completely different faith, than my experience growing up. Both, because I have so much more faith and find an incredible richness of spirit in the church, and because I am just literally awestruck at the intellectual rigor of the Catholic Church! For example the Catechism of the Catholic Church, is a large book, that explains the official doctrines and teaching of the church. Here is what is says about faith and reason: 159. Faith and science: \"Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth. Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are.\" This very clear statement that the Catholic Church sees no conflict between science and religion! It has been extremely popular to bash the Catholic Church for the last 500 years or so ( from the time of the \u201cPROTESTant\u201d, Reformation). Of course, there is much deserved criticism. However, I have been shocked to discover how many things about Christianity and the Catholic Church specifically, that everyone knows are \u201ctrue\u201d, are in fact blatant falsehoods! For example, most believe the Catholic Church is against science. Since science is almost like the new \u201creligion\u201d, for those that think of themselves as smart people, the Catholic Church seems like a non- starter for most. This view about the church and science could not be more wrong! For example, have you heard of the \u201c Big Bang Theory of the creation of the cosmos? It is a well accepted theory in Astro Physics ( meaning they have found lots of scientific evidence, proving parts of the theory correct so far). Well, would you be surprised to know a contemporary of Albert Einstein and George Hubell, named Father George Le Maitre was the originator of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d theory!That is correct, the foremost theory of the origin of the known universe, was proposed by a Catholic priest!  Father George Le Maitre and Albert Einstein Where past ( and present), religious figures get into trouble, is when they consider a particular scientific view as being theological! Ordained by God, in other words. As when many thought that a geocentric solar system, was religiously mandated. Therefore, the heliocentric theory occurred to them as a religious \u201c heresy\u201d. In retrospect, they look extremely foolish. To be fair, there were many Catholic clergy and even many scientists who thought exactly that! However, the Pope of Galileo\u2019s time did not. He correctly discerned that a heliocentric solar system could be true, as Copernicus had published 50 years earlier ( with the \u201c blessing\u201d of the Pope of that time, and also a prominent Cardinal). Here is evidence: \u201cPope Clement VII (r. 1523\u20131534) had reacted favorably to a talk about Copernicus\u2019s theories, rewarding the speaker with a rare manuscript.\u201d[5] So, decades before the Galileo controversy, Nicholas Copernicus (a Catholic clergyman), and later Johannes Kepler ( a PROTESTant),proposed the theory that the Sun was in fact the center of the Solar system, not the Earth. They both used mathematical arguments and astronomical observations to support his claim. \u201cTen years prior to Galileo, Johannes Kepler published a heliocentric work that expanded on Copernicus\u2019s work. As a result, Kepler also found opposition among his fellow Protestants for his heliocentric views and found a welcome reception among some Jesuits who were known for their scientific achievements.\u201d[2]  So, the popular idea that church saw Galileo as a threat to the church , is mostly wrong! It is true, however, that many in the church as well as PROTESTants ( Martin Luther being one)[2], thought such theories to be against the faith. In fact, the actual reason the Pope ( who was a friend of Galileo\u2019s ), forbade him to publicize his theory as fact, because he could not prove it scientifically![1] Because there was no peer reviewed scientific journals back then, to test theories and refute or prove them as the evidence was weighed, the church was the guardian of scientific truth. Because the technical means to prove Galileo\u2019s theory did not come until optical advancements in telescopes, made possible the first successful measurements of stellar parallax (it was accomplished by Friedrich Bessel, in 1838). From the time of Aristotle, it was known that if the heliocentric theory were true, there would be stellar parallax observed ( meaning-the position of stars would be seen to shift, as the earth changed location through it\u2019s orbit). Since, Galileo could not demonstrate this, he was unable to prove his theory.[7]  So, he could certainly talk about his theory ( and even publish it, as Copernicus had done-encouraged by the Pope of his time). He just could not say it was a fact, because it was not scientifically proven. That is what the Pope forbade him to do. He did it anyway! By claiming his theory was fact, because he had no proof, Galileo was being unscientific. That is why the Pope had to do something to discipline him. This is the ultimate irony in this controversy! However, Galileo being arrogant and reckless, went too far. First, he declared his theory to be fact ( without actually providing scientific proof). Then he insulted the Pope ( his friend, in fact), to boot! As so: \u201cThen in 1623, seven years after his condemnation, it appeared that Galileo\u2019s luck was finally about to change. His long-time friend and supporter Cardinal Barberini \u2013 who had valiantly defended him during the Inquisition \u2013 was elected to the head of the Catholic Church as Pope Urban VIII. Galileo was ecstatic.\u201d[6] \u201cWith renewed vigour, Galileo started to work on a new book, which compared the Copernican and Ptolemaic systems. He received permission from the pope to do so during a visit to Rome in 1624, under the condition that Copernicanism would be treated purely as a theoretical hypothesis. After receiving approval from the watchful Vatican censors in 1630, Galileo finally published his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systemstwo years later in 1632. Dialogue consisted of a series of conversations between three characters, Salviati, Sagredo and Simplicio. Salviati, a Copernican scientist, argues in favour of Galileo\u2019s theory, while Sagredo acts as an impartial scholar. Simplicio supports geocentrism and is depicted by Galileo as an idiot, emphasised by Simplicio\u2019s derogatory name, which translates to \u2018simpleton\u2019 in Italian. After years of struggle, Galileo\u2019s ambition had finally been achieved. His defence of Copernicus was printed in black and white for the world to see. He had deviously disregarded the stipulation that heliocentrism must be portrayed as mere theory \u2013 and he had even managed to do it all with the Church\u2019s approval. Galileo basked in his success, unaware that his downfall was right around the corner. \u201c[6] \u201cTo make matters worse, he had offended his powerful one-time ally, the pope \u2013 the one man who could have really helped him. When Pope Urban gave Galileo permission to write his Dialogue, he asked that the astronomer include his pro-geocentric arguments in favour of Ptolemy. Galileo\u2019s creation of Simplicio insinuated that, along with those who supported the Ptolemaic system, the head of the Church was a fool. He had single-handedly ensured that any help he could have received from Pope Urban was now just a pipe dream.\u201d[6] So, yes he defied the church. It was for scientific reasons that he was initially punished. Later, others made arguments that his theories amounted to heresy. This was to some degree provoked, by Galileo saying the Church\u2019s interpretations of scriptures were incorrect! If he had not pushed his arguments from the scientific realm, into theology, it probably never would have become a great controversy: \u201cScripture scholars of the past were willing to consider whether particular statements were to be taken literally or phenomenologically, but they did not like being told by a non-Scripture scholar, such as Galileo, that the words of the sacred page must be taken in a particular sense\u201c.[2] Trying Galileo for heresy was wrong, and for that the church deserves criticism ( which eventually was acknowledged by Pope John Paul II). In fact, I just read an excerpt from an interesting book about Galileo, \u201cSetting Aside All Authority: Giovanni Battista Riccioli and the Science against Copernicus in the Age of Galileo\u201c by Christopher M. Graney. He states that two prominent priests argued correctly, that the weight of scientific knowledge (of that time),was strongly against Galileo: \u201cGraney calls on newly translated works by anti-Copernican writers of the time to demonstrate that science, not religion, played an important, and arguably predominant, role in the opposition to the Copernican system. Anti-Copernicans, building on the work of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, were in fact able to build an increasingly strong scientific case against the heliocentric system at least through the middle of the seventeenth century, several decades after the advent of the telescope.\u201d[3]  T.H. Huxley, drawing by Carlo Pellegrini, 1871. Also, there is this opinion rendered in the 19th century, by no less a figure as Thomas Henry Huxley, English biologist, educator, and advocate of agnosticism (he coined the word). Known as \u201cDarwin\u2019s bulldog,\u201d he was no friend of the Catholic Church! He was a very prominent figure. His organizational efforts, public lectures, and writing helped elevate the place of science in modern society.[4] Here is his verdict on the matter: \u201cThe Victorian biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who had no brief for Catholicism, once examined the case and concluded that \u201cthe Church had the best of it.\u201d[2]\u201d Further evidence of Catholic scientific acheivements include, Gregor Mendel an Augustinian monk, who is known as the father of the science of modern genetics. This is quite far from fundamentalist creationism! Louis Pasteur, a brilliant scientist, is known as the \u201cfather of microbiology\u201d , \u201c pasteurization\u201d, and was instrumental in the development of \u201cGerm Theory\u201d, and vaccination. He was a strong Catholic as this quote attests:The Literary Digest of 18 October 1902 gives this statement from Pasteur that he prayed while he worked: \u201cPosterity will one day laugh at the foolishness of modern materialistic philosophers. The more I study nature, the more I stand amazed at the work of the Creator. I pray while I am engaged at my work in the laboratory.\u201d-Louis Pasteur What is my point? The church in fact holds that both faith and reason are important, and do not contradict each other at all. Arguably, the church actually laid the foundations of the scientific method, the entire university system of education, and much of modern philosophy through the efforts of towering figure who lived in the 1200s. This was the great Saint Thomas Aquinas. \u201cThe Catholic Church really has little to apologize for in its relations with science. Indeed, Stanley Jaki and others have argued that it was the metaphysical framework of medieval Catholicism which made modern science possible in the first place. In Jaki's vivid phrase, science was \u201cstill-born\u201d in every major culture\u2014Greek, Hindu, Chinese\u2014except the Christian West. It was the insistence on the rationality of God and His creation by St. Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic thinkers that paved the way for Galileo and Newton.\u201d[1] My second point is that you can learn about religion, faith, science, and philosophy in a reasoned and extremely credible way by several very accessible resources. The most powerful is this website: Credible Catholic .  This site is an entire course of Christianity, taught by a brilliant professor of philosophy and a Catholic priest ( Father Robert Spitzer, the former President if Gonzaga University). He has debated theoretical physics with Steven Hawking, taught philosophy, and written scores of well received books. Also check out Bishop Robert Barron\u2019s: Word on Fire - Word on Fire  Bishop Barron is another incredible voice of accessible, rational, and yet absolutely wondrous and beautiful religious faith. His video programs are so well done they have been shown on PBS, a totally secular media channel ( the Catholicism Series) You can go on YouTube and look Father Spitzer and Bishop Barron, as well. Another amazing resource is: EWTN Global Catholic Television Network: Catholic News, TV, Radio | EWTN  They have many many powerful programs you can watch there, or on their website, or on the actual television channel! There network is veritable treasure chest of truly incredible resources. I hope you will check them out. To close, I will mention something Bishop Barron said recently. He has been a real pioneer in social media. He began on YouTube around 15 years ago or so, trying to reach those who did not go to church! He started by reviewing music and movies. Just recently, he ventured into \u201cthe den of the lion\u201d, by going on \u201cReddit\u201d, to answer questions from nonbelievers. He said he was amazed to discover that almost none of these folks had heard of any of the hundreds of years of proofs of God\u2019s existence! Be careful, you may find like I did, that your non -belief might dissappear!

            "answer_text": "Two different games on the same board.Depends on what you mean by \u201creligion.\u201dSome have said that religion and science are \u201cnon-competing magisteria\u201d which I think is completely false. If religion was only about values, and not about facts, and if science was all about facts and not about values, then they would have a point. But religions do generally attempt to make factual statements about the cosmos. So while religion and science are playing on the same board (the board of allegedly factual statements about the cosmos), they are playing different games. The next question is what \u201cgame\u201d is religion playing? I say that you need to distinguish between religion and faith. To me, a good working definition of religion is that it is a human-created social institution which requires publicly endorsing certain beliefs as a condition of membership. (By contrast, political parties require endorsing certain programs of action - the party\u2019s platform - but on the whole, does not require endorsing beliefs.) Screw religion, so defined. I\u2019d rather focus on faith. For myself, I subscribe to a line from Babylon 5, \u201cFaith is the surrender to the possibility of hope.\u201d The way I understand that, is that faith is involved when, in all possible worlds where a proposition p is not true, there is no \u201chope\u201d - there is no action that the subject could take that would bring about a good life. In some worlds where p is true, then there are actions that the subject could take to bring about a good life for themselves. In such a situation, then I think that the subject would be justified in accepting p as true based on faith, and in ignoring any evidence against p. The key here is to make sure that all not-p possibilities are, indeed, sources of despair. This is seldom the case, but\u2026 At any rate, I think you should sort out issues of faith first. Figure out in what areas, you\u2019re prepared to say, \u201cif I\u2019m wrong on this, then I don\u2019t want to be right.\u201d Once you\u2019ve got that figured out, then you can take the rest of the world as it comes. And science is as good a tool for figuring out the world as any, and better than most. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are Christian, I suggest reading your Bible. 1)\tThe Bible says that all of Creation is created only by God: \"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on Earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities \u2013 all things have been created through Him and for Him.\" Colossians 1:16 \"All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.\" John 1:3 2)\tThe Bible says that God never lies. God does not lie or create lies: \"God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind.\" Numbers 23:19. \"God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie ...\" Hebrews 6:18 3)\tThe Bible says that God reveals Himself through His Creation: \"What may be known of God is manifest in them for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.\" Romans 1:19-20 As God's Nature is only Truth, anyone can seek anything in God's Creation and find the truth. It does not matter whether one is Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, or atheist, God reveals the same Truth to all, for it is not in God's Nature to lie. 4)\tThe Bible says that God bids humans to explore Creation and to ask questions: \u201cAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\u201d Matthew 7:7 So: - Only God brings all things into being; - God works only truth and never lies; - God reveals Himself in His Creation; - God bids humans to explore and question His Works to learn His Nature. If God is indeed constant, ever truthful, and reveals Himself in His Creation, then all God creates must be constant, truthful, consistent, and revealing of God. Science does exactly what the Bible bids humans to do: Explore God\u2019s Creation and ask God questions to learn God\u2019s Nature. Millions of people have devoted their lives over millennia doing just that: Exploring existence, asking questions, wondering, probing, learning, comparing experiences with others, repeating each other\u2019s experiments, verifying observations, steadily refining what is true and casting out what is false. Fundamentalists rejecting the findings of science do so on one of four bases: Created by Satan to mislead the faithfulViolates Colossians 1:16 and John 1:3Created by God as illusions to test the faithfulViolates Numbers 23:19 and Hebrews 6:18Fabricated and planted by humans in a worldwide conspiracyViolates Colossians 1:16 and John 1:3Just plain inconstant, inconsistent, or wrongViolates Numbers 23:19 and Hebrews 6:18All of the above rationales violate what the Bible says about the nature of God and His Creation. One even resorts to calling God Satan. All of the above rationales are therefore blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Jesus warns that is an unforgivable sin: \"And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.\" Matthew 12:31 So if you are Christian, your own Bible tells you to study God\u2019s Creation to learn His Nature. Studying God\u2019s Creation is exactly what science does. ",

            "answer_text": "I chose to see religion as a philosophy. God is an experience. While religion can play a role, it is nothing but a guide to live by in your interpretation of that experience. In other words, God and religion are two entirely different things, and while there are correlations between the two, they have nothing to do with each other. Actually, religion kind of only exists because of God (or non-god for atheism religions). But God exists on its own. It doesn't need religion, but religion needs God (or lack of one). So, how does this fall into your question. Well, for starters, I changed your structure of your words. And your definition of God. God is, after all, just a word. It can signify many things. Science and religion have always battled. There doesn't appear for either party to budge in their philosophies, which is fine. But, a scientist can believe in a natural phenomenon that binds us together. An \u201corder\u201d to things. Gravity is the best example of this. This constant, no matter where you are in space, no matter what planet you are in, no matter even if gravity appears to disappear all together and you \u201cfloat\u201d, it's still there. If you float out of the spaceship, you still \u201cfall\u201d downward. But even things falling \u201cdownward\u201d all the time can still be suspended (like our planets). Which is still constant. Why? Well, science has yet to come up with that answer. We just know that it does. It does what it's supposed to do. As a matter of fact, any small, miniscule change to anything in our universe would make it entirely unstable. It wouldn't form at all. And science can prove that it was literally (and I'm not sure what the actual statistical number, but just a relitive approximation here) 1 in a billion chances that this world was formed as correctly and uniformily as it is. 1 in a billion. And if just one thing is off (which could have happened 999,999,999 of the time) all of this would not, could not, be here. None of it. Not one thing. Not even an entirely different universe and structure. It just wouldn't be here. That's a powerful thing, this unity and literal perfect design. Even if you don't believe there is some designer behind it. Even if it was all a role of a billion dice that has over a billion sides on every dice. They ALL came up the same number. So, yeah, in science there is some role for \u201cGod\u201d. In its most strict and pure form, absolutely God and science work with each other more than religion and science ever can. Actually, God and science may not even be mutually exclusive. While religion needs God (and God doesn't need religion at all), science needs God, and God needs science. Because God is only a word. It's a word to describe an experience. That experience can be anything, even statistical perfection. ",

With oppositely restricted thought frameworks as the essential guide through our short lives here, is it any ponder the world is in disorder and confusion? The two positions we can hold, together or independently, highlight the disputation in this world, which thusly keeps us from encountering the very thing we as a whole need. For peace will never be found in a war zone, or in a mind torn in two by inverse perspectives. The thoughts we depend on to help control us through the intricate tangle of life\u2019s sources will, by need, reflect components that make up life. The principle conditions and actualities that both thought frameworks concur on are basic: Everything originated from one source.Everything is made of a similar stuff and contains a manly and feminine rule.We are altogether headed in a similar bearing and will wind up in a similar place or circumstance.On account of these thoughts, maybe it just bodes well to just concentrate on our common view and equality, and neglect any appearing contrasts that obstruct our aggregate search for truth. Love Science Albert Einstein proposed in an exceptionally casual and easygoing way that God, consequently Love, is all characteristic and discovered wherever in the realm of science. An unmistakable difference, Carl Sagan \u2013 a dedicated Atheist \u2013 guaranteed that \u2018love is a development of the primates\u2019. Yet, he additionally expressed that the absolute hugeness of the growing universe would \u2018be excruciating without love\u2019. Love is a general property of all life and is reflected wherever in the common world. Without love, life would be horrendous as well as incomprehensible; it is the law of fascination that offers ascend to all shape. Still, it is the inner penchant to join that holds the full articulation of our life constrain in light of the fact that Love is content and not types of any sort. Male and female standards are seen all over and are all over. Their unending fascination is actually created by the one thing they are pulled into \u2013 to be specific Love.This discovery will bring about a total eclipse of all man-made ideas as the truth of the excellence and power that we as a whole have, separately and together, shows itself as Heaven on Earth in our souls and brains.

            "answer_text": "Many people of my generation are grappling with COGNITIVE DISSONANCE -- trying to reconcile a religious teaching with a scientific theory. Cognitive dissonance in this case is hard to handle, for adults and children because both science and religion are poles apart from each other.  It can only be a good thing if someone tries to work through it, and all the better if they succeed and move to rational and logical reasoning. There are many ways to cure it but not all are good. For example, if I know x is true, but the data suggests that y is true as often as x, I can throw away half the data, all the results that do not fit the theory. I will get a wrong answer, but I will be much more at peace having resolved my CD. This is sometimes called \"confirmation bias\". Sometimes the way to cure Cognitive Dissonance is to not just relieve it, but to use it.I think it is the engine, the pressure, that drives almost all fresh learning and discovery.But if one short-cuts it looking for relief, it is like letting all the steam out of a train's boiler. You\u2019ll be very much comfortable. But you will never get anywhere. (Of course, it would be better if there were no cognitive dissonance to begin with, but we\u2019ve to work with what we\u2019re been handed from our upbringing)\ufeff ",

Convert to any religion other than those two and you will be in a religion with no conflict whatsoever. It can be a huge world religion like Hindu or Buddhism or a tiny one like Wicca or my Asatru. Thor doesn't object to science. If you intend to stay in your own religion then just decide to laugh every time your preacher says something against reason. You might want to shop around for mild churches where you won't need to laugh much. There's probably such a church within a few blocks. But mostly it will be about you deciding that clergy has little power in your life and your book of scripture is symbolic and filled with wisdom not literal and filled with errors. ",

Then you can go on believing that your god has made the universe including its physical laws and now just watches it humming along, with a beer and a bag of chips. Of course, at that point you can no longer tell other people that something is sinful because god doesn\u2019t want it (after all, if it\u2019s in the universe, it was made and therefore wanted) but on the other hand, you can now tell people that something is bad because sociology or psychology (i.e. science) says it\u2019s bad. The question what a chips eating and beer drinking spectator god likes or dislikes stays open, but I\u2019d not think about it too much. We\u2019ve been told the \u201cmysterious ways\u201d excuse way too often. According to most religious people, gods will is unknowable, therefore we can stop worrying about it and just do what we think is best. ",

Still, if the teachings of Buddhism are all true, it won't be so soon that science can prove much of them, considering that most scientific discoveries are within this short period of 500 recent years, compared to the history of mankind. Furthermore, scientists are mostly non-Buddhists. If there is any reconciliation, it will start with Enstein's energy theory with rebirth and Newton's second law with karma. ",
