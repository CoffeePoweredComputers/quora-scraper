            "answer_text": "In classical mechanics (Statics and Dynamics) both use the Free Body Diagram (FBD). As a science student, we have to study both Statics and Dynamics. In dynamics, where body under motion, in addition to FBD we also have to use Kinetic Diagram and Kinematic diagram that relates the FBD with motion (Kinematic and Kinetic) diagram. In this short webcast, it is explained with example the three types of diagram:  ",
