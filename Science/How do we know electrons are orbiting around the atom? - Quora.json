            "answer_text": "We don't know that they are.  In fact, we know that they aren't. They aren't orbiting in any sense that is anything like how planets orbit.  The ideas that they were lasted only a couple to a few years about a hundred years ago. We know that the atom has a heavy dense nucleus surrounded by a much more diffuse volume.  We know this because of throwing particles at them and seeing how they bounce off.  We also know how they pack, like in crystals. We know that the things that are in that more diffuse volume can be knocked off, and those things have a single negative charge each.  It's easy to knock them off.  You can even rub them off with such primitive tools as a piece of plastic or glass and a cat.  Or shoes on carpet.  We can even boil them off, sort of, by making some wire hot, which is how a vacuum tube works. We call this things an electron.  As Richard Feynman pointed out, though, the electron is really a theory.  I prefer the term \"model.\"  It's an idea that explains observed behavior. So if electrons have a negative charge, and the nucleus has a positive charge, and opposite charges attract, why doesn't the electron just fall to the nucleus and sit there?  The idea that they were somehow in orbit, as I mentioned, only lasted a few years. The thinking that has lasted for a century is as follows.  There is a limit to how precisely the position and motion of a particle can happen together.  It's a simple relationship, but I'll spare you the math.  The electron can't just fall to the nucleus and sit there, because then it would be in a precise location, and it wouldn't be moving.  So electrons occupy a volume much bigger than the nucleus as a kind of average that gives them some sort of a location and some sort of motion, but it's much bigger than the nucleus, so it's on the outside. This limitation, called the Uncertainty Principle, depends on mass.  Electrons are lighter than the particles in the nucleus, about 2000 times lighter, so the volume they have to occupy is much bigger.  The heavier protons and neutrons can be in a much smaller volume.  The Uncertainty Principle applies to them, too, but in a smaller volume. The places the electrons can be, we call, rather confusingly, \"orbitals.\"  There are other limitations.  Two electrons can occupy the same volume, but only if they have opposite spins.  Once there are two, there isn't any room for any more, so other electrons have to go into other volumes. Even more confusingly, orbitals are sets of these volumes, which are sometimes called subshells. The subshells form these seemingly weird shapes:   (I just swiped that picture from the web, so I can't take credit for it.  I once made a picture from some calculations, but I don't have it any more, and I didn't do anywhere near that many.) Though they look weird, they're actually just like how gong moves in various ways when you bang it.  So if you put some sand on a horizontal gong and bang it, you'll see cross sections of shapes like this. They'd be exactly like it if you had a three-dimensional gong instead of a flat one.  Think of a spherical blob of Jello, maybe, and the ways it could wobble with standing waves in the Jello. When you get to molecules rather than individual atoms, it gets much more complicated.  With metals, for instance, the electrons don't hang around one nucleus but instead blob around all the nuclei.  This is called band structure.  It's what makes metals so good for conducting electricity, and it also explains the high heat capacity of metals, and it also explains why they are opaque even if very thin. ",

            "answer_text": "Edit: I orginally wrote an answer quite similar to the one by Eric Pepke, but due to my darned procrastination Mr. Pepke beat me to it. But since I already put some effort into it, I rewrote my answer a bit and offer it here as a historical perspective to the question of how the modern picture of atoms was arrived at. Well, I guess for this answer one should go back to some history: J. J. Thomson first proposed the \"plum pudding\" model [1] of the atom in order to include electrons (which he had also discovered earlier) in the early atomic model (since most matter is electrically neutral, the charged particles Thomson discovered earlier had to be accompanied by some other matter with equal but opposite charge):   Thomson's model of the electrons did not last long, however; it was replaced by the Rutherford model of atoms [2], which is more or less the modern picture of atoms as \"electrons orbiting a nucleus\": the way he came to this conclusion is, in my opinion, quite ingenious. He had a setup like this:   What he essentially did was to shot a beam of alpha particles (which is a bound entity consisting of 2 neutrons and 2 protons; in other words, a heavy beast, indeed) at a very thin foil of gold. Around his target he placed a detecting screen which purpose is to detect any stray alphas. His experiment showed that: Most of the alpha particles went straight through the gold foil, or very near straight through, in the sense that they got deflected very little; this would be consisted with the picture that the atom consists of a uniform \"pudding\" embedded with electronic \"plums\". This is the correct interpretation since the alpha particles are much heavier than the electrons and thus would presumably not be scattered much (the correct mental image of this is of a bullet being shot through a piece of tissue paper);surprisingly, he found that some alpha particles got sharply reflected back in the direction of the incoming beam. Again, imagine the bullet-tissue paper analogy: if I told you to shoot into a black box and you saw what Rutherford saw in his experiment, and I later tell you that the black box contains a piece a tissue paper, you'd have a hard time believing me. Such was also the case with Rutherford.Confronted with this evidence, Rutherford proposed his own atomic model:   In his picture, the atom consists of a large and heavy core, called the nucleus. The nucleus carries positive charge and most of the mass of the atom. Surrounding the nucleus, almost 2000 times smaller than the nucleus, are the electrons, which carry the negative charge. This then ensures charge neutrality and consistency with Rutherford's result. Nowadays, of course, as already alluded to by Eric Pepke, the electrons are known to be described by wavefunctions; specifically, they are the solutions of the Schroedinger equation in the Coulombic field of the nucleus. The closest one could actually come to \"seeing\" the electrons directly are STM (scanning tunneling microscopy) [3] images of the electronic orbitals of the atoms on a graphite surface [4]; they produce images like this:   [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model[3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope[4] A.
