            "answer_text": "A particle moving under the influence of field force possesses both kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy does not need a reference point to measure in a frame, while potential energy needs a reference point. For example a body of mass 2kg moving with velocity 5m/s possesses the KE 25J. Let this body is moving on a horizontal surface at a height 5m. If ground is taken as reference point then PE of body will be 98J. If the surface of table is taken as reference point then PE of body will be 0J. So, the potential energy does possess the definite value but depends upon the choice of reference point unlike KE. ",
