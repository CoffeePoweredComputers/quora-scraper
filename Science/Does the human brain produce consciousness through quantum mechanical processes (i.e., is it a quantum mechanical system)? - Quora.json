            "answer_text": "Conventional answer: quantum mechanics can\u2019t explain the human mind. Despite the universal validity of the superposition principle, we see a live cat or a dead cat, never a live-and-dead cat superposition. Thermally-induced decoherence \"destroys\" (i.e. scrambles to the environment in a thermodynamically irreversible way) superpositions of distributed neuronal feature-processors in the warm, wet CNS too rapidly to support phenomenal binding into perceptual objects (cf. Maximilian Schlosshauer, \"The quantum-to-classical transition and decoherence\": http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2635v1.pdf). Not least, the dynamical timescale for quantum-coherent neuronal feature-binding is wrong \u2013 femtoseconds or less versus (we assume) scores of milliseconds. In consequence, even if some form of panpsychism is true, the existence of phenomenally-bound perceptual objects populating our classical world-simulations remains a fathomless mystery. Unconventional answer: only quantum mechanics can explain the mind. Phenomenal binding of distributed neuronal feature-processors into perceptual objects is classically impossible. The universal validity of the superposition principle in QM explains why we see classical cats in phenomenal world-simulations described by an approximation of classical mechanics. Recall Bertrand Russell's oft-quoted remark that one only ever sees the inside of one's own head. If membrane-bound neurons in the CNS were discrete, decohered classical objects, as we naively assume, then packs of neurons would at most be micro-experiential zombies: mere patterns of what William James christened \"mind-dust\" (cf. Phil Goff, Why panpsychism doesn't help explain consciousness). For 86 billion-odd distributed neuronal \"pixels\" of experience [colour-, motion-, shape-, edge- (etc) detectors] could no more create a phenomenally-bound classical cat-percept than 320 million skull-bound American minds could intercommunicate to create a unitary pan-continental cat-experience. Classical physics can\u2019t explain local or global phenomenal binding. By contrast, quantum physics potentially delivers a perfect structural match between the phenomenology of our minds and the formalism of QFT \u2013 confounding David Chalmers\u2019 dualism:  Can we put these two rival conjectures to the test? Yes, in principle! Unfortunately, armchair physicists probably underestimate the technical challenges to creating and experimentally manipulating in vitro \"Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s neurons\" superpositions (cf. physicalism. com: an experimentally testable conjecture). Yet unless the unitary dynamics of QM breaks down in neuronal networks (unlikely!), fleeting neuronal superpositions must exist. What\u2019s in question is whether decoherence in the CNS is too fast and uncontrollable for selection pressure on these neuronal superpositions ever to have got to work. My best guess \u2013 no more \u2013 is that such a molecular matter-wave interferometry experiment will confirm that organic minds have been quantum computers for over 540 million years. For a nice non-technical overview of the decoherence program in post-Everett QM, see John Campbell\u2019s review of Zurek\u2019s \u201cQuantum Darwinism\u201d:http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1001/1001.0745.pdf ",

There is a third and final, not so much voice but an almost infinitesimally small interval of time where the driving mind, that made you click on this is coming to an agreement with the skeptical questioning side as a yes no or maybe answer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th...

Reference below:\u201dhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/rel...\u201d material sourced is in italics. REFERENCE I As much as I love yet hate the popularization of physics, the average tax payer needs to know, that at the end of the day, their tax dollars gave them science that keeps their kids alive or safe. For example MRI machines and cell phones* or if you are okay with it, nuclear power.But at a more philosophical level, science eventually needs to compete with religion with the ultimate goal of a TIE!In the science lecture series, \u201cthe Mind after midnight\u201d a sleep researcher is able to show how rats dream in reverse with a fast forward feature.This reminds me of Dr. Fredkin\u2019s reversible computing example, and to me suggests that quantum computing (our brain) behaves in a very similar fashion, in that nature exploits quantum effects in things like photosynthesis. REFERENCE II, excerpt below: \u201c In 1982 Fredkin and Toffoli proposed the Billiard ball computer**, a mechanism using classical hard spheres to do reversible computations at finite speed with zero dissipation, but requiring perfect initial alignment of the balls' trajectories, and Bennett's review compared these \"Brownian\" and \"ballistic\" paradigms for reversible computation. Aside from the motivation of energy-efficient computation, reversible logic gates offered practical improvements of bit-manipulation transforms in cryptography and computer graphics. Since the 1980s, reversible circuits have attracted interest as components of quantum algorithms, and more recently in photonic and nano-computing technologies where some switching devices offer no signal gain. **I think our current universe is a three dimensional version of this where the different balls differentiate on the basis of different spin rates, and rely on broken symmetry (IE a NON random, hyper symmetric construct, wehre even magnetic moments are quantized (how cool is that) and that is discussed in another of my answers. REFERENCE I \u201cThe theory, called \"orchestrated objective reduction\" ('Orch OR'), was first put forward in the mid-1990s by eminent mathematical physicist Sir Roger Penrose, FRS, Mathematical Institute and Wadham College, University of Oxford, and prominent anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, Anesthesiology, Psychology and Center for Consciousness Studies, The University of Arizona, Tucson. They suggested that quantum vibrational computations in microtubules were \"orchestrated\" (\"Orch\") by synaptic inputs and memory stored in microtubules, and terminated by Penrose \"objective reduction\" ('OR'), hence \"Orch OR.\" Microtubules are major components of the cell structural skeleton.Orch OR was harshly criticized from its inception, as the brain was considered too \"warm, wet, and noisy\" for seemingly delicate quantum processes.. However, evidence has now shown warm quantum coherence in plant photosynthesis, bird brain navigation, our sense of smell, and brain microtubules. The recent discovery of warm temperature quantum vibrations in microtubules inside brain neurons by the research group led by Anirban Bandyopadhyay, PhD, at the National Institute of Material Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan (and now at MIT), corroborates the pair's theory and suggests that EEG rhythms also derive from deeper level microtubule vibrations. In addition, work from the laboratory of Roderick G. Eckenhoff, MD, at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that anesthesia, which selectively erases consciousness while sparing non-conscious brain activities, acts via microtubules in brain neurons.\u201d REFERENCE II There are two major, closely related types of reversibility that are of particular interest for this purpose: physical reversibility and logical reversibility.A process is said to be physically reversible if it results in no increase in physical entropy; it is isentropic. There is a style of circuit design ideally exhibiting this property that is referred to as charge recovery logic, adiabatic circuits, or adiabatic computing. Although in practice no nonstationary physical process can be exactly physically reversible or isentropic, there is no known limit to the closeness with which we can approach perfect reversibility, in systems that are sufficiently well isolated from interactions with unknown external environments, when the laws of physics describing the system's evolution are precisely known. Probably the largest motivation for the study of technologies aimed at actually implementing reversible computing is that they offer what is predicted to be the only potential way to improve the computational energy efficiency of computers beyond the fundamental von Neumann-Landauer limit[2]of kT ln(2) energy dissipated per irreversible bit operation. (Though even the Landauer limit was millions of times below the energy consumption of computers in 2000s and thousands less in 2010s.[3]) ",

Intelligence and quantum mechanics both have mathematically intriguing properties: consciousness, intuition, mixed states, interference, no-cloning, and more, but it's not clear how they might or might not be related. The no-cloning theorem (related to the uncertainty principle) dictates that there is more quantum information in any brain than can be replicated in a perfect copy, but that doesn't mean that the lost details are crucial to thought in any way. Likewise, intuition (for example, understanding why 1+1=2 without someone teaching you) is impossible to achieve perfectly with any algorithm, which might suggest a depth to intelligence that can't be simulated with classical physics, but who says that conscious intuition is perfect to begin with? Even if intelligence arises just from interactions of neurons and neurotransmitters, the mush of classical particles that makes up any brain is still governed by quantum mechanics, so we've got that going for us, which is nice.

            "answer_text": "YES. Below I briefly explain why. To be fair, you should first know that most experts in neuroscience and physics who have considered this question would say what Steve Zara said: \u201cNo. The brain is a vast collection of neural networks which operate through electrical and chemical interactions. There is no place in that for any quantum-mechanical strangeness.\u201d Temperature objection: Many scientists believe that it is implausible that a macroscopic quantum state could survive in a warm brain. This opinion is typically based on calculations in simple models that assume thermodynamic equilibrium in brain tissue (Tegmark 2000). But an older simple model (Frohlich) demonstrates how energy flow through a system (i.e. steady-state metabolism, not at thermal equilibrium) of molecular dipoles can organize it into stable coherent states even at high temperatures. So in my opinion a quantum substrate for consciousness in the brain is not ruled out. But why would one consider such an \u201cexotic\u201d hypothesis when current understanding of neural dynamics seems to account for a wide range of behavioral and cognitive phenomena? It is very popular to deride theoretical arguments, but here is a simple argument that motivates the idea that consciousness requires a quantum physical description. Our states of consciousness are intrinsically unified; they are irreducible wholes. But there are no irreducible wholes in classical physics. Really. Quantum physics on the other hand describes the dynamics of irreducible wholes, because that\u2019s what quantum states are. Thus the quantum brain or quantum consciousness or quantum mind approach has the potential to solve the \u201cphenomenal binding problem\u201d at a fundamental level. This should not be dismissed lightly because synchrony in a classical brain model (a la Singer) cannot do this (I said why above), despite protests you may hear from well educated people. One can also note that despite impressive successes classical neural network theory has not yet managed to account for the full range of human cognitive abilities, even if we recklessly decide to neglect consciousness. Yes (classical) computers can beat us at face recognition and Go now, but current models simply do not capture the flexibility of our \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Quantum computation in a brain could give it significant advantages over a classical brain (e.g. Quantum Associative Memory). Quantum physics is not \u201cexotic\u201d or \u201cstrange\u201d to Nature; it is Nature. A variety of \u201ccircumstantial\u201d experimental evidence is consistent with the possibility I am arguing for, that a macroscopic quantum state in the brain underlies our consciousness and mind. For example, Context effects produced by question orders reveal quantum nature of human judgments. From the biophysical side, ultraweak light radiation emitted by all living tissue (\u201cbiophotons\u201d) has been shown by Popp et al to exhibit a non-equilibrium distribution demonstrating the existence of an underlying coherent state.Such leakage of coherent light radiation is predicted by certain quantum models of memory and consciousness (Del Giudice, Vitiello). Aside from the temperature objection addressed above, another common objection to the hypothesis that a quantum process underlies consciousness, is the assertion that \u201cthere is no place\u201d for quantum effects in the brain. This attitude stems from familiarity with the deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations which govern neural dynamics like Newton\u2019s Laws in physics. If these equations determine everything neurons do, how could there be a role for some additional quantum ghost? But synaptic transmission among neurons in the central nervous system is extremely \u201cnoisy\u201d or random or \u201cunreliable.\u201d In other words, synaptic transmission in the brain is probabilistic, and the transmission probabilities vary with time. We do not necessarily know every factor that can affect synaptic transmission probability at each synapse from moment to moment. This apparent randomness represents a \u201cplace\u201d where a hypothetical quantum state could interact with the well-known neural machinery to guide adaptive behavior. As a concrete example, the theory of Hameroff and Penrose posits a collective quantum state in brain microtubules. The microtubule state could condition the state of the photon field inside microtubules, which in turn could modulate synaptic transmission probabilities via liquid-crystal actin molecules that reside near the synaptic junction (the microtubules tend to be \u201caimed\u201d down neuronal axons toward the synapse). This is analogous to how liquid-crystal gates function in optical computers. This is one specific example to demonstrate that the brain\u2019s neural networks are not completely determined classical machines even in the mainstream description, so one can reasonably consider how a hypothetical additional factor\u2014the quantum conscious process\u2014might interact with the known neural machinery.

From what I understand, it's not inconceivable that quantum computing might be involved in the production of consciousness, but it's not very likely. To keep entangled particles from decohering, you need to keep them very isolated from other particles and forces, either with magnetic traps or very low temperatures. The brain is a warm, wet, chemically and electrically active environment, terrible for quantum computing. Also, it doesn't seem like you need to invoke quantum computing to understand consciousness, for a couple of reasons. First of all, plain old chemistry is perfectly adequate to produce the full complexity of the brain's activities. Secondly, the brain probably isn't a computer at all; it has no top-down organizational structure. The brain is more of an ecosystem where certain synaptic connections compete for metabolic resources. Consciousness emerges from this competition, as synapses form networks of networks of networks, eventually building up recursive representations of the brain's activities to itself. ",

It is humorous to note that that it took a long time to discover microtubules existed because the standard method of preparing cells to be examined under a microscope dissolved the microtubules. Just off the top of my head I think that there is some interest in the connection between the fact that anesthesia tends to dissolve microtubules and the fact that it causes one to lose consciousness, but I'd definitely cross check that. That said, I don't believe quantum computation in necessary to explain consciousness.  I do have one personal observation though. In quantum mechanics there are always significant ramifications for when particles or systems are indistinguishable. I believe consciousness innately must be indistinguishable regardless of the individual or entity experiencing it. I think consciousness may end up being considered a type of singularity in physics, not to imply any connection to black holes. I have no clue to what the ramifications of these ideas are, but I suspect they are valid concerns. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, even in the interpretations of quantum theory that posit hard determinism. Hard determinism, even though it rejects all ontological randomness, is compatible with alternative possibilities. It does not preclude the power to \"do otherwise\", so does not contradict our belief in conscious freedom of choice. Even under hard determinism the set of conditions which specify an observed system is not adequate to determine which event will be observed. The conditions define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will be observed. When an observer exercises freedom, by his act of choice he is adding a factor not supplied by the observed system and is thus himself determining what will occur. That he does so is known only to himself. From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law. It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the observer himself that he is free. The outcome is neither random nor determined only by the observed system. We must still however accept that the future is at all times determined- not solely by the observed system but by the observer acting in conjunction with the system.

If you think that free will needs freedom from the ability of someone to predict what you do, then quantum mechanics doesn't help because it happens on such an incredibly tiny scale it has no relevance to how you make your decisions.  Your decisions, according to biology, are the result of the states of brain cells, and brain cell states are vastly bigger and longer-lived than quantum effects.  So, quantum mechanics is nowhere near a large enough gap in physics (assuming it is a gap) for unpredictability to have an influence on mental events. If, like me, you believe that free will is not about predictability, but freedom from other influences than your own wishes, then quantum mechanics is of no consequence anyway. ",

It's more about the causal connections between mental processes and actions, whether you're *determined* by causes outside your control to act as you do. You might think QM gives a 'yes' answer in this case, since not only is it unpredictable (sometimes), that unpredictability is the result of fundamentally chancy events. But... all this means is that, if QM explains your actions (or the will that caused them), that those things themselves are uncaused, and in an important sense, arbitrary!

            "answer_text": "I think the opposite question would make more sense - Do quantum effects interfere with free will? A deterministic universe would mean that each decision we make is based entirely on the state of our own mind (brain) and the rest of the universe at a given time. I don't see how you could get more free than that. The interference of something not dependent on either your mind or the rest of the universe, whether that thing is God or randomness caused by quantum unpredictability, can only reduce your ability to make the decisions that your mind \"intends\".

Each of those has about 10 billion atoms, which is the scale that quantum mechanics studies. At that scale, quantum mechanics doesn't have anything to say that wasn't already discovered by classical mechanics and electrodynamics. The weight of the probabilities in the QM world gets turned into statistics that form the laws of physics we all understand intuitively. ",

If you want to find out about free will, you will have to go back farther into time and study the infinite structure that brought forth the elementary particles,... Then you would have go back farther and study the design and establishment of the structure into the infinite emptiness. Then you would have to go back even farther and also read what is recorded in the Bible about why free will was given to mankind. You will find that it is a personal choice that we all make about where to accept God as our creator and accept the way that he teaches us to live our lives. ",
