            "answer_text": "In simplest terms the Otto cycle is an internal combustion engine that compresses a mix of vaporized fuel and air in a cylinder through the rise of the piston stroke.  Then ignites the mixture with a spark of electricity so that it burns explosively just before maximum compression.  This can be done with either four stroke or two stroke engines.  In order to run safely an Otto cycle engine must use a fuel that vaporizes easily, and it must not compress the fuel to the auto ignition temperature for that fuel.  This compression limit is commonly described as the Octane rating.  The higher the Octane rating the more the vaporized fuel air mixture can be compressed before it will auto ignite without the sparkplug igniting it at the correct time. Low octane gasoline has an Octane rating of 87 at most American gas stations while E-85 fuel has an Octane rating of 105.  This makes E-85 fuel suitable for high compression Otto cycle engines with the correct fuel system components. Diesel cycle engines are internal combustion engines that compresses air with no fuel in it to a very high pressure which causes the temperature of the air to rise. This effect is known as Boyle\u2019s Law, compressing a gas causes it to heat up and decompressing a gas causes it to cool down.  Because the air has no fuel vapor mixed in it you can compress it to a very high pressure which causes it to grow very hot.  In a Diesel cycle engine a fuel injector sprays a very fine mist of liquid fuel into the cylinder just as the gas reaches maximum heat and the heat causes the mist to burn very rapidly.  The spray of mist is a very short spurt, but in that short time the burning fuel heats the air in the cylinder and keeps it very hot even as the cylinder volume expands as the piston goes back down.  This steady high pressure lasts for most of the down stroke and provides great torque to the drive shaft.  Much like Otto cycle engines a Diesel cycle engine can also be two stroke or four stroke with two stroke engines often given catchy names like \u2018Power Stroke\u2019 because every compression cycle leads to a power cycle. A four stroke cycle has a compression upward stroke, downward power stroke, upward exhaust stroke, downward intake stroke.  By careful design a two stroke engine combines the bottom of the stroke into an exhaust/intake event by forcing fresh intake air into the top of the cylinder under pressure that forces exhaust gasses out the bottom of the cylinder through a side valve. You should also be aware that Otto cycle engines are not the only design intended to use easily vaporized fuels like gasoline or alcohol.  The alternative gasoline design is the Wankel engine that uses lobed chambers instead of cylinders and pistons.  This permits the engine to constantly turn through a cycle instead of forcing the pistons to reverse direction every half cycle.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is a nice question, let us first of all take a look at what otto and diesel cycle actually are. Otto Cycle  It is the ideal cycle for spark ignition engines which has following processes considering air standard assumptions. The air standard assumption allow us to treat air as working fluid, and the combustion of fuel is replaced by constant volume heat addition process, exhaust is replaced by constant volume heat rejection. 1\u20132 : isentropic compression of air in cylinder. 2\u20133 : constant volume heat addition. 3\u20134 : isentropic expansion of air. 4\u20131 : constant volume heat rejection. Now let us take a look at diesel cycle. Diesel cycle  It is the ideal cycle for compression ignition engines and the process in accordance with air standard assumptions are. 1\u20132 : isentropic compression of air in cylinder. 2\u20133 : constant pressure heat addition to air. 3\u20134 : isentropic expansion of air. 4\u20131 : constant volume heat rejection. Here also we have replaced combustion process with constant pressure heat addition and exhaust with constant volume heat rejection in accordance with air standard assumptions. Now we can discuss differences between them. Differences between otto and diesel cycle: 1: For a given compression ratio, i.e V1 / V2 , the efficiency of otto cycle is higher than diesel cycle. 2: The combustion process occurs at constant volume in case of otto cycle and occurs at constant pressure in diesel cycle. 3: Combustion in otto cycle occurs due to generation of spark in the cylinder when the piston reaches tdc and is instantaneous. Whereas in case of diesel cycle combustion is time consuming and occurs due to injection of fuel in cylinder which is filled with hot compressed air (at point 2 in figure) due to which auto ignition of fuel takes place. 4: Due to the fact that we compress air in diesel cycle rather than fuel(in otto cycle) , the air can be compressed to very high pressures and then the fuel can be injected accordingly , thus incresing compression ratio and higher efficiency of diesel cycle. 5: So for same max pressure of cycle, diesel cycle is more efficient that otto cycle. 6: The compression ratio in case of otto cycle is however limited because in otto cycle , air fuel mixture is being compressed which can lead to very high temperature of air fuel mixture and can cause auto ignition of fuel before the power stroke. 7: The compression ratio in diesel cycle is also limited due to the metallurgical reasons , air is compressed to such temperatures which will not harm the engine parts.
