            "answer_text": "Depending on your JEE score you will get an All India Rank AIR,a state rank and a category rank.Basically your AIR is the main rank because according to it you will get your selection as per your choice filling.On the other hand the state rank you will get will be applied only to your home state quota i.e your home state NIT.Every NIT's provide a separate quota for their home state students as per mhrd.So it is applicable if you will give your home state NIT in your choice filling.If you want to study in outside NIT's then your home state rank will not give any relaxation.That time only your AIR rank will decide your seat because you will opt for your NIT's other than your home state.And yeah the entire selection whether home state NIT or other state NIT's will be done based upon your category rank i.e if you are general category student then your counselling will be done among the general category students.Similarly SC,OBC,ST,PH. Let me add a little bit of information about OBC students.For obc students who are residing in Tripura you wont get any advantage for belonging to OBC category in NIT Agartala but students from other state will get.Your counselling will be done among the general category students.I dont know about the other NIT's since I myself from NIT Agartala. Be calm and fill your choice wisely.Give choice according to your branch interest and before that please have an idea about the NIT's you are thinking of giving as a choice.Because every department in every NIT is not good considering placements,facilities,academic records etc.So be specific to your branch selection and fill the choice after gathering information in which of the NIT's your desired branch is good in. Thank you. All the very best. ",

            "answer_text": "NITs have 50 percent weightage for outside state students and 50 percent weightage for in-state students. So, for getting admission to one of the NITs, students have to do their class 11th and 12th from that particular state and it has nothing to do with the domicile or where they reside. So, let us assume a student has a domicile of X state and is taking 11th and 12th from Y state. So now he becomes eligible for the NIT of Y state, along with this he is also eligible for state entrance exams of state engineering colleges of X state. But he would not be eligible for NIT of X state. For students of union territories, full home state quota is available at the nearest NIT. ",
