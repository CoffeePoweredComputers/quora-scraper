            "answer_text": "It is a very effective tool used in engineering mechanics to analyze the structures and find the unknown forces. To draw a free body diagram the following steps may be used. Show all the forces which are directly acting on the body including the weight by representing it as vectors.Isolate the body by removing all the supports.Show the forces exerted by the supports on the body as vectors.Forces may be resolved in to x and y components and shown for easy solution.If two or more objects are considered as a single unit, the action reaction pair between them will cancel out and should not be considered.The figure shows two blocks connected by a rope which is passing over a pulley.  To draw the free body diagram of the block lying on the inclined plane (when the block tends to move upward), we isolate the block from its supports. Here the supports are string restricting the downward movement and the inclined plane (In the absence of the plane, block swings anticlockwise). Remove the supports and replace the forces exerted by the string (T ) and by the plane (normal reaction N and frictional resistance fR). The frictional resistance is shown downward as we are considering a case, where the block is tending to move upward. The weight of the block Mg acts vertically downward. The free body diagram of the block resting on the inclined plane is shown below.  ",

            "answer_text": "A free body diagram is a representation of forces, acting on any body which can be represented by dot. So forces are represented by arrows and masses are represented by dots. Why is that? \u00b0 First of all this reduces so much confusion, and give a nice idea how many forces are acting on any body. \u00b0 In problem solving, we encounter the direction of motion, and net forces. This idea of FBD helps us to understand the direction of motion, and through which we can figure out the component of forces in the direction of 3 spatial axes, and help us to write the net force equation easily. \u00b0 One can ask that how we can neglect the dimension of the body? Well, we know that the whole mass of the body centred at its centre of mass. If centre of mass is moving with certain velocity, than all the masses surrounds to it is having same velocity. Hence we can treat bodies to be dimension less, and newton\u2019s formulation describes well enough. \u00b0 But in rotation we need to take account of the shape of the object and we just can\u2019t assume to be point mass. Hence there is a concept of MOMENT OF INERTIA. ",
