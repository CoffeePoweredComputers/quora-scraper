            "answer_text": "How would you define \"scientifically\"? Most people think being scientific means to emulate physics. It means that the subject must develop elegant mathematical models and must be predictable. If these do not exist, then the discipline in unscientific. While this may seem incredulous, this view actually exists in the social sciences. Look at economics. Most economists till the late 19th century used to study economic activities in a more qualitative manner, and they were not blockheads. In fact, they were some of the greatest economists who were later forgotten. Even today, there are renowned economists who study economics more as a qualitative subject than as a quantitative one. These folks have more sound policy suggestions. On the other hand, quantitative economics borrowed a lot of terminology from physics, such as equilibrium (static and dynamic), elasticity, etc. It meant abstracting human action into mathematical models. Other social sciences have also tried this to an extent. I've seen political scientists and sociologists use mathematical models, and linguistics uses maths and computational analysis quite extensively (though in this case, it is actually warranted).  However, there is a different meaning to being scientific. It means that one must suit their frameworks according to the subject that the discipline studies. It is unsuitable to use microscopes to study astronomy and telescopes in biochemistry. Similarly, one can't use individual-level analysis, which psychology uses, to study societies at an aggregate level, which sociology and anthropology do. (However, there is a considerable overlap between these disciplines, which is a story for a different time).  Mary Midgley puts this very well in her book Beast and Man: Roots of Human Nature:   \"The scientific temper is one that looks for the appropriate method in each field, that carefully distinguishes different sorts of questions for differing treatment. To become obsessed with a method for its own sake and try to use it where it is unsuitable is thoroughly unscientific.\" In other words, when all you have is a hammer (read \"the scientific method as exemplified by physics\"), all problems start to look like nails.  Bent Flyvbjerg, in his book Making Social Sciences Matter, deals with this in more detail. He argues that the frameworks and perspectives used to study social sciences must necessarily vary from those used in the natural sciences, simply because of the nature of the subject.  Keeping these mind, can political science be studied scientifically? Yes, it can be, and it has been. One of the greatest works of political science that studies the discipline \"in its own language\" [1] is The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli. There are many other great works in political science, but this book is regarded as setting the foundation for the scientific study of political science. Another book that deals with political science is Aristotle's Politics, especially his comparisons between different constitutions. [1] I've borrowed this phrase from the Robert Sapolsky's characterization of how ethology studies animal behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "Political science, law, Evolutionary Psychology, Social Psychology, Economics, history etc all study aspects of politics from the evolution of the structure of the institution of governance right back to the tribal chief to current legislation and its political, fiscal and social impact. Politics is both a form of institution that has multiple levels from small groups of people electing a representative through to world political structures and it is also a kind of behaviour. Just as politics has many properties, there are many scientific disciplines studying them. Environmental law, for instance, penetrates far beyond the mere decision making process and reaches right into the ecology, flora and fauna. Health law impacts on individuals, institutions such as hospitals, societies and the nation as a whole and each of these lends itself to scientific investigation. Science is the objective eyes and ears of a country. Unfortunately some people ignore objective research and prefer their own politically biased opinions and this in turn always leads to short sighted decisions and eventually to various degrees of disasters. Equally troubling is political interference in science, as we saw in early Soviet Russia and the resulting famine caused by science corrupted by political opinion. The USA is facing similar attitudes today. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say at the present time and for the foreseeable future, no.  The problem is complexity.  Politics is the art of structuring and managing human governance.  All of the entities involved in the process are intentional actors.  When you add up all the factors that go into the formation of just one person's intentions -- and then multiply them by all the human actors in even a simple political interaction -- you get to a point where \"science\" just doesn't make sense as a mode of rigorous knowledge. The conceit that there could actually be something that it would be legitimate to call \"political science\" is, I think a result of foolish \"scientism.\"  In my opinion, much of economics is the same. There are certainly legitimate applications of the scientific method to some issues of human behavior and mental activity that can shed important light on political questions, but to think that one can jump from those sorts of things to a true \"science of politics\" is, as one very wise man called it, a \"fatal conceit.\" ",

However, I would note that theories of politics can never become as rigid and comprehensive as theories of for example chemistry. Societies are incredibly complex and forever changing due to our biological, social and technological evolution, and therefore similar policy can have dramatically different outcomes in different societies and in different points in time. That being said, you can still state for example that: \u201cBased on historical occurrences A, B, C and D, policy X is expected to have effects Y and Z\u201d which to me is a perfectly scientific statement.

Science is meant for the categorisation of the physical elements, but is guided by coherent logic and reason in it\u2019s deduction and observation of the physical universe. To think coherently and logically is a fundamental part of the deduction process of science, and this coherency and logical ability to process information is not limited to science, and the more people study science the more they realise this. Some people, though, do use science to discredit everything and this is not coherent or logical, but an error. Intelligent observations and conclusions are useful when we have a purpose for those observations. Psychology does not have a useful purpose for the study of the human mind articulated in the definition of psychology. Psychology is primarily used to normalise deranged behaviour and to exploit human weakness for sordid gain. Although politics is suppose to be government by the people, for the people, for the good of the people, it is controlled by those who seem to use the same mindset in psychology, and until we articulate a useful purpose for psychology, the errors here will persist, and even science has not been unaffected by the omission of the obvious improvements we need to make in the articulation of our structures of thought. IN short, all that we know and understand is rooted in language, and we really need to start to understand the effects language has on our psyche, perceptions, attitudes and actions, and find and implement solutions to the many improvements to the many quality of life issues, worldwide.
