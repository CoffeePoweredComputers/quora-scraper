            "answer_text": "Tesla was OCD and a vegetarian, eventually he limited himself to a diet of only milk, honey, bread, water, some vegetables and whiskey - until prohibition which Tesla swore took decades off of his life, but he obeyed the prohibition 'law'. Tesla had a fear and aversion to germs (he had become very ill as a child and almost died) - and reportedly only ate boiled foods. Not a terrible idea in those years. However, Nikola Tesla died a virgin; significant only in that we have to wonder, \"Does anyone really know?\"   Tesla was never married or lived with anyone as an adult, so nobody can attest to first hand knowledge of his eating rituals.  Amusingly, one of his best buddies was Mark Twain. I can imagine them having fun creating 'Tesla tales' - pure speculation on my part, but entirely fathomable as well. I think it's a fact Tesla loved his whiskey - as he attested to loving it in his writings and in conversations - and others who knew him confirm it.  ",
