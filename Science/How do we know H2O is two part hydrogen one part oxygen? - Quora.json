            "answer_text": "There are some experiments that can be done that confirm that two parts hydrogen react with one part oxygen to produce water. If you were to mix in a container a volume of oxygen gas and double that volume of hydrogen gas and ignited it, it would all be consumed and turned into water. I don\u2019t really recommend doing that at home, though, because that reaction is so fast, it will be an explosion. It would release a lot of energy and likely bust open the container and fling fragments out like a hand grenade. As an undergraduate student, I had a summer research assistantship for which I had to mix various gases and burn them inside a very strong long tube. So I did this actual experiment with this stochiometric mix of hydrogen and oxygen (see Stoichiometry - Wikipedia). It went bang! It did not explode like a hand grenade. But it was designed not to. Don\u2019t do it at home! An experiment that you can do at home is to cause the reverse of this reaction to happen. You can use electrolysis to convert water back into hydrogen and oxygen. See Electrolysis - Wikipedia. Here, this video shows someone doing this exact experiment:  Just go watch that. He only added the salt so this would work with a 9 volt battery. If you don\u2019t add the salt, then you need a higher voltage. ",
