            "answer_text": "I will give an example right away by simply dismissing this question and making the claim that it is not, and without a single word of substantiation or support. It is evident that this answer is quite inferior to your thought provoking question. Questions give birth to answers and it has been my experience at times that some of the progeny are far superior to the parents. Questions seek resolution and when empiricism strikes and the resolutions vary the original ipecac has done a great service to encourage the refining process. Specialized questions can be posited to produce accurate (if more mundane) answers. And sometimes the best questions are those that produce no answer but rather leaves the questioned with wheels spinning in contemplation. This sort of question ignites a desire in the hearer to learn and maybe never respond. Just some thoughts. Thanks for the question. Edit: Hopefully the banner which shows the question I originally answered is above this one. That question was profound and answer- worthy. This one, not so much. Originally answered, How is a question better than an answer? ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Are good questions better than good answers? While better is rather subjective, yes, I do think there's a very reasonable case to be made that good questions possibly have more utility than good answers (if utility can be used as some form of metric for better). Especially from Quora's point of view. Quora seem to think so too - they have even been prepared to trial paying for questions, after all. From my point of view, most of the time I prefer reading (what I feel are) good answers, to reading good questions and thinking \"Yes, I think I'll enjoy answering that one.\". But usually not by much. Depends on whether or not I'm in a mood to be answering, or a mood to just be reading.  Thanks for the A2A David. ",

            "answer_text": "How is a question better than an answer? This answer applies only to Quora. Much of the info comes from https://www.quora.com/about. The way Quora works is that questions are the title of threads. Theoretically, people ask Quora the same kind of questions they ask Search Engines such as Google. That will prompt Google, and other Search Engines, to find Quora\u2019s content when doing searches for internet users across time and geography. Quora further believes that great questions open the way to great answers. As Quora users know, a single question can raise a large number of answers. For example, what happens when you accidentally back your vehicle into a police car? I think that was the question that hooked me on Quora because an actual police officer whose cruiser had once been backed into wrote an answer. Had I known to look, there might have been others from other jurisdictions. Another example: I follow a university professor\u2019s answers. People ask all kinds of questions on what it\u2019s like being a prof. Be he\u2019s not the only person who responds to those questions. That means readers get to learn about more than one university professor\u2019s experiences and opinions. Conclusion: One question on Quora leads to a much larger insight than a single post about one person\u2019s experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: How is a question better than an answer? Answering questions can be a learning experience as we need to think on how to deliver an efficient response. It seems that \"learning\" happens on both sides of the exchange - - At the student level, and at the teacher\u2019s. The act of asking a question is also a way of teaching, and it is not an easy task to ask good questions. Questioning requires thinking about the topic being inquired so that we can present the problem to someone else. In fact, when we can properly formulate a question, we are closer to the answer even before asking. This is because we understand what we don't understand. So, is a question better than an answer? Answering is reinforcing what we already know, but it can expand our own awareness even furtheron that same subject. Asking, on the other hand, is being proactive. It pushes our envelope by propelling our consciousness forward. In many cases, it's also an act of humility; an acknowledgement of our own vulnerability or lack of understanding. For the most part, it takes courage to ask a question. ",

The question is what inspires the answer, and so a good question is truly better than a good answer. ",

It can be helpful if you are open to multiple possible answers to a question. You can still evaluate the responses you receive and assess which answer(s) are a better fit. The key is to not close off the discussion too early. You might miss out on the opportunity to gain insights otherwise. This approach works best for open ended questions such as: \u201cWhat are ways we can increase our productivity at work?\u201d as compared to factual questions such as: \u201cWhere is our next team meeting?\u201d. Hope this gives you some \u201cfood for thought\u201d. ",
