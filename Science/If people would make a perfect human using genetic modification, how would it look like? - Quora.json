            "answer_text": "What do you mean perfect? As a weapon? As a human in part of a society? As a spy or a hitman? As a leader? As a scientist? Depending on which you choose there will be stuff to play with. First the sex of the human. Females are a better choice for all the above except for the first one. So females seems a little more likely. Great now features. Hair: the color of the hair doesn't matter in any of the criteria that we have so just keep it at default. Eyes: there are some genatic components that control defects in eye sight so we will fix that and the color will also be default. Now the fun stuff. First there are genes that control the amount of hormones that our glands will secrete. So let's take a look at estrogen which controls femal secondary charactstics like smooth skin growth of brests and softness of voice. If you want that human to be some sort of a robot then you will need less estrogen but if she will be a spy or just a human within the Socity then a little above average would be best. Now to GH growth hormon We will alter the gen\u00e8se that produce the protein that controls the pituitary gland which activates the thyroid gland to produce more because females tend to be shorter but we will alter it enough so she would also be a little above average(seems to be the sweet spot) Also there are a lot of small things that makes some humans more susceptible to diseases such as cancer so we will tweak the immune system and prevent her from developing cancers If humans actually have this level of technology the we can change the some genes I made a youtube video about human mutation where I talked about a gene that if inactivated humans don't produce a protein which inhibit muscle growth, so by inhibiting the inhibitor that human will be able to have a larger muscle mass with no exercise. Maybe activate some genes that were found to be correlated with higher Iq and that takes care of that. Also some enhancements against autoimmune diseases we don't want the tweaked immunity messing up with our body Maybe add in some stuff that cause ostepetrosis which kiterly change the bones in stone Osteo is bone in Latin and petrosis is the process of petrification So yeah unbreakable bones super muscles super brain. Attractive body I guess we made black widow  ",

Seriously, the physical attributes like hair color, skin color and build are probably not that important. The mental and physical attributes are. High IQ. Photographic memory. Perfect recall. Mathematical savant. Kinesthetically gifted. Good athlete. Fast twitch muscles. No lactose buildup. High immunity. Low body fat. Good social skills. Good eyesight. Good aging genetics. Best of luck.
