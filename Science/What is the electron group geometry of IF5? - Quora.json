            "answer_text": "Iodine is a halogen and it has 7 valence electrons. It can exist in various electronic states but if it is neutral, it must always have 7 valence electrons. Here\u2019s how we count the electrons that \u201cbelong\u201d to an atom: Lone pairs have two electrons that both count towards the atom they\u2019re attached to. Count 2.Bonding pairs also have two electrons but only one of the electrons count because they are shared between the two bonded atoms. Count 1Normal valence state for Iodine has three lone pairs (3x2=6) for a count of 6 valence electrons and one bond for a total count of 7. An example is. HI. Iodine has d orbitals available so it can split up those pairs and make bonds. Each time a lone pair is split it can make two new bonds. So, the other hypervalence states for Iodine are: Two lone pairs and three bondsOne lone pair and 5 bondsNo lone pairs and 7 bonds.Along with the previously mentioned normal valence state of three lone pairs and one bond, there are 4 possible ways I can be involved in bonding while remaining neutral. In your example, IF5 needs 5 bonds to hold 5 Fluorines so it must also have one lone pair so it\u2019s neutral. 5 bonds + 1 lone pair represents 6 domains of electrons around the central atom, I, so it must have an octahedral electronic geometry but a trigonal pyramidal molecular shape since one of those domains is not a bond.

            "answer_text": "The overall geometry is octahedral but with one lone pair the structure becomes a square pyramid. This square pyramidal shape would be distorted. The electrons will push the fluorine's away from it, distorting the bottom of the pyramid. As a consequence, the overall shape is best described as a distorted square pyramid.  It is unlikely that a square pyramid actually exists. They will all be distorted in some way. ",
