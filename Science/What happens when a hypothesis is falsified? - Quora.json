            "answer_text": "Like anything based on science, any hypothesis or theory is falsifiable. That simply means that there can be evidence that would invalidate parts, or the entirety of the claim. Let\u2019s, for example, take a simplistic look at the theory of universal gravitation. The theory of universal gravitation states that every object in the universe will be attracted to every other object. We validate Newton\u2019s theory by observing our solar system and the cosmos. In doing so, we see that in every observable instance, objects do attract each-other. We also validate universal gravitation every time we drop a dense object that falls to the ground. Now suppose someone made observations where massive objects didn't attract each-other (or maybe even repelled one-another). If that were to be observed, it would be counter to universal gravitation and could lead to proving the theory wrong (or at least inadequate). Note, that doesn\u2019t mean that such evidence might exist, only that if it did exist, it would \u201cfalsify\u201d the claim. This is what it means for something to be falsifiable. On the other hand, suppose I asserted that a race of invisible aliens inhabit the Earth. That they make sure that only I can see them. What evidence could ever be produced to falsify that claim? It is not possible to provide any verifiable proof that there aren\u2019t invisible aliens. This is an example of something that is not falsifiable. ",

            "answer_text": "Normally the researcher is pleased as this provides a clue as to how to find the truth. That is why being able to falsify is so important, it allows us to get to the truth. You do an experiment based on a hypothesis, it doesn't work, so you look at the results and ask your self, why didn't it work? you then come up with a hypothesis to explain this result and go and test it again and again and again until eventually your hypothesis appears to reflect reality. At this stage you publish a paper and give it to all your colleagues (and others) that are interested in what you are looking at and ask them to try and repeat what you have done (peer review), if you are lucky they will do it and agree with your results. At which point you have established a fact. If not then you start again. This is why the scientific process is so powerful and has done so much to improve your life. You may want to contrast this with other views of how the world works. ",
