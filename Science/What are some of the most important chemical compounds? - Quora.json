I'll put some points to highlight why, It is used to make fertilizers. Not directly but it's use in making phosphoric acid is prominent which in turn is used to make phosphate fertilizers. This makes it of immense importance to agricultural nations like India. It's use in metallurgical processes is prominent. It is used directly in the extraction processes of copper and zinc. It is also used for cleaning the surface of zinc, a process known as \u201cpickling\u201d. It's use in making polymers. It's used to make caprolactum, which is the primary monomer for nylon-6. Other industrial productions. It's used in manufacture of Titanium Dioxide, hydrofluoric acid, phenol etc. All the products made with the help of sulphuric acid are of major industrial use and hence the association of industrial significance.
