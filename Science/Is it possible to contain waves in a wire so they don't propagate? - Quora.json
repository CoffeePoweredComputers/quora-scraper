            "answer_text": "If you mean \u201cso they don\u2019t radiate\u201d then yes. This is one of the purposes of transmission lines. You are likely familiar with coaxial cable. This stuff has a center conductor in the center of a tube conductor called the shield, which is a clue. All the signals stay inside the cable at least when it is terminated properly, and little to none is even detectable outside the cable. The \u201ctwisted pair\u201d wires used for ethernet cables are also transmission lines. Before Cat VI, such cables did not have overall shields. Because each twisted pair is balanced and twisted, very little signal radiates away from the cable, even when running at gigabit speeds. Finally, there is waveguide, which is just a hollow metal pipe inside of which microwaves travel. The metal keeps them inside. These are used inside microwave ovens to connect the magnetron tube that generates the microwaves to the cavity of the oven. The oven itself is the shield, and the gap around the door is carefully \u201ctuned\u201d so that microwave oven frequencies don\u2019t escape. Waveguides are also used in radar and similar extremely high frequency systems. It is even possible to have an \u201cinside out\u201d waveguide in which the waves travel along the outside of the guide. Weird, but it works. See Single-wire transmission line - Wikipedia ",
