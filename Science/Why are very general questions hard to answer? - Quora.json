            "answer_text": "The main difficulty in answering general questions is in finding an answer that's at a similar level of abstraction, but nevertheless sufficiently accurate to be useful. There's a pressure to find an answer that summarises what's \"largely true\" of the majority of a large set of concrete examples / instances *without* straining the questioner's (often low) tolerance for detail. This often involves calling to mind large amounts of detailed information as part of vetting any generalities you may be tempted to include in your answer for accuracy. And once you've recalled that information, it can be quite tricky to decide exactly how much accuracy it's legitimate to sacrifice (how many - and which - special cases / exceptions it's okay to \"gloss over\") for the sake of brevity.
