            "answer_text": "Your blood type (i.e. blood group including all sub groups) cannot change, because your blood is made in your bone marrow on a daily basis. The blood, that was added to your blood in form of a transfusion, will survive in your body for a certain time. Red blood cells have a life span of about 120 days, so the youngest red blood cell from the donor will stay in your system about 120 days. Old blood cells (your own and the donors\u2019) will be removed and destroyed by the spleen over time. Your blood group is determined by the genes in your blood stem cells that reside in your bone marrow and therefore it can\u2019t be changed. If someone has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant, this would be a different story. In this case, the patient\u2019s own bone marrow would be destroyed and replaced with new bone marrow of a compatible donor. ",
