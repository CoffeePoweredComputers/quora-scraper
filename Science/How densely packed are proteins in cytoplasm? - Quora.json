It's important not to neglect the fact that macromolecules are constantly bumping into one another. Even if proteins behave one way when studied in vitro, they may have different properties in the crowded environment of a real cell. Non-specific protein-protein interactions play a larger role in the cytosol where the total protein concentration is as high as 200 mg/ml or about 5 millimolar. For a sense of scale, you can just make out individual water molecules in the cytosol of this artistic rendering from Nature Chemical Biology:   (http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v7/n6/images_article/nchembio.575-F1.jpg) The volume and mass of a typical protein are about 22,000\u00c5^3[2] and 50,000g/mol[3] respectively (very rough estimates which obviously depend a lot on the specific protein). The total volume of all proteins works out to between 20-35% of the total volume of the cell. This depends a lot on the organism, cell type, and stage in the cell cycle. [1] Alberts, B. et al.
