            "answer_text": "Extraordinary ought to be the very first word that comes to mind for anyone trying to describe Florence Nightingale and her story. Nothing else comes even close, but it\u2019s far from the only word that applies. At a time when most women were content to be protected, cossetted, and patronized in equal measure, the woman who founded the modern nursing profession established herself as a bold and fearless advocate for basic medical reforms we now take for granted. Accordingly, we can certainly include the word visionary in any description of the \u2018lady with the lamp\u2019. When she announced to her family in 1844 that she intended to devote herself to nursing, they were aghast. It simply wasn\u2019t \u2018done\u2019 for someone of her class and background even to work, much less at something as unseemly as caring for others. Nonetheless, Ms. Nightingale immersed herself in the art and what little science there was of nursing. I think her devotion to her calling certainly certainly warrants our use of the words determined and tenacious. In 1853, after several years of study and travel, Ms. Nightingale was appointed Superintendent at the Institute for the Care of Sick Gentlewomen in London\u2019s Harley Street. A year later, she and the 38 nurses she had trained went to Turkey under the auspices of her friend, Sidney Herbert, Britain\u2019s Secretary of War. She was accompanied by 15 Catholic nuns who had volunteered to join her mission. It was at Scutari, on the outskirts of modern-day Istanbul and just across the Black Sea from the Crimean peninsula, that she established her reputation as a \u201cministering angel\u201d. Compassionate should certainly be added to her description. In the words of her colleague, French medical officer Lucien Baudens, she \u201cembraced in her solicitude the sick of three armies\u201d, caring for the sick and dying soldiers of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire during the bloody Crimean War. The situation she found when she arrived was appalling. She was 34 years old. More soldiers were dying from disease than from wounds sustained in battle. 4,000 of her patients died from typhus, cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever during the months that followed her appointment. The challenge was enormous, starting with an overburdened medical team whose pleas for additional resources were routinely ignored by the \u2018brass-hats\u2019 of the military staff. There weren\u2019t enough beds and soldiers often had to lie on the floor. The kitchens were incapable of producing enough food for the overcrowded wards and the food itself was often spoiled. Medicines were in short supply, and untreated water supplies, bad drainage and a general lack of hygiene resulted in mass infections that were frequent and often fatal. Florence immediately fired off letters home, and a plea to the Empire\u2019s most influential newspaper, seeking the attention of the British government. The result was a pre-fabricated hospital built in Britain and shipped to Turkey. Fatalities at the new facility dropped to a fraction of what they had been before. She also called for the creation of a \u2018Sanitary Commission\u2019 to investigate and recommend solutions for the general unhygienic situation in Turkish military hospitals In due course, the Commission made arrangements for improved ventilation and more sanitary drainage and sewage disposal. Sewers were flushed out and water purification improved. Nightingale, in the meantime, had emphasized the importance of hand-washing, personal hygiene and better nutrition. She never claimed any credit for the improvements, but there is no question that her efforts had made the difference. Capitalizing on the lessons she had learned, Florence returned to England and called for the same standards of sanitation, nutrition and hygiene she had set in Turkey to be applied in civilian institutions and in the daily lives of working-class families. Indefatigable as ever, she raised money for the training of nurses and, in 1860, established the Nightingale Training School at London\u2019s St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital. 160 years later, the school is part of King\u2019s College London and is known to the world as the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care. It has been in continuous operation for the better part of two centuries. At the core of her school\u2019s curriculum was her book \u201cNotes on Nursing\u201d, published the year before. Though it was specifically targeted at those nursing at home, The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools. In describing the goals of nursing, Nightingale wrote, \"Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have \u2013 distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have\" With these words Florence Nightingale established herself as \u201cthe mother of the nursing profession\u201d. Today, in the midst of a pandemic, our public health officials are still offering the same advice Florence gave to her nurses in Scutari. Maintain persoal hygiene and wash your hands. ",

            "answer_text": "A radio/TV scriptwriter once told a long story about a painting that depicted a view of the city of Florence (Firenze), with the cathedral\u2019s dome prominently in the foreground. It was dark and there was a storm going on with strong winds swirling around the dome.Someone unkindly pointed out the resemblance of the dome to the head of a goggle-eyed boy in a knitted cap, with a curious bump on the top of his head.  And forever after, the painting its artist had titled \u201cFlorence Night in Gale\u201d became known as \u201cThe Laddie with the Lump\u201d.Someone has since pointed out that the actual sobriquet given to Ms Nightingale was \u201cThe Lady of the Lamp\u201d, which rather lessens the impact of the pun. But I\u2019ve never been able to look at a picture of that building without seeing the \u201claddie\u201d in his cap. ",
