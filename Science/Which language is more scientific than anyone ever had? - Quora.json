Reasons: 0 means NO.1 means YES.YES always means YES.NO always means NO.(Not like conversation with girls)We can use this language using circuit construction.Instructions are not influenced by sound of word.There is no dialect or accent in this language.Whenever an instruction is given in this language, the responder will do the work without showing any sign of laziness.This language has helped to communicate over large distances using equipments called satellites. In fact this language is still communicating with object man has sent farthest from our earth (Voyager-1).This language is the fastest mode of communication.This language will still keep world connected in coming futureThanks for reading <<SSP>> ",
