Very \u201croughly\u201d 30:1 Carbon to Nitrogen ratio, or C:N. Carbon provides energy source, (think \u201csugar\u201d C12 H22 O11) and the basic building blocks for microbes, gives structure to their cell walls. N makes up the building blocks for proteins, amino acids, amines (NH2) and enzymes. Kept the pile moist (H2O) and turned (02), and let the microbes start feeding and multiplying. Heat is released\u2026a lot of it. Of course there is waste\u2026 Until finished into compost. That\u2019s the fast \u201chot\u201d way. Which turns out to not be as environmentally friendly\u2026part of that waste??\u2026 a lot of carbon as in CO2 and green house gases released. Think of all those little microbes \u201cbreathing\u201d in O2\u2026releasing CO2 In other parts of my garden layered these materials\u2026a slow \u201ccold\u201d finished compost results which mimics what happens in nature.

            "answer_text": "Organic carbon (OC) is stored in soil organic matter. Soil organic matter is converted to soil organic carbon by a complex chemical process that is difficult to explain here. Suffice to say that perhaps one of the most important processes in converting soil organic matter to organic carbon involves the action of oxidative enzymes produced by soil microorganisms that depolymerize plant carbonic polymers (long-chain hydrocarbons, lignin, fatty acids and esters) to organic carbon. This process shows the importance of microorganisms in the maintenance of a healthy soil. ",
