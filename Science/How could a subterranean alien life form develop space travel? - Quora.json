            "answer_text": "If it were subterranean, what initially would cause it to be so? If it had evolved such a living habit, would it have developed high intelligence sufficient for advanced travel? For the question one must asssume so. However, I can imagine that if an advanced civilisation had gone underground to, say, escape punishing levels of solar radiation, then there could be a strong compulsion to escape such an environmental \u2018hell\u2019 - via an escape from that solar system? But, if we rewind for a moment - for an evolving species, that hadn\u2019t yet reached a stage equivalent to the emergence of intelligence, while also being subterranean, we need to understand \u2018what\u2019 makes it a subterranean species in the first place? If we viewed analogies in reverse \u2026 what would make a \u2018terrestrial surface\u2019 species turn to becoming subterranean? That\u2019s an awfully big evolutionary swerve. And in overall proportions, there are very few advanced animal species on Earth that have adapted as to specialise for an underground existence. What I\u2019m saying here, in conclusion, is that it\u2019s an unimaginably big assumption that a NATURALLY subterranean one would change its ways, once developed. ",
