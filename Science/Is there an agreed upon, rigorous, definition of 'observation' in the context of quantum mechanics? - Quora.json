            "answer_text": "In Physics, we don\u2019t observe anything \u2013 blind men can be physicists. Quadriplegics can be scientists. We use neither eyes nor hands. In Science, we use the mind. Observation is not an element of the Scientific Method. Authentic scientists dismiss gawking and gaping as belonging exclusively to the 20th Century religion of Mathematical \u2018physics\u2019, specifically to the amusing sect known as Quantum Mechanics. Quantum ignorance After centuries of theorizing, researchers could finally explain visible phenomena such as how a rope pulls a bucket upwards through a pulley or how a ball breaks a window. Inclined planes and how planes fly and boats float became a thing of the past. What no one could explain were the invisible mechanisms. How does a magnet physically attract/repel another from a distance? What physically causes a bowl to fall to the floor and not to the ceiling? What is the mechanism?  Of course, the mathematical \u2018physicists\u2019, especially the \u2018mechanics\u2019, were never able to offer intelligent explanations for such SIMPLE phenomena. I mean, how convoluted and intricate is a system involving two pieces of metal? And yet, the mechanics are powerless to disclose the mechanism operating between the magnets. Or they tell you that the electrons spin in the same direction? So what? How is this an explanation of the mechanism? There are two reasons for the appalling ignorance floating around Quantum Mechanics. One is that Mathematics is the wrong tool to throw at such problems. The other is that \u2018observing\u2019 is not the way to figure these things out. Quantum Numbers You cannot elucidate the invisible mechanisms Mother Nature avails herself of to accomplish her daily tasks with an equation. Numbers, variables and equations have no business sticking their noses in these affairs. How did you figure out the bucket and pulley mechanism? Did you take an advanced course in Mathematics at the university? Or did you just watch the movie? How did you figure out how the window broke? Did you do some fancy calculations with your abacus and slide rule? Or did you just watch the movie? So why believe that the microscopic subatomic world is any different? Does Mother Nature use spirits to do her daily chores? Does she throw abstract mathematical concepts like energy and fields at visible objects? In order to figure out how a magnet attracts another or what causes the bowl to fall to the floor you absolutely need to make an assumption about the invisible mediators. You have to make Mother Nature\u2019s invisible mediators visible. You have to put them on a screen and watch the mechanism unfold before your very eyes just like you did with the fellow pulling the box up with a pulley and with the one who broke the window with a ball. Without the rope, there is no box going upwards. Without the ball there is no broken window. How can an equation help you in either case? Quantum gawking How about observation? After all, we had to watch the movie of the box being pulled by the rope and the one where the window was broken by a ball with our eyes. First, let\u2019s make absolutely clear that you don\u2019t figure out what causes an apple to fall to the ground rather than to the sky like Newton did: by sitting under a tree and having apples fall on his head all day long. You don\u2019t gawk at each apple and scribble calculations of speed and acceleration in your pad. No. What you do is you go home, grab a beer, sit on the couch, and do armchair Physics. You think! That\u2019s what you do. Think. Think and brainstorm! You attempt to VISUALIZE the invisible entity that is dragging the apple to the ground, for clearly, as Berkeley\u2019s Richard Muller concedes, there is an invisible mediator that comes in contact with EVERY single atom that comprises the apple\u2026  So again, we do not use eyes or equations to unravel mysteries such as magnetism and gravity. You could have observed the entire century and never figured them out. We must brainstorm possible candidates as mediators and simulate the phenomenon with them. No math or observation required. In fact, the mechanics have been \u2018observing\u2019 blindly now for almost 100 years and they still provide surrealistic physical interpretations for the invisible phenomena they routinely \u2018observe\u2019 at the accelerators. What are the most outstanding conclusions from so many \u2018observations\u2019? 1. A particle can be at two places at once. 2. Two particles can occupy the same space at once. 3. Virtual particles spontaneously appear at their pleasure from the vacuum and disappear back again into the vacuum because in Mathematical \u2018physics\u2019 space itself is made of particles and other spirits... \u201cempty space is far from empty. In fact, it is teaming with activity. Particles are constantly popping in and out of existence. They erupt out oof nothingness, quickly annihilate each other, and disappear.\u201d Brian Greene, What is Space? The Fabric of the Cosmos (November 3, 2011) \u201c\u2026space is a very tangible material with tangible properties like stiffness and shape\u2026 The most important thing to keep in mind about Einstein\u2019s Universe is that fantastic stiffness of space \u2013 of the rubber sheet, if you like\u2026 the stiffness of solid steel is about\u2026 10 ^11. Space has a magnitude of about 10 ^43\u2026 Space is a billion billion billion times stiffer than steel!\u201d David Blair, Ripples on a Cosmic Sea, pp. 6-20 4. Tachyon particles are so swift that they end up coming from the future. 5. Particles are not particles. Quantum \u2018particles\u2019 are excited \u2018fields\u2019\u2026 whatever those are. 6. They don\u2019t understand Quantum Mechanics. \u201cI can safely say that nobody understands Quantum Mechanics. Do not keep asking yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, but how can it be like that?\u2026 Nobody knows how it can be like that... the more you see how strangely Nature behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work. So theoretical physics has given up on that.\" Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize Physics 1965), Feynman Lectures\u201d Richard Feynman, Feynman Lectures. So? Did it help the Quantum mathematicians to observe so many events for so many decades if in the end they are going to give irrational explanations to what they \u2018observed\u2019 or tell you that they didn\u2019t understand anything? The purpose of the word \u2018observation\u2019 Let\u2019s get it straight. The only purpose of the word \u2018observation\u2019 in the religion of Quantum Mechanics is to mislead the public into thinking that the particle mathematicians actually SAW something with their own eyes at the accelerator. What better proof can a housewife expect of Quantum theory if the expert witness testifies that he \u2018observed\u2019 the particle do this and that? Theorists introduce the word \u2018observation\u2019 as evidence in the form of their expert testimony. It\u2019s only purpose is to persuade, convince, convert, and recruit unwitting and casual laymen. \u2018Observation\u2019 is a strategic word the mathematical \u2018physicists\u2019 invoke to induct believers into the religion of Quantum. Therefore, it is not in the best interest of Mathematical \u2018physics\u2019 to define this term. After all, the theorists have yet to define point, line, plane, energy, mass, black hole, dark matter\u2026 . . . ",

            "answer_text": "An observation is a measurement. In classical mechanics, you could refine your apparatus to make the disturbance caused by measurement as small as required for your experiment. In the 20th century we hit a limit. If you want to observe an atom, how do you make your apparatus smaller than that? Specifically we reach the limits on mutual resolution of conjugate variables like (p,x) and (E,t). Conjugate variables date back to the early 1800's when Fourier introduced his transform. The product of the variances of mutual Fourier transforms with conjugate pairs like(k,x) and (\u03c9,t) as variables is always \u22651. In terms of the quantum mechanical variables (p,x) and (E,t), the minimum becomes \u0127. The necessary disturbance of very small systems under measurement is called the observer effect. That term has been misused in another connection. None of the quantum mechanical atomic models of 1910\u20131930 can handle electrodynamics, so their solutions are necessarily stationary, and cease to apply: the press called it \u201ccollapse\u201d; whenever anything is happening! That's all there is to wave function collapse: an incompleteness common to all the models. That \"Collapse\" has been misinterpreted as an observer effect. ",
