            "answer_text": "Begin of response, no time to finish. I suppose that your question concerns mainly toxicity of metabolic ammonium, and not toxicity of oral exposure to ammonium (oral respiratory exposure to gaseous ammonia). Ammonium ion is neurotoxic, and hepatotoxic mainly. The toxicity of ammonium ion is dominated by hepatic encephalopathy (Hepatic encephalopathy), even if some hyperammoniema does not seem to induce hepatic encephalopathy. The role of ammonium in Hepatic encephalitis is controversed (cause or consequence ?). Hepatic Encephalopthy (HE) due to hyperammonemia mechanism is not known, even if some were proposed. Loss of permeability of the blood brain barrier inducing cerebral oedema, toxicity of glutamine, for an example.  Data not included in my response and relevant in my opinion : LD of intraveinous ammonium. ",
