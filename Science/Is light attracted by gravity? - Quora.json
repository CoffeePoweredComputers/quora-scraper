            "answer_text": "According to Einstein's General Relativity Theory,light will be affected in the same way matter is affected by gravity. This is because under this theory, we should think of gravity not in terms of vector like forces, but as a consequence of the \"shape\" of the universe. From Newton's point of view, gravity was a linearly directed force with which all objects with mass pulled on all other objects with mass. His analysis showed that the strength of the force was proportional to the product of the 2 masses attracting one another, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Thus an apple and the earth would pull toward each other, and the apple \"falls\" from the tree. Since light (whether perceived as a ray or a photon) has no mass, Newton's equation predicts that it will not be attracted by gravity towards anything, no matter how massive. In order to construct a theoretical framework that would be consistent to all observers and that did not rely on some independent fixed reference frame, Einstein had to discard this perception of how gravity works and devise a new understanding. According to this theory, all object with mass alter the curvature of spacetime, the 4 dimensional fabric of the universe. Objects moving through spacetime then simply follow the curves that have been created. Since human brains are not good at picturing things in 4 dimensions we usually resort to an analogy in 3 dimensions. Imagine spacetime as a sheet of rubber, stretched flat when there is no matter present. If we place a massive object like a star in this \"space\" it pushes down into the rubber sheet creating a dimple or pit in the rubber. an asteroid flying by the star would not travel in a straight line as it rolled along the sheet, it would curve as it went through the dip, coming out in a new direction. If an object were going just the right speed, it might get stuck in the dimple and travel around the star in an orbit like a ball around a roulette wheel. So far the predictions of this theory are the same as Newton's, but now comes a big difference- if light traveled along this rubber sheet of spacetime, it would follow the curve too, since the curvature of space is already created by the star. In fact if the pit is deep enough and the walls very steep, the light might fall into the pit and never escape. (what we call a black hole) Newton didn't notice this bending of light because it takes very massive objects to get something as fast as light to curve enough that you can notice. This is the same reason we still learn and use Newton's equation - it works well most of the time. But experiments have shown that in fact Newton was wrong and light IS attracted towards object with mass, as Einstein's theory predicted. ",

            "answer_text": "Many would say yes and that it\u2019s because of the warping or curvature of spacetime but that's not true. Physics is a science of observations, as such a great smoking gun for any geometry to the \u201cfabric\u201d of spacetime would be if the angles of triangles no longer added up to 180 degrees. That has never been \u201cobserved\u201d - ever. And it\u2019s a test that could easily be performed here on earth and would yield results if true. Light always seeks the path of least resistance to travel forward in time, always forward. As such gravitational lensing is caused because of the temporal flux (yes this is a real thing) around a star, galaxies or mass in general. Due to a star\u2019s enormous mass (in other words its time dilation), means it is moving faster through time than the surrounding region, Hence light - all matter for that reason, are drawn to it. All due to the arrow of time and than all objects want to move through time as fast as possible and are attracted to regions that such as the sun they do so - nothing more. Space is flat but time also plays a key role in the evolution of the universe in a major way. Time is the true force causing all effects - gravity most of all. Again there is no evidence of any geometry of spacetime - none. However, if you can show me an experiment where the angles of triangles do not add up to 180 degrees, by all means, please let me know. Einstein himself never believed in any curvature and there is no evidence of it whatsoever. However, the interpretation of general relativity that attributes gravity to the curvature of spacetime is (almost) universally accepted now, but Einstein himself didn't agree. He considered the geometrical view and rejected it. He thought of GR as no more of a geometrical theory than Maxwell's electromagnetism. It was Weyl and Levi-Civita who put forward and popularised the geometrical conception. It became the orthodoxy and went into all the textbooks, but all through his life, Einstein disagreed with this move. Let's hand it over to the man, in reviewing a book on relativity by Emile Meyerson: La deduction relativiste in 1928. He (Einstein) liked the book (a lot) and only objected to Meyerson's view of GR as geometrical: I would like to deal more closely with this last point because I have an entirely different opinion on the matter. I cannot, namely, admit that the assertion that the theory of relativity traces physics back to geometry has a clear meaning. [...] According to the general theory of relativity, the metric tensor determines the behavior of the measuring rods and clocks as well as the motion of free bodies in the absence of electrical effects. The fact that the metric tensor is denoted as \"geometrical\" is simply connected to the fact that this formal structure \ffirst appeared in the area of study denoted as geometry. However, this is by no means a justification for denoting as \"geometry\" every area of study in which this formal structure plays a role, not even if for the sake of illustration one makes use of notions which one knows from geometry. Using a similar reasoning Maxwell and Hertz could have denoted the electromagnetic equations of the vacuum as \"geometrical\" because the geometrical concept of a vector occurs in these equations. A close reading of Einstein's later work shows that he didn't change his mind on this. He didn't see that calling gravity \"geometrical\" meant anything other than a recommendation of the mathematical tools to use. Now in modern terms, we don't agree with this. We say that Einstein unified inertia and gravitation, that he did so by reducing gravity to the geometry of spacetime, and it was via this mechanism that inertia and gravitation become the same. Inertia falls out when spacetime is flat, gravity falls out when it is curved. Einstein also thought he had unified inertia and gravitation, but he saw the tool that did the trick as the co-ordinate dependent gravitational field, and resisted its interpretation in geometrical terms, seeing it as no more geometrical than many other fields (e.g., the electrical and magnetic fields). From a modern point of view, Einstein's \"halfway house\" looks odd, and as though he denied his own greatest triumph. But he was adamant that this is how he understood his own theory. Steven Weinberg doesn't like the geometrical interpretation either. But he's rare in this amongst modern physicists. (Sources on all this follow the work of Dennis Lehmkuhl: philosopher of physics and member of the Einstein Papers Project. A paper here: Why Einstein did not believe that general relativity geometrizes gravity.) I\u2019ve written a paper on this (the gravity/time part) Please take a look.
