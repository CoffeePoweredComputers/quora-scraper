            "answer_text": "Okay !! If you are asking about the last rank only then I would not give any sort of preference to branch (quite obvious) :P Okay here it goes.. Last rank for anyone to get into NIT in last round for lowest branch was ~44k-45k. Here is the proof.  Moreover if you are from any of the North East state (The 7 sisters), then you would easily get any branch even with a closing rank of 900k. [Proof] added see Home state Quota. Hope this helps :) Thanks Cheers ;)  ",
