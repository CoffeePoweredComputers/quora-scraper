            "answer_text": "The most practical and accurate way is indirect calorimetry -- measure CO2 produced during exercise (by breathing into a mask), vs. O2 consumed.  There are some fat vs. carbohydrate issues, but generally this test can be accurate to within 20%. For certain tasks, especially cycling, you can use an ergometer to measure work performed. Theoretically you can use direct calorimetry (measure all heat produced by the body during exercise), but this is fairly impractical, and I don't think it's used in the context of measuring human exercise -- it's used for things like measuring the activity of a hive of insects.
