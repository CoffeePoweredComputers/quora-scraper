            "answer_text": "The reversal of the Flynn-Effect Several studies have confirmed a slight reversal of the famous Flynn-Effect. In the 1980s James R. Flynn discovered that throughout the 20th century IQ scores had been increasing by about 3 points per decade. This effect might have been due to increasingly stimulating environments for toddlers and little children. However, more and more studies tend to find a reversal of the Flynn-Effect (e.g. here). There are many interesting hypotheses about its causes and I would like to add my own. IQ is correlated with the personality trait \u201copenness\u201d. Markus Jokela (2012) has found in a study that Higher levels of openness to experience in both sexes and higher levels of conscientiousness in women were associated with lower fertility [...] This has been true before the 60s, but the effect has become stronger since the availability of the contraception pill. High openness correlates with being on the fast end of the life-history spectrum (openness to action) as well as the slow end (openness to ideas). It is the latter that should be highest correlated to IQ. I have argued that the slow end of the life history spectrum is populated with \u201chunter-gatherer\u201d types, who (historically) had fewer children than \u201cfarmer\u201d or \u201cpastoralist\u201d types.  The reversal of the Flynn-Effect could, therefore, be explained by lower fertility among high IQ hunter-gatherer types. As hunter-gatherers are collective breeders, hunter-gatherer types might find it harder to raise children in a world with little support for child-rearing than farmer types. Birth control allows them to make voluntary decisions about having children. Being more conscientious would reinforce the choice to have few/no offspring as this would entail an additional burden in child-rearing. If my hypothesis is correct it would follow that it is, in particular, hunter-gatherer type women who suffer from post-partum depression due to lack of social support. Apart from reduced fertility, there may be additional factors that reduce trait openness in the gene-pool. One of them is a higher incidence of autism among hunter-gatherer types. Hunter-gatherer types have highly reactive amygdalas and are therefore less resilient than other types. They were not born for highly competitive and socially stressful environments. Schools and stressful modern work environments might, therefore, be additional factors that might lead to high IQ hunter-gatherers not succeed in life due to increased mental problems such as social anxiety and depression.

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u2018leveling off\u2019? If we assume a rise of 3 points every 10 years, but that increase decreases by 0.1 point every 10 years, then for the first decade, it\u2019s a 3.0 increase, 2.9 next decade, 2.8 next decade, 2.7 next decade, etc. In this case, \u2018leveling off\u2019 would imply it reaches an increase, say 0.7 every decade, but doesn\u2019t decline from an increase of 0.7 every decade onwards. In the study linked in the question, it reads: However, the same factors can turn from positive to mixed or even negative. The number of children in the home has reached a minimum (and indeed there are more solo-parent homes), middle class parents have used up the tricks that make the pre-school environment cognitively enriching, we appear to have reached a limit in terms of enhanced schooling and the number we keep in school into adulthood, the economy may be producing fewer cognitively demanding jobs in favor of more service work; however, we may continue to improve the health of the aged. Thanks to the Scottish data (Staff et al., 2014) and Table 7, we know that a decline at one age does not entail a decline at another. The worlds that encompass our lives, early home environment, schools and teenage subculture, university, the world of work, and the conditions of the aged evolve to some degree independently of one another. Even during the period of gains, they never marched in lock step (never gave the same gains from age to age), but at least they were all positive. During a period of \u201cdecline\u201d there may be a mix. We would expect ambiguous results and a pattern like the Netherlands: stability among preschoolers, perhaps some losses at school, eventual losses among adults (here The Netherlands may be lagging a bit), and gains among the aged. Against this, it is always possible that the Scandinavian data represent a pattern that will spread to all ages and become typical of much of the developed world. But remember that Scandinavia gives results only for 18-year-olds and it might show gains for all ages other than the late teens (unlikely for adults, likely for the aged). Still, there is no reason for optimism. If the economists are correct, adult gains are due to reverse throughout the developed world. The UK Volume & Heaviness test suggests losses that cover at least ages 5 to 12. Shayer speculates about the evolution of British society over the relevant period (since 1989 \u2013 when the subjects were 5 or 6). Children drifted away from formal toward concrete thinking. They became more and more immersed in modern visual and aural electronic culture. More time (four to five hours a day, more on weekends) spent on TV, computer games, and cell-phones, all of which decrease their attention span. A hypothesis: When Volume and Heaviness was first used in the CSMS National survey in 1975\u20136 there was a boy/girl IQ difference of 0.50 SD. At the time, this was attributed to differential play patterns between the ages of 4 to 8. These were unaltered until 1994. After that, thanks to the new electronic culture, the way in which boys and girls spent their free time gradually became the same. As a result, the IQ gender gap steadily decreased. By 2002 it disappeared and in 2003, boys and girls began to suffer IQ decline in tandem (Shayer et al., 2007, Fig. 2). Massive IQ gains over time were never written in the sky as something eternal like the law of gravity. They are subject to every twist and turn of social evolution. If there is a decline, should we be too upset? During the 20th century, society escalated its skill demands and IQ rose. During the 21st century, if society reduces its skill demands, IQ will fall. It is always possible that our schools and universities will graduate more young people who read and become more critically astute. This in itself would put a limit on IQ losses on Vocabulary, Information, and most Verbal tests, and on accepting the stereotypes that cloud moral reasoning and political prudence. Basically, we\u2019re not sure why. We have our ideas but we\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re correct or even if the IQ decline across different countries and cultures can be attributed to the same or similar reasons. From what I\u2019ve read, it seems that cultural shifts and environmental factors, which seems may also include epigentics as well, cause a decrease in IQ. This sums everything up in a short sentance. During the 20th century, society escalated its skill demands and IQ rose. During the 21st century, if society reduces its skill demands, IQ will fall. A large impact is education and jobs that society demand, hence the influence of industrialization on countries.  Why isn\u2019t it leveling off? Why should it? Although not perfect an anology, imagine water. Having no water is bad. Drinking more and more water results in an increase in performance. However, drinking too much water becomes bad. There\u2019s an idea set of criteria which is optimal for intelligence tested by IQ tests. We\u2019re approached these criteria but we\u2019ve also strayed from them, resulting in instability of IQ along generations. It would be highly unusual for the Flynn Effect to level off, as that would indicate no change in society or systems involved affect the average IQ of generations. That\u2019s just strange and highly unlikely. ",
