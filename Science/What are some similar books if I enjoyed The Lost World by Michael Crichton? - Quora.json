            "answer_text": "Most of Crichton's other books, including some of the others made into movies: Jurassic Park, Runaway, Timeline, Congo, Sphere, etcJohn Saul's Creature and Homing are more scifi thrillers in the spirit of Jurassic Park than his usual horror writingStephen King's Firestarter (mili/techno)Justin Cronin's The Passage (this is definitely a dystopia vampire novel but it's all rooted in mili/techno/science so you may dig it. Excellent book in any case.Carl Sagan's Contact. Among lots of other things, this is a scifi book about getting an alien blueprint for a spaceship, building the spaceship, and then actually flying around space. For a layperson, the technical details about the technology used and conjecture on why they worked were pretty entertaining. For a physicist I'm sure it read like Dora the Explorer in Space.It's interesting you listed The Lost World book because the one thing I remember about it is how totally different it was from the movie.

            "answer_text": "What are some similar books if I enjoyed The Lost World by Michael Crichton? Most of Michael Crichton\u2019s books have similar techno thriller themes.. I enjoyed these: Lost Horizons by James Hilton \u2014 not as techno heavy, but thrilling. Shangr-La by Eleanor Cooney \u2014. Return to the world of Lost Horizons And two sci-fi books by Anne McCaffrey \u2014 great techno thrillers especially her Crystal Singers books, but also these: Dinosaur Planet\u2014 fighting off both dinosaurs and ancient and current technology and raiders. Dinosaur Planet Survivors \u2014 still fighting the current tech and schemers. ",
