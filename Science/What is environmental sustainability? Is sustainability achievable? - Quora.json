            "answer_text": "Sustainability is not achievable given our current population and lifestyle aspirations. In the 1930s, given sufficient foresight we could have perhaps consciously designed sustainable systems. (Look up Buckminster Fuller\u2019s World Game for an example of possible approaches.) For sustainability with anything like todays lifestyle we\u2019d need to collapse population to around one or 2 billion, while also regulating consumption. The math is not hard, it\u2019s simply such an unacceptable answer that nobody will do the sums. ",

            "answer_text": "Sustainably means a way that helps in the continuous use of a natural resource without being depleted or causing damage to environment. In reference to plants it is widely used now a days as we need a system where for every single tree which is cut for human use for any reason we need to plant twice or more than that trees to replace the negative impact of cut trees on the environment. It can also mean we should not put pressure on the soil or environment by forced production against what the soil is capable in long term. here, we also need to make sure that different soil has different capabilities so we need to understand that. As per the current scenario sustainability is really difficult to attain. ",
