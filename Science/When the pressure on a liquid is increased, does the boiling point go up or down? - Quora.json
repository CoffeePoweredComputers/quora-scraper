            "answer_text": "As a rough analogy, just imagine the atmospheric pressure acting on the liquid as your hands pressing down on top of the liquid. The more hands you place on top of the liquid, the harder it will be for molecules to escape from the liquid to gas state. In order for the molecules of a liquid to change phase into gas, they need to have enough energy to break free and zing around. The gas above the liquid exerts pressure by the molecules of that gas colliding with the surface of the liquid. More pressure means more collisions (hands, from the above analogy) which hold the molecules of the liquid in the liquid state. Using this logic, increased pressure means increased boiling point. ",

            "answer_text": "When pressure increases, the boiling point rises. For boiling to occur, the vapour pressure of the liquid must be equal to the gas pressure above the liquid. If the gas pressure above the liquid is increased, for the liquid to boil the temperature of the liquid must also increase until the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the increased gas pressure above the liquid.
