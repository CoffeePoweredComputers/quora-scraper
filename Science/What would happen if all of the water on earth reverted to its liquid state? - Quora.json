            "answer_text": "Most of the Earth\u2019s surface water is liquid already. 96.5% is in the oceans. Evaporated water makes up a tiny fraction of all water, but there is enough of it that we would notice if it all came down on us all at once. Imagine rain all over the world, in literally every place, and lots of of it. Every river and dam that could flood would. Erosion and mudslides would be rampant. A lot of people would die, but that is hardly the worst of it. The polar ice caps make up about 1.7% of all the worlds water, and about 68.7% of all the world\u2019s fresh water. If that all melted, sea levels around the world would rise about 61 meters, or 200 feet. That puts that majority of the worlds land mass under water. So if the evaporated water in the air is like a leaky faucet, the melting ice caps would be like an exploding swimming pool. Almost everyone dies (where is that guy when you need him? ). It gets worse. As much as 1.5 to 11 times the earth\u2019s surface water is underground, mostly in gas form. If all the earth\u2019s underground water were to suddenly become liquid, then the pressure distribution in the earth crust would change dramatically. No one know what would happen, but some possibilities are that the Earth\u2019s crust could break apart, or volcanoes could erupt everywhere as pressure forces magma violently to the surface. If any of those things happen, everyone dies. ",

            "answer_text": "Sea level rises by about 80m, almost all coastal cities wiped out, Amazon rainforest becomes an inland sea, Bangladesh wiped off the map, massive rainstorms as all water vapour in the atmosphere condenses, climate reaches a temporary equilibrium similar to the mid Cretaceous but then starts moving back to present day conditions. The last bit is highly speculative since we have no climate models for such a scenario since the extra heat you magiced into existence to melt all that ice has to go somewhere. ",
