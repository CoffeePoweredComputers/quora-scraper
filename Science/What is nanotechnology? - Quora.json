            "answer_text": "It would appear that you have found the Wikipedia entry unhelpful, perhaps misleading, over-edited in a biased fashion by wikipedian nano-SS and nano-partisan guerrillas ...you are correct to never trust anything printed on electrons, but the Wikipedia entry is not completely bogus ... there are small mistakes, very small ones ... I'd still start there;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology  Unless of course, you asked this question to obtain alternative views of what nanotechnology is from the quorasphere ...in that case, nanotechnology is:   A new, very small religion based upon the nanotheological worship of infallibility of science [and the need for unlimited spending by government on bureacratically-administered scientific research] advocated by the high priest of this religion such as Richard Feynman, Ray Kurzweil, Steven Chu ... mantras of this new religion include:  \"There's plenty of room at the bottom!   \"The singularity is near!\"  \"Yes, we can!\"  It's tough to argue against the followers of this religion -- they've watched every Discovery program known to humankind!  Their faith is very real to them.  A research blackhole drawing seemingly infinite amounts of basic research funding and some applied R&D capital from large research organizations in different nations around the world ... corporations are not investing -- corporations don't invest in real R&D, they acquire [although they wont' be able to find nano companies for awhile]... all sides agree that the fruits of this research have been very small.  Russia has been one of the leaders in supporting nanotechnology research; certainly the leader in percentage of GDP ... which sort of tells you something.  It's important to remember that when it comes to copying what other people are doing, the Russians have developed undisputed first mover advantage.  Industrial espionage and copying are a core competency in the administration of Russian research.Something that you can make fun of endlessly ... it the same as making fun of short people -- it's too easy, like shooting fish in a barrel -- small, short fish.  You should make your jokes now, because there are some rumors circulating that jokes about nanotechnology will be outlawed by the Geneva Conventions on Crimes Against Humor ... of course, the response to that is: \"Small chance!\" Something you can't ignore and probably should follow [with a tiny amount of your free time] because, every now and then somebody pulls off something truly spectacular that makes me stop and think, \"Wow!  I dunno, but that might be really important!   Maybe not as big as the George Foreman grill, but maybe pretty important ...\"   For example http://www.rdmag.com/News/2010/09/Energy-Solar-Energy-Solar-Cells-Thinner-Than-Wavelengths-Of-Light-Hold-Huge-Energy-Potential/  Ever time I see things like that, I make another small investment in nanotechnology ... if you squint, you can almost see my acquired earnings right here.

Science empowered every industry structure by improving their work efficiency, products, strength and by reducing cost expenses. The term of Nano-technology had been first coined by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, since then it is utilized to change the application of material. Every industry is now exploring the possibilities with this new technology. Industries like Healthcare, Sports, Automobiles, Electronics, and Environment are particularly witnessed fruitful benefits of nanotech. Reforming Future of Healthcare Various industries are considering different aspects of Nano tech and employing this technology to generate more and more benefits. Medicinal industries are deploying the modern Nano tech fueled machines to provide exceptional health profits, like curing cancer and slowing down the natural aging. With the help of Nano-tech, cell walls penetrate easily and help cancer treatment. Nano bots can localize the disease site and deliver the drug precisely in right part of the body and releases the drug according to the schedule. The conventional treatments for cancer involve radiotherapy or chemotherapy, both the processes are very painful, changing the procedure and employing Nano bots the process becomes less painful for the patient. \u201cNanotechnology in medicine is going to have a major impact on the survival of the human race\u201d. Bernard Marcus Automotive: Not Just a Four Wheel Thing In automotive industries Nano-tech considered as the game changer. Automotive Industry as whole relies on the compatibility and modern technology which can benefit in low fuel consumption, safety, comfort, eco-friendly and budget oriented in material. With the wide scope of this technology Nano tech offers the light weight, reduction in friction and emissions by the engine, reduced corrosion resistance, UV resistance, and advanced electronics and sensors.

            "answer_text": "In this fast-paced world, people are often tangled up with their own lives. This leads people to follow a common notion- \u2018the faster, the better\u2019, \u2018the compact, the better\u2019, \u2018the durable, the better\u2019. To achieve this feat, nanotechnology is an important tool required. Nanoscience- a fresh perspective: To explain nanoscience in common man\u2019s perspective, imagine a toy building made from tiny building blocks, like LEGO. Now, the whole structure of the building can be changed by altering the orientation and alignment of the building blocks. Similarly, the products which we come across every day, like garments, bags, food etc. are analogous to the toy building which we imagined and the molecules making up the products to tiny LEGO blocks. Any alterations made to the basic structure of the material brings, about considerable change in the physical properties of the final product.  Image credit: Grow learning company Nanotechnology in daily life: When you say nanotechnology, many refer it to an idea from science fiction or futurism. It is something that is happening right now and transforming our way of living. What would you say if I tell you that, right now you are possessing a device, that is computationally million times faster than the onboard and off board systems of Apollo 11 space mission. This example gives us an insight on the potential of nanotechnology in effecting our lives and necessities. Future of nanotechnology: The development of nanotechnology is going on at a steady pace for past few decades. This is mainly attributed to the fact that, as we go deeper into the applications of nanotechnology, we reach a point where we require new tools to understand their behaviour. Nevertheless, if nanotechnology picks up some pace, then quantum computing will be the next big thing. In a nutshell, nanotechnology itself can be a great inspiration to us. Since \u2018nanotechnology is an idea of making great things from small things\u2019. So in life, for great things to happen, never give up on small things\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology, as we know, is an umbrella term used to define technologies working on nanoscales for utilization in this transformed world. Nanoparticles (NPs), the basic parts of nanotechnology, are atomic or molecular aggregates with sizes varying from 1nm to 100nm. In Nanoscience, we manipulate matters at their atomic or molecular level and discover a whole new material with properties totally different from the mother matter or more powerful than it. The world is facing significant changes in day to day life, be it with the environment, medical sector, automobile sector or any other field and to cope with these, Nanoscience or Nanotechnology is the need of the hour. In today's world, thinking of any innovation sans Nanotechnology is impossible. Nanoparticles can be synthesized either chemically or biologically, naturally or artificially. In this particular technology, we repair control, construct and monitor at the molecular level of any systems. Nanoparticles are of different types according to the size, morphology, physical and chemical properties. Some of them are carbon-based nanoparticles, ceramic nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, semiconductor nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles. Nanotechnology has its impact in every field like medicine and with devices based on new technology, it can cure diseases, enhance the military with updated weapons, preserve our environment with new techniques to purify water, soil, gases and energy. Thus Nanotechnology, along with nanoparticle, is the only science that can control and conquer the world with its positive impacts on every aspect ranging from medical, ethical, environmental domains, to fields such as biology, engineering, material science and so on.

            "answer_text": "Truly revolutionary nanotech products, materials and applications, such as nanorobotics, are years in the future (some say only a few years; some say many years). What qualifies as \"nanotechnology\" today is basic research and development that is happening in laboratories all over the world. \"Nanotech\" products that are on the market today are mostly gradually improved products (using evolutionary nanotechnology) where some form of nano-enabled material (such as carbon nanotubes, nanocomposite structures or nanoparticles of a particular substance) or nanotech process (e.g. nanopatterning or quantum dots for medical imaging) is used in the manufacturing process. In their ongoing quest to improve existing products by creating smaller components and better performance materials, all at a lower cost, the number of companies that will manufacture \"nanoproducts\" (by this definition) will grow very fast and soon make up the majority of all companies across many industries. Evolutionary nanotechnology should therefore be viewed as a process that gradually will affect most companies and industries. We have also compiled a Nanotechnology FAQ \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions list for you to explore. Definition of nan'o\u2022tech\u2022nol'o\u2022gy So what exactly is nanotechnology? One of the problems facing this technology is the confusion about how to define nanotechnology. Most revolve around the study and control of phenomena and materials at length scales below 100 nm and quite often they make a comparison with a human hair, which is about 80,000 nm wide. Some definitions include a reference to molecular nanotechnology systems and devices and 'purists' argue that any definition needs to include a reference to \"functional systems\". The inaugural issue of Nature Nanotechnology asked 13 researchers from different areas what nanotechnology means to them and the responses, from enthusiastic to sceptical, reflect a variety of perspectives.

The \u201cnanoscale\u201d is typically measured in nanometres, or billionths of a metre (nanos, the Greek word for \u201cdwarf,\u201d being the source of the prefix), and materials built at this scale often exhibit distinctive physical and chemical properties due to quantum mechanical effects. Although usable devices this small may be decades away , techniques for working at the nanoscale have become essential to electronic engineering, and nanoengineered materials have begun to appear in consumer products. For example, billions of microscopic \u201cnanowhiskers,\u201d each about 10 nanometres in length, have been molecularly hooked onto natural and synthetic fibres to impart stain resistance to clothing and other fabrics; zinc oxide nanocrystals have been used to create invisible sunscreens that block ultraviolet light; and silver nanocrystals have been embedded in bandages to kill bacteria and prevent infection. Possibilities for the future are numerous. Nanotechnology may make it possible to manufacture lighter, stronger, and programmable materials that require less energy to produce than conventional materials, that produce less waste than with conventional manufacturing, and that promise greater fuel efficiency in land transportation, ships, aircraft, and space vehicles. Nanocoatings for both opaque and translucent surfaces may render them resistant to corrosion, scratches, and radiation. Nanoscale electronic, magnetic, and mechanical devices and systems with unprecedented levels of information processing may be fabricated, as may chemical, photochemical, and biological sensors for protection, health care, manufacturing, and the environment; new photoelectric materials that will enable the manufacture of cost-efficient solar-energy panels; and molecular-semiconductor hybrid devices that may become engines for the next revolution in the information age. Source : nanotechnology Additionally : Nanotechnology involves the understanding, manipulation, and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanotechnology encompasses science, engineering and technology and involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. The development of unique nanoscale structures has the potential to revolutionize industry, including electronics, medicine, and consumer products. Examples of materials developed with nanotechnology include the following engineered nanomaterials: Carbon buckyballs or fullerenes;Carbon nanotubes;Metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g., titanium dioxide); andQuantum dots, which are nanoscale semiconductor materials (e.g., cadmium selenide).Although the development and application of nanotechnology is primarily still in the research phase, some engineered nanomaterials are produced and used in commercial applications today. Examples of products that are produced currently using nanotechnologies include: Sunscreens and cosmetics;Longer-lasting tennis balls and light-weight, stronger tennis racquets;Stain-free clothing and mattresses;Polymer films used in displays for laptops, cell phones, digital cameras;Coatings for easier cleaning glass;Bumpers and catalytic converters on cars; andProtective and glare-reducing coatings for eyeglasses and cars.Source : Occupational Safety and Health Administration Below is an instructive documentary tube about nanotechnology and some of its applications :  And here is an interview about what exactly is nanotechnology with K.

Work within the intersecting disciplines at the core of nanotechnology innovation\u2014including physical, life, and social sciences and engineering\u2014has revealed the potential of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) and nanoscale processes to collect and store energy, reinforce materials, sense contaminants, enable life- saving drugs, and shrink and accelerate computational devices in both incremental and paradigm- shifting ways.* Nanotechnology lets us directly interact with nanoscale systems such as individual molecules, DNA, and quantum mechanical devices. By being able to interact with such systems, nanotechnology enables to us to have greater control over our environment and our own biologies. It lets us design faster computers, more efficient energy sources, and develop new types of medicines. It's a rapidly growing field and still has lots of room left for exploration.

            "answer_text": "A2A The nano- in nanotechnology indicates very small; often meaning on the order of nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Think of computers. First we had mainframes that often took up an entire room, or even an entire floor in a building. Then we had minicomputers, that could handle much more in a smaller space. Then we had microcomputers, the PC being the primary example. They did even more, and in less and less room. Now we have 128GB memory chips that we can insert into our cell phones or computers; this is an early example of nanotechnology. Here's what Wikipedia says on the subject: Nanotechnology is also being applied to or developed for application to a variety of industrial and purification processes. Purification and environmental cleanup applications include the desalination of water, water filtration, wastewater treatment, groundwater treatment, and other nanoremediation. Applications of nanotechnology - Wikipedia What I'm most excited about is the application of nanotechnology in medicine: Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology. Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines. Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials (materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers, i.e. billionths of a meter). Nanomedicine - Wikipedia I know this is just Science Fiction right now, but I'd like to see nanobots that could be delivered via the blood system or lymphatic system, and could repair body cells. ",

The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \"nanotechnologies\" as well as \"nanoscale technologies\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. ",

Particles and matter in the nano scale might have a totally different physics than in the macro scale. This is what makes it so much interesting. I will give you an example. If you have two silica particles (less than 20 nm in size) in a alkaline solution, the particles would repel each other due to a negative charge on their surface. Therefore, it will form a very stable suspension. Smaller particle size has a higher surface/mass ratio and the surface charges are sufficient to form a stable suspension. Now, increase the particle sizes to ~ 5 micron and the particles will form a precipitate since the same surface charge is not sufficient to keep these particles afloat. There is a whole world of possibilities in the nano world and the laws of physics are not the same as the macro scale. ",

The nanoscale is the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers. Physicist Richard Feynman is the father of nanotechnology. Living beings are made from cells where a cell is the smallest unit of an organism. Just like our bodies are made from organs, organs from tissues and tissues from cells; all non-living things are made from atoms. An atom is the smallest particle that can exist in any nonliving object. There\u2019s no way we can see an atom with our naked eyes. Does it mean that we need a microscope to see atoms? Yes, not the ordinary one but the special microscope invented recently with the tendency to see atoms known as the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) through which scientists could view and study atoms. This helped them to come up with a new science called \"Nano-science\". ",

Mechanical Engineers: How to build actuators and sensors on the Microscale that can be integrated with this Silicon-based Nanoelectronics, these systems are always noted as MEMS/NEMS (Micro/Nano Electro-Mechanical Systems) Material Scientists: How to change the properties of materials through manipulating atomic structure. Biologists and Chemists: How preparing chemicals in small dimensions change their properties and reactivity. and So on .. It does not have a unique definition, it is more related to your field. ",

That results in the formation of low dimensional by materials that have better chemical, electric, magnetic, optical and catalytic properties. Now the above image is of Carbon Nanotubes which is one of the most researched nanomaterials which was discovered by Japenese Electron Microscopist Sumio Iijima. Now you must be wondering why to synthesis nanomaterials so it is to get better properties as compared to bulk materials. For example- For bulk matters- Gold - Melting Point is around 1064\u00b0CFor Nanomaterials - Gold particle (2nm) Melting Point is around 680\u00b0CIt also results in good electrical, magnetic and optical properties when we decrease surface to volume ratio to produce low dimensional materials.

There are tradeoffs when using React Native so be sure to research, but I\u2019ve found that the speed at which I\u2019m able to develop an iOS and Android application with one code-base is blazingly fast.

The very foolish dive into Java and try to learn the very complicated task of doing an android app at the very lowest level using android studio from google. Do you want a system that lets you get going with 100 hours of training not thousands of hours which is what Java will take you to become very proficient. When writing high-performance low level software you have to go down to Java, but simple apps and games can be done in these protected simpler environments with much less training needed. There is always a point at which the simplest Systems start to become a limitation in a hindrance but the vast majority he of the apps you see in the store can be built with these types of tools ",
