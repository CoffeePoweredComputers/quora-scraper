            "answer_text": "Venus might have been like Earth early on in the solar system before the runaway greenhouse effect occurred when the sun was less bright so we could have in theory lived on it then. Venus has retrograde rotation. It has no moon because wehn it got knocked into its retrograde rotation, its rotation was slow enough for its tidal forces on moon formed by the debris to make it spiral into Venus. Its sidereal year is 224.7 days and its rotation period is 243 days making its day about half the length of its year. That\u2019s because it never got tidally locked to the sun because it faces the same side to Earth every time it passes Earth because of the influence of Earth\u2019s gravitational field. Difference in height from tidal forces wouldn\u2019t be that much larger than human size but the amount of change in shape from tidal forces varies as the cube of the size the sun appears so the size the sun appears is about the inverse cube root of the planet\u2019s size. It can also be derived from Venus\u2019s gravitational field strength that the gravitational constant is about the reciprocal of Venus\u2019s size. Orbital period is about 1/sqrt(G \u00d7 (apparent size of sun^3)) = 1/sqrt((1/Venus\u2019 size) \u00d7 (1/Venus\u2019 size)) which is about Venus\u2019 size. Since a sidereal day is about a year and a year is about the planet\u2019s size, centrifugal force of rotation would be about gravitational aceleration divided by Venus\u2019 size so a point of a given height at the equator would be only a few meters further away from the centre of Venus than a point of the same height at the poles so we would have been living on an extremely round planet. The amount of acceleration on an object from coriolis force would be about its speed divided by planet size, minimizing its disruption to physics experiments. We would hardly ever observe whirlpools formed by the coriolis force. We could drop a hard boiled egg which has a high terminal velocity and still have it go almost exactly straight down. You could do so much in a day because a day is so long. Also, because of slow rotation and little coriolis force, there would be a single convection cell on the day side where air goes from the edge of the day side to the centre at low altitude and back to the edge at high altitude reducing temperature difference through the day side and there would be more stable weather patterns. That is, there would be much smaller random fluctions in the average weather tendencies even though the weather is chaotic. The winds at large scale at each time would be stable because the cloud pattern at large scale was stable at and there was so little Coriolis force at an earlier time but the cloud pattern at large scale was stable at an earlier time because the winds at large scale were stable at an even earlier time. According to  , venus could have been habitable for billions of years because of its slow rotation. They probably meant there would be no sudden changes in the state of the planet triggering mass extinctions because of stable weather patterns because of slow rotation and plant life would have absorbed carbon dioxide from the air delaying the runaway greenhouse effect. Maybe air would move all the way from the centre of the night side to the centre of the day side at low altitude due to suction of air on the night side by air on the day side. Maybe the planet was once eroded very smooth by water and entirely covered by water because of lack of tectonic activity because of so little coriolis force. If we lived on Earth at that time and had the technology to drain most of the water from Venus to colonize it, there would be more rapid prevailing winds because of less resistance acting on the winds. Also because of so little resistance acting on the winds, the winds would have enough inertia to be barely slown down by resistance throughout an entire day and would instead pretty much follow the average force of the sun on the winds which is one convection cell in each hemisphere moving towards the equator at low altitude and towards the poles at high altitude. We could build vacuum tubes around the planet for a rocket train to go fast enough to be in free fall having extremely weak fictitous force on the order of the inverse square root of the planet size in it from the coriolis force greatly reducing the flow rate of molten glass making it easy to make stress free fused quartz by slowly cooling it. An even lower speed train like a bullet train going at 300 m/s would have an undetectably small observed tilt from the coriolis force when you\u2019re in it. Even better would be if we evolved to be poikilotherms because we would eat at a slower rate giving ourselves more than plenty time to peel and eat our own shrimps, but the average length of time between 1 liter meals still wouldn\u2019t be as long as a quarter of a Venusian day although we could in theory evolve to survive an individual patch of time longer than a Venusian day without eating at all. See Evolution of hearing. Even better would be if Venus also had a uniform continuous cloud cover at high altitude from the condensation of evaporated water from adaibatic expansion because then we\u2019d have no directional clues and would have the challenge of finding our way around through our own memory of places and our own eyes detection of how much we turned. With a good trainer, assuming a prep shift in a restaurant is a quarter of a Venusian day, even with almost the maximum rate of customers the prep people can possibly keep up with, a new person could be trained on a complex plan of how to do the job that doesn\u2019t make other workers unable to do their job within their first shift and just know what task to do next, where to do it, and what to use, only rarely not knowing and having to ask the trainer. Despite the many different prep tasks they do, they would get so many chances in that shift to prepare a square deep of grape tomatoes cut in half to replace the square deeps of them that get used up, knowing each time when it\u2019s time to prepare it based on what they saw less than 3 hours earlier and how to label it as the newer one without indicating the time it was prepared because a day is too long to date it. A day would be divided into 120 hours which would be divided into 60 minutes which would be divided into 60 seconds which would be divided into 60 thirds which would be a similar length to what we currently call a second. The next division of time, 60 of what they call minutes which are similar to an hour would fit into a day so many times. That would be so amazing. You could do so much in a single day. In addition to that, days wouldn\u2019t lengthen over time because of its resonance with Earth. The unvigesimal system, base 21, has some really good mathematical advantages. If the unvigesimal system were used instead of the sexagesimal system, a day could be divided into 4 hours, which is then divided into 21 segments 5 more times. The division 4 higher than a the smallest division which is similar to a second would even fit many times into a day, let alone the one 3 higher. That would be so amazing. Not only that but the number of seconds in a day wouldn\u2019t start increasing either because its rotation wouldn\u2019t be slowing because of Earth\u2019s gravitational influence. Alternatively, we might be able to change its orbit to revolve around the sun the opposite way from Earth at a distance lass than that of Earth that makes it appear the same size as the sun every time it passes Earth and have the slowest rotation opposite from its orbit that makes it face the same side to Earth every time it passes Earth then drain the think atmosphere and plant a plant to obsorb the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen once tectonic activity spews out new water and carbon dioxide. Because it now has flake tectonics, it\u2019s very smooth so the result would still be the same but the flake tectonics would probably eventually stop due to the lower temperature and extremely low Coriolis force.

            "answer_text": "Near as on the Earth, but some terraforming before is required.  Preliminary steps (simplified summary): Technology for universal self-replicating factories is ready (they can collect chemical elements, produce or 3D-print most of the things including rockets and certainly self-replication).We have dismantled some smaller solar system bodies, such as Ceres and others like Titan, so we have enough resources for Venus terraforming - more than 10^22 kg of mass. Move vehicles with factories and mass from the dismantled objects to the Venus orbit.Factories produce enough space mirrors combined with solar panels around Venus. Decrease Venus atmosphere temperature by decreasing amount energy from the Sun.Change Venus albedo also using special chemicals in Venus atmosphere.Factories produce gas collectors from the Venus atmosphere. Mass of atmosphere is 4.8 \u00d7 10^20  kg, 96.5% is carbon dioxide. From some carbon dioxide we produce required oxygen and use carbon as material.Factories produce special vehicles for Venus surface. Vehicles bring parts of universal factories on surface. Universal factories start replication process until 10 % of Venus surface is ready. Then change mode and start to produce tools for quicker cooling of Venus surface. Some of the factories produce nitrogen from Venus minerals if some is missing in atmosphere. Later Venus atmosphere is fully prepared. Some problems with missing magnetic field will be solved.Some hundreds years later Venus is prepared for colonization.",

            "answer_text": "First you would cease to be alive, and then you would cease to exist. Venus' has an atmosphere that rains sulfuric acid and if you held a block of lead in your hand, you could feel it flow through your fingers. Not much can survive on the surface. HOWEVER, there is still hope! 50 km above the surface, conditions are surprisingly Earth-like. The atmosphere is still toxic, and there's still acid, but temperature and pressure are very similar to Earth. Furthermore, due to the high molar mass of the atmosphere, normal (breathable) air floats, allowing large cloud cities to be made easily. TL;DR: The surface is a no-go, and the upper atmosphere is filled with acid, but aerial habitats are surprisingly livable.   ",
