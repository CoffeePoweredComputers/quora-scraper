            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure others have already mentioned that the Bible doesn\u2019t say that Moses lived this long. Everyone after Noah lived to an average age of 120 years and since then it has declined. This can be explained scientifically as before the catastrophic flood of Noah, the earth\u2019s climate was much different. The Bible says that there was a canopy of water that surrounded the earth, although it doesn\u2019t go into much detail about it. It also says that the flood was the first instance of rain when this canopy ceased to exist. Before the flood the earth was more tropical, UV rays were significantly lesser as the water would have shielded earth thereby allowing organisms to live much much longer (UV rays cause our biological clocks to start ticking faster). So we have good reason to believe that if there actually was a layer of water over the earths atmosphere that humans and other organisms could live much, much longer. Which is what the Bible records, it says that Adam and his other descendants before Noah lived 600\u2013900 years. Other ancient texts indicate long ages as well but they seem to have been mythologized a little and may not be as trustworthy (i.e. saying humans lived for tens of thousands of years). ",

            "answer_text": "My best guess: they were lunar years, aka months. Ancient Hebrews were largely nomadic, and so didn\u2019t have any way to measure seasons in a fairly temperate region where they were prone to re-locate; and thus couldn\u2019t measure years, and so they kept time by phases of the moon. Science typically measured the length of years by keeping track of things like the length of shadows of a particular landmark, the sunset point on a horizon etc; but this was naturally difficult for a culture that didn\u2019t have a permanent settlement with which to establish when a year ended and another began. Even the 365-day model would lose 1/4-day per year, which could lose a month after 120 years, and cause problems when telling people when to plant and harvest etc. So they worked with landmarks\u2014 or calendrical devices like Stonehenge. However again, a nomadic culture wouldn\u2019t have this means, and so they kept time by the phases of the moon instead. Then when they established a permanent state, they switched to standard solar years, which gave earlier characters the appearance of having super-long lifespans, which were attributed to being closer to the children of Adam.

            "answer_text": "Those purported to live many hundreds of years all belong in the Book of Genesis, a compilation that includes some of the very earliest myths of Judaism. The story of Moses begins in the Book of Exodus, which generally takes a more realistic view of achievable lifespans. For example, forty years was said to be long enough for everyone who left Egypt as an adult to have died before the Israelites entered the Promised Land, so that it would seem that a maximum lifespan of about 55 years was expected. As an obvious exception, the story allows Moses a lifespan of 120 years, but even this is much less than 900 years. We may well ask how it was that Moses, Aaron, Joshua and Caleb managed to live much longer lives than any other man in the entire nation: the answer is that they were the story heroes and story heroes are allowed some privileges.
