            "answer_text": "Los Alamos, 1946. Reckless young physicist Louis Slotin held 2 halves of a plutonium core apart with a screwdriver. It slipped and the core went super-critical for 1/2 second, bathing the room in blue light. He died 9 days later. Others in the room suffered severe injuries.  A re-creation of the 1946 experiment. The half-sphere is seen, but the core inside is not. The beryllium hemisphere is held up with a screwdriver.  On May 21, 1946, physicist Louis Slotin and seven other Los Alamos personnel were in a Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the closeness of the core to criticality by the positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would use it in a final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core using a thumb hole on the top. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. The experimenter needed to maintain a slight separation between the reflector halves in order to stay below criticality. The standard protocol was to use shims between the halves, as allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. Under Slotin's own unapproved protocol, the shims were not used and the only thing preventing the closure was the blade of a standard straight screwdrivermanipulated in Slotin's other hand. Slotin, who was given to bravado, became the local expert, performing the test on almost a dozen occasions, often in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots, in front of a roomful of observers. Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be \"dead within a year\" if they continued performing the test in that manner. Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as \"tickling the dragon's tail\", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to \"tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon\". On the day of the accident, Slotin's screwdriver slipped outward a fraction of an inch while he was lowering the top reflector, allowing the reflector to fall into place around the core. Instantly there was a flash of blue light and a wave of heat across Slotin's skin; the core had become supercritical, releasing an intense burst of neutron radiation estimated to have lasted about a half second. Slotin quickly twisted his wrist, flipping the top shell to the floor. The heating of the core and shells stopped the criticality within seconds of its initiation while Slotin's reaction prevented a recurrence and ended the accident. The position of Slotin's body over the apparatus also shielded the others from much of the neutron radiation, but he received a lethal dose of 1,000 rad (10 Gy) neutron and 114 rad (1.14 Gy) gamma radiation in under a second and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning. The nearest person to Slotin, Graves, who was watching over Slotin's shoulder and was thus partially shielded by him, received a high but non-lethal radiation dose. Graves was hospitalized for several weeks with severe radiation poisoning and developed chronic neurological and vision problems as a result of the exposure. Slotin suffered an \"agonizing sequence of radiation-induced traumas\", including severe diarrhea, reduced urine output, swollen hands, erythema, \"massive blisters on his hands and forearms\", intestinal paralysis and gangrene. He had internal radiation burns throughout his body, which one medical expert described as a \"three-dimensional sunburn.\" By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of \"mental confusion.\" His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent. He ultimately experienced \"a total disintegration of bodily functions\u201d. Source: Demon core - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Thomas Midgley, Jr (1889\u20131944)  Midgley graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University. Five years later, he landed a job with General Motors. While working there, he discovered that adding tetraethyl lead to gasoline prevented \u201cknocking\u201d in internal combustion engines. Oil companies latched onto leaded gasoline fuels as a clearly superior alternative to biofuels such as ethanol. Within two years, Midgley had to take extended leave from work due to lead poisoning. He returned to oversee DuPont\u2019s pilot tetraethyl lead plant which, over the course of the year, caused ten employee deaths and numerous other cases of poisoning. In response, General Motors and Standard Oil opened their own plant (using a different process) which killed five employees and seriously poisoned others. In response to all this, Midgley held an infamous press conference where he purported to demonstrate the safety of leaded fuel. He poured tetraethyl lead over his hands and inhaled the vapour for sixty seconds, claiming he could do this every day. New Jersey didn\u2019t buy it and ordered the plant closed. Midgley subsequently took yet another leave of absence for lead poisoning and was relieved of his position as Vice President of General Motors Chemical Company. If you don\u2019t know the story, you may have guessed the rest. But no, Midgley did not die of lead poisoning. Midgley\u2019s next job was working for a different subsidiary of General Motors, Frigidaire. They were looking for chemicals for use as refrigerants; previous systems used chemicals which were toxic or flammable, such as ammonia and propane. Midgley and his team started looking at alkyl halides, and eventually started synthesising a new class of chemicals known as chloroflurocarbons (CFCs). Soon, CFCs were being used everywhere, from aerosol sprays to asthma inhalers. Three decades later, of course, it became clear that CFCs were greenhouse gasses and also depleted ozone in the upper atmosphere, causing an environmental menace. It has been noted that Thomas Midgley probably had more effect on this planet\u2019s atmosphere than any other single organism. But, of course, he died long before this became a serious issue. This also did not kill him. In 1940, Midgley contracted polio. This left him disabled, so he invented a system of strings and pulleys to help him get out of bed. In 1944, he became entangled in this invention and died of strangulation. ",
