            "answer_text": "Well, there is a reason to question the value of the recommendation. An awful lot of people still think wearing a mask helps prevent THEM from getting the disease. That is blatantly false Wearing a mask is meant to prevent someone with the disease (knowingly or not) from spreading it. It doesn\u2019t help someone without the disease for them to wear it, it helps if people with the disease wear it. And there\u2019s been a lot of excess by local governments. There\u2019s been at least one case of someone being put in jail for not wearing a mask\u2026a place where they\u2019re more likely to be exposed. I think it\u2019s nothing but a placebo. I don\u2019t believe the science of the past few decades has changed. It\u2019s a placebo, meant to make people think they\u2019re doing something when they\u2019re not. I don\u2019t really care. I have a face covering I wear if I go somewhere only because the dumb fucks in local government insist on it. I\u2019m not ready to make a scene at some retail place because it isn\u2019t their rule, it\u2019s the government being absurd. I do take it off sometimes though. I have gone to a shooting range. I take off the mask when I\u2019m in my lane. Not doing so sends heated air (exhaling) into my protective eyewear and that fogs up the glasses which in turn interferes with the ability to see the target. But it\u2019s back on when I leave the lane and comes off when I get near my car. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s take this back a step. How many times and how many people go to their doctor or dentist, for a check up and hear this: You\u2019ve gained some weight since our last visit, I\u2019d like to see you down 10 lbls for our follow up visit in 2 months about your high blood pressure. You know, it looks like I can\u2019t save that tooth, so we are looking at another root canal. You know less coffee would be better for your tooth enamel. And you are brushing three times a day aren\u2019t you? What do these statements sound like? They sound like a parent nagging you to behave better, and you are paying the person who is doing this to act like and parent,nag you and make you feel bad or guilty about how you are treating your body. My sense is that very few people are going to tell a medical provider who they have to (a) pay; (b) see on a regular basis and (c) may need in an emergency to go to hell. Those same individuals are on the other hand, happy to say go to hell to a public health bureaucrat they have never seen before, they don\u2019t really know or care about and who they feel no obligation to pay attention to. Hence the mask problem. ",
