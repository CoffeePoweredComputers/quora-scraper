It is the first university in Asia to be solely dedicated to the study and research of Outer space. it was set up by ISRO. A P J Abdul Kalam was chancellor of this institute. it offers regular engineering undergraduate, postgraduate and doctorate programmes with focus on space science, technology and applications. University Of Allahabad- The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (DEPS) was established in the year 1985. It is a FIST-sponsored Level-II department recognized by the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.  The DEPS is known for its scientific contributions in frontier areas of research in Earth and Planetary Sciences in India and abroad.The adequate research facilities in Earth and Planetary Sciences, A.U. are available in the Department and our University facility to nurture budding Earth and Planetary scientists to purse their studies and research.  The students of this Department have excelled in teaching, research and industry in India and abroad. Various Short Courses and Workshops in Earth and Planetary Sciences and Applied Geo science are conducted by the Department from time to time. This Department is visited by reputed scientists from India and abroad to teach, conduct collaborative research and interact with students in evolving areas of Earth and Planetary Sciences.
