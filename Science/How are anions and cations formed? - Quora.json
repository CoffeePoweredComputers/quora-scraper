            "answer_text": "Cations are formed via ionisation energy; this is the process by which atoms lose electrons to form cations. The first ionisation energy is the energy required to remove the outermost electron from each atom in one mole of a gaseous substance, to form one mole of gaseous +1 ions under standard conditions. This is an endothermic reaction as energy is absorbed/required in order to remove the outer electron from an atom as the electron needs to go from having a lower intrinsic energy (when in the orbital of the atom, attracted to the positively charged nucleus) to a higher intrinsic energy (when it is removed from the atom, thus further away from the positively charged nucleus at a higher energy level in the environment). This means that the value for the enthalpy change in first ionisation energy in KJMol-1 will be positive. The cation formed will have a smaller atomic radius as the outermost electron is closer to the nucleus at a lower energy level, thus it has a lower intrinsic energy and is harder to remove (as there are stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the outer electron and the positively charged nucleus). This means that the resultant ion has a smaller electron cloud. Anions are formed via electron affinity; this is the process by which atoms gain electrons to form anions. This process is known as the first electron affinity, which is the energy released when each atom in one mole of gaseous atoms gains an electron (which is added to the outermost orbital) to form one mole of gaseous -1 ions under standard conditions. This is an exothermic process as energy is released, thus the value for the enthalpy change in KJMol-1 is negative. Because this reaction is exothermic, it is energetically favourable therefore the anion formed is more stable, as it has a full outer shell. This also means that the outermost electron (gained during the formation of the anion in first electron affinity) is further away from the nucleus at a higher energy level (thus it has a higher intrinsic energy and is easier to remove as there are less electrostatic forces of attraction between it and the positively charged nucleus). This means that the anion has a larger atomic radius, as the size of the electron cloud is larger. ",

            "answer_text": "POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IONS: CATIONS AND ANIONS Cations (positively-charged ions) and anions (negatively-charged ions) are formed when a metal loses electrons, and a nonmetal gains those electrons. The electrostatic attraction between the positives and negatives brings the particles together and creates an ionic compound, such as sodium chloride. A metal reacts with a nonmetal to form an ionic bond. You can often determine the charge an ion normally has by the element\u2019s position on the periodic table: The alkali metals (the IA elements) lose a single electron to form a cation with a 1+ charge.The alkaline earth metals (IIA elements) lose two electrons to form a 2+ cation.Aluminum, a member of the IIIA family, loses three electrons to form a 3+ cation.The halogens (VIIA elements) all have seven valence electrons. All the halogens gain a single electron to fill their valence energy level. And all of them form an anion with a single negative charge.The VIA elements gain two electrons to form anions with a 2- charge.The VA elements gain three electrons to form anions with a 3- charge.The first table hows the family, element, and ion name for some common monoatomic (one atom) cations. The second table gives the same information for some common monoatomic anions. Some Common Monoatomic Cations Family Element Ion Name IA Lithium Lithium cation Sodium Sodium cation Potassium Potassium cation IIA Beryllium Beryllium cation Magnesium Magnesium cation Calcium Calcium cation Strontium Strontium cation Barium Barium cation IB Silver Silver cation IIB Zinc Zinc cation IIIA Aluminum Aluminum cation Some Common Monoatomic Anions Family Element Ion Name VA Nitrogen Nitride anion Phosphorus Phosphide anion VIA Oxygen Oxide anion Sulfur Sulfide anion VIIA Fluorine Fluoride anion Chlorine Chloride anion Bromine Bromide anion Iodine Iodide anion It\u2019s more difficult to determine the number of electrons that members of the transition metals (the B families) lose. In fact, many of these elements lose a varying number of electrons so that they form two or more cations with different charges. The electrical charge that an atom achieves is sometimes called its oxidation state. Many of the transition metal ions have varying oxidation states. The next table shows some common transition metals that have more than one oxidation state. Some Common Metals with More than One Oxidation State ",

            "answer_text": "Monoatomic Ions: If a neutral atom acquires one or more electrons, it becomes an Anion. (From \u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 (ano) = up + \u03af\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 (iemi) = moving towards). Examples: Cl\u207b , I\u207b If it looses one or more electrons, it becomes a Cation. (From \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 (cato) = down + \u03af\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9). Examples: Na\u207a , Ca\u207a\u207a Polyatomic Ions: There exist arrangements of more than one, mostly different, atoms, which aren\u2019t molecules because they are not electrically neutral: They have either a surplus of electrons (Anions), or a deficiency of electrons (Cations). Anion Examples: Hydroxyl anion (OH\u207b), Carbonate anion (CO\u2083\u207b\u207b), Phosphate anion (PO\u2084\u207b\u207b\u207b), Acetate anion (CH\u2083COO\u207b). Cation examples: Ammonium cation (NH\u2084\u207a), Methylammonium cation ( [CH\u2083NH\u2083]\u207a). Conclusion Ions are formed by some atoms loosing electrons from their outer shell and other atoms adding electrons to their outer shell. This is HOW ions are formed. If you would also ask WHY atoms do form ions, they do it because they are thus lowering their energy levels, just as a golf ball lowers its energy level by falling in the hole when it reaches it. If matter didn\u2019t have this property and all elements were like the Noble Gases which neither share nor exchange electrons with other atoms, then no compounds would be possible and hence also no life . . . We are back at discussing the Anthropic Principle, i.e whether the universe is created as we know it, to ENABLE the existence of Man (Anthropos in Greek)! ",
