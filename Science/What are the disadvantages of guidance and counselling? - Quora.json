            "answer_text": "I will read the question as \u2018\u2026the disadvantages in counselling\u2019 (if that is wrong I apologise). In person centred counselling the aim is for the client to find their own answers to their problems, therefore directing a client is discouraged. This is because it is viewed as impossible to understand another persons problems, after all we start from very different positions and experience life in a unique way. Each person delelops a unique mental understanding of the world we live in. We may regard them as wrong but we cannot understand the whole story. The dangers of direction is that we may give advice that is just plain wrong - are counsellors experts in life? In all it\u2019s complexity? We mayalso deflect them from learning how to cope with their lives for themselves. True understanding comes from self-reflection. Another disadvantage has to do with the relationship between the counsellor and the client. It may be seen as authoritarian and elitist. Having said that there are also advantages to direction in counselling, but that, I believe, is the person centred attitude. Mark ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there are any disadvantages of counseling. There may be times when the counselor you choose is not suited to your personality or needs but in general terms, guidance and counseling provides you with the space to explore your own thoughts and come to new understandings on your own. Somethimes this requires the counselor to challenge your thinking in order for both you and the counselor to get a better understanding of your thoughts or views. But a good counselor will not bring any sort of judgement to the process. I have worked with a few clients who felt they did not get what they needed from a previous counselor. All counselors bring their own experience and personality along with their education to their practice. While they have an expertise and training in some areas, no one knows you better than you so it is critical for you to be as open as you can and at times, share what you are thinking about the experience if you are next getting what you are looking for. Counseling is a collaborative process and you are the most important part of that process! ",

People can be frustrating they may or may not choose to follow your \u201cadvice\u201d. People who come on their on are easier than ones who are mandated to get help. At the end of your career you will think about how much some have changed for the better and how many have not changed or are worse. Out come for the chronically mentally ill is usually not good unless they have a strong family support system to hold them together. Most of the time chronically mentally ill do so many things to the family, the family gives up on them. You have to have skin as tough as hide, because they will say things to you and you will want to get violently ill. Best advice - if you are truly sure you want to do counseling, have a double major, something else if you choose to go down another path you have a head start. ",

Mind, after having had the help of a very mature doctor, I decided to solely seek professionals over age fifty. Lastly, on the subject of counselling, be choosy who you hire, specially if your mood is low and/or weak, for being lonely draws you to just anybody unless you choose who sounds nicest on the phone. You\u2019d have to phone some up and ask them what they can do for you. I know Covid prevents going out, but soonest, connect with humankind; be it talking to a barmaid or man, or wait staff, which is a habit I stumbled on, by chance, to connect with humankind. ",
