            "answer_text": "I will assume you are asking about normal force from surfaces, which one frequently comes across while solving questions in mechanics. The answer is it can be both pushing and pulling. But in a vast majority of cases it is pushing. Normal reaction is a contact force between two bodies (specifically one that acts normal to the contact surface). This contact force doesn't involve what is termed as frictional force, which opposes relative motion at the point of contact. Typical examples of normal force being pushing are when two blocks are placed on one another, humans standing on floor, etc . In all these cases, there will not be any normal force when one body is trying to move away from the other and exists only when they are trying to go into each other. There cannot be a pulling normal force here because the contact is broken. A case of pulling normal force would be having a glue. Imagine you put a lot of glue on a table and then place a block on it. Now try pulling the block up, the glue will end up applying a pulling normal force in this case . ",

            "answer_text": "As a technical term \u201cnormal\u201d means \u201cat right angles\u201d, perpendicular. So, even if a force is applied obliquely, the resultant direction of movement is normal to the surface at which the force is applied (unless there is grip or spinning impulse, say). The remainding part of the force vector slides off. In the old days, we used to say \u201c a force is a push or a pull\u201d. Either. Pusg is easier to comprehend. Pull tends to be a reversed push from the back, although action-at-a-distance (such as gravity) is a bit of a puzzle. ",
