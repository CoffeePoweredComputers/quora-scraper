            "answer_text": "Mass tells you how heavy something is & volume tells you how large it is in size. Mass density is related to heaviness or lightness of an object. Usually, when we refer to density we mean a mass density which would be mass per unit volume. Mass density=Mass of object/ Volume of object Density can be measured by Densometer, Pycnometer, Hydrometer, Triple Beam Balance, Graduated Cylinder etc. Optical density is related to the speed of light. It measures the amount of light transmitted thru a solution i.e., it measures how clear or blur a solution is in comparison to water. The medium in which speed of light is more is considered as rarer medium while the medium in which speed of light is less is considered as denser medium. For e.g., considering air & water, the light travels with greater speed in air when compared to speed of light in water. So here air is called as rarer medium while water as denser medium. The value of optical density is generally between 0 & infinity. Pure water has an optical density of 0. Optical density is measured by an instrument called Photometer or Densitometer, which converts optical readings into electric signals. ",
