            "answer_text": "Because we\u2019re human. Because we\u2019re curious. Because we want to know about how the world works and knowing this means asking some philosophical questions. For Socrates the answer might have been to make life worth living as he once said \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth living.\u201d Philosophy is the method for engaging in that examination. Our search for meaning, as documented by Viktor Frankl is one which requires us to philosophize as well. According to Frankl meaning can be found even in the worst of conditions but to find it requires reflection and that reflection will be philosophical. We also philosophize because it is fun. We should not overlook this important motivator for all our investigations. As Richard Feynman put it we learn for the \u201cpleasure of finding things out.\u201d Andrew Pessin put it like this: Lots of things never end. Space. Time. Numbers. The questions little kids ask. And philosophy. You try to convince somebody of something- even yourself- by offering reasons to believe the thing. But then your belief is only as valid as your reasons are, so you offer reasons to accept your reasons. But then those reasons need further reasons and you\u2019re off. As a result it often seems that there aren\u2019t any answers to philosophical questions: there are just more arguments, more objections, more replies. And so it may easily seem that it\u2019s not worth even getting started. Why bother? You\u2019ll never finish. You may as well try to count all the numbers. But there is another way of thinking about it. I went snorkeling for the first time a few years ago. It was an amazing experience. There wa a whole world under that water to which I\u2019d been oblivious my entire life. This would was populated with countless amazing creatures with all sorts of complex relationships to each other in that tangled ecosystemic way. Indeed every single thing was connected to every other thing: this one is food for that one, which excretes chemicals used by another one, which excretes waste products used by others, and so on. Stunning, fascinating, and absolutely, deeply, beautiful. It had been there all along, just waiting for me to dive in. If you were now to tell me that that ocean goes on forever filled with even more amazing creatures in more amazing relationships- I wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cWell, then why bother entering?\u201d Rather, I\u2019d say, \u201cWhere can a guy get a wetsuit around here?\u201d But that is philosophy. It\u2019s filled with countless amazing ideas, concepts, beings, which exist in all sorts of complex logical relationships with each other. And unlike the actual ocean this one is infinitely deep: Wherever you enter you can keep going and going and going. What you should be thinking, then, is not: \u201cWhy enter?\u201d It is, rather this: thank you- very much. But of course, that world is just is this world, the world that you\u2019re in. This great ocean you may be looking for, you\u2019re already in it. You just have to start thinking about it. The very first drop in that bucket is a splash into the infinte. This is the beginning.

            "answer_text": "Reasons why philosophy is important: All human beings orient their lives around ideas about what reality is like, that they believe explain their experiences, and ideas about what reality and human beings should be like, that they use to guide their behaviour. The first of these kinds of ideas is a metaphysical theory, the second an ethical or moral theory.Human beings seem to need metaphysical and moral ideas because they are not born with instincts that determine for them what they should think and want, and are born with the capacities to make up their own minds and to question any belief they have or meet.It is evident that most of the ideas in history that people have used to explain human experiences have been false or unfounded in many respects, and it is also evident that most of the ideas in history or direct human behaviour have been harmful to other human beings or to themselves.On the other hand, it is also evident that whatever adequate understanding people have of themselves, of others, and of their environments and possibilities, is based on the asking and answering of the type of general questions that are philosophical and scientific, and that there seems to be no way of being human without trying to ask and answer such questions.All ideas about philosophy or science, including those that ridicule or condemn philosophy or science, are themselves philosophical ideas, and such as declare all philosophy useless, trifling, or impossible are little better than a refusal to do any serious philosophical or scientific reasoning.The ideas people live and die for, go to war for and kill each other for, or let themselves be inspired to the making of great art or science, are all philosophical ideas.The lives people lead and the choices they make are the result of the philosophies they hold, whether they are conscious of this fact or not. Much of the history of the 20th century - \"The Century of Total War\", in Raymond Aron's apt phrase, which is the title of one of his books - is the more or less direct product of a small number of philosophical ideas and the philosophers who made them up: Marxism ruled the lives of more than a 1000 million people; Fascism destroyed the lives of millions of people and caused a World War; both Marxism and Fascism were opposed by men in the name of Liberalism, Democracy, Catholicism, Protestantism, or Science, each of which are themselves either specific philosophies or derived from more comprehensive philosophical systems.
