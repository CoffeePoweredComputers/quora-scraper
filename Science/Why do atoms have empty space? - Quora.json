            "answer_text": " view that an atom mostly consist of empty space stems from the old times when Bohr's atomic model (as a miniature planetary system in which electrons surround the nucleus) was the best picture of what an atom is like.But there are no electron particles moving around an atom. One cannot view the electrons as little balls moving inside a molecule and somehow avoiding falling into a nucleus. Such a configuration would be unstable. The nuclei would attract little charged balls until they fall into them.But it is very well understood why atoms are stable - the ground state is a delocalized stationary state of the electrons in an atom, a state living indefinitely (unless the nucleus decays). In terms of quantum field theory, the space is filled by the electron field. The resulting electron density can be calculated by quantum mechanics. Indeed, this is one of the outputs chemists are interested in when they use quantum chemistry packages like GAMESS.Electrons behaving as particles (in the sense of being localized at approximately one place) only exist in situations where one may consider the field theory in the limit of geometric optics (cf. photons as particles of light), so that one can speak meaningfully of their paths. See, e.g.,Maloff, I.G. and Epstein, D.W., theory of electron gun, Proc. Inst. Radio Eng. 22 (2006), 1386-1411.which presents a phenomenological view,Jagannathan, R. and Simon, R. and Sudarshan, N., quantum theory of magnetic lens, Phys. Lett. A 134 (1989), 457-464.which derives geometrical electron optics from the Dirac equation, or the bookP.W. Hawkes and E. Kasper, Principles of Electron Optics, Vol. 2: Applied Geometrical Optics, Elsevier, 1989.which contains engineering details for electron beams.Geometric optics is an essentially macroscopic view not applicable inside atoms or small moleculesRead more here DO ATOMS HAVE EMPTY SPACES?

            "answer_text": "Empty space is sort of a tricky concept, especially on the atomic scale. We say that \u201cmost of the atom is empty space\u201d to emphasize that the atomic nucleus is incredibly tiny compared to the atom as a whole, and that the electrons are so ethereal as to almost be non-existent. If that\u2019s true, why don\u2019t the electrons simply collapse down closer to the nucleus, shrinking the atom a million-fold? Part of it has to do with quantum mechanics; electrons can only exist in certain allowed orbits, because they\u2019re both particles and waves. Electrons must orbit the nucleus in such a way that their path represents a whole number of wavelengths, which means there will be regions where electrons cannot orbit. But here\u2019s the thing: Given electrons\u2019 wavelike characteristics, it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint an electron to one specific location. The electrons of an atom are really \u201csmeared out\u201d over a range of possibilities centered on the nucleus. So we could claim that most of the atom is empty space, but it\u2019s probably more accurate to say that most of the atom\u2019s volume is occupied by the wave functions of electrons, over which electrons are spread out.
