            "answer_text": "Green energy is generated from sources that are renewable using methods that have little or no negative impact on the environment. It is a nice concept but in practice it is hard to implement effectively. Manufacturing and maintaining the equipment generally generates pollution and safely disposing of it when it reaches the end of its life presents more problems. This is particularly applicable to wind farms and batteries. Solar power is generally less polluting and the latest Concentrated Solar Power facilities are proving to be cheap and reliable while generating very little pollution. Fuel Cells and hydrogen are rapidly improving and there is a growing take up of the technology for all forms of transport. Many countries around the world are starting to invest heavily in the move to a global hydrogen economy to replace our current fossil fuel economy. For a more detailed analysis of Renewable Energy please refer to my 5* reviewed book \u2018Renewable Energy - An Essential Guide\u2019 available on Amazon. ",

            "answer_text": "The U.S. voluntary market defines green power as electricity produced from solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, eligible biomass, and low-impact small hydroelectric sources. Customers often buy green power for its zero emissions profile and carbon footprint reduction benefits. = green electricity. By definition, green electricity is produced exclusively from renewable energy sources (solar energy, wind power, hydraulic energy, biomass, geothermal energy, etc.). It may not be produced using fossil fuels or by nuclear power plants.. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Green Energy material there... ",
