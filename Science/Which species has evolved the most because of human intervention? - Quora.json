            "answer_text": "Which species has evolved the most because of human intervention? First we need to define what we mean by \u201cevolved most\u201d. I will take that as meaning showing considerable or significant change in structure, survivability, or place in an ecosystem. It is probably impossible to single out any one organisms or gene-pool of a particular species. The obvious choices are the farmed animals and plants, which have been selectively bred to produce foods or products for humans. Many are hybrids which have been produced by cross breeding, human transportation to new habitats. Some are invasive species which have run amok in an explosive burst of colonisation in a new habitat. This includes some pests and diseases which have been accidentally moved around the planet on human transport systems. Marine organisms transported in ships\u2019 ballast tanks are an example of this. Failed crop innovations like Prickly Pear Opuntia Cacti introduced to Australia, is another. The Global Price of Invasive Species The U.S. and China pose the greatest threat as exporters of invasive species, but other countries have more to lose.It\u2019s the stuff of environmental horror stories: Exotic species invades new shores, and swiftly lays ruin to the native ecosystem and its inhabitants. And it's so common it's become almost a trope. Think of kudzu vines strangling trees and shrubs in the South, Asian longhorned beetles decimating hardwood forests in the Northeast and prolific Asian carp outcompeting native fish (and terrifying boaters) in the Great Lakes. But the devastation wrought by these invasions isn\u2019t just environmental\u2014it\u2019s economic. Alien insects and pathogens cost an estimated $40 billion annually in the United States alone, in terms of the harm they wreak on crops and forests. As disparate parts of the world grow increasingly connected and thus face increased risk of new invasions, those costs will only rise. Despite these scary stakes, researchers haven\u2019t yet assessed the worldwide costs that these invasions cause as a whole. Instead, most research on invasive species has only been done on a single-country basis. That means we\u2019ve been missing out on capturing the global nature of the problem: trade links virtually all countries, and thus all would-be invaders in a network of possible pathways into a new country.Now, a new study attempts to fill that knowledge gap by using complex computer models to quantify the cumulative threat of 1,300 insect pests and fungal pathogens to crop production in 124 countries. The results are stark: almost a third of the countries studied had a high likelihood of imminent invasion. Developing countries stand to experience the worst impacts, while major agricultural producers like China and the U.S. pose the greatest risk as sources of invasive species, according to the findings, which were published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These invasions have major impacts on the evolution of native species and crops, on ecosystems, and on the finances of farmers and land managers. Stuff like Japanese Knotweed, can even destroy roads, pavements and buildings. Japanese Knotweed Damage Clearly there are significant changes in domesticated animals: - cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, poultry, cage birds, and laboratory animals, where their genes have been manipulated for experiments. Plants bred for agriculture, and horticulture are also very different from their wild ancestors. Cereals, root-crops and fruit crops have developed much higher yields, but many have lost resistance to wild pests and diseases in the process. Events like the Irish potato famine illustrate the risks to pampered crops from attacks which their ancestors could withstand. There is also a whole selection of sterile hybrid fruit crops which are entirely dependent on human management for their on-going propagation and survival. Some of the greatest genetic changes are the result of chemically induced polyploidy doubling the number (or more with 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12), of chromosomes in the organism. Polyploidy - Wikipedia The induction of polyploidy is a common technique to overcome the sterility of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, Triticale is the hybrid of wheat (Triticum turgidum) and rye (Secale cereale). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become triticale. In some situations, polyploid crops are preferred because they are sterile. For example, many seedless fruit varieties are seedless as a result of polyploidy. Such crops are propagated using asexual techniques, such as grafting. Polyploidy in crop plants is most commonly induced by treating seeds with the chemical colchicine. Examples Triploid crops: some apple varieties (e.g. Belle de Boskoop, Jonagold, Mutsu, Ribston Pippin), banana, citrus, ginger, watermelon[41], saffron crocus Tetraploid crops: very few apple varieties, durum or macaroni wheat, cotton, potato, canola/rapeseed, leek, tobacco, peanut, kinnow, Pelargonium Hexaploid crops: chrysanthemum, bread wheat, triticale, oat, kiwifruit[11]  Scientific classification Kingdom: - Plantae Clade: - Angiosperms Clade: - Eudicots Clade: - Rosids Order: - Rosales Family: - Rosaceae Genus: - Fragaria Species: - F. \u00d7 ananassa Binomial name Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 Octaploid crops: strawberry, dahlia, pansies, sugar cane, oca (Oxalis tuberosa)[42] Dodecaploid crops: some sugar cane hybrids Of course in the case of fertile polyploids, this makes a mockery of the fanciful creationist claims that the genetic information storage capacity of organisms cannot be increased!
