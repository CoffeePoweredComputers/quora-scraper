            "answer_text": "A short explanation (which might answer your question) would be that density is mass divided by volume. density = mass/volume In physics, we usually use the Greek letter rho, \u03c1, for density. This equation that can be rearranged in different ways.  You could also say that density*volume = mass. Or volume = mass/density Something with a higher density than water will sink, something with a lower density than water will sink. Something with a high mass but a low density has the mass distributed across more volume.  Mass has to do with the number of subatomic particles (protons, electrons, neutrons) within an object. Each of these particles has a \"mass\", and the sum of them is the total mass of the object.  The way we experience mass is usually in combination with gravity. On Earth, something with a higher mass will feel heavier.  F = m*g (F and g being vectors) But even without gravity, the effects of mass are noticeable, for example in space.  F = m*a It will take more force to accelerate something with a higher mass. Much like it takes more torque to rotate something with a higher moment of intertia. Two masses cause a force of gravity, shown in Newton's Law of gravitation.  So the effects of gravity exists where there is mass. F = (G M m)/r^2 F is a vector, G is the universal gravitation constant, M and m are the two masses and r (squared) is the distance between the objects squared. ",

            "answer_text": "Density and mass are compleatly different. They are related as[math] mass = density \u00d7 volume [/math].Mass is the matter which is filled up in a body, whereas density determines what mass is filled in the body per unit volume. So, hardness or softness of a body will be only determined by density as it helps us identify How much matter is stashed in a unit length I.e. if less matter is present in a unit lenght (comparing to some other body), then rest of the space will be occupied by the air gaps; making the object more compressible (with respect to the other body). Whereas, mass just identifies How much matter is stashed in the body regardless of any length height or volume. To understand better, suppose you hold a linear body of mass 1 KG , Density 1 kg/cm^3 and volume 1 cm^3. If you crop out 0.1 KG part of that body, you will now hold a mass 0.9 KG , Density 1 kg/cm^3 and volume 0.9 cm^3. The thing to be noted is that, density didnt change! Thats because cropping out some part of the body from one end didn't change the composition of matter in the compleat body ( so called as density! ).  Hope it helps. ",
