            "answer_text": "\u201cIs the Big Bang theory still accepted as how the universe was created?\u201d The Big Bang theory is not a theory about the creation of the universe, and has never been seen as one by actual scientists in the field. The theory begins with space-time, matter, and energy already in existence, and does not explain where they came from. It is perhaps one of the most misunderstood theories in science. The Big Bang was not an explosion, and there was no center to the expansion. The universe did not originate from a point, and could have been infinitely large to begin with, since the universe could be infinitely large today. It was only the finite portion of the universe we can see from Earth, the observable universe, that once fit into a tiny space.  Here is the evolution of a large section of the universe. The Big Bang is more like the illustration above, which has the past on the left and the present on the right. As time progresses, the universe becomes less dense as gravity pulls matter together into galaxies. The illustration does not go all the way back to the beginning of the Big Bang, just back far enough to see the expansion of space taking place. ",

            "answer_text": "You asked if the Big Bang theory is still accepted as how the universe was created and for me, it is better than some mythical supreme-being having created it in six days. I am not an atheist; I am a spiritual realist and I tell you the eventuation (Big Bang) did occur. All those immortal soul-beings who reside within the realms of Havona or you prefer heaven are fully aware of its happening; and I have proof of what I speak. The knowledge concerning the eventuation and the source of my knowledge is in the form of an audio recording presented by a Master Melchizedek teacher who has made the Big Bang his life\u2019s study. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But before I share this celestial knowledge with you, it is important that you learn who I am and the means by which I obtained the information. Who is Rani My psychic seer Magna was a master in all aspects of the paranormal, specializing in astral projection and travel, psychometry, clairvoyance, precognition, and was a spiritual channel for Abaris. It was because of her extraordinary abilities that makes it possible to provide the information that follows.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To receive the answer to what, where, when, and how everything began, listen to the Eventuation and proceed to gain more celestial knowledge. Next you should learn that we are not alone in this universe by introducing you to our brothers and sisters residing in the Pleiades. Then to learn aboutof the Brotherhood Reclamation Fleet and their Purpose. I will now attempt to bring you up to date by providing a special gift from Abaris on what to expect in the not too distant future. Realize Abaris recorded this message back in June of 1995 so some of the predictions have already come to pass while others are yet to occur. When talking with us, he often used universal time which is 18.34 times greater than earth time, thus predictions slated to occur in one or two years actually means nearly twenty to forty earth years. That puts the remainder of the predictions in our present and not too distant future. When it comes to learning the truth about earth\u2019s history, the bible not a reliable place to inquire. If you are truly seeking the complete and accurate history on this planet, I suggest you consult the Urantia Book and scroll down to paper 62. The Dawn Races of Early Man. Or if you would prefer to begin with the history of Dalamatia (we earthlings call it Atlantis.) begin with paper 66, The Planetary Prince. This is the time of the Calagastia Rebellion and the beginning of our history when everything went wrong and we became deaf, dumb, and blind to all divine knowledge. ",
