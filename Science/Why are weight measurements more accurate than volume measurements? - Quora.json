            "answer_text": "Before getting to the point, it is important to understand what is actually meant by volume and weight. Volume\u2014 It is the space taken up by a 3 dimensional object, which can differ Weight \u2014 It is the pressure exerted by a 3 dimensional object, which is the product of the mass of the object with the gravitational force faced by it. The space taken up by an object (i.e, volume) is due to molecular expansion , thus, even if an object have low mass but have high molecular expansion ( which can be due to various reasons such as state of matter or heat/thermal expansion) then it is having a high volume, and thus, by occpying more space may seem to be much more in quantity than an object containing more mass in actual but have low volume because the molecules are contracted ( usually the solids, for example). To overcome this issue of mis-judging quantity, it is more convenient (or you can say is actually accurate) to have a weight measure as it (keeping aside the force of gravity, which affects the weight of an object in any planet or space) shows the correct measure of the mass contained, or in more simple words, the real quantity of the object.

            "answer_text": "Density of solids is more than that of liquids\u2026 Liquids easily accept change in atmosphere such as temperature,pressure etc. We may not be familiar with much pressure changes, but temperature changes frequently with in a day.With the change in temperature volume of the liquid is also changed. But weight of the substance will never change where ever we are in the planet. If we take same amount of liquid substance in two vessels and measure the volume in two different temperatures,it varies. That is the reason ,why oil cans are sold in kg\u2019s ",
