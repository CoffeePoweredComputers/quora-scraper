            "answer_text": "no,it is not necessary that friction always opposes motion. consider the following example of motion in which friction helps favourably in motion. suppose a small block is placed on the upper side of a big block. now big block is moved slowly in the forward direction. we will see that small block placed on the big block also moves in forward direction while we are moving only big block. in this example the direction of frictional (acting between down side of small block and upper side of big block) force is in the direction of motion which is enabling the small block to move in the direction of motion.

            "answer_text": "No, friction can CAUSE motion, be in the same direction as motion. For example: Put a raft in the river. As the river flows past the raft, friction between the water molecules and the raft structure will speed up the raft to the same speed as the river current. Friction pushes the raft forward, giving it velocity. When you walk on the ground, your feet push against the ground backwards. Your feet don\u2019t slip because the sideways force on the ground is friction. By Newton\u2019s Third Law, the ground pushes FORWARD on your feet, causing you to move forward. So friction between the ground and your feet pushes forward, the same as the direction you are walking. ",

            "answer_text": "Friction produces heat causing wastage of energy in machines. This reduces efficiency of machines. Friction causes wear and tear of moving parts of macinery, soles of shoes, etc. Work is done when a force causes an object to move in the same direction that the force is applied. When two surfaces slide past each other, friction resists their motion. Thus speed decreases. Now in order to maintain same speed, extra energy is needed. ",
