            "answer_text": "Most varieties of maggots will only eat dead tissue, so if someone has a wound that needs to be debrided, maggots that only eat dead tissue can be very, very precise in the removal of only the dead tissue, sparing live tissue far better than a surgeon can do with a scalpel. The trade-off is that, as Helene Disantos pointed out, it is messy, requiring a lot of nursing care, often comes with really bad odors, messy dressing and linen changes, the need to control for flies as the maggots mature, and the idea of maggots may be so creepy-crawly that patients cannot tolerate them. I only saw one case where \u201cmedical maggots\u201d were ordered, on a hand that was crushed in an industrial accident. I didn\u2019t have to provide the care, thank goodness. ",

            "answer_text": "I have not seen maggots used to debride necrotic tissue since the 1960s. I remember patients in a private room with a screen door to contain flies, as maggots mature into flies. Maggots did a good job, but it was a nasty job to change dressings and bed sheets for patients who had to agree to this treatment. Usually the patient had Diabetes and a necrotic foot or lower leg. Despite the maggot debridement, the necrotic extremity was amputated as the underlying problem is inadequate circulation . ",
