            "answer_text": "vanadium with its atomic number 23, and electronic configuration (3d3 4s2) normally while vanadium in plus 3 state will lose two of its 4s electrons while one will be lost from 3d which will left 3d as 3d2, thus these both electrons will arrange in same spin because of Hund\u2019s rule, or maximum spin multiplicity. Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby certain materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal induced magnetic field, in the direction of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetism is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic. Due to their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act like tiny magnets. An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "The electron configuration of vanadium in its ground state is [Ar] 3d3 4s2. A V(III) cation, on the other hand, is [Ar] 3d2. If you work out an orbital energy diagram, you will easily see the two electrons are located on two equivalent 3d orbitals. According to Hund\u2019s rule, their multiplicity must be maximised so both will pair their spins up (or down, whichever will do). This is why V(III) is weakly attracted by the poles of a magnet or, put it differently, is paramagnetic. ",
