            "answer_text": "This question is under \u201cFocusing and Concentrating\u201d and \u201cMachine learning\u201d It should really be under science, perhaps biology or chemistry, because that is where a concentration gradient is important. When particles(solutes) are in a solution and the concentration on one side of a permeable membrane is greater than the other, the particles will move through the membrane until the concentration is equal on both sides. Think about it this way. You have a shoe box with a piece of cardboard in dividing it in the middle. This card board has a marble sized slot in it. You put nine marbles in one side and one in the other. The difference in the number of marbles is your concentration gradient. Then, you shake the box (this is similar to the way molecules are always moving) and after awhile you have five marbles on each side. No matter how long you do this, you will average about five marbles on each side most of the time even though they come and go through the slot. ",
