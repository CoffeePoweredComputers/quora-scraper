            "answer_text": "In biology, an organism (from Greek: \u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, organismos) is any individual entity that exhibits the properties of life. It is a synonym for \"life form\". Organisms are classified by taxonomy into specified groups such as the multicellular animals, plants, and fungi; or unicellular microorganisms such as a protists, bacteria, and archaea.[ Defining Life Five characteristics are used to define life. All living things share these characteristics. All living things: are made of one or more cells.need energy to stay alive.respond to stimuli in their environment.grow and reproduce.maintain a stable internal environment.Humans are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which differentiate during development into specialized tissues and organs. An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains\u2014bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes. Living Things Are Made of Cells Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like tiny factories where virtually all life processes take place. Some living things, like the bacteria, consist of just one cell. They are called single-celled organisms. Some living things are composed of a few to many trillions of cells. They are called multicellular organisms. Your body is composed of trillions of cells.  The green scum in this canal consists of billions of single-celled green algae. Algae are plant-like microorganisms that produce food by photosynthesis. Regardless of the type of organism, all living cells share certain basic structures. For example, all cells are enclosed by a membrane. The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. Living Things Need Energy Everything you do takes energy. Energy is the ability to change or move matter. Whether it\u2019s reading these words or running a sprint, it requires energy. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Where do you get energy? You probably know the answer. You get energy from food.  Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are healthy sources of food energy. Just like you, other living things need a source of energy. But they may use a different source. Producers such a tree in use sunlight for energy to produce their own \u201cfood.\u201d The process is called photosynthesis, and the \u201cfood\u201d is sugar. Plants and other organisms use this food for energy.Consumers such as a raccoon eat plants\u2014or other consumers that eat plants\u2014as a source of energy.Some consumers such as u mushrooms get their energy from dead organic matter. For example, they might consume dead leaves on a forest floor.Living Things Respond to their Environment When a living thing responds to its environment, it is responding to a stimulus. A stimulus (stimuli, plural) is something in the environment that causes a reaction in an organism. The reaction a stimulus produces is called a response. Imagine how you would respond to the following stimuli: You\u2019re about to cross a street when the walk light turns red.You hear a smoke alarm go off in the kitchen.You step on an upturned tack with a bare foot.You smell the aroma of your favorite food.You taste something really sour.It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to realize that responding appropriately to such stimuli might help keep you safe. It might even help you survive. Like you, all other living things sense and respond to stimuli in their environment. In general, their responses help them survive or reproduce. Watch this amazing time-lapse video to see how a plant responds to the stimuli of light and gravity as it grows. Why do you think it is important for a plant to respond appropriately to these stimuli for proper growth?  Living Things Grow and Reproduce Like plants, all living things have the capacity for growth. The ducklings in have a lot of growing to do to catch up in size to their mother. Multicellular organisms like ducks grow by increasing the size and number of their cells. Single-celled organisms just grow in size.  These ducklings will grow to become as big as their mother by the time they are about a year old. As the ducklings grow, they will develop and mature into adults. By adulthood, they will be able to reproduce. Reproduction is the production of offspring. The ability to reproduce is another characteristic of living things. Many organisms reproduce sexually. In sexual reproduction, parents of different sexes mate to produce offspring. The offspring have some combination of the traits of the two parents. Ducks are examples of sexually reproducing organisms. Other organisms reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, a single parent can produce offspring alone. For example, a bacterial cell reproduces by dividing into two daughter cells. The daughter cells are identical to each other and to the parent cell. Living Things Maintain a Stable Internal Environment The tennis player in the picture below has really worked up a sweat. Do you know why we sweat? Sweating helps to keep us cool. When sweat evaporates from the skin, it uses up some of the body\u2019s heat energy. Sweating is one of the ways that the body maintains a stable internal environment. It helps keep the body\u2019s internal temperature constant. When the body\u2019s internal environment is stable, the condition is called homeostasis.  Sweating is one way the body maintains homeostasis. All living organisms have ways of maintaining homeostasis. They have mechanisms for controlling such factors as their internal temperature, water balance, and acidity. Homeostasis is necessary for normal life processes that take place inside cells. If an organism can\u2019t maintain homeostasis, normal life processes are disrupted. Disease or even death may result. Summary All living things are made of cells, use energy, respond to stimuli, grow and reproduce, and maintain homeostasis.All living things consist of one or more cells. Cells are the basic units of structure and function of living organisms.Energy is the ability to change or move matter. All life processes require energy, so all living things need energy.All living things can sense and respond to stimuli in their environment. Stimuli might include temperature, light, or gravity.All living things grow and reproduce. Multicellular organisms grow by increasing in cell size and number. Single-celled organisms increase in cell size. All organisms can normally reproduce, or produce offspring. Reproduction can be sexual or asexual.All living things have ways of maintaining a stable internal environment. This stable condition is called homeostasis.",

            "answer_text": " A living organism is primarily physicochemical material that demonstrates a high degree of complexity, is capable of self-regulation, possesses a metabolism, and perpetuates itself through time. To many biologists, life is an arbitrary stage in the growing complexity of matter, with no sharp dividing line between the living and non-living worlds. Living substance is composed of a highly structured array of macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides, as well as smaller organic and inorganic molecules. A living organism has built-in regulatory mechanisms and interacts with the environment to sustain its structural and functional integrity. All reactions occurring within an individual living unit are called its metabolism. Specific molecules containing information in their structure are utilized both in the regulation of internal reactions and in the production of new living units. ",
