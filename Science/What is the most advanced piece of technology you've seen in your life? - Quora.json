However, given the frame of the question, I would vote for the satellite global positioning systems (GPS). To pull this off, you need to combine advanced technology in microelectronics, precision timekeeping, RF propagation, geodetics, rocketry, reliability, radiation hardness, battery technology, LED or LCD displays and materials technology. And it\u2019s all the more impressive in that this technology has become massively and inexpensively available to everyone on Earth, becoming so ubiquitous that GPS is now just an assumed accessory for your smartphone.

            "answer_text": "Maybe not so advanced because it is actually fairly simple in concept, but my vote would go to the Intra Aortic Balloon Pump. It is a balloon catheter that is advanced into the aorta through the femoral artery. By getting a signal from the patients ECG, it inflates and deflates (40cc), in time with the hearts pumping cycle. For patients in heart failure, this increases the available oxygen for the heart muscle AND decreases the work the sick heart needs to perform in order to provide life sustaining circulation by about 15 percent. This factor has resulted in saving countless numbers of people's lives!!!! Kudos to whomever thought this through. The Cardiac Pacemaker is right up there too. ",
