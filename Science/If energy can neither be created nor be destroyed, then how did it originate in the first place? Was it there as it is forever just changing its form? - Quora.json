            "answer_text": "This is an open question in the field of science now. But we do have some knowledge about it, if our current theories are correct. We do know that this energy, matter and even the familiar space wasn't forever as the universe had a starting point, a singularity (known as the 'big bang'). We know that in the beginning the universe was so small that quantum effects were profound and that according to laws of quantum mechanics we definately know that matter and energy can pop up in positive negative pairs (matter-antimatter) without any cause. With all these knowledge we speculate that in the early universe these pairs would have formed in unbalanced form, favouring matter and energy more that their counterparts. There is a theory called super asymmetry that explains it, but this theory needs to be confirmed. Or, the universe expanded so rapidly that these pairs wouldn't had enough time to recombine and annihilate, and in that case these anti matter pairs are still around, in which case we need to confirm it experimentally. We still haven't found antimatter in such abundance. ",

            "answer_text": "While we may presume that this question gets more of a philosophical/conjectural answer, we may discuss this question in a somewhat scientific perspective. With the advent of \u2018mass-energy equivalence\u2019, it has now become an indisputable fact that mass is not constant in nature but all mass may be discussed in terms of energy (it is worrisome that some of the young minds on the platform are still thinking in terms of \u2018conservation of mass\u2019!). Thus, it is the conservation of energy that we deal with nature as an indomitable principle. Now, in order to discuss the question of conservation of energy in a meaningful way we have to first consider the universe to be finite for the simple reason that, if the universe were infinite the very principle of conservation becomes null and void. So all we mean by this principle is that in all our calculations of all the physical process in the universe we would be able to show that energy is constant. Even in the case of energy fluctuations in the quantum realm, we hurriedly say that energy is borrowed from the empty space for only very transient periods which is dutifully paid back to the vacuum energy. But then, in reality, the universe is infinite and eternal \u2013 and in this setting conservation of energy does not apply in principle, and energy will just be there for us to play with forever! ",
