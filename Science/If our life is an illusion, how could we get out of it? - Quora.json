            "answer_text": "Take a hammer, put your thumb on the table and hit your thumb with the hammer. If your life is an illusion you would not feel this, right?So this part is not so much illusion.Another experiment. Look at a solid building and try to see right through it, see what is happening at the other side. Fair chance this will not work. So again there must be something standing between us and the other side, else our view would not be blocked.  So we can be quite sure that sense impressions and what we call feelings exist. Then there is thinking. I recall this guy stating: 'cogito ergo sum'. At least for ourself our thinking is real. Would be hard to deny this, right? I'm starting to wonder: how is our life an illusion?  There is a certain illusion however. The illusion that it's the hammer that is causing the pain, the illusion that the building is blocking our view. That our thinking exists independent of other impressions.If I cut your thumb, press a needle in it, put it on fire, you will hurt. Should we blame those outside influences or our thumb? If we see a train, a car, a bird, a human, an animal, they are blocking our view. Should we blame those outside influences or our eyes which are not suited to look through solid forms? If we think good thoughts, bad thoughts, unwanted thoughts, should we blame outside influences that cause this or should we look how those outside influences are dragged into the mind? Our head can go on fire by many sense impressions. Pleasant or unpleasant.  This is the illusion of life, that there is something outside responsible for our fortune and loss, pain and pleasure, status and disgrace, praise and critisism. If there is someone responsible it's the person picking it up. Stop picking these up and life has not many illusions left. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything that is perceived has some level of reality.  I am not sure what you mean by \"illusion\".  The human experience is a construct, building symbolic structures out of the neural messages of sensory organs.  That's experience.  It's an illusion.  It is not a direct reflection of physical reality.  The rainbow has no bands, you realize?  The rainbow spectral spread is continuous.  The color bands are qualia.  They are an artifact of how our eyes deliver information in response to light, not of light itself. Coping mechanisms are also illusions.  The self-talk we use to seek comfort is an illusion.  Escaping illusion is like trying to break out of a prison that is in a wasteland.  To what end?  At least the prison feeds you.  There is nowhere to go. ",
