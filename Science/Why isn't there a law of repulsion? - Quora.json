            "answer_text": "There is this idea called the law of attraction. It says that what you put out into the universe, the universe brings back to you. The proponents of this idea talk about the idea in positive terms, like if you really want more money and focus on it, the universe brings you money. I like the idea, but I\u2019d hedge my bet and back it up with a whole bunch of action that would produce the outcomes I wanted, were it me.I have no idea whether the law of attraction really works, but I know the law of repulsion works with a flawless and predictable certainty. What you put out can very easily repel your dream clients ",

Repulsion is a surer test to identify a charged bodyLike charges do repel each otherSub-atomic particles repel each other if the distance between them decreases to less than 0.8 fmAll these instances show that repulsion definitely accounts in our life.
