            "answer_text": "He is because he built the first mechanical computer. This was in 1800s when he built this machine and it could calculate differential equations using gears. He had planned to make the whole computer but died before he had finished it all. The part he had finished could have been called math unit of CPU. Babbage was so far a head of everyone nobody even knew what he had built into the early 1930s when they found pieces of the machine and put it back together. Dr. Turing who is considered one of the greatest minds in computer science could not believe what they had found and that it was built in the 1800s. That is why Babbage is considered the father of the computer because he built the machine to calculate differential equations. They have found other parts where Babbage was trying to build the rest of the computer system to be complete. ",

            "answer_text": "Ayesha Fatima At this time, I see over 3700 questions posted by you. Please put a little more care into your questions, because this one is not a valid question. As shared by Prem Sobel , a PDF is something invented by Adobe in 1993. The only PDF related to Charles Babbage would be Pretty Dead Finally, since he had been dead for over 100 years at that time. ( FYI - PDF stands for Portable Document Format. The general intention was that a PDF file looks like the size and shape of paper it is intended to be printed on. Compare that to a Microsoft Word document that will reformat based on what size of paper you select. ) Charles Babbage originated the original concept of a digital programmable computer. ",
