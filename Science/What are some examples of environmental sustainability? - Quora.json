            "answer_text": "In the simplest terms environmental sustainability means fulfilling the needs of present generation without hampering the ability of future generations to meet their needs. It means natural resources available today should be used in such a way that not only fulfills the needs of present generation, but also ensures the availability and accessibility of these resources to meet the needs of future generations. Interaction of human (human activities which affect environment in any way) with environment should not hamper its regenerating capacity. Thus, only by avoiding resource abuse, misuse, overuse, waste, depletion and degradation; long term environment quality can be maintained. This is what environment sustainability calls for. You can understand it better with an example:- Nature has its own ability to rejuvenate and regenerate the resources. e.g. if a little portion of river in an area is polluted due to dead bodies of animals or any other organic waste; river will regain its water quality itself within a given time.Every ecosystem has its own resilience and balance. But when human uses resources in inefficient way and creates waste which hampers this ecosystem balance and resilience, environmental sustainability is threatened. e.g. that same river will not be able to regain its water quality if is completely polluted due to chemicals.In this scenario, future generations will suffer because of degraded water quality. This is how environmental sustainability is threatened. Hence environmental sustainability here will be to use water in an efficient way which doesn't pollute it and maintains its quality. Let's take one more example:- Today we are using genetically modified crops, pesticides, insectides, rodenticides, intensive irrigation methods so that food production can be very high to ensure food security of present population. But what it does in a long term is that it degrades the soil quality, decreases soil fertility and land gets completely degraded due to soil salinity, water logging etc. Thus the same land loses its ability to produce crops, which hampers food security of future generations.Environmental sustainability here will be to strengthen public distribution system, using manure, doing organic farming with crop rotation etc; so that not only it can feed present population but can also ensure food availability to future generations. Therefore environmental sustainability can only be ensured when economic development doesn't destroy environment. ",

            "answer_text": "While we were surfing the Internet, weI came across an article that read that pizza boxes made out of pandan leaves are being used as an alternative to the cardboard boxes. A pizzeria joint in the Philippines is using pandan leaves to make eco-friendly pizza boxes. The idea struck the minds of the owners when they ran short of the cardboard boxes. So, they thought of sourcing the boxes locally and they requested the hat weavers to make tampipi pizza boxes made out of pandan leaves. This way they provided employment to the local weavers and promoted a sustainable alternative to help the environment. This is just one example of how the people and firms are adopting the goals of sustainable development and understanding their moral responsibility towards the environment. There are other options of environment sustainability also where the firms have adopted the goals of sustainable development and made a move towards a green and clean environment. One of the examples of environmental sustainability is the system of sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture uses such practices by integrating the animal and plant production which helps in increasing productivity and has minimum impact on the environment. Crop rotation is a very effective way of promoting sustainable development. The rotation of crops helps in improving the quality of the soil and increases the fertility of the soil. Crop waste and animal waste is used as manure for the soil which increases the productivity of the soil. Water is also an essential element in agriculture. The drip irrigation system is a great way to manage water resources and prevent its wastage. Sustainability in the fashion industry is also a leading example of environmental sustainability. A shift from fast fashion to sustainable fashion or slow fashion where quality pieces keeping the environment in mind will be produced. The products would be produced with a thought of being ethical without compromising on trends and fashion. A sustainable item can be reused, recycled, repaired and revamped to increase its longevity and thus minimise the toll being put on the environment. In the recent years, various strategies and innovations have been done in the fashion industry like using fabric made from plants and leaves of fruits, making luxury wares from food waste, producing t-shirt made without chemicals, etc which have focused on sustainability to reduce carbon emissions, fabric waste, water usage and other resources. The use of LED lights and bulbs is also getting popular these days. It has replaced the traditional incandescent bulbs. They have reduced the energy consumption to a great extent by around 40% which helps in saving the electricity bill and saves money. By adopting the LED lights, American households can achieve 84% market share by 2030. Another sustainable trend to be looked into is the focus on automobile manufacturing and applying such techniques to promote fuel-free cars. The leading example in this regard is Telsa who is making cars and vehicles that run on electricity. The concept of self-driven cars is also popular and is practised in many cities and following the footsteps, the automobile industry can be reshaped and sustainability can be ensured. These are some of the leading examples of environmental sustainability. The sustainability goals have already been adopted by many companies and firms. Citizens have become more responsible towards the environment and are doing every bit to save the environment. Such steps and awareness among the individuals will help in making the planet a better and safer place to live in. ",
