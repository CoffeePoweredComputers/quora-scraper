            "answer_text": "Transition metals and their compounds function as catalysts either because of their ability to change oxidation state or, in the case of the metals, to adsorb other substances on to their surface and activate them in the process. All this is explored in the main catalysis section. Transition metals as catalysts Iron in the Haber Process The Haber Process combines hydrogen and nitrogen to make ammonia using an iron catalyst.   Nickel in the hydrogenation of C=C bonds This reaction is at the heart of the manufacture of margarine from vegetable oils. However, the simplest example is the reaction between ethene and hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst.   Transition metal compounds as catalysts Vanadium(V) oxide in the Contact Process At the heart of the Contact Process is a reaction which converts sulphur dioxide into sulphur trioxide. Sulphur dioxide gas is passed together with air (as a source of oxygen) over a solid vanadium(V) oxide catalyst.   Iron ions in the reaction between persulphate ions and iodide ions Persulphate ions (peroxodisulphate ions), , are very powerful oxidising agents. Iodide ions are very easily oxidised to iodine. And yet the reaction between them in solution in water is very slow. The reaction is catalysed by the presence of either iron(II) or iron(III) ions.   ",

            "answer_text": "Most d block elements have variable oxidation states which allow them to oxidize or reduce the reacting species easily. They change the mechanism of the reaction by oxidation or reduction and take the reaction through a different path as compared with the un-catalysed reaction. Also, d block elements offer a comparatively large surface area for the reactant molecules to come together and react with each other on the surface of the metal. ",
