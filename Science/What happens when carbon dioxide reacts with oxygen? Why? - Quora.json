            "answer_text": "O2 and CO2 do not react under ordinary conditions, owing to the thermodynamic stability of CO2 and the large activation energy required for multiple double-bond cleavage.You could imagine O2 + CO2 = O3 (ozone) + CO, where CO2 is reduced to CO and oxygen is oxidized to ozone. However, this reaction is not observed in the atmosphere - instead, the sun breaks down molecular oxygen to give ozone. ... CO2 is necessary for photosynthesis. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically you can force them to react to form CO\u2083, but that takes a lot of coaxing (corona discharge forming plasma of free oxygen atoms which then attack the CO\u2082), and apparently the stuff falls apart in seconds, forming \u2026 you guessed it, CO\u2082 and O\u2082. Think about it, if CO\u2082 and O\u2082 reacted, what would happen in your lungs? The fact that you exhale a mixture of about 3\u20135% CO\u2082 and 16\u201318% O\u2082 (plus 78% N\u2082 and 1% Ar) tells you that they don\u2019t react \u2026 ",
