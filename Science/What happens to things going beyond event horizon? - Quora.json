            "answer_text": "Classical general relativity says that for a large enough black hole, the infalling observer just goes in more or less uneventfully at the horizon, gradually getting stretched and squeezed by the relentlessly increasing tidal forces as he/she gets closer and closer to the singularity, and finally vanishes (stops existing) at the singularity, where general relativity is guaranteed to break down and we don't know what happens. But in light of the recent developments in the context of string theory and quantum gravity, based on the so-called fuzzball/firewall picture of black holes, I would say the jury is still out on whether this is actually what happens. Opinion is divided among the experts about whether general relativity breaks down at the horizon or at the singularity. We know it must break down at the singularity, but some people suspect it breaks down already at the horizon. If it breaks down already at the horizon, then the picture in the previous paragraph is wrong, and we will have to re-think what happens to the infalling observer. In other words, your question is one where active research is currently under way. ",
