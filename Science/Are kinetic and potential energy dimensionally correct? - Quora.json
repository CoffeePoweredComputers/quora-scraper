            "answer_text": "Do you mean the same? If so, then yes. Kinetic energy is given by half the product of mass and velocity squared. KE=12mv2KE=12mv2 Dimension for mass is M1L0T0M1L0T0, and the dimensional formula for velocity is M0L1T\u22121M0L1T\u22121 So, the dimensional formula for KE is M1M1\u00d7(M0L1T\u22121)2(M0L1T\u22121)2 Giving us M1L2T\u22122M1L2T\u22122 Gravitational potential energy is given by the product of mass, gravitational acceleration and height, in its simplified form anyways. PEg=mghPEg=mgh The dimensional formula for mass is, again, M1L0T0M1L0T0, the dimensional formula for gravitational acceleration is M0L1T\u22122M0L1T\u22122, and for height, it is M0L1T0M0L1T0. So the dimensional formula for potential energy is given by M1L0T0M1L0T0\u00d7M0L1T\u22122M0L1T\u22122\u00d7M0L1T0M0L1T0 Giving us M1L2T\u22122M1L2T\u22122 Which is the same as kinetic energy, which makes sense. They're both given in units of joules. Work is also given in units of joules and is equal to kinetic energy, therefore also has the same dimensional formula. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there! Lets see what the answer would be.. We know that K.E=mv^2/2 and P.E=mgh Where , m=massv=velocityg=Acceleration due to gravityh=heightSo dimensionally , Mass, m= MVelocity=LT^-1Height, h=LAcc. Due to gravity ,g=LT^-2So, K.E=M(LT^-1)^2 =ML^2T^-2 And P.E=M(LT^-2)L =ML^2T^-2 And its the same in both cases.. Cheers! ",
