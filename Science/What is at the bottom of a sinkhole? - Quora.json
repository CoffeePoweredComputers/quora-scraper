            "answer_text": "I think the easiest way to envision this is to imagine what is below the surface BEFORE the sinkhole appears. Sinkholes usually form in Karst terrain, which typically features a bedrock composed of limestone. Limestone is a rock that dissolves fairly easily, at least compared to other rocks. All it takes is very slightly acidic ground water moving through fractures in limestone and the rock begins to dissolve. Over time, in the range between decades to thousands of years, the dissolution of the rock forms caves below ground. Most caves, at least the ones I know about in North America, formed when sea level was higher, and therefore so was the water table beneath the land. So imagine you now have underground caverns completely filled with ground water, anywhere from 10 to several hundred feet below the ground surface. Now imagine Earth goes into an Ice Age: glaciers and ice caps get bigger and sea level drops. The water table under the land surface drops also, and the usually flooded cave system in the limestone drains and fills with air instead of water. Water is many times denser than air, and the now empty cave is more susceptible to collapse without the support of the water. Even though the cave is mostly empty because it is now above the water table, it still acts as a drainage system, sort of like a perforated drainage line in your yard - water trickling downwards towards the water table gets intercepted by the cave and then flows away as a rivulet or stream along the bottom, most likely flowing through connected cave systems until eventually intersecting the water table deeper down. So the cave is still getting larger - flowing water continues to dissolve and erode the limestone AND the roof grows increasingly more likely to collapse. A sinkhole is what happens at the ground surface when a cave roof collapses into a cavern beneath it. This is easy to imagine if, say, the cave is only ten feet below ground. If the cave roof was ten feet deep and the cave was ten feet tall, you wind up with a sinkhole about 10 feet deep and about ten feet of rubble filling what used to be the cave. But caves in Karst terrain can be hundreds of feet deep. It can take many years for a roof collapse to propagate upwards to the surface from a deep cave, and during those years the rubble from the collapsed roof material can get dissolved and eroded away downstream to wherever the cave water eventually flows. Essentially the cave grows upwards, vertically, and can become gigantic before the surface eventually collapses to form a sinkhole. Sinkholes commonly form when the cave propagates upwards enough to reach the surface of the bedrock. Once that happens the soil will begin to fall downward into the cave like water flowing down a drain (though slower). So worst case scenario, what's at the bottom of a BIG sinkhole? It's a tortuous, rocky pit hundreds of feet deep, that ends in a completely dark cavern with a raging, violent river in it, and that river flows through miles of pitch black passageways with unmapped twists and drops - and no one knows where it flows to, or how far. EDIT: there other types of sinkholes and ways to form them. One example which doesn't involve bedrock would be in a landfill situation where organic material may have been deposited and then covered over with soil. Imagine a pit filed with wood and then covered over. Decades later that wood is rotted away and the soil collapses into the void. Water leaking from either a water or sewer pipe can erode the backfill surrounding the pipe creating a void. When the surface collapses into the empty space - sinkhole. ",
