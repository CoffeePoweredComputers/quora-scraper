            "answer_text": "There are of course no volumetric flasks of 330 mL available, unless of course you have one custom made and calibrated, which is probably very expensive. So we will go for the next available volume, 500 mL. The molecular weight of ethanol (C2H6O) is 46.07 g/mol A concentration of 0.16 mol/L means 46.07 * 0.16 = 7.37 g per liter. For 500 mL we need 5.37 / 2 = 3.69 g So: weigh out 3.69 g of ethanol (Yes, I know ethanol is a liquid, but it is not against the constitution to weigh a liquid). Transfer quantitatively to a 500 mL volumetric flask, and dilute with pure water to the mark. Pour out 330 mL in a graduated cylinder, and you have 330 mL of 0.16 M ethanol solution ",
