            "answer_text": "Potassium is much more reactive than 3rd Period sodium. Because its valence electron is farther removed from the nuclear core, the metal is a much stronger reducing agent. Sodium can be safely destroyed by ethyl alcohol\u2026the attempt to do so with potassium will result in flames\u2026and other means must be used to dispose of residues\u2026 Interestingly, an alloy, which composition corresponds to  may be easily prepared from the metals, and this is much more reactive than potassium. The fact that this alloy is a LIQUIDUS, makes it useful for certain applications\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Generally sodium is more reactive than potassium as elements are generally more reactive up and to the left on the periodic table. Elemental sodium and potassium are both violently reactive with water, giving off copious quantities of hydrogen gas that typically ignites. They both participate virtually identically in many chemical reactions as they have the same valence. ",
