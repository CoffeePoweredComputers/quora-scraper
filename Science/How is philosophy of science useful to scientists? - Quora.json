            "answer_text": "It certainly was influential at one time, although may be less so today. Aristotle made observational arguments for why the Earth was round, and could be considered to have used the scientific method. But he is usually cast as a philosopher. Similarly, Eratosthe\u0301nes estimated the size of the Earth by comparing shadows in remote places, another application of the scientific method, despite not being widely recognized as such today. Copernicus started to change the paradigm by publishing his views and making it easy for others with an open mind to see why the Earth orbits the Sun. This was in the face of persecution by the Church, but could be argued to be the conception of modern science. More specifically to the point, Rene\u0301 Descartes performed a philosophical thought experiment in which he concluded that light must act like a wave. This was not apparent to others, but it preceded Newton\u2019s discovery by 36 years. Something about the earlier philosophy could have inspired Newton\u2019s experiment with a prism, or it simply could have happened when the right tools were available. From Newton\u2019s time on, I would say that science guided philosophy rather than the other way around. Today there is a lot of metaphysical misinterpretations which fulfill psychological needs rather than scientific ones. But I would say the philosophy of science is still very needed, but not necessarily to guide scientists in their day-to-day. Scientific discoveries need philosophy to help put them into popular context. An example would be the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2013, which proved a model unifying electroweak and nuclear forces. This satisfies a philosophical ideal of unified energy, but without a philosophy of science, not even scientists are likely to embrace it with any zeal. The job of scientists is to continue asking questions, regardless of what answers are being given. ",

            "answer_text": "Truth be told, philosophy of science is of no use to practicing scientists. At best it is an enjoyable read of the history of evolution of the scientific world views, at worst a rigid obstruction in the progress of science. A scientist always makes a tentative epistemology as a working philosophy but he can not afford to be fully committed to one fixed system. Rigid philosophy of science has always hindered the progress of science in the long run. For example take the history of physics. At the time of Descartes the philosophy of science was \"mechanism\" (everything must be explained by mechanical push-pull of mater). It was a progressive philosophy for the time. But then people felt uncomfortable by Newton's theory of gravity since it is an action at a distance theory. How can sun affect the motion of earth since there is so much empty space between them? Even after Newton's triumph, people continued to adhere to \"mechanism\". Faraday and Maxwell went on to express their new field concept in terms of mechanical stress-strain on a mechanical medium called ether. But then the mechanical world view collapsed completely. The mechanistic philosophy of science has played its heroic role (the most successful being the theory of heat) but ultimately it tried to hinder progress. There was a time when Kant's philosophy of science became popular. Kant thought that Euclidean geometry is the only possible geometry and the nature of that geometry is given to human mind a priory. So by pure thought alone we can deduce its inferences. Space and time do not have any objective structure by itself. We arrange our physical experiences within this preexisting categories of geometrical thought. This world view has been shattered ever since Einstein proposed his general theory of relativity and subsequently confirmed. To a modern eye the mistakes of Kant seems to be surprisingly naive but people at the time were absolutely certain about its validity. Take the case of positivism. Einstein while proposing his special theory of relativity clearly inspired by early positivist like Mach. The positivist reasoning has since been quite useful for physicists. Heisenberg's quantum mechanics and uncertainty principle have been direct results of applying positivist reasoning. But positivist philosophy had played a negative role in case of atomism. The intensity of criticism by Mach based on his positivist position drove Boltzmann nearly insane. Ultimately atomism won. A theory of physics can not be based solely on observables. Geoffrey Chew in the 1960s tried to abandon quantum fields altogether since they were unobservable. His \"S-matrix\" program also failed (although it may be argued that string theory has revived his ideas) in favor of quantum field theories of weak and strong interactions. Popper's idea of essential falsifiability is naive in many ways. I wouldn't make my answer any longer. Just think about Dirac's idea of a magnetic monopole. A single monopole in the whole universe is enough to solve a profound mystery of quantization of electric charge. This theory is Popper unfalsifiable yet completely scientific. Kuhn's ideas about science are respected only by non-scientists. It's completely silly. At the end let me quote Einstein. \"The reciprocal relationship of epistemology and science is of noteworthy kind. They are dependent upon each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is - insofar as it is thinkable at all - primitive and muddled. However, no sooner has the epistemologist, who is seeking a clear system, fought his way through to such a system, than he is inclined to interpret the thought-content of science in the sense of his system and to reject whatever does not fit into his system. The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far. He accepts gratefully the epistemological conceptual analysis; but the external conditions, which are set for him by the facts of experience, do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted in the construction of his conceptual world by the adherence to an epistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist: he appears as realist insofar as he seeks to describe a world independent of the acts of perception; as idealist insofar as he looks upon the concepts and theories as the free inventions of the human spirit (not logically derivable from what is empirically given); aspositivist insofar as he considers his concepts and theories justified only to the extent to which they furnish a logical representation of relations among sensory experiences. He may even appear as Platonist or Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.\" Ref: http://depts.washington.edu/ssnet/Weinberg_SSN_1_14.pdf ",
