            "answer_text": "Excellent question. As life supposedly came from the sea our distant ancestors would have lived in and drunk from it. I think the practical part of it comes down to limited energy availability making the body prune away all non-essential functions. The ability to do so might still be present but dormant in our junk DNA. Perhaps a well enough fed, adapted and exercised human could but most people are too close to starvation including professional athletes or too out of shape (like the heaviest fattest people in the world) to maintain that functionality if it\u2019s not a daily requirement. This hypothesis should come with a \u201cdon\u2019t try this at home\u201d since drinking saltwater can supposedly be lethal and I don\u2019t think anyone I\u2019ve ever seen is really in good enough shape to even start (re)acquiring this adaptation even with good medical knowledge of what they are doing. So basically not unless you are Dr. Superman, you have a laboratory and a PhD in some sort of human bio-medical related field, you really know what you are doing and you are proceeding slowly, carefully, scientifically as an experiment and monitoring your health for any adverse effects. While it should be possible for an exceptional individual to adapt in THEORY it would likely kill most people in practice. Drinking saltwater can be lethal according to this source: Can humans drink seawater? . The reason set forth is simply that our kidneys can not produce urine at a higher salt concentration than seawater thus we can not eliminate the salt. I\u2019m not really sure why our guts would absorb the salt instead of just pooping it but since seawater does not even taste good I\u2019d rather not risk my life to find out. For how I suggest staying in shape to maximize both your body\u2019s healthy subcutaneous fat (to prevent starvation and loss of muscle or other functions to efficiency pruning) and your personal physical fitness see the bottom post of my Quora blog for an exercise guide: Basic personal fitness. I also recommend three good meals per day to satiation until you don\u2019t want to eat more and have leftovers of things that you will eat later. I do NOT recommend drinking seawater or saltwater or otherwise eating large quantities of salt. The USDA recommends 2300mg of sodium at maximum per 2000 calories of food. ",

            "answer_text": "We can\u2026 and we do, from time to time. Generally it\u2019s bad for our health because it draws moisture osmotically out of our tissues into the bloodstream, increasing our blood pressure and triggering our kidneys to dispose of as much of the extra salt and water as it can keep up with in an effort to bring our blood pressure back down. Meanwhile, our tissues are dehydrated and so cannot function properly. When you\u2019re sweating profusely, though, it can be beneficial to drink water with some amount of salt added to it to replenish the salt lost through sweat. This is how Gatorade justifies its existence. You do need to be careful, though, to not supplement too much salt this way because again doing so can dehydrate you. On very sweaty days when you find yourself drinking a great deal of water, try to find some middle ground; drink water that is \u201csalted to taste\u201d, and if it starts tasting unpleasant, switch back to clear water. When you\u2019re salt-depleted, you\u2019ll probably have a mild craving for salt. The body\u2019s pretty neat about that sort of thing. ",
