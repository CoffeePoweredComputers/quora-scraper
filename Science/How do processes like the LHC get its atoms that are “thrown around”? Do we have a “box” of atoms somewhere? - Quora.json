            "answer_text": "The construction of bean seems complex:  It all start with LINAC 2, then it go to PSB, then to PS, then to SPS, and finally to LHC. PSB, PS, SPS, and LHC are similar: circular particle accelerators (synchrotron). Each of them accelerate the particles, so to have the wanted energies for collision in LHC. They have magnetic and electric fields to accelerate particles, to turn them, and to focus them in the center of the beam. LINACs are linear accelerators. Nearly the same principle of the circular accelerators. Now I do not know exactly how protons are produced: there are various methods: chemically you detach Hydrogen atoms from a molecule, and then you ionize it (you take its electron), so you have the wanted protons. Or maybe you ionize the molecule, and you take apart the H. Electrolysis is similar. In any case there are many processes. After you have the proton, you just accelerate, see above descriptions. Only protons should be able to persist in the different circular particle accelerators (because the charge and mass), so you have quickly a beam of protons (and just protons), and with a precise energy. Note: you can use these accelerators as storage of protons. Just you keep them in a circular beam, until you have enough protons, and then until the protons are required for next synchrotron. Note: as you see from above figure, protons can be used for other experiments. Producing protons (or electrons) is not complex. Instead to produce other particles (positrons, etc.) it may takes much more effort (you may need collision [at lover energies] and trapping the particles with correct charge and mass into a synchrotron, until you have enough particles.

            "answer_text": "What the LHC throws around is protons - hydrogen atoms with tbe electron removed. And at the very head of the LHC there is indeed a box, or rather a small thin bottle half a metre tall, of ordinary hydrogen. But the amount of matter the LHC moves is very smalk. A few tens of thousands of protons in each packet, a million or two circulating for days. That little bottle is expected to last the lifetime of the LHC. ",
