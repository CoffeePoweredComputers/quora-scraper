            "answer_text": "Short answer: Mg is [math]1s^22s^22p^63s^2[/math]; its Noble gas shorthand is [math][Ne]3s^2[/math]. There are two rules to keep in mind, whenever you are trying to figure out the electron configuration of any ground-state atom: You have to follow the Aufbau principle, which states that electrons populate the atomic orbitals situated at the lowest energy first. There are two parts to the Aufbau principle. The first one is the Klechkowsky\u2019s rule, which states that electrons must be assigned in order of increasing value of [math](n+l)[/math]. In case of a tie, the second portion of the Aufbau principle . These two rules can be summarized by drawing diagonal arrows pointing to the bottom-left corner of the screen in the following diagram. The arrows will show the progression of filling in the orbitals, as directed by the Aufbau principle. [math]1s[/math] [math]2s 2p[/math] [math]3s 3p 3d[/math] [math]4s 4p 4d 4f[/math] [math]5s 5p 5d 5f[/math] [math]6s 6p 6d[/math] [math]7s 7p[/math] The order would be [math]1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f ...[/math] Of course, if you have the periodic table of elements with you, you can trace your way across periods to find out the electron configuration of Magnesium. Note that main group elements retain the same principal quantum number while transition metals have to be considered as [math](n-1)d[/math] and inner transition metals have to be regarded as [math](n-2)f[/math], when moving across the periodic table of elements.

            "answer_text": "In order to write the Mg electron configuration we first need to know the number of electrons for the Mg atom (there are 12 electrons). When we write the configuration we'll put all 12 electrons in orbitals around the nucleus of the Magnesium atom. In writing the electron configuration for Magnesium the first two electrons will go in the 1s orbital. Since 1s can only hold two electrons the next 2 electrons for magnesium go in the 2s orbital. The nex six electrons will go in the 2p orbital. The p orbital can hold up to six electrons. We'll put six in the 2p orbital and then put the remaining two electrons in the 3s. Therefore the Magnesium electron configuration will be 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 . ",
