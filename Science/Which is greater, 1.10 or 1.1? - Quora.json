            "answer_text": "Mathematically, they are equal. The reasons are there in all the previous answers. Practically, in scientific experiments, they aren't. **intense background music from Christopher Nolan\u2019s films plays** The reason behind it is, significant figures. 1.1 has 2 significant figures, and 1.10 has three significant figures. A significant figure describes the extent to which a given result is accurate. For example, a metre scare may show a minimum of 1cm. So it is accurate upto 0.01m only (1cm => 1S.F.). But a normal 15 or 30cm scale shows a minimum 1mm (0.1cm => 2 S.F.) Therefore, if we measure 1cm in both scales, we will conclude 0.01m with a metre scale (or 1cm), and 0.010m (or 1.0cm) in the centimetre scale. Yes, they both may represent the same number, but 1.0cm shows a higher level of accuracy than 1cm. The metre scale may have measured 9mm or 11mm, we cannot be sure since it cannot measure mm, but a centimetre scale shows that it is 10mm and not 9 or 11mm. We can use more accurate scales with more significant figures (Vernier Callipers can show 1.00cm, which will be more accurate than 1.0cm, and so on\u2026) **intense background music from Christopher Nolan\u2019s films ends** Theorically, yes, they are equal. However, if we apply it in real-life scenarios, we will surely prefer the number which has more zeroes at the end (more significant figures). ",

[However, there is a Philosophical dimension as well. Let us see. For 1.10, we can say that 110 objects are being divided among 100 people. Where as for 1.1 we can say that 11 objects are being divided among 10 people. Now, how will we judge which is greater? I don\u2019t know the answer to this question.] ",
