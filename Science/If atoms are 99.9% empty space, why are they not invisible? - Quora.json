            "answer_text": "Copying my answer to a similar question about people not being transparent[1]: There are multiple ways to answer this. The atom is not 99.9% nothing This claim essentially comes from the fact that the electron is over a thousand times lighter than the protons and neutrons which reside in the nucleus which only occupies a miniscule fraction \u2014 way smaller than 0.1% in fact \u2014 of the size of atom. Thinking in terms of mass, you could say that most of the atom is \u201cempty\u201d. But this should be understood with the caveat that in all those \u201cempty\u201d regions, there is a non-zero probability of finding an electron because the electron wave function is non-vanishing there[1]. More importantly, electromagnetic interactions are more concerned with the charge of the electron rather than its mass. Both the electron and the proton feel the same magnitude of force in an electric field due to equal magnitude of charge, but the former responds more to the force because of the lower mass. It is hence the spread out electron charge density which dominates in the interaction with light resulting in opacity.  Wavefunctions for different hydrogen atom orbitals show that the electron is delocalised in a large volume (Author: PoorLeno. Public domain image. Source: Wikimedia commons[2]) Even very low density interactions can add up over large distances. Transparency of a material depends on the thickness. Even normally opaque materials such as metals are quite transparent when a thin films a few nanometres thin are considered. So even if you have some material which is quite transparent at small thickness, increasing the thickness can give opacity, as the transmitted light falls exponentially with distance[3]. Humans are thousands of times larger than the visible wavelengths, giving sufficient distance for the light to decay.  Laser light intensity decays exponentially as it passes through an absorbing medium. (Author: Amirber. License: cc-by-sa 3.0. Source: Wikimedia commons[4]) Light can \u201creach out\u201d to a distance comparable to the wavelength. If you have a 10cm^2 wide beam of light and place a 1cm^2 area coin in its path, it is pretty obvious that the the fraction of light cut off by the coin is the ratio of the coin size to the beam size. But this intuition breaks down when we go to much smaller objects, smaller than the wavelength of light. The effective area of light that interacts with an object is described by its extinction cross section[5]. And for sub wavelength particles, the extinction cross section can be much larger than the size of the particle itself, and of the order of the wavelength of light. This is the reason why we can make the reflectors for radio telescopes[6] out of a thin metal mesh rather than solid metal. Even if your mesh is 99.9% empty, you can't get an object larger than the mesh holes through it!  The parabolic reflector of the half kilometre long Ooty Radio telescope seems invisible in this photo because it is built out of a wire mesh. Humans are a tiny bit transparent Really. As another answer points out, just shining a torch light on your hand in a dark room will show multiply scattered light passing through. Also, \u201clight\u201d is not just visible light. X-rays work in medical diagnostics because the flesh is mostly transparent under them but bones are not. The entire human body is almost completely transparent for even higher energy waves like gamma rays. So let us put the bits together: the charge density in the atoms which make up our body is spread out over the whole size of the atom (of the order of 1 angstrom). Biomolecules can get much larger than this. Some of these atoms and molecules such as melanin[7] can absorb light, with a single absorber being able to \u201ccatch\u201d photons from regions much larger than their geometric size. Though the probability of photon absorption is pretty low, it adds up over the entire thickness of the body, letting only a tiny portion of visible light pass through.

            "answer_text": "This is an apparently naive question with a not so obvious answer. Fred McGalliard\u2019s answer is true but I will try to keep this explanation out of quantum mechanics and more on the classical explanations of nature of light and matter. So even though the combined sizes of nuclei and electrons are that much smaller than the atomic radius, their likelihood of interacting with visible light is much more related with a larger scale arrangement of atoms, be it at a molecular or crystalline lattice level. That is also why the solid state is typically called condensed matter. It also really depends on what light we are talking about. Most materials are transparent to high energy photons with very short wavelengths (cosmic rays, gamma radiation), while longer wavelengths are more likely to interact with matter, to an extent, because above a couple hundred microns, long wave IR and radio and microwaves will be able to skip physical barriers and even bounce off the upper limits of the atmosphere and thanks to that we have modern telecommunications. When you say transparent I guess you mean to the naked eye, which means visible light, with a wavelength between 400\u2013700 nanometers (1 billionth of a meter). The atomic radii range between 0.3 to 3 angstrom, which is about 1000 thousand times smaller than the visible wavelength range. So when visible light interacts with matter, it will do so at molecular level and even at microscopic level (microscopic meaning it can be detected with a conventional optical microscope). Molecular spectroscopy is based on these complex phenomena of interaction of visible and infrared light with matter. So, such \u201cempty space\u201d (even though it\u2019s not really empty according to quantum mechanics) is actually very crowded, when you are a photon of the visible range. It is as if you are a truck pushing through a desert with all the grains of sand (size comparison, don\u2019t take the analogy overboard). The fact that some materials are opaque and some others are transparent is much more related to the materials\u2019 molecular or crystalline build up, polarity and chirality and other properties. Hence you have water or glass, which are transparent (even though they affect the light path by refraction) and you have opaque materials, like my girlfriend when she passes in front of the tv while I\u2019m watching football. Some materials are opaque in the visible range, but transparent in the InfraRed range, like a plastic bag. Others are opaque in the infrared but transparent in the visible, like some glasses. Others can even become opaque under an applied electric field, such as liquid crystals. ",
