            "answer_text": "A magnetic rod is required when constructing a compass. This can be created by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. magnetic needle is then placed on a low friction surface to allow it to freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then marked,  so that user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end. The north end is typically marked. Because of the Earth's magnetic field's inclination and intensity vary at different latitudes, compasses are often balanced during manufacture so that the dial or needle will be level, eliminating needle drag which can give inaccurate readings.

So the north pole of the pointer in compass attracts the south magnetic pole of the Earth.But w say that it is north pole of Earth.. Theory is like poles attract and unlike poles distract. ",
