            "answer_text": "This patent is for protecting this particular 3D projection technique (to be honest, it makes no essential difference to the very old mirage technique, so I dont understand how they can patent it.), not for holographic image/display. So far, only few research groups are able to generate real holographic image with large enough size, wide viewing angle, colours and video rate. Large size here I mean less than 100 mm in each dimension. Wide viewing angle I mean smaller than 10 degrees. Overall, holographic display is still in the lab stage, and very far away from the commercialization stage. People in this field normally say it will take another 20 years for it to come, if they are optimistic. For some pessimistic ones, it may take more than 50 years. As for many other 3D techniques, say the \"holographic image\" on stages, or any commercial product labelled with holography, they are not holographic image by scientific definition. They are at best some kind of 3D image technique, which doesn't provide all necessary 3D depth cues (which means fake 3D). There are three big difficulties in holographic display, in my opinion.1) how we provide enough optical information2) how we calculate holograms fast enough3) how to deliver the massive amount of hologram data in real timeWe are now still far away on every these three issues from the commercialization level. --Putting hologram onto the VR helmet seems to be a more doable approach to achieve holographic displays. Some companies are researching on this, and hopefully we will see some prototype in 5-10 years of time. By the way, HoloLens by Microsoft doesnt project holographic image (I mean the holographic image in science definition). It is still stereoscopic 3D, which may make sick if you wear it for too long.

A 3-Dimensional structure is created and can be viewed as a 2D image.Holography is the science that is associated with photographing recordings of a light rays and then displaying them in an open environment. Medical Holography is the science that is associated with creating visuals of the interiors of the body for the sole purpose of clinical analysis to cure and diagnose. Along with the interiors of the body, Medical Imaging can also provide imaging related to organs and other body systems. Holography can be used in the field of medicine; this has enabled surgeon to view patient\u2019s organs and anatomy on a 3D scale. It works by establishing a clear understandable database of normal anatomy and physiology to help us understand the abnormalities. Applications for Medical Holography include telemedicine, 3D mapping technologies and remote video conferencing to name a few.These medical holograms are widely used in hospitals, clinics, educational institutes, medical schools.

Usually this need a proper environment with ideal light condition to record the image onto a specific material. Also reproduce need a laser bean with an identical angle as the recording environment. As you see, there is so many limitation here which always stall it to enter our daily life. The more easy 3D tech nowadays is parallax stereo ",
