            "answer_text": "We know that in gases molecular attraction is almost negligible (don't assume it zero as that of ideal gas) compared to the molecular attraction in liquids. So, it is very clear that the molecules in gas does have more degree of freedom than liquids ie; they can move easily anywhere with higher velocities. So,it is clear that gases will consume more volume than the liquids when it kept in a system. Condenser is mainly used to convert the low preassure steam at the end of the turbine to liquid so that the process is continued . As the preassure in the last phase of turbine(1.High preassure turbine,2.Intermediate preassure turbine,3.low preassure turbine) is very low so the preassure in the condenser must be lower than that so that the low preassure steam can flow to condenser and get liquified. Now how is vacuum created? Specific volume of water is much lower than the steam.Hence when the condensing process happens, volume of steam reduces and basic vacuum is created. Simply as liquids takes up less volume than gases whenever a steam is liquified..there is a huge preassure drop as the drastic decrease in volume of liquids. The volume change takes place in the multiples of thousand at a certain preassure from the original volume of the gas. Let us explain , At 0.1 bar preassure the decrease in volume is 14500 times than the previous volume of gas. Why vacuum is created?To improve LPT cylinder efficiency & thus the load/work done shall be improved. Effect of over vacuum?It causes sub-cooling effect where hot well temperature reduces more than design which required to be added in boiler leads to heat loss. Also flow accelerated erosion in LPT last stages. Effect of under vacuum?LPT efficiency reduction which causes lesser work done & leads to reduced load output. ",
