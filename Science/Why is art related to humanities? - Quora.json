            "answer_text": "Art is the only proof that men exist. Thesis: Only a man can make or decide what a poem is. Proof: A machine cannot translate or decode a metered poem. (Take any METERED poem in a foreign language ..and ask a machine to translate into English..you get jibberish\u2026.or something ridiculous.) Therefore (if you are connecting the dots)\u2026 Poetry is the only proof that man exists. How is that for relating Art to humanities? Only a human knows what a poem means. A machine cant translate a poem. Therefore poetry is the primary human singularity. (what not a single up-vote? Who else is giving you this insight\u2026man!) ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that art is related to humanities because many artists use some type of art form to express how they\u2019re feeling about the world around them. Whether it\u2019s music, painting, poetry or writing, \u201cart\u201d allows an artist an opportunity to depict how they feel. Many artists are observers and can be intuitive. They often want to inspire others. ",
