            "answer_text": "'Quantum tunneling' describes the fact that particles can behave both as particles and waves where quantum mechanics replaces classical mechanics. According to quantum mechanics, light can behave simultaneously as a particle or a wave. So, if a wave equation describes the behavior of photons, it should also describe the behavior of other microscopic particles. In 1924, Luis deBroglie (1892-1987) proposed that a wave function is associated with all particles. Wherever a wave function has an amplitude, we are likely to find the particle. The wave function for a material particle is known as a matter wave. Such a 'dual nature' of the electron is known as the Wave-Particle Duality; tunneling occurs when electrons move through a barrier. In classical terms, electrons will not 'move over' a barrier if they do not have enough energy to do so. However, in the quantum mechanical world, since electrons have wavelike properties, they do not stop at a barrier; if the barrier is thin enough, there is a probability of some electrons managing to get to the other side of the barrier. The probability may be 'small' - but if there are sufficient number of particles, some will certainly move through and appear on the other side. When electrons move through the barrier, it is known as tunneling. The number of electrons that will actually tunnel through depends on the thickness of the barrier. Further reading: Quantum Tunneling The implications are many. For instance, scientists are looking at the possibility of building compact fusion reactors to serve the world\u2019s ever-growing energy needs. Apparently, the key element of understanding fusion is quantum tunneling. You see, nuclei have a positive electric charge, and since like charges repel, there is an energy 'barrier' to be overcome for fusion to occur. Quantum tunneling is one way of overcoming the barrier. https://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/compact-fusion.html New research has revealed that chemical reactions previously thought to be \u2018impossible\u2019 in the ultra cold vacuum of space can actually occur due to quantum tunneling. This is a discovery that could change scientists' understanding of how alcohols are formed and destroyed in space. This could also mean that exoplanets considered too cold for life to form, may have a shortcut for biochemical reactions, thanks to quantum tunnelling. Quantum Tunneling Allows \"Impossible\" Chemical Reactions to Occur in Space The best known technical application of quantum tunneling is the 'flash memory' in USB flash drives and solid state drives that we all are familiar with.

            "answer_text": "Quantum tunnelling or tunneling is the quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle tunnels through a barrier that it classically could not surmount. One important implications of quantum tunneling : Quantum tunneling is projected to create physical limits to how small transistors can get, due to electrons being able to tunnel past them if they (transistor) are too small.
