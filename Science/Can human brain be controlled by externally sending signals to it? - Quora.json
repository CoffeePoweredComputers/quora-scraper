            "answer_text": "Developed in the early 2000s, optogenetics\u2014the combined use of genetic and optical (light) methods to control genes and neurons\u2014is among the most rapidly advancing technologies in neuroscience and has the potential to revolutionize how scientists study the brain. With precisely timed pulses of light aimed at targeted tissue regions or cells, optogenetics allows researchers to trigger or block events in specific cells of living animals. In a mouse with a paw made hypersensitive to touch, for instance, the pain response can be eliminated by shining yellow light on the affected paw, cells in which have been targeted to express a type of light-sensitive microbial protein known as opsin. The first human trial involving optogenetics began in 2016 and was designed to explore the potential use of the technology to treat patients affected by the hereditary eye disease retinitis pigmentosa. Progressive degeneration of the retina, the hallmark of the disease, eventually causes severe impairment of vision. As many as 15 patients who were blind or mostly blind were expected to participate in the trial, and each was to receive an injection of viruses transporting opsin-encoding genes targeted specifically to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). A major goal of the test was to establish light sensitivity in RGCs, which usually are unaffected by retinitis pigmentosa and normally relay visual information from photoreceptors in the eye to the brain. In the presence of blue light, RGCs that expressed the opsin would fire, sending visual signals to the brain.  Although the extent to which the optogenetics treatment would improve vision was uncertain, findings from the study were highly anticipated. Other optogenetics therapies were under development for a wide range of diseases, including chronic pain and Parkinson disease, and whether the technology would work in humans was unknown. ",

            "answer_text": "Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 30th: Using ideas to control the lamp, drone, and even mouse movements, it is possible to judge whether a person's attention is focused without a visual inspection. If a patient moves his head, he can rely on the machine to stand again. Scenes that have only appeared in sci-fi films have now become a reality. In the United States, Musk founded the brain-computer interaction company; Zuckerberg set up a project team to research high-speed typing ideas; a few days ago, scientists from different countries at the American Academy of Neuroscience show the use of brain implant equipment to control the initial abnormalities in the mood Human test results. In addition to these international scientific explorations, in China last year, astronauts Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong carried out a space experiment controlled by ideas on the Tiangong 2; on November 9th, HKUST released the results of the idea control home... Is \"mind control\" scientific or super power? What is its scientific basis? In the ultimate brain-computer interaction, will the human brain be controlled by machines? Does the idea of \u200b\u200binformation cracking lead to the risk of some people controlling other people's brains? The basic principle of brain-computer interaction is the analysis of brain waves As early as the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a young boy wearing a \"mechanical skeleton armor\" made the first goal through his mind. Until now, the technology of idea control objects or experimental animals has become more and more mature. How does \"mind control\" be achieved? The name of this technology is called brain-computer interaction. Professor Wang Shouyan, director of the Institute of Brain-based Intelligence Science and Technology at Fudan University, said that \"brain\" refers to the brain or nervous system of living organisms, and \"machine\" refers to equipment for information processing or calculation, which can be expressed as a mechanical arm with an electric circuit. Vehicle models and drones can also be mice with inserted electrodes and people with implanted pacemakers. Brain-computer interaction connects the human brain with external devices and ultimately helps people interact with themselves and their surroundings. \"The human brain is charged. We see the sun, we hear birds, and we smell flowers. These feelings need to be felt by the brain. They must first be converted into electrical signals. Then the electrical signals are transmitted along the long nerve fibers to the brain. The brain Re-generate brainwave instructions and give instructions for movement,\u201d Wang Shouyan said. The basic principle of brain-computer interaction is the analysis of brain waves. Wang Liping, director of the Institute of Brain Cognition and Brain Diseases, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, introduced the following steps: First, the electrodes were implanted into the skull through craniotomy, or brain waves were collected on the head. Second, the complex waveforms of brain waves are converted into data, and then noise reduction and analysis are performed. Third, encode the parsed information and issue action instructions. Fourth, the externally perceived information is fed back to the brain through a stimulating device. University of Electronic Science and Technology Chengdu Institute of Brain Sciences Dean, academician of the American Medical and Biological Engineering Academy Professor Jun Dezhong introduced that the first step of brain-computer interaction is the collection of brain waves; the second step of EEG interpretation is currently the technology of domestic and foreign companies and research institutes. The key to competition; the third step of information coding is the focus of brain-computer interaction, and also the frontier of scientific research; the fourth step is to feed back the results to the signals that the brain can read. Science fiction shines into the real brain machine applications: medical, education, transportation At present, brain-computer interaction technology has been applied in many fields such as medical care, education, and transportation. - Medical care. At Shanghai Huashan Hospital, when patients with Parkinson's disease develop drug resistance, doctors will recommend special treatment based on brain-computer interaction technology. The craniotomy inserts the electrode, the electrode sends out the electric pulse, may adjust or correct the abnormal neural activity in the specific brain area, relieves the patient the tremor, the action delays, the balance force difference and so on the symptom. Wang Shouyan said that the current technology is more effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and the clinical improvement of Alzheimer's disease, depression, autism, and other brain diseases, the effect is not satisfactory. Brain-computer interaction technology can also be used to help treat patients with degenerative symptoms such as degenerative fever and paralysis. This year, the \"One Mind, That's Up\" smart wheelchair debuted in the Tencent Innovation Contest. One of the developers of intelligent wheelchairs and the student of Malan Shu of Tianjin University of Technology introduced that disabled people with normal brain function and elderly people with limited mobility need only to sit in a wheelchair. The direction and speed of the wheelchair can be changed based on brain electricity and electro-oculogram signals. --education. BrainCo, which won the Best Consumer Product Award at the International Consumer Electronics Show, developed a brain-computer interaction headband. Students take a ring in the classroom and the teacher can monitor students' attention in real time. \"Compared with other brain activities, the concentration of attention on EEG is more obvious and can be grasped through EEG monitoring.\" Founder Han Bizhen introduced that at present, some schools in Beijing and Wuhan have already tried this product. --traffic. At the just-concluded Shenzhen Hi-tech Fair, Shanghai Teiyi Technology Co., Ltd. displayed a special helmet for train drivers to wear, built-in bio-electrodes and signal processing modules to collect and process driver's brain signals in real time. Sun Hu, head of the company, said that by monitoring and analyzing the driver\u2019s EEG signals, the drivers\u2019 fatigue status and health status can be identified and alerted at the first time to ensure driving safety. The product has been applied to the high-speed train driver's value protection in the Hefei and other locomotive sections under the Shanghai Railway Bureau. Can the human brain be controlled? Since the brainwaves can be interpreted, will \"reading mind\" and \"transmitting ideas\" come true? In the future, can someone or a machine control our brain? Experts believe that \"mind control\" based on brain-computer interaction technology has a scientific basis, but it is still in the primary stage of research and development. \u201cYou can learn a new language every day by putting on a ring; implanting a chip can read information from the brain and even delete memory. This cannot be achieved because humans have not really cracked brain waves.\u201d Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University Professor Gao Xiaoyu said. Zhang Jianmin, director of the Brain Center at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, said that the human brain has 100 billion neurons and 1,000 billion \"matching\" glial cells. How many nerve cells are involved in the high-level functions of the human brain, such as thinking, emotion, and memory, and how many neural circuits participate in them, scientists currently know very little. Even so, the ever-evolving brain-computer interaction technology has encountered an ethical controversy that cannot be avoided. Experts such as Wang Shouyan and Gao Xiaoji believe that in the management and control of brain-computer interaction technology, we can refer to international practices and manage medical device methods in the early stages of development. At the same time, it is forbidden to transfer brain-computer interaction data to the Internet and to prohibit remote program control. Start up means to maximize the prevention of hacking and prevent potential risks. In addition, government departments should step up research on the impact of the technology on society, culture, and law, and conduct reasonable guidance and regulation.

            "answer_text": "This is a multi-bottommed question. In fact our brain responds to a multitude of signals that reach it through our senses. So yes, these signals can modify brain activity, evoke responses and be coupled to emotions and previous experiences. I suspect, however, that the question has another purpose. There are indeed a number of techniques, grouped under the umbrella of neuromodulation techniques that can alter brain function. These are usually dependent upon the delivery of electrical current or magnetic pulses to the brain in a more or less focussed way. These interfere with the normal activity and hence alter brain function, be it by inhibition or excitation of tissue. This may result in behavioural alterations, temporary loss of functions, etc. rTMS or TCDS are the most frequently used techniques, and they have entered neuroscience and to a certain extent the clinic (e.g. for the treatment of depression). More recently experiments with ultrasound have been introduced as an alternative. ",
