            "answer_text": "Yes! With a few impurities, of course. But only in the sense that the computer chip in your smartphone is just a piece of silicon. With a few impurities, of course. Both are surprisingly pure single crystals of single substances, and both of those substances have any number of rather remarkable properties. But also in both cases, it's the incredibly detailed structure of the crystals that is where the real story is.  For computer chips, that incredibly detailed structure is mostly computer-made, with help from a few clever humans who let the computers know what is needed. For snowflakes the structure is also amazingly detailed, but also (and unlike computer chips), beautifully symmetric in a six-fold fashion. The design method here is also extremely detailed, but in sharp contrast to computer chips, it is new and pretty much unique for every single snowflake, even in a typical storm with quintillions of snowflakes. So how does a snowstorm manage to create a unique and somehow symmetric design for each and every one of its snowflakes, something that no team of computers and humans could ever do for computer chips? The answer is chaos\u2026 but chaos that smooths out just before it reaches the size scale of snowflakes. A thunderstorm is a maelstrom of winds, pressures, temperatures, and humidity. All of these factors affect the speed and directions in which ice faces develop once a crystal begins to grow from some speck of seed dust, and all of these factors are interacting and changing at great speeds, often at millisecond time scales. Yet at the minute size scale of snowflakes, all of this chaos smooths out enough to give a sequence of remarkably uniform microenvironments in which ice is added almost identically across all six edges of the snowflake. It is this smoothness-at-the-bottom that is the source of the remarkable symmetry of snowflakes. The \u201cprogram\u201d for the design of any one snowflake, then, is the sequence of these microenvironments that the snowflake encounters as it grows, including the duration and transitions between them. So the bottom line again is yes, a snowflake is just ice. But it is also a testimony to the remarkable complexity and beauty that can emerge from a few relatively simple options, especially when those options are combined with a healthy dose of chaos to add variety.

Ice that is solidified from liquid water does not form such crystalline structures ; ice cubes are more amorphous than crystalline. If you smash up an ice cube, you will get a \u201cpiece of ice\u201d the same sizes as snowflakes, but never having their crystalline structure or physical properties. ",
