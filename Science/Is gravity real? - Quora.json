            "answer_text": "Instead of directly answering the question, I propose the following experiment. Do you have an expensive smartphone? Or some eggs? A pricey antique vase? Or maybe you are the proud new parent of a baby? Let me borrow your phone, eggs, vase, or baby. I am going to stand on the hard concrete sidewalk, hold one arm outstretched horizontally, and hold your object in the palm of my upturned hand. Then I will turn my hand 180\u00b0, palm facing the ground. Will you be bothered if I do that? I suspect you will be disgruntled within seconds. \u201cGravity\u201d is the name for this phenomenon of things falling to the ground, of weight, of dense fluids sinking to the bottom of containers with lighter fluids resting on top. That\u2019s fine for regular human activities on the surface of Earth. When we fall freely, such as in a broken elevator, sky-diving, or riding NASA\u2019s \u201cvomit comet\u201d airplane, gravity effectively disappears. Does that mean gravity isn\u2019t real? No, just that gravity as we know it in everyday life, and motion, are entangled in some way that took the brightest scientists of the late 19th Century and early 20th, including Ernst Mach, Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s and Albert Einstein, to figure out. Even in free fall, there is a reality to gravity which is subtle but fundamental. Imagine falling in an elevator from way up high. (BTW, never buy your elevator cables from Cheapco Ropes Inc.) You have two marbles, which you hold in mid-air, one in each outstretched hand, like I held your antique vase. Let go. The marbles just hover in mid-air, no different from what you see astronauts do on the space station. Except - each marble is heading toward the center of the Earth, moving on radial lines to that center. They move toward each other. If you\u2019re falling from 3,953.2 miles from the center of the Earth, to its surface at 3,963.2 miles (at the equator; of course being wealthy scientists we do our work on tropical islands) - the motion of the marbles toward each other is slight.  If you put the marbles vertically, one near the bottom of the elevator and the other near the top, they\u2019ll move apart slightly. Earth\u2019s gravity is stronger closer to its center, so the lower marble falls a tiny bit faster. The top marble is pulled slight less. The elevator is pulled at an acceleration averaging between that at the top and at the bottom. If your elevator was made out of whipped cream instead of iron, it would stretch out vertically.  (photo credit: NASA Goddard, Arizona State Univ.) Careful measurement of the moving-toward acceleration of horizontally separated marbles, or the moving-together acceleration of the vertically separated marbles, is a direct measure of the Riemann Tensor. Since the publication of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity decades ago, the Riemann Tensor has been interpreted as a measure of curved space-time. Mostly, for practical situations Humans get themselves into, it\u2019s mostly a matter of nonuniform time flow, and less a matter of curved space. Whether falling near Earth, or stationary, or in orbit, or whooshing upward in a rocket, this moving-together along one or more directions, and moving-apart perpendicularly, is irreducible, always present, always real. It is the most real form of gravity known in physics. It is this effect that Einstein\u2019s field equation [math]G_{\\alpha\\beta}=8\\pi T_{\\alpha\\beta}[/math] deals with - aside from some mathematical details - the G is a measure of curvature of space-time, and T indicates where there\u2019s mass/energy/pressure/momentum. If we compare to electromagnetism, we see T as being like charge, and G a field which falls off with distance. [math]G[/math] actually falls off as [math]r^{-3}[/math]. It\u2019s related to the gradient of the \u201cconnection coefficients\u201d [math]\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma}[/math] which describe influences of curvature on paths of moving objects. On Earth, this may be identified as gravitational acceleration, the good ol\u2019 lower case [math]g=9.8 m/s^2[/math] familiar from basic first year physics. It falls off as [math]1/r^2[/math]. Along the path of an object moving freely, with no rockets engines or wind resistance or anything, the [math]\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma}[/math] can be set to zero. But only right there along that object\u2019s space-time path. They won\u2019t be zero nearby. This is the mathematical way of describing the moving-together or moving-apart of the two marbles. How the connection coefficients vary over distance, their gradient, is the curvature of space-time, quantified by the Riemann Tensor [math]R^\\alpha_{\\beta\\gamma\\delta}[/math] or Einstein Tensor [math]G_{\\alpha\\beta}[/math]. The [math]\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma}[/math] are in turn a sort of gradient of the metric, [math]g_{\\alpha\\beta}[/math], for which the time-time component [math]g_{00}[/math] incorporates the ordinary gravitational potential, which falls off as [math]1/r[/math]. I describe this math, not to show off fancy math, but to make a point: even though \u201cgravity,\u201d as we mean it in every day life, identifiable as the [math]\\Gamma[/math], can be made to disappear just by falling or going into orbit, there\u2019s still something real which persists, which is the changing of [math]\\Gamma[/math] from place to place, identifiable with the Riemann and Einstein tensors, which you cannot make zero except by being far, far, far away from any form of energy, matter or momentum. The curvature of space-time is real, as real as the oceans\u2019 tides following the Moon, and is widely accepted by almost all physicists. (There are always a few hold-outs, weirdos, and geniuses trying other ideas.) Many experiments have matched the predictions of theory, while alternative theories assuming flat space always lead to mismatches with experiment. Some experiments which have verified Einstein\u2019s curved space-time: Eddington\u2019s observation of star positions near the Sun during an eclipseDrift in Mercury\u2019s eccentric orbitComparison of atomic clocks sitting on the ground vs. flying around in a jet plane or rocket. Look up \u201cGravity Probe A\u201d.Direct measurement of the Shapiro delay using Cassini\u2019s transmitter during its cruise to Saturn.Gravity Probe B, with a precision gyroscope using the \u201croundest object ever made\u201d measured the minuscule shortage of circumference with decreasing radius away from Earth\u2019s center, and the \u201cframe dragging\u201d due to Earth\u2019s spin. ReferenceReal scientists have made these measurements, argued about the details, double-checked their calibrations, and repeatedly come up with consistency with Einsteinian space-time curvature. So is gravity real? ",

            "answer_text": "LIGO--wasting billions of taxpayers money March 21, 2016t New science by Jim Ryan With more billions coming to be spent on LIGO, Science never even bothered to sit down and think it out before they threw away these billions upon billions of dollars. Number one, the earth puts off gravitational waves and it will be putting off the strongest gravitational waves in this area. Do you think the physical gravitational waves of celestial bodies billions of light-years away will be stronger than the physical gravitational waves of the earth? Can a physical gravitational wave pass through another physical gravitational wave, as light waves do? Gravitational waves from my perspective must be a physical force. To that end, every celestial body produces those waves. Remember, science claims that Einstein was correct in his claims that mass alone creates gravity and that gravity is an attractant force. Now science is claiming that LIGO is correct, leaving science at odds with itself. Because science projects gravity waves in an outward fashion, and it is a physical force, the earths gravitational waves will always be stronger than any other gravitational waves coming in from billions of light-years away, meaning, from my perspective, those waves will not reach LIGO. Number two, gravitational waves are created by gravity and gravity is a physical force. Science claims that gravitational waves can travel at the speed of light and yet, nothing in the universe can prove that gravity can create anything other than a physical force. No physical force has ever been proven to travel at the speed of light. By the way, the scientists of the world have claimed that according to Einstein, gravity is in essence, a stagnant force, created by mass alone. Now think about what science is claiming About gravity waves. Science is claiming that gravity waves are being created in a manner that forces the gravity wave, away from each celestial body, in order to travel through the universe. That means that gravity is not only an attractive force but it also is a repellent force. I claim or have claimed for a long time now, that gravity can only be created through the spinning motion of the mass as well as the revolving motion of the mass. All of my work is backed up with cause and effect Cause and effect are also known as empirical evidence. ",

            "answer_text": "Regardless of what you want to call it, there is a measurable force (prehaps not a force in the classic physics sense) that pulls or attracts us to the earth. The best way I've seen of demonstrating this I think I read elsewhere on Quora;it goes something like this: Take a set of scales (simple kitchen scales work ok). To get a reading on the scale you much compress a spring, to compress it you need to force it down. For example using your hand (which may only weigh a kilo or so) you can apply a force and have the scale read 10 or 20 kg. With a good grip you can maybe get 100kg! So this demonstrates that a force is required to compress the spring and get a reading from the scale. Now ask yourself where the force comes from when you place an object on the scale?There is a force acting on everything to attract us toward the centre of the earth, whether or not you call it gravity or something else is up to you.",

            "answer_text": "Gravity is indeed real. It is a binding force , not a force of attraction. It has a very long range , even though it keeps on decreasing as one moves away from the source of the force of gravity. Gravity and gravitational laws are best described by the great genius Isaac Newton. Gravity can not be described as space-time warping or distortion . Gravity is miss understood by many. It is the force of gravity that starts the stars in the galaxy. Planets, galaxies exist because of gravity. Space-time warping or distortion can not ignite nuclear fusion in the belly of stars. We all feel the force of gravity when we walk on the Earth, climb hills or lift bodies with mass. Our weight on Earth is due to the force of gravity, not due to space-time warping or distortion. We can harvest the force of gravity to generate electricity when we build dams to gather water and then allowing water to run down to run turbines. NASA uses the force of gravity to send space probe to visit distant planets (gravitational sling shot). The force of gravity is very real. ",

An operating program used to run Apple products is not the same language as that which is used to run Microsoft, and yet they both work. If we could learn to understand a different language that governs a completely different set of laws, we would then realize that gravity is not absolute and can be manipulated or even cancelled all together.
