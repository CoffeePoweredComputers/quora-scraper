            "answer_text": "As many have already said, you can improve your scientific writing skills by reading, analyzing, and practicing scientific writing. Here are some concrete steps you can follow. 1. Read every day. Choose a few inspirational publications and read them on a regular basis. Forming a habitual routine to read will not only introduce you to new and exciting research and discoveries but will also foster familiarity with the way your favorite writers write. When we read, we learn new terminology, various structural elements, and begin to notice various writing components that are commonly used in the genres we are being exposed to. The more you are exposed to a specific style of writing, the more well versed you will become in the elements that create effective pieces in that genre. 2. Research and dissect popular science writing. Analyze the scientific articles you read. Identify the elements that aided in the development of the concept, and take note of what phrasing and structures are conventional in the field. Next, consider how you could improve upon the delivery of a finding\u2014perhaps there is a new idea or perspective you can contribute to the topic. It takes time and hard work to become an affluent writer in any field. 3. Write every day. We did not begin writing coherent, 12-page essays as toddlers. It takes many years of practice to become a good writer. Practice makes perfect, so create a writing schedule and make sure that you follow it. This includes practicing the arts of editing and proofreading. Revisiting a document with fresh eyes allows you to take note of the areas of your text that require improvement. This way, you can discover which areas of writing are not your strongest and focus on improving these areas. As you read, analyze, and practice writing more and more, you will be able to create your own writing style and become fluent in the linguistic nuances of scientific writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Write and then write again and then write some more. You may take all the writing courses you can and get as much advice as possible, however in the end, the only effective way to improve writing is to do lots of it. And it\u2019s very likely that in the beginning you won\u2019t be good at it. My very first article came back all red, which was quite discouraging, but it got better the more I wrote. Here are some practical tips: - Get a good template. For this, look into the journals that you\u2019re aiming to publish in for some articles in your field or that you find well written. Then use their structure and language forms for your own writing. Start by creating a backbone from one of the selected articles (e.g. introduction, results, discussion, etc\u2026) and then populate it with your text. Then, look for the words that they use to start paragraphs, emphasize ideas and describe the results. With practice, this sort of language will come out of you automatically, but if you\u2019re not there yet, this is a way to get the inspiration. For example, I had a list of connector words and phrases to sprinkle into my text for a better flow. - Learn from the feedback. When your text comes back red, don\u2019t just cringe and accept all changes. Instead, go through the edits and look for their reason. If necessary, ask for clarification. Was it the choice of language, incomplete descriptions or was the flow missing? Often, we repeatedly make the same mistakes. - Read lots of scientific literature. The best way to get used to the scientific lingo is to expose yourself to it. And I don\u2019t mean getting fanatic and putting articles on your bedside table, but at least several articles per week consistently should be the minimum. And if you\u2019re doing a PhD, you should be reading as much or more anyway. ",

Second: (there\u2019s a \u201cthird\u201d below!) If you type into Google \u201chow to write a science paper\u201d you\u2019ll get to a lot of websites with advice and guidance. Here\u2019s one HOW TO WRITE A SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE and some more that look ok to me: Writing@CSU How to Write a Scientific Paper Different fields of science have somewhat different guidelines, and you should try and find one that is directly relevant to your field. Engineering is different than chemistry or physics in style. This website is for biology for instance: Scientific Writing Made Easy: A Step\u2010by\u2010Step Guide to Undergraduate Writing in the Biological Sciences Third: You should look at other science papers in the area you\u2019re working on, and try and figure out what the authors did. Can you isolate the different sections (introduction, methods, etc.)? How long is their introduction? How much detail do they go into? Fourth: Writing anything is about trying to get other people to understand what you want to say. First you yourself need a clear understanding of exactly what you\u2019re trying to say. I find it helpful to write down an outline first, and then fill it in - not necessarily worrying about the style at first, but just clarifying exactly what I want to get across in each section. ",

As a member of my city association of teachers of English I listened to a talk on this from a lady, I think, working in an academic writing center of Columbia University. She said the student body of the college was international, coming from a a variety of countries with different discourse traditions absorbed unconsciously and interfering with what is deemed good by American professors. While teachers of various subjects wanted to see a hypothesis/statement, then its analysis in something like a straightforward numbered list of paragraphs and a conclusion at the end, what they sometimes saw was going in logical circles, spirals, branched digressions etc in even very able students who just didn\u2019t see any difference between their and standard logic. So professors referred these students to the college-wide academic writing center, and after classes in it the quality of wiring improved. ",

Also, the more you write, as someone else has pointed out, the better you get at it. Revision, much as I hate that word, is also a good thing. And with scientific/mathematical writing, as with fiction, set it aside for a couple of days when you finish the article/paper and then read it with fresh eyes. Read it aloud. If you can\u2019t read it out loud as though you were presenting it to an audience of your peers, comfortably, then revise until you can. Hope this rambling helps and best of luck with your writing.

It can be anything. Then build on it. That way, you\u2019re training your mind to produce work every time you sit with the computer. Writing is like any skill. You have to put in the time but it will come. You\u2019ll get into the flow and it will be much easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Kenneth, assuming you mean popular portrayal of esoteric or complex concepts, the biggest complaint I hear and have is writing that fails to adequately qualify a study or \u201cbreakthrough\u201d. It's a tough wire to walk, but too often popular science fails to explain the limitations of a study. I realize to sell the reader or an editor you have to make it sound relevant, but it\u2019s easy to over do implications that are highly speculative but decades out of reach for the average person. This is especially relevant to medical breakthroughs. I hate it when I hear about a breakthrough in diabetes or cognitive enhancement to find in the final paragraph it's a mouse study! Over-simplification of Quantum physics or metaphors that extend the implications too far are also misleading. That is not to criticize metaphors, as this device is often the only way an abstract concept can be communicated and visualized. The quality of a study is not sufficiently taken into account; or a study is hyped but then fails to be replicated. Remember cold fusion? S [ follow-up. Statistics also need better explanation, since that is usually how the significance of a study is determined. But I find stats without parallel in the everyday world. Read the best working in this specialty. ",
