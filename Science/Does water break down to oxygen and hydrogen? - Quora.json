            "answer_text": "Yes, but the hydrogen and oxygen are pretty tightly bonded together, so it takes quite a bit of energy to break them apart. This can happen when you superheat the water (apparently, this can be an issue when trying to put out excessively hot fires). It also happens through a number of chemical and physical processes, though they're not very common in nature. But, having mastered electricity, humans can easily split the two by simply applying an electric current. This is known as electrolysis of water, and it's so simple that it's routine used as a demonstration in high school science classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Yup, they do.When water is electrolyzed ( electricity passed through) it dissociates into molecular hydrogen(H2) and molecular oxygen (O2) . Apart from electrolysis , hydrogen and oxygen can be extracted through water by various chemical reactions.It is know that water is not used in extinguishing fires which originate or have electricity near them.It is so because electricity decomposes water, which was originally meant to extinguish the fire, which results in liberation of hydrogen and oxygen gas . Hydrogen gas is very explosive in nature and oxygen sports combustion, thus agitating the fire even more . For these type of fires foam type for extinguishers are used. ",

            "answer_text": "Photolysis produces oxygen gas (O2) and hydrogen ions (H+) to generate electrons (e-) for light excitation as part of the light-dependent reactions in photosynthesis. H2O \u2192 2e- + 2H+ + 1/2 O2 Photolysis during photosynthesis occurs in a series of light-driven oxidation events. The energized electron (exciton) of P680 is captured by a primary electron acceptor of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and thus exits photosystem II. In order to repeat the reaction, the electron in the reaction center needs to be replenished. This occurs by oxidation of water in the case of oxygenic photosynthesis. The electron-deficient reaction center of photosystem II (P680*) is the strongest biological oxidizing agent yet discovered, which allows it to break apart molecules as stable as water. [1] Maybe not exactly what you were looking for, as hydrogen ions (H+) are merely protons and not hydrogen (H2). But I thought I\u2019d add it in nonetheless. ",
