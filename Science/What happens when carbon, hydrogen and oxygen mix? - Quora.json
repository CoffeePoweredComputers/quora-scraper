            "answer_text": "Mix? Nothing, Oxygen and Hydrogen are completely mixable gases, and essentially nonreactive at room temperature, while Carbon is a solid. If you used equal masses, you then heat them and subject them to an electrical spark, things could get interesting, as in BOOOOM. If the Carbon is a solid block, the combustion product would be water. If the Carbon was finely divided dust, the combustion products would be water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, with trace amount of other things possible. ",

            "answer_text": "C, H and O are ideally, the constituents of a carbohydrate, Cm(H2O)n. Theoretically, it is thermodynamically possible to create a carbohydrate. For example: 2C + 2H2(g) + O2(g) = C2H4O2 T < 118C Change in Free Energy: \u0394G(100C) = -374.7kJ (negative, so the reaction runs) Change in Enthalpy: \u0394H(100C) = -480.2kJ (negative, so the reaction is exothermic) If my colleague Jim Griepenburg (Ph.D. in Chemistry) is reading this, I hope he comments. He is a source of knowledge in matters chemical. ",
