            "answer_text": "Couterintuitively, yes, it\u2019s actually true - at least up to (down to?) a certain point. If you think about it, at the center of the earth, there\u2019s zero gravity - there has to be, because there\u2019s the same amount of matter in every direction, so you don\u2019t get pulled in any particular direction. So you\u2019d think that gravity would smoothly decline as you dig deeper and deeper, going from 1.0 at the surface to 0.0 at the center. And it would, if the earth were of a consistent density. But it\u2019s not - the center parts of the earth are composed of metals, which are much denser than rocks. In fact, that\u2019s WHY they\u2019re at the center: they\u2019re denser, so they sink to the \u201cbottom\u201d (center). So as you descend, two different things are happening: You\u2019re getting underneath the outer layers of the earth, which will reduce the pull of gravityYou\u2019re getting closer to the really dense stuff, which will increase the pull of gravity.Initially, the second effect dominates, and the pull of gravity goes up slightly (blue \u201cspike\u201d at ~3.5 below). But eventually, the first effect overwhelms the second, and the pull of gravity starts to decline again - reaching zero at the center, just as you\u2019d expect.  ",

There comes a point where the net force of Gravity will start going down the deeper you go. Of course this is a depth at which no human could hope to survive - air pressure would be so high the oxygen content of air would become corrosive to your lungs and the heat would literally roast your flesh.
