            "answer_text": "Quite nice actually. But first a point of clarification, Australia has 10 deserts not just one, and not all of them fit with the conventional image of an arid sandy desert. But returning to the \u2018Nile-like\u2019 river (a large river flowing through largely arid country) in a way it already does. As shown by the map below, most of Australia\u2019s river systems flow to the sea (as is common), the exception being the Lake Eyre Basin. This is a vast inland catchment area that equates to 17% of Australia\u2019s land area, with coverage of 1.2 million square kilometres and which spans several states/territories including Queensland, Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales. The basin is by far the largest endorheic (doesn\u2019t flow to the sea) basin in Australia, but has the lowest annual runoff of internal drainage basins around the world. Can\u2019t have everything I s\u2019pose.  Now you might be tempted to think that any rivers, creeks, etc. in this very dry and hot part of Australia would be only very small and perennial (indeed, average annual rainfall in the basin is only 125 millimetres and the pan evaporation rate is 3.5 metres!), but collectively they can carry a large amount of water, although flows vary significantly over the year and years. As an example, here\u2019s a pic I took of just one from my camp on the mighty Cooper\u2019s Creek near Windorah (you can see it on the map) when touring with the family just a few weeks ago. Typically, like other Outback rivers, plenty of trees on the banks and further away open woodland and grassland. Beautiful. The Cooper even has pelicans! The Thomson, Diamantina and Barcoo Rivers are also quite large.  And these and the other rivers and creeks in the basin all eventually (but not always) flow into Lake Eyre below. And through four of Australia\u2019s 10 deserts on the way there! Simpsons DesertStrzelecki DesertSturt Stony DesertTirari DesertWonderful isn\u2019t it?  ",

            "answer_text": "Probably joined to New Guinea where the water would originate. The tectonics would have to be radically different, with some kind of push from Australia towards the north, so the land would be inclined from heights in the north, in the mountains of New Guinea, towards lower lands south in the southern coast of Australia. If you do not have the kind of situation you have in the African Rift Valley, it is impossible to have a river flowing through the desert, because those rivers do not appear from nothing. Actually, Australia itself shows how you cannot have rivers flowing through the desert if the desert itself has no mountains collecting water coming from the ocean. Can you name even one Australian river? I think few Australians can name the rivers on the country Well, that is because exception made of the Murray river (large river bottom right) most are highly seasonal because at the center there is a flat desert  ",

If there was a river like Nile going through it\u2019s desert/s, it would have developed a full-scale civilizations like that of Cambodia, Egypt or Indonesia and the resulting architecture, with population migrating in huge numbers across Indonesia, millennia ago, further along and not just surviving but thriving in Australia would have eventually led to civilizations like those.

The Murray flows along most of the border between Victoria and New South Wales and then turns North where it becomes the Darling forming the border between New South Wales and South Australia and into southern Queensland. There are many tributaries and creeks that \u201cflow\" from the main river system and most of them end up at Lake Eyre in South Australia. For most of the time, these rivers, creeks and even the Lake itself are bone dry. But when the floods come, the water trickles down them at first and later in greater volume, until the Lake is filled once more, when the surrounding countryside becomes a veritable garden for a for short weeks and the place teems with bird and animal life. There are even fish that bury themselves in the sand and hibernate until the water comes, when the whole place suddenly erupts with life, until the thirsty land absorbs all the water once again. ",
