            "answer_text": "Well, I can say this. I studied Civil Engineering. It is so fundamental to society that without it we would not have structures, roads, water, sewerage and just about everything that humans have constructed that touch the earth in some way. Engineering takes math, science and technology and gives it tangible form. Making it useful in concrete and observable ways everyday. I have added bold and Italics on what I think is the \u201cbest\u201d part of this quote. President Herbert Hoover had this to say about Engineering.  It is a great profession. There is the satisfaction of watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes to men. Then it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life. That is the engineer\u2019s high privilege. The great liability of the engineer compared to men of other professions is that his works are out in the open where all can see them. His acts, step by step, are in hard substance. He cannot bury his mistakes in the grave like the doctors. He cannot argue them into thin air or blame the judge like the lawyers. He cannot, like the architects, cover his failures with trees and vines. He cannot, like the politicians, screen his shortcomings by blaming his opponents and hope that the people will forget. The engineer simply cannot deny that he did it. If his works do not work, he is damned. That is the phantasmagoria that haunts his nights and dogs his days. He comes from the job at the end of the day resolved to calculate it again. He wakes in the night in a cold sweat and puts something on paper that looks silly in the morning. All day he shivers at the thought of the bugs which will inevitably appear to jolt his smooth consummation. On the other hand, unlike the doctor his is not a life among the weak. Unlike the soldier, destruction is not his purpose. Unlike the lawyer, quarrels are not his daily bread. To the engineer falls the job of clothing the bare bones of science with life, comfort and hope. No doubt as years go by people forget which engineer did it, even if they ever knew. Or some politician puts his name on it. Or they credit it to some promoter who used other people\u2019s money with which to finance it. But the engineer himself looks back at the unending stream of goodness that flows from his successes with satisfactions that few professions may know. And the verdict of his fellow professionals is all the accolade he wants. \u2013 Herbert Hoover, President and EngineerThe Profession of Engineering (from his memoirs) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s simple, really: it helps us to do things. Ever since we discovered fire and developed primitive tools, we were using science and technology. It\u2019s just that the types of tools that we\u2019re able to use get more and more complex over time. Of course, it also helps us to know things, and that\u2019s important too. But ultimately, people like scientific research to have some sort of tangible, monetary value, and so the studies that typically get funded and the technology that gets developed is almost always designed to make a profit. That\u2019s good for capitalism and innovation but could also mean that we forget about what\u2019s important to us. All in all though, we could live without science and technology, but it certainly makes our lives easier. And if not easier, if it makes life harder by adding extra complexity, it\u2019s also what makes our lives as we know it possible in the first place. ",
