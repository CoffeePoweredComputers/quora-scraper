            "answer_text": "When I was around 13 years old, I spent the night at my friends house and stayed up all night playing video games. When I got home it was Saturday; the day I always do my chores. When I got home I felt pretty tired so I asked my mom if I could sleep for just a few hours. She said yes but I better get up to do my chores. I went in bed and instantly fell asleep. When I woke up, it looked like it was morning so I checked the time and it was around 9:30. I thought it was Sunday so I got ready for church but no one was up. I woke up my parents and urgently told them that we needed to hurry and get to church. My mom told me it was Monday! I was amazed that I had slept for more than 24 hours. So my conclusion is that humans can sleep longer if you\u2019re mentally tired than if you\u2019re physically tired. ",

I just went back to Europe from Australia and I hadn't sleep for around 2 days, took intercontinental flights and stood awake on the plane. So far I have slept 22 hrs in interrupted. I only woke up to go to the bathroom. If I had something to allow me to stay in bed without the need to go to the bathroom I think I could sleep up to 30-35 hours. I woke up one hour ago, eating now and all I can think is to go back to bed to sleep. The weird thing is that I don't feel the fatigue on my body that much. The sleepiness is 90% mental. Like my brain needs sleep more than my body. ",
