            "answer_text": "The atomic number of sodium is 11. Therefore we can say that sodium has eleven protons. Since, in a neutral molecule, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, we can also deduce that sodium also has eleven electrons. So the electron configuration can be written, either in complete electron configuration (showing all the electrons), or in the condensed electronic configuration ( showing the previous noble gas followed by valence electrons only.) Na\u2192 1s2 3s2 2p6 3s1 (complete configuration) OR Na \u2192 [Ne] 3s1 (condensed configuration) Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Electron configuration of Na = 2, 8, 1 This is so because electron configuration is the arrangement of electrons on a shell. Hence, Na has 11 electrons. However, the first shell has a maximum number of 2 electrons, the second shell has a maximum number of 8 electrons. That adds up to 10, therefore, it only needs 1 more to reach 11. So the 1 extra electron would have to go on the third shell. ",
