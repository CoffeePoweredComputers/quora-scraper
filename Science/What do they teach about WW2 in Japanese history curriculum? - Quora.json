            "answer_text": "I last lived in Japan twenty years ago, but when I was there I studied the educational curriculum, read their high school history books and spoke to as many veterans as possible. While my direct knowledge is mostly about the Nagoya area, it applied fairly well to most other areas. I also visited both Hiroshima and Nagasaki alone and with groups of Americans serving as their translator.  Twenty years ago, the history books ended with the death of Emperor Taisho, who was Hirohito's father. Thus, the high school history texts did not reference world war II at all.  I surveyed my students and their knowledge of WWI was virtually non-existent, few could even identify exactly when. Contrast that with the Russo-Japanese War and many students had an opinion about the Treaty of Portsmouth which ended it.  Their knowledge of WWII was better, most had family stories about it. A missing great uncle or two, people who were repatriated years later, Korean neighbors who had suffered greatly. To me it was odd that a people without a national understanding of events that had re-shaped their nation. The elder people I met then especially at the atomic sites all spoke excellent English. They'd been children during the occupation and they loved Americans. They spoke of their children and grandchildren as disinterested in the war. They understood the war, and even thanked Americans in uniform for dropping the A-bomb; they knew it prevented massive Japanese casualties from an invasion.  A few spoke of friends and one man even mentioned the famous photo by Joe O'Donnell because one of my friends happened to have been named O'Donnell (no relation.)         What really strikes me is how just in the time I have experienced this unique nation (Japan) it has changed. When I first visited this photo was truly understood, then it would have been ignored and now, it is seen as a symbol of the cruelty of the United States. On my most recent trip, a Japanese school teacher leading her class at the Peace Dome asked (in English first, a courtesy so I had time to think of my words in Japanese) if Americans were 'sorry' for the A-bomb. I told her no and mentioned how her grandparents had known how many lives, including their own those two bombs saved. She decided I wasn't worth further questions, in English or in Japanese.  ",

            "answer_text": "I can write my experience from history class to my current ideas about wwii. My view is still being developed but you can see some Japanese perspective here. I did learn about wwii in history class in japan. (Don\u2019t get offended here because I didn\u2019t learn anything from it.) And I do remember seeing Nanking massacre photos and reading texts about rapes that japnese did in Korea and massacre in Philippines and other (sorry I don\u2019t have specific memory about this history text book. I remember those 3 countries.) Unfortunately, and this will sound more awful, I didn\u2019t feel much back then when I read about those in the class when I was 12. I didn\u2019t use my brain much back then anyway. I didn\u2019t even think I was japanese. I couldn\u2019t see myself as a part of Japanese society. I couldn\u2019t even connect myself to history. I just existed to pass some history tests. even in middle school I learned world history and there were large chunk about wwii in the text book, but my focus was girls and \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s rainbow six\u201d back then, again, wwii wasn\u2019t something I considered deeply in my little head. I probably connected myself to Jackson after watching \u201csaving private Ryan\u201d. I didn\u2019t realize this as a larger topic until I went to a college in California, and one lady from China told me, \u201cyou killed Chinese and hide the history of Nanking massacre as if it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u2026And that moment I felt wwii personally. My honest feeling was, I was offended. I told her that I did learn about Nanking, And I didn\u2019t kill anybody. And yknow what? that was a wrong answer I did. I should have told her that I should study more about it. It\u2019s like telling black lives matter protest, \u201cI\u2019m not a racist so I don\u2019t care\u201d. That\u2019s just rude yknow. later I asked the lady her name and introduced myself. I chatted together not about the war, but chatted about how shitty international student lives were. few years later I happened to watch a NHK documentary about the soldiers who massacred people in Philippines. It was on tv in japan so I just chose to watch it. It was pain to watch it. I felt personally disgusted by the massacre and the war. But I learned the perspectives of those soldiers too. it gave me many perspectives. now I am very sorry for the people who were killed and hurt. The only thing I can do is saying sorry to the people who are offended. The hope I can give is that Japanese do learn \u201cnever going to war\u201d over and over again. my views are not common in japan. I am a spoiled child who had this luxury to study abroad and met international friends who gave me perspectives. So I got to learn how \u201cjapnese\u201d I was/and I am. I\u2019m very japnese. Anyone who meet me, you will know I\u2019m definitely Japanese. And I know that. If you are Japanese lived in japan never know outside perspectives, you wouldn\u2019t know that you are Japanese. We behave very similar to each other in japan. If you don\u2019t get to have a chance to see who you are, you won\u2019t know that Japanese living in japan are all representing japan. also many people in japan don\u2019t connect themselves to Japanese culture or Japanese history. Think about it. Life sucks. I, you, everybody, life sucks so bad. If you can be something else But not yourself, you would love to be not you. That\u2019s how people disconnect from their identity.. So when someone tells you that your ancestors killed their families, you will be offended. Your life sucks and somebody is telling you you suck. I think that\u2019s what happens when Japanese people Get offended about wwii history. I bet that\u2019s the similar case to any other countries. we do learn history. We never felt it. one more thing. I took world history class in California. It was mind blowing. The teacher kept talking all the sneaky things America did after wwi and so on. And that gave perspectives to me and American students. He thought us every country got some weird negative histories and we all just need to take it neutrally. ",
