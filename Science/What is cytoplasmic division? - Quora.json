            "answer_text": "Brother the picture see you in the cell Division process, either meiosis or mitosis, you see separating chromosome. We generally say that the cell is dividing and divided into 2 or 4 daughter cells. Cell is dividing it is true. Inside cell there are two divisions that completes actually a cell division: one is 'karyokinasis' (the division of chromosomes) other is cytokinesis (the division of cytoplasm. Division of cytoplasm means sharing half of the cytoplasm by one cell and half to other cell (in mitosis as there are two daughter cell) This completes the cell division. (In Meiosis this sharing occurs between 4 daughter cells). ",
