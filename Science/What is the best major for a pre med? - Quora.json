            "answer_text": "A2A: What is the best major for a pre-med? In considering what is the \u2018best\u2019 major for a pre-med student, a number of factors need to be considered: A) Does the major fit the student\u2019s interests and talents? Music majors have a very high rate of acceptance into medical school, but if you are not a talented musician, it would be a terrible choice; you need to choose a field that you will excel at! B) What would you do with that degree if you don\u2019t get accepted into medical school? While Biology is the most popular major for pre-meds, and is the #1 undergrad degree of the majority of students at top medical medical schools, it is also the most common undergrad degree of those not accepted into medical school, and of unemployed college grads between the ages of 22 - 26, it is one of the most common undergrad degrees. Compare that to the near-zero percent unemployment rate of engineers who do not get accepted into medical school. C) How well does the major prepare you for medical school? This may be counterintuitive, but biology, chemistry, genetics, etc., really only prepare you for one course you\u2019ll take in medical school, whereas other, more broad majors provide you with skills that will prepare you for many more courses and situations. Engineering, for example, is at its most basic level, the science of problem-solving, and is extremely helpful once you reach the clinical years, as well as in understanding orthopedics, neurology, cardiology, physiology, etc., as they are physical system that follow engineering principals. D) How easy or hard is the major, and therefore the likelihood of a high GPA? This is a double-edged sword, as picking a major that leads to a high GPA for most students will not distinguish you from the other students applying, and medical school admissions committees will generally accept a lower GPA from students in more rigorous majors such as math, chemistry or engineering. The flip-side, however, is that \u2018easy\u2019 majors give you more time to do extracurricular activities and prepare for the MCAT, etc. E) What is the acceptance rate for that major into medical school? This is really a bit of a red herring, and should be the lowest consideration. Biology majors have one of the lowest acceptance rates into medical school, yet they are still the most common major at top medical schools, because there are so many biology majors that apply, so certainly if you are a stand-out, you may well rise above the wave of other biology majors and get in. On the other hand, the acceptance rate for math majors is very high, but if you aren\u2019t a math whiz, you are unlikely to make it through the math curriculum, let alone get a high enough GPA to be accepted into medical school, so there is quite a bit of self-selection in the people who major in math, physics, chemistry and engineering, which may lead to the higher acceptance rates. F) Lastly, but of very high importance, is how well will the major prepare you for life after medical school? There are a couple of components to this; how will the degree enhance your personal life, and how will the degree help your professional life? Music, Art, History and Literature majors tend to have lifelong interests in these subjects, broadening their lives beyond medicine. English majors acquire writing skills that help in pretty much any career they choose. Engineering, math, and business majors have a broad range of career options if they decide that clinical medicine is not for them. This should not be underestimated, as burnout is very high among physicians. On a slight tangent, it is also very important to remember that medical school admissions are holistic, just like undergrad admissions, and you shouldn\u2019t focus on GPA and MCAT to exclusion of enjoying college life and doing things you enjoy, without exclusive regard for bulking up your resume. My medical school class included a dozen or more NCAA Division 1 athletes, a circus clown, a couple of dance majors, a published playwright, a couple of attorneys, one of the inventors of bungee jumping, a bartender, a street-fighter, a winner of the Colorado Wild Man contest (and holder of the world record for eating live maggots), and me, a former professional gambler with no undergrad degree at the time, no MCATs, a 4.0 in engineering courses at MIT but D\u2019s in organic chemistry and biochemistry, and no biology or English courses in undergrad (but plenty of other accomplishments).

            "answer_text": "This can be viewed several ways. You know for sure you want to be a doctor. You are committed to being a doctor. You want to do well in medical school. Take the major that will maximize your GPA, or prepare you well for the MCAT and for medical school. Major in Psychology, Biology or Biochemistry. It is relatively easy to earn a high GPA in Psychology; the required courses may marginally help you on the new MCAT, but not in medical school. If you failed to get in or choose not to pursue a medical career, your options may be limited. Biology or Biochemistry, you are preparing for your MCAT by taking required courses. If you can learn the Basic Sciences before medical school, you are slightly ahead already. But remember medical school is a lot faster and more in depth than college. Courses like Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Cell Biology, Physiology, Neuroscience, Anatomy, Pharmacology in college mirror those in medical school. I was able to concentrate on other subjects, and did not have to study for Biochemistry, Genetics, Physiology etc. There were several PhD\u2019s in my class who were professors in Anatomy, Biochemistry and Physiology, They could have opted out; but decided to stay and killed the curve. [Edit: Since many schools have turned the basic sciences freshman and sophomore years into Honor/High Pass/Pass/Fail, the need to do well compared to your classmates has become less intense. However, prior knowledge may help you earn those Honor or High Pass marks. And perhaps excel on the USMLE exams). If you failed to get into medical school, your career options may be limited. You may have to go all the way and get a PhD degree. Medical students are all smart and driven with good study habits. Your specialty options depend on you GPA and USMLE scores. It is better to be well prepared so you can do well compared to your classmates, and have long term goals. From day one, if you want to eventually specialize in Dermatology, you have to start looking around for research opportunities that can get you published. A friend of mine was a former mechanical engineer with an MBA degree. He was older, had no prior exposure other than prerequisites for the MCAT. He started doing Dermatology research as a freshman, before anyone thought about a specialty. He was Junior AOA (Alpha Omega Alpha honor society. As a junior - top 5%), which is a ticket to the most competitive specialties.You are not sure about medicine and want a backup plan. You want to have a good paying job if you don\u2019t make it. Consider Pharmacy. While this may take 5 years, you will be prepared for the basic sciences. You would have a job and a good background in Pharmacy is tremendous. A doctor is only as good as the medications he/she prescribes.You are intelligent, want to have the college experience and can process new information quickly. Major in what you are interested in, which does not have to be life sciences related. You can study English, Computer Science, Engineering, Art etc. You can study Economics (taking a few courses actually would help your career as you will deal with medical economics issues. At least, learn how to invest.) The risk is too low GPA and MCAT scores take you out of the running. A lot of premeds self deselect this way. These non-traditional students may have challenges when facing basic sciences information for the first time. Some flunk out.10 Most Competitive Residency Programs in US Published on November 27, 2015 at 2:50 pm by NIKOLA POTREBI\u0106 in Lists Applying for residency and awaiting matching results is probably the most stressful part of medical student\u2019s life up to date, and we\u2019ll probably add more pressure to some of them by compiling the list of 10 most competitive residency programs in US. Residency might not be med school graduate\u2019s first true medical experience, but it\u2019s definitely a start of one\u2019s medical career. Most competitive residencies can be tough to get into \u2013 especially if candidate\u2019s GPA and USMLE scores aren\u2019t exactly strong. If med school graduates want to get a perfect match in highly sought after residency program of their choosing, they have to excel at both the USMLE and throughout their med school education.  Some residencies are more competitive than others simply because there are less available programs and open positions for them. This means that more than one med school graduate vies for a single spot in a respective residency program. This further means that most competitive residencies require better USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores. All these criteria are important when trying to establish which of medical residency programs is the most competitive, and neither of them will be neglected. In order to compile the list with such diverse inputs, however, we\u2019ve had to apply our own points to all three of the given categories (physician\u2019s average annual salary, mean USMLE tests score and a number of open positions per US senior candidate). First we have pinpointed the maximum and minimum values across all three criterions. Then, we have calculated the difference between these two points and divided it with 10 in order to get ten scoring segments. Those residencies with scores in lowest of these segments have received a single point while those ending up in highest have been assigned with the maximum 10 points. With this done for all three criterions, it\u2019s easy to figure out that point range spans between 3 and 30. More competitive residencies, naturally, have the higher overall score. Finally, if more than one residency ends up with a higher score, a number of positions per US senior is used to determine the more competitive of the two (or more). Let\u2019s see which are the 10 most competitive residency programs in US. 10. General Surgery Overall score: 18 Future general surgeons need to exhibit solid USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores which, in this instance average 238.5. They still, however, have more than a few spots open for them as an average US senior competes for 1.1 open position in trying to get the match in this residency. Finally, general surgery promises physician\u2019s mean salary of $360,933 which represents the middle ground compared to the rest of available specialties.  9. Diagnostic Radiology Overall score: 20 \u201cThe eye of medicine\u201d \u2013 diagnostic radiology is responsible for diagnosing the illness and paving the way for other medical specialties. The average salary of $404,302 is quite promising indeed, but in order to earn it, every diagnostic radiology resident will have to get a 245 USMLE Step tests average or thereabouts. Lucky for them, at least they compete for 1.29 open positions.  8. Ophthalmology Overall score: 20 Ophthalmologists might earn slightly lower average yearly salaries of $343,144 than their predecessors on this list, but they don\u2019t have plenty of maneuvering space when it comes to a number of open positions. 1.01 is the number here, and most US seniors have to really excel with their respective applications.  7. Urology Overall score: 22 Urology is still competitive, even though the results vary between the years. Average USMLE tests scores for urology are almost impossible to find, but we have managed to dig urologist\u2019s average Step 1 score from 2013 which sits at 238. Salary of $381,029 and positions per US senior score of 0.82, however, clearly pinpoint urology\u2019s high competitiveness rating.  6. Radiation Oncology Overall score: 23 A present-day radiation oncologist is closely connected with cancer treatment, even though physician in this field would only be a part of any respective cancer treatment team. Still, their overall Step score averages 244.5, and they all fight for 0.93 positions. Furthermore, their respective yearly salary of $418,288 is also quite competitive, but they first have to finish their residencies before getting the chance to actually earn it.  5. Dermatology Overall score: 24 With mean USMLE Step tests score of 251, average US dermatologist represents the most qualified residency match. Their respective salary reaches $400,989 and they compete for 0.95 open positions. Considering all this, it\u2019s no wonder why dermatology is one of the most competitive specialties on our list of 10 most competitive residency programs in the US.  4. Otolaryngology Overall score: 25 Proudly carrying the moniker of \u201cthe oldest medical specialty in the US\u201d, otolaryngology positions itself inside the top 5. Compared to some of less competitive residencies, the salary of $369,790 doesn\u2019t seem like much, but 250 average in Step 1 and Step 2 scores, together with 0.84 positions per US senior applicant clearly make this residency stand out among others.  3. Plastic Surgery Overall score: 26 Opposite of otolaryngology, plastic surgery is one of the youngest medical fields in the US. However, it has rapidly gained popularity in past couple of decades and is now considered one of the most competitive specialties. The future plastic surgeon can expect a median yearly salary of $407,709, but he/she also needs average USMLE test score results of around 248.5. Finally, Plastic surgery is the most competitive residency in terms of open positions per US applicant. 0.74 positions mean that only two out of three US seniors can expect to get a match.  2. Neurological Surgery Overall score: 27 Neurosurgeons earn the most, with their average yearly salaries soaring as high as $609,639. However, they compete for 0.93 positions which isn\u2019t the highest score; as we have seen. Their respective Step 1 and Step 2 score average of 245.5 also isn\u2019t the best, but neurological surgery still manages to be one of the most competitive residency programs, regardless.  1. Orthopedic Surgery Overall score: 28 The specialty that leads the list of 10 most competitive residency programs in US is orthopedic surgery. Orthopedics warrants the average USMLE tests score of 248, and all future residents have to know that they will compete for only 0.83 open positions. However, average annual salary of $535,668 should be enough to sway many a young med school graduates and seniors into considering this highly competitive specialty as their future vocation.   10 Least Competitive Medical Specialties in America Published on November 23, 2015 at 3:14 am by NIKOLA POTREBI\u0106 in Lists Future medical residents and specialists surely must wonder which are the most and least competitive medical specialties in America \u2013 more so because November 30th, 2015 (residency match early registration deadline) is rapidly closing in. Don\u2019t fret if you\u2019re not ready to register just yet, however. You can still register your match after this deadline for an additional fee.  Samuel Borges Photography/Shutterstock.com Every medical school graduate already knows that some specialties are more competitive than the others and most of them will try to choose their residency according to that. In order to actually match to a really competitive residency program, a future medical practitioner needs to possess a number of qualities \u2013 most importantly, high GPA and USMLE scores. Even though high GPA and USMLE scores are the main prerequisite for highly competitive specialties, they aren\u2019t the only ones, and certainly not guarantees for a match. Highly competitive specialties are often much sought for (that\u2019s why they are competitive after all), and even students with exceptional scores sometimes can\u2019t find their match in one of these fields. But, what about least competitive specialties? Some residency programs have GPA requirements as low as 2.3, as shown in this table. Medical schools with low requirements usually go by the moniker \u201csecond chance\u201d schools, and here\u2019s the list of 10 least competitive medical schools in the US. All those schools offer a variety of medical specialties to choose from. They might be the least competitive med schools, but it doesn\u2019t mean that all of their programs exhibit low competitive ratings as well. We\u2019ll use a number of factors while bringing you the list of 10 least competitive medical specialties in America. For starters, we\u2019ll start with compensation. Respective specialty\u2019s salary has a large impact on its overall competitiveness rating. We have gathered data on physician\u2019s respective salaries from here. Next we have the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 mean scores for every given specialty. This criterion is pretty much self-explanatory as least competitive residencies usually end up with lower mean scores gained by their respective student matches. Finally, most competitive residency specialties are most competitive for a reason and vice versa. A number of available residency positions per US applicants (not counting international ones) tell a story of supply and demand. Some specialties are filled almost instantly while others usually end up with plenty of open spots. Needless to say, the latter ones are less competitive and are mostly filled by independent applicants or even left unfilled to some extent. Finally, these three criteria are incompatible with one another which means that we have to assign certain points to them. Let us take a look at the salary points, for example. Overall yearly salaries for respective specialties stretch roughly from $200,000 to $600,000. That\u2019s a difference of around $400,000. We have 10 spots to assign and have divided 400,000 with the number of spots in order to get segments of $40,000. Specialties with salaries between $200,000 and $240,000 have received 10 points, those with salaries between $240,000 and $280,000, 9 points and so on. We have done the same for mean Step scores and number of positions per US applicant as well. We have also used a larger number of positions per US applicants as a tiebreaker winner (or loser in this instance). Finally, highest cumulative scores determine our 10 least competitive medical specialties in America. 10. Emergency Medicine Score: 18 Deciding for emergency medicine is outright ludicrous. Not only that you\u2019d have to put up with uncertain working hours, but you\u2019ll have a very responsible job of saving people\u2019s lives on a daily basis, and not so great compensation. Average annual salary for emergency medicine physicians (not residents) is $320,419 which doesn\u2019t look so bad compared to other specialties but isn\u2019t that high either. Step 1 score of 229 and Step 2 score of 243 average to a total of 236 which is just shy of 236.5 national average. Ultimately, there are 1.15 spots available per US applicant that decide to apply to this specialty.  9. Obstetrics and Gynecology Score: 19 Ob/Gyn and Women\u2019s Health practitioners obviously don\u2019t get enough credit since they have found their spot on our list of least competitive specialties. Their respective annual salaries which average $315,295 nationwide are also something that could improve. Still, both Step 1 and 2 scores of 226 and 242 are below national average, and so is their mean of 234, consequently. Add to that 1.24 open positions for every US applicant, and you\u2019ll see why Ob/Gyn isn\u2019t the most sought after practice among US med school graduates.  8. Anesthesiology Score: 19 Most people well versed into this field will be surprised that anesthesiology has made the list at all, even at such a low spot. Average annual salaries of anesthesiology physicians speak in favor of previous assessment \u2013 amounting to $357,116. However, residents applying to this program showcase sub-par USMLE Step test scores of 230 and 241 for Step 1 and 2 respectively. That\u2019s an average of 235.5 which is a whole point below the national average score. In the end, 1.31 open position for every US applicant also doesn\u2019t speak in anesthesiology\u2019s favor.  7. Pediatrics Score: 23 Pediatrics is rather complex when it comes to final scores. There are a few niches inside pediatrics which range from $157,394 in average annual salary for pediatric endocrinology to $303,917 for pediatric cardiology. On average, Pediatric practitioner\u2019s salary amounts to $206,961 which is right at the foot of our list. Average Step test scores for the niche are also below average with ratings of 226, 241 and 233.5 for Step 1, Step 2 and their mean value respectively. Finally, there are 1.41 spots available for every US senior attempting to get a match in one of Pediatrics\u2019 fields.  6. Neurology Score: 24 Neurology seems like a path worth taking, but things aren\u2019t that good-looking when numbers get crunched. Median annual salary of $243,105 is low compared to other specialties, and so are the test scores. Residents that find their match in neurology are averaging 235.5 on their USMLE Step tests (230 and 241), and they apply for 1.76 open positions not counting independent applicants. Neurosurgery, on the other hand, is one of the most competitive specialties, but it\u2019s a different thing altogether.  5. Internal Medicine Score: 24 Being one of the most common practices, it\u2019s no surprise that internal medicine ends up as high as it does on our list of 10 least competitive medical specialties in America. Average annual salary for internists equals $223,175, and oddly enough, it seems that they could have chosen a better path for their careers judging by the USMLE Step scores. Internal medicine residents average 237 points (231 and 243) which is above the mean figures for both categories. The number of applicants and offered positions for this specialty exceeds other residencies by far, but still, US applicants don\u2019t really have to roll up their sleeves as they all fight for 1.8 available spots.  4. Pathology Score: 24 Pathologists earn more than most other specialties that have made the list with their annual salary averaging $302,610. Mean Step scores achieved by the future pathology residents are close to national average with Step 1 amounting to 231 and Step 2 coming to 241 (average of 236). However, the fact that they apply for 1.98 open positions doesn\u2019t really go in favor of pathology as a specialty.  3. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Score: 27 PM&R is traditionally among the least sought for residencies which usually gets filled by international and other independent applicants. Average annual salary of $278,283 doesn\u2019t look that bad for such a high spot on our list, but USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores of 220 and 234 certainly do. It\u2019s an average of only 227 (almost 10 points below national average), and 1.79 positions per 1 US applicant don\u2019t really go in favor of this residency as well.  2. Psychiatry Score: 28 All of you thinking of applying for Psychiatry residency; better think again. For starters, you\u2019ll hardly be the ones to treat the Mafia boss like Tony Soprano, and you are highly unlikely to charge triple digits for a session. Average yearly salary of $227,478 is a more likely outcome, but at least you won\u2019t need high Step test scores. In fact, they are exactly 10 points below the national average of 236.5 as 220 and 233 equal to a mean value of 226.5. Add to that 1.77 open positions per US applicant and there you go.  1.Family Medicine Score: 30 This probably doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to those with some knowledge of the matter. Family medicine has always been near the bottom when it comes to residency competitiveness and it comes dead last on our list of 10 least competitive medical specialties in America. The annual salary of around $227,541 is mediocre in terms of medical average, but USMLE Step scores are even worse. Step 1 score of only 218 is particularly bad, and 234 points in Step 2 tests aren\u2019t exactly flying colors as well. Average of only 226 speaks for itself, but that\u2019s not the worst. US senior applicant rarely decides to get into family medicine residency as there are 2.13 positions open per one of them.  ",
