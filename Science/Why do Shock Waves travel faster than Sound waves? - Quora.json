            "answer_text": "As Mark Barton pointed out, shock waves in a medium may travel either faster or slower than ordinary sound waves. In shock waves the key point is that there is a discontinuity (or very close to a discontinuity) in thermodynamic properties of the medium, such as temperature, pressure and entropy across the wavefront of the shock. This distinguishes shock waves from ordinary sound waves, which are propagating waves of compression and rarefaction of the medium, in which the variation of thermodynamic quantities is continuous. A classic example of a shock wave that travels more slowly than the speed of sound is the deflagration wave that forms in a combustible medium such as gunpowder ... there is certainly a propagating flame front with a discontinuity in temperature across the front, yet the flame front moves more slowly than the speed of sound. In high explosives, such as RDX or TNT, a detonation wave occurs ... which travels faster than the speed of sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Contra Todd Gardiner's answer, it's not actually definitional of a shock wave that it travels faster than the usual speed of sound. It's normally produced by something traveling faster than sound, and it may well travel faster than sound itself, but it doesn't absolutely have to. Rather, it's just a large, sharp step-function wave (for some ill-defined value of \"large\"), so that the pressure, temperature etc in the medium change abruptly as it passes through. Now the wave velocity is [math]\\sqrt{K/\\rho}[/math] where [math]K[/math] is incompressibility (a.k.a., bulk modulus) and [math]\\rho[/math] is density. And incompressibility, especially for solids, often increases steeply and non-linearly with compression. So for large values of \"large\", where the compression is starting to get directly noticeable (cf. a sound of SPL 94 dB, which is quite loud by everyday standards but only a compression of 1 part in 100,000), the velocity may also increase significantly.
