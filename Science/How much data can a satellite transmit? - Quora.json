            "answer_text": "A satellite works by receiving radio signals sent from the earth and resending the radio signals back down to earth. Satellites are relay stations in space for the transmission of voice, video and data communications. The transmit power is based on the distance from Earth, area to be cover through the satellite, it varies as per the usage too, if the interference is a constraint then power varies a lot. It depends on the beam power, beam current. Satellites are important because they give us a birds-eye view of our planet, satellites are machines that orbit a star or a planet such as earth. Satellites provide us with radio and cable television and allow us to make phone calls from long distances. They have a very important role that they play in everything from TV broadcasting and transcontinental telephone calls to weather forecasting and the Internet. They are ideally suited to meet the global communications requirements of military, government and TV broadcasting, Internet communications, weather forecasting, commercial organizations because they provide economical, scalable and highly reliable transmission services that easily reach multiple sites over vast geographic areas. They also provide with services of navigation photography, imaging, and scientific surveying Geo stationary satellite is 36000km away from Earth. Lower earth orbit satellite is around 2000km away from Earth. Now here comes the important aspect: Data Rates/Returns The data rate direct-to-Earth varies from about 500 bits per second to 32,000 bits per second (roughly half as fast as a standard home modem). The data rate to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is selected automatically and continuously during communications and can be as high as 2 million bits per second. The data rate to the Odyssey orbiter is a selectable 128,000 or 256,000 bits per second (4-8 times faster than a home modem). An orbiter passes over the rover and is in the vicinity of the sky to communicate with the rover for about eight minutes at a time, per sol. In that time, between 100 and 250 megabits of data can be transmitted to an orbiter. That same 250 megabits would take up to 20 hours to transmit directly to Earth! The rover can only transmit direct-to-Earth for a few hours a day due to power limitations or conflicts with other planned activities, even though Earth may be in view much longer. Mars is rotating on its own axis so Mars often \"turns its back\" to Earth, taking the rover with it. The rover is turned out of the field of view of Earth and goes \"dark,\" just like nighttime on Earth when the sun goes out of the field of view of Earth at a certain location when the Earth turns its \"back\" to the sun. The orbiters can see Earth for about 2/3 of each orbit, or about 16 hours a day. They can send much more data direct-to-Earth than the rover, not only because they can see Earth longer, but also because they have a lot of power and bigger antennas than the rover.

            "answer_text": "There is no data limit in satellite data transmission but there are speed limitations that a satellite can transmit. Depending upon the height and the frequency used, speed of data transmission varies from satellite to satellite. This data is further stored and transmitted into large servers at Earth. Since raw data that is received is not usable for general public, it is processed and then only general public can use this data, ",
