            "answer_text": "Issac Newton was the greatest scientist.The main reason behind this is that he played the most important and finalising role in revolution started by Galileo and Copernicus. With Newton's theory the age of reason dawned.Using the geometrical ideas of Descartes, Newton discovered Calculus and with it a new way of doing science. With calculus one can solve problems which were impossible to solve with just elementary algebra.The idea of instantaneous quantities, which was in the mind of scientists since ages, obtained a rigorous description. Our understanding of nature evolved.With his laws of motion, Newton gave a way to determine the behavior of bodies under the influence of forces. He demonstrated that natural phenomena can be reasoned out.The most famous work of Newton was his law of gravitation. With this law he described both, the orbits of planets and falling of an apple. Hence he united terrestrial and celestial phenomena under one equation.And how we can forget his work in Optics. By developing early optical instruments and studying visible spectrum, he paved the way for further research and development.He even worked in the field of waves and thermal physics.Newton pushed every field of modern science. He was versatile. His theories are of great utility even today. His second law of dynamics (F = dp/dt) is a fundamental law of physics and is still valid.So undoubtedly, Newton was the greatest scientist. ",

            "answer_text": "Sir Isaac Newton indeed is the greatest scientist in the human era.  You see? Simply google Great Scientists and you find Newton in the second place. This is the guy who created Calculus at the same rate in which people learn it.He discovered, and more accurately, mathematically described gravity. Forget General Relativity, he is the one who had put the foundation stone.He also made significant contributions to Optics and is the Father of Classical Mechanics. He also generalized the famous Binomial Theorem.People mostly point out his mistakes, and speak of Einstein, who formulated General Relativity. Ever wondered, if Newton wouldn\u2019t have discovered Gravity, then how would Einstein even have got the Idea of Gravity and Space time curvature? He would have simply wasted some fraction of his life thinking of gravity.When Space Scientists launch Rockets, when engineers design buildings, and Inventors create motor cars and mechanical stuff, they all use Newton\u2019s Laws, not Einstein\u2019s Relativity. Newton Rocks! If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. ",
