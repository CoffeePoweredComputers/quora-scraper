            "answer_text": "If mass is increased with the same kinetic energy, then velocity decreases as long as we are talking about speeds that are substantially less than the speed of light. Kinetic energy KE=1/2mv^2, so v=(2KE/m)^-1/2, but once you get to relativistic speed with speeds close to the speed of light, then both mass and KE increase fast as we get closer and closer to light speed, and the energy may increase exponentially even further with rapid msss increase. We are referring to like at 99.99999% of the speed of light\u2026 Kaiser T, MD. ",
