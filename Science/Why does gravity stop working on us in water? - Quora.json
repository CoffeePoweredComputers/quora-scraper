            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. This is why stuff sinks. But obviously, other stuff floats. And then there\u2019s humans, who are largely water, and who sometimes sink and sometimes float. The force of gravity is always acting on you. But in fluids, there\u2019s also a force of buoyancy acting upwards. This force is related to the fact that when you\u2019re in a fluid, you\u2019re displacing part of that fluid. If your density is low, then a liter of water is going to be heavier than a liter of you \u2014 well, any unit of volume, I\u2019m just using liter for convenience. You\u2019re too light to displace the water. But something like a chunk of metal is more dense than water, so it does displace it, and promptly sink \u2014 the buoyant force is too low to help it out much. The buoyant force also explains why not all things sink at the same rate. You can try this at home, really. Fill a sink or preferably a bathtub with water, maybe use a pool if you have access to it, and try to sink some stuff in it. Some will go down quickly, some slowly, some not at all. (For ideal results, you\u2019d want to use objects of roughly the same shape. Think about it like this: submarines and fish are usually in pretty specific shapes, shapes that make moving through water more efficient. This implies that some objects you\u2019re working with would also have an easier time moving through water based on their shape; this is similar to how when dropping things outside of water, air resistance can play a pretty important role.)

            "answer_text": "Gravity does NOT stop \u201cworking on us\u201d in water \u2026 nor on the water or even the air. Gravity keeps all of us and the earth together. The question is what order we should be from the center out \u2026 we cannot all be the closest together. In general, things get stacked up with the greatest density lowest. Gravity has already \u201cworked on us\u201d to be below the air ( we have greater density). We would go even lower; but the water is already there. We try anyway. We don\u2019t sit on top of the water; but are allowed entry until we\u2019ve displaced enough water to equal our weight. For most people, they can be vertical and keep their head out. Upside down is not good. Horizontal, you can float on your back. Face down is not good. In deep enough calm water, you can experiment with this idea. Taking a deep breath will cause you to expand and be larger without becoming much heavier \u2014 so less dense. start by floating in a vertical positiontake a deep breath and note that you rise upslowly let the air out and note that you start to sinktake in more air to rise again.Submarines do this with water to control their density. Balloons do it with heat. Gravity will not likely stop working during out lifetime. It just treats all mass the same. ",
