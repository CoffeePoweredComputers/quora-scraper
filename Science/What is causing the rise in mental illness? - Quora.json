            "answer_text": "We are often asked, \u201cSince life is so much easier today, why are mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorder and depression, on the rise?\u201d It\u2019s true that our life is much easier today than it was 50 years ago. Yet, mental illness is on the rise, and drastically. A study by researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center, published earlier this year in the journal Psychiatric Services, found more Americans than ever before suffer from serious psychological distress (SPD). [1] The researchers analyzed a federal health information database and concluded that 3.4 percent of the U.S. population (more than 8.3 million) adult Americans suffer from SPD. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which conducts the National Health Interview Survey on which the research is based, SPD combines feelings of sadness, worthlessness, and restlessness that are hazardous enough to impair people's physical well-being. Previous survey estimates had put the number of Americans suffering from SPD at 3 percent or less. Another study by the National Survey On Drug Use And Mental Health found nearly 20 percent of the adult population suffer from some type of mental illness.[2] This is up from 18.1 percent just a few years ago. A 2010 study done by the National Institute Of Mental Health found that for the first time, youth are disproportionately affected by mental disorders.[3] The study found that one in five youth are affected by at least one type of mental disorder. According to the NCS-A researchers, the percentage of youth suffering from mental disorders is even higher than the most frequent major physical conditions in adolescence, including asthma or diabetes. Another study, called the National College Health Assessment, by the Canadian Association of College and University Student Services (CACUSS) found more students are reporting being in distress than four years ago. The study found that one fifth of all Canadian post secondary students are depressed and anxious, or battling other mental health issues. It also found that 8 percent fewer students felt their health was very good or excellent. The study also found that the number of students who seriously considered suicide was 13 percent, up 3.5 percent from 2013.[4] Speaking of suicide, it doesn\u2019t get any better. A study presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting this past May (2017) found that the number of children and teens admitted to children's hospitals for thoughts of suicide or self-harm have more than doubled during the last decade.[5] Unfortunately, there are numerous studies all reporting the same trends: a dramatic rise in mental illness and suicide. This is particularly true for children and teens. So, why the dramatic rise? What has changed? There are many reasons for these alarming trends, such as: Increased parental pressuresIncreased adoption of electronic media (Electronic Screen Syndrome)Increased performance pressures (education, career, financial, etc.)Increased terrorist events and threatsIncrease in divisive newsDramatic increase in violent TV programs, movies, and video gamesDramatic increase in graphic children\u2019s mediaIncrease in sexually explicit material (TV programs, movies, video games, easy access online, etc.)Social media pressureReduced face-to-face interactions and social supportsThe breakdown of the family unitSexual orientation confusionGender confusionBeing exposed to a multitude of opinions (on TV and online)Being exposed to aggressive behavior (a dramatic rise in child abuse, adult abuse, sexual abuse, etc.)Poor/reduced sleepIncreased financial pressure on parentsReduced parental contact - children are prematurely separating from parents and families, and bonding to peersEasy access to, and the acceptance of, recreational drugs (of all types)Overly protected/indulged childrenReduced expectations for young adultsThe \u2018I\u2019 generation (where everyone believes they are entitled to whatever they want, from opinions to lifestyle choices, and whenever and however they want it)And unfortunately, many more. While life is easier in terms of survival and work, societal norms have changed making it more difficult on our health, both psychologically and emotionally. Based on the research, this change is affecting everyone, and especially today\u2019s children, which doesn\u2019t bode well for our future. The shortage of mental health resources to help those who are suffering with mental illness is another alarming trend that research has identified. On the one hand, we have a rising trend in mental illness and suicide. On the other, there are fewer resources to help address these rising trends. What is the solution to these rising trends? Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t easy solutions. What is required is a wholesale rethink about the many contributing factors and then adopting healthy change. But based on how society got here, and where it\u2019s currently headed, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a positive change anytime soon. The expectation is that things will get much worse. So, the best we can do is seek mental health support from the available resources, and then work at making families healthy one person at a time.  The combination of good self-help information and working with an experienced anxiety disorder therapist is the most effective way to address anxiety disorder and its many symptoms. Until the core causes of anxiety are addressed - the underlying factors that motivate apprehensive behavior - a struggle with anxiety disorder can return again and again. Identifying and successfully addressing anxiety's underlying factors is the best way to overcome problematic anxiety. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not aware of well-respected research that shows an increase in the frequency of mental illness (e.g., bipolar disorder & schizophrenia). So, yours is one of the large collection of questions on Quora for which the question makes an assumption that may not even be true. With that in mind\u2026 Changes in Culture: Consider that many cultures and subcultures still place moral judgments on those with mental illness and, in some cultures, people with mental illness are shunned from society. Even now, there are many with mental illness who cannot function well enough to be employed. This was far more so in the past\u2014 even the recent past. Keep in mind that there are still many cultures in which mental illness is not diagnosed\u2026 or even talked about. I mention this because, in Western cultures (particularly those with a high average standard of living), seeking treatment for mental illness and lesser mental health conditions is becoming far more culturally acceptable\u2014 but you\u2019d want to look at the breakdown by subculture/demographics to see whether this is pervasive or restricted to certain ethnicities, religions, or genders. The Advent of Psychology as a Science: There is a hypothesis that the primary difference in the so-called presence of mental illness today vs. in the past is that mental illness diagnoses didn\u2019t even exist until recently. While the manifestations of bipolar disorder (certain manic/depressive behaviors, aberrant thoughts) were first described around the time of the U.S. Civil War (mid-1800s), this was long before the era of psychology as a widespread discipline. Europeans and North Americans became more aware of psychology with the spread of Freudian and Jungian theories of psychology in the early 20th century. I should mention that we\u2019ve been observing that some people have psychosomatic illnesses, depression, or other \u201cthought disorders\u201d at least since 1500 B.C.E. in Greece. I imagine ancient Eastern traditions made similar observations, though perhaps with different explanations. The point is: It was extremely rare for anyone to be diagnosed with mental illness until recently because the vast majority of humanity had no access to professional care. Mental Illness Diagnosis in the 20th-21st Centuries: Even such famous a person as the writer Virginia Woolf was not diagnosed with bipolar disorder by the time she committed suicide in 1947. Yet, her journals clearly indicate the extreme emotional pain she was in when she was having a depressive episode and a different kind of pain+euphoria that she experienced during manic/hypomanic episodes. The term \u201chysteria\u201d has its origins in the ancient Greek word for uterus. Yes, we were considered to be somewhat crazy just by virtue of being a \u201chormonal female.\u201d As recently as the 1960s, women were routinely prescribed sedatives for what was actually depression (!!). Sobbing was associated with hysteria and these women just needed to calm down. Not only was the diagnosis not right: The prescribed treatment could be downright harmful. By some metric, we\u2019d have to say that there\u2019s been a decline in hysteria in women, by which we\u2019d mean that few women are diagnosed with a mental health disorder on the basis of being emotionally expressive or having hormonal cycles. Myopic Assumptions: People like to explain the unproven hypothesis that mental illness is becoming more frequent by pointing to today\u2019s stresses. Many of us have very complicated lives, which is something that is difficult for our brains to keep balanced. But I\u2019d hesitate to say our lives are more stressful. For most of history, keeping a roof over one\u2019s head, food in their bellies, and rearing their children (some of whom would likely die before their 5th birthday) were physically and mentally exhausting. Was it too much for some people to cope with? Of course. Were they dying of other ailments before triggers for mental illness symptoms received attention/diagnosis? Probably, in many cases. (The average life expectancy in 1900 was 46\u201348 years old.) Going by the Book (i.e., the DSM-5): Even in recent decades in the U.S., we\u2019ve seen diagnostic criteria changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Obviously, as the criteria change, the diagnoses are going to change. Patients fall into and out of a classification with those changes. Then there is what\u2019s in vogue. Children, particularly boys, were overdiagnosed as having ADHD with the same characteristics as what had previously been labeled as \u201cbeing a boy.\u201d Intervention included medicating boys so that they would sit still in classroom settings. In the late 1990s, it became popular (never mind the DSM!) to diagnose young adolescents with Type II Bipolar Disorder when less-eager-to-label practitioners were looking at the mood changes of early adolescence as part of the not-yet-stabilized hormone cycles of that time in development as well as part of the process of individuation that is so crucial during adolescence. Such physicians believe that the symptoms associated with early adolescent mood changes might benefit from medical or psychological assistance, but the child is not mentally ill. On the other hand: In the United States (not to be taken as indicative of the rest of the world), we\u2019re seeing a decline in life expectancy. For the past few years, longevity has declined due to two primary factors: (1) death from opioid overdose and (2) suicide. In the U.S., suicide by firearm, in particular, has become more common than it was in the past. (I have read that this is due to an increase in the percentage of people owning firearms, but I have not spent time determining whether there are multiple independent studies that show this is not simply a correlation but rather a cause-and-effect situation.) Do more people have suicidal ideations than in the past (i.e., major depressive disorder is on the rise) or do they just have greater access to a sure-fire way of ending it all? There may be no difference in the prevalence of suicidal depression, only a rise in success rates. ",
