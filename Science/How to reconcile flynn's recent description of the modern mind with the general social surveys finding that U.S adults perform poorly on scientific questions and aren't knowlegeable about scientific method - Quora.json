Even the dumbest American knows that coronavirus spread through contact and through the air. Look at the way these people behave. There are 340 million people 220000 deaths. 8.3 million people are infected. Kerala has 34 million people and 1200 deaths. If the US public has taken precautions there would have been 12000 deaths instead of 220000. The US leads in infections and deaths. Even then the public does not wear masks and observes social distancing. What does this show? These people have no idea about viruses. They have become living zombies. Another 20000 deaths are waiting for them in a year next. ",
