            "answer_text": "NMR Spectroscopy. NMR Spectroscopy involves absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency region. Absorption of radio waves in the presence of magnetic field is accompanied by a special kind of nuclear transition, and for this reason we call this kind of spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance NMR Spectroscopy. The nuclei of certain atoms behave as if they are spinning charges. Any spinning charge makes a magnetic field and behaves as if it were a tiny bar magnet. Of the three nuclei most common in organic compounds (1H, 12C, and 16O)only the hydrogen nucleus proton behaves in this manner.  When a proton in an organic molecule is placed in a powerful magnetic field, it can align with the field or against it. In the more stable low-energy state, it is arranged with the magnetic field. If power is supplied in the form of radio waves of exactly the right frequency, radiation will be absorbed and the nucleus will \"flip\" and align against the applied magnetic field in the higher energy state. For example, a proton in an applied field of 14000 gauss requires a frequency of 60 million hertz (cycles per second) for this particular transition. When this exact frequency is apply, it is absorbed, and the absorption consumption on a chart paper. In practice, either the magnetic field can be held constant and the radio frequency varied, or more commonly, the radio frequency can be held constant and the magnetic field varied.

            "answer_text": "NMR stands for \u201cNuclear Magnetic Resonance \u201c. NMR spectroscopy involves the changes of the spins state nuclear magnetic moment , when a nuclear absorb electro magnetic radiations in a strong magnetic field . There are two types of NMR spectroscopy as H1(PMR) and C13(CMR). NMR studies of organic molecule gives 4 kinds of informations . Different kinds of protons in the molecule can be known from the number of signals. It gives information about the different kinds of the proton environment of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule . The area under which signals is in the same ration has the number of hydrogen atoms causing each signal.  The 6 hydrogen in the dimethyl ether all in the same environment. They show one sharp NMR signal.The hydrogen atoms of ethyl alcohols are in the three different environments,so they shows three peaks. The principal signal may split into smaller peaks due to \u201cspin -spin splitting \u201c such as doublet, triplet, quartable.. The splitting depends on the number of neighbouring non equivalent protons,for many simple compounds the splitting can be predicted from the \u201c(n+1) rule \u201c. Where n is number of neighbouring protons. The spacing between the peaks is labelled as \u201cJ\" the distance between the centre's of two adjacent peaks in a multoplicate is called \u201ccoupling constant\". J Which is always constant. ",
