            "answer_text": "I think that your question can be answered in two ways. Most answers have addressed this one: Determine what is the scariest movie of all time using scientific means. I thought of it in the following way: What is the scariest movie of all time considering the scientific implications of the movie\u2019s concepts. The latter is what I will answer. I think that scientifically the scariest movie of all time is Event Horizon. The concepts and theories behind this movie are absolutely horrifying. The existence of other dimensions is something that is discussed in a lot of different media, however, you rarely see such a chaotic, unfeeling, indifferent-towards-mankind-and-everything-you-think-you-know representation of the potentials of the universe that we don\u2019t consider. We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, as human beings we are limited to our senses that we developed evolutionarily on earth. More than likely the things we can\u2019t see or sense or know are vast to the point that we can\u2019t even comprehend. This movie shows what could happen when our feeble and specialized minds and bodies perchance come into contact with this chaotic unknown. There are things out there, I think, that we could never comprehend and would melt our psyches. Other fictional universes that deal heavily with these themes are the Warhammer 40,000 universe and the works of HP Lovecraft. These all are based off of the fear of the unknown, the most basic fear known to mankind. ",

            "answer_text": "The Screwfly Solution, from the Masters of Horror series. No, it\u2019s not that well made, and commits several major flaws, but the premise is plausible. It would be pitifully easy for an alien species to do that to us, and yes many religious people would interpret it as a sign from God telling us to kill all the women. Because we do that to species all the time, mess with their DNA\u2026 I would hope that the actual response from us would be good and decisive, and we wouldn\u2019t fall into some of the obvious traps the characters in the film do, but you never know\u2026 ",
