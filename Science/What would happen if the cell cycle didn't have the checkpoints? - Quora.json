            "answer_text": "Checkpoints make sure everything is going according to plan. Cancer usually results from bypassing a checkpoint so the cell can divide extremely fast and create a tumor. There are other cell-cycle-related diseases, but cancer is the most well-known. So, if our checkpoints disappeared, cancer rates would probably be much higher. Checkpoint also make sure the DNA is copied correctly. Without this, there would be more mutations and DNA would be damaged easier. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Most cancers are missing at least some checkpoints. Several are missing most. If all checkpoints were eliminated the population would have a difficult time. Cells without most checkpoints are under constant stress from DNA damage but they do tend to select for mutations that allow this to be tolerated. ",
