            "answer_text": "Freelancing as a student can be tough with the continuous challenge that you can\u2019t ignore your studies for any paid job. Plus as a student, you have a long list of commitments too - social and educational. So before starting freelancing, make sure you have ample time in your hands to dedicate to freelancing. Keep in mind the first few months will be spent on setting up your profiles, connecting and networking with people, and just learning and tweaking from your mistakes. You have to choose your line of work. Most students like to get into content writing, but there are other design, development or pure data entry jobs also available. Search for what gets your creative juices flowing. Once you have the freelancing category settled (it can be more than one like me - I used to work on websites as well as writing when I was a student) you can start telling everyone and anyone you know about you being open to freelancing opportunities in those categories. You can\u2019t let your ego hide you from your prospects. It might take some time to start getting leads and jobs, but you have to be persistent and persevered. Once you start getting jobs, deliver on time, and always be polite with your clients. This type of consistency will win you more jobs. And don\u2019t be afraid to flaunt your skills in front of your clients. They should know what you\u2019re capable of. You can\u2019t afford to be shy. All the above is good to get you started. Join freelancing sites. Join LinkedIn. And get a bank account in your name and don\u2019t forget to get the IFSC information for online transfers, along with the rest of the important bank information. You should always make it super easy for a client to pay you for your good work. And never charge below the norm. You\u2019ll just be setting yourself up for a world of misery because no matter how good you become, you won\u2019t be able to raise your rates because people will always expect you to work for cheap. Don\u2019t let that happen to you. That\u2019s an absolute killer of growth. ",
