            "answer_text": "No. An example: That little pebble in your garden has a higher density than the water in the ocean. Nevertheless, the ocean has more mass than the pebble. Something with a higher density has more mass in the same volume. A liter of stone has more mass than a liter of ocean water. And this is why a pebble sinks to the bottom when thrown into the ocean.

            "answer_text": "Yes, because the formula for Density is D=M/V where M is Mass and V is Volume. If you got more Mass, it will result in more density. For example, consider you have 2 objects i.e. an Apple and a Stone of same size that means the same Volume, but Mass of Stone is much higher than Mass of Apple, thus Stone will have more Density compared to an Apple.
