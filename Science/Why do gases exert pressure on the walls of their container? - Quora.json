            "answer_text": "The gas molecules are in continuous random motion due to its kinetic energy. The attractive and repulsive forces both exists between molecules which can be termed under internal energy which is capable of doing some work due to forces. As this internal energy gives velocity to molecule, it is termed as kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is function of temperature and hence Kinetic energy increases with increase in temperature. Suppose at particular temperature the molecule has velocity \u2018V' and it collides with the same velocity with the walls of container. Imagine three stages ; before collision, at collision and after collision. Before collision velocity is positive, at collision its zero and after collision its negative. Consider velocities at two transitional stages ; before collision and at collision. Initial velocity = V , Final velocity = 0 , let some small distance be \u2018s' between molecule and wall of container. By 3rd kinematical eqn, v\u00b2=u\u00b2 + 2as \u21920=V\u00b2+2as\u2192V\u00b2=-2as\u2192a=-V\u00b2/2s Here the molecule is subjected to retardation If \u2018m' is the mass of molecule then By Newton's 2nd law of motion Retarding force F = ma is exerted by wall of container on molecule. By Newton's 3rd law of motion , Equal and opposite force must be exerted by the molecule on wall of container. Since, the molecules exert force on wall of container, on unit area they exert pressure.

            "answer_text": "Simply due to their full occupation of the space, in which they are contained, as the gas is limited only by the walls of the container. When you are filling a tank with any type of gas, how can you tell or what do you use as your basis when the tank is fully filled? Don\u2019t you use a pressure gauge to measure how much pressure is already contained? You base it from the pressure reading since the tank is also rated to hold an x- amount of pressure\u2026 Similarly when filling a balloon with air, the elastic wall becomes rigid allover and feeling the pressure exerted by the trapped air is an indication whether the balloon is full \u2026. That is how you know by the equal pressure exerted along its wall! That if you decide to exceed, may cause the balloon to burst! ",
