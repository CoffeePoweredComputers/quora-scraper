            "answer_text": "They do not. Theyvhave to put themselves out there as actors. Read backstage. There are many ways. Doing community theater in a small town is not going to get you on TV. Going to NY or LA or a major city. Or producing shorts on line or even making your own film, if you have the resources. I worked on sets for a year and a half before getting into the union. I submitted and auditioned for most of the roles on my reel. I worked hard and people knew me on set as a woman who was happy and liked acting and being on sets. If you do not take the effort to be an actor and train you will not achieve anything. I took classes and workshops. I went to script writing classes. I studied film production and editing. I used money I made to buy Adobe cs4 to make graphics and edit footage. I was incredibly active. I was never looking to be discovered. By the way working as an extra is how pro people gain experience and get to know people. Even backstage recommends it. It is not just being a prop. You learn. It is also how some crew people network into the industry. I never thought about being discovered. I never asked for my sag vouchers. I worked hard and eventually the work paid off. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think there is such thing as \"being discovered\" as an actor.  I guess that most that 90% of succesful and respected actors outhere worked they way to their current status. \"Luck\" is the meeting between readiness and opportunity.  Studying, learning as practicing the art & craft of acting is your first step.  How much do you currently know about acting ? From 1 to 100 how ready are you to play in the big leagues ?  How much training and experience do you currently have ?  Wich are your main tools when crating a character, analizing a scene ? What kind of work you want to do? What kind of characters do you want to create and play ? Do you have an agent? Do you have headshots, demo reel and a website ? All those questions may seem irrelevant,  but they hold a basic blue print followed by most succesful actors. I would recommend you to watch the tv show \"INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO\" and learn from some of the best actors in the world, how they did it, how they still doing it. Get ready, get even more ready, find a good agent, define what kind of work you want to do, go to castings, create your own work, don't wait for permission. There are always ways to make things happen. Fall in love with the process, love your art, love yourself, and the rest will fall into place little by little. Good luck and never stop learning :) ",
