            "answer_text": "If the substance being titrated is fully in solution, then simple swirling will achieve the necessary degree of mixing. Go slowly - drop by drop - when nearing the end point and be sure to reach the same visual end point on both of your samples (replicates). If the sample being titrated is not fully soluble in the solvent being used, then it will be necessary to frequently shake the flask to be sure that all of the material is fully reacted with the titrnt.
