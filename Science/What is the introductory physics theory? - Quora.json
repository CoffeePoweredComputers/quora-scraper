            "answer_text": "There is no the introductory physics theory. That would imply there is only one, and, in fact, there are many. Probably what you are thinking of is an introductory class in theoretical physics\u2026 which is exactly what it says on the label. Once you have some experience in maths and science education, you can start specializing in specific sciences\u2026 one of the specializations is \u201cphysics\u201d, which is the science of the physical world. Physics can be divided loosely into theory and practice. Like anything can. Once you get through the introduction course, you may have an option to specialize further. ",

            "answer_text": "The introductory physics theory is Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion and Universal gravitation. That is the bedrock theory of physics and it is also relatively simple to understand. Next in priority is electromagnetism, which is a good deal more difficult. Physicists typically study it as freshmen, juniors, and graduate students. There is other stuff every physicist must learn, but those are lower priority: thermodynamics, modern physics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and optics. If you know those, you have a good undergraduate understanding of physics. ",
