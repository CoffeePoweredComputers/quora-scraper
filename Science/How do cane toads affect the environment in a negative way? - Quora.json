            "answer_text": "Cane toads were introduced into Australia in 1935 to control the cane beetle , which was a major pest of sugar cane plantations. While they ate the beetles and the larvae, they also eat many other things that they preferred. As well as the beetles, they eat native frogs and reptiles and their poison is fatal to many larger predators such as quolls, as well as dogs and cats. ",
