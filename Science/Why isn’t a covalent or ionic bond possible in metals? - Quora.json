            "answer_text": "Chemical bonding depends on both electronegativity of the elements which form the bond and on the width of the forbidden zone, the zone between the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals. Metals are formed by one the same elements. However, the forbidden zone is very narrow converging to zero. Hence many of the highest lying orbitals become of the same energy, they are called degenerated. They form the zone of the non-bonding orbitals. The electrons are moving freely within this zone within the whole metal lattice. if you apply voltage an electrical current start running between the corresponding poles. If the spins are order in one the same direction according to Hund\u2019s rule (Hund's rules - Wikipedia) you have an fero-or feri-magnetic metal. In the same way the free electrons carry heath, thus the metals are electricity and heat conductors. ",

            "answer_text": "Only ionic bonding is possible in metal, so this is between a metal and a non-metal element (for example NaCl) Covalent bonding is not possible, because it can only form between non-metal elements (for example O2, NO3 etc.) ",
