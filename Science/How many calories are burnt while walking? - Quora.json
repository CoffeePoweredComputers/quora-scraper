            "answer_text": "How many calories do I lose by walking? Bianca, humans expend energy (over and above basal metabolic rate - BMR - which is there just to stay alive - even if in bed 24/7 ), on a pretty even scale when walking and this is:- between 2 and 5 calories per kilogram per HOUR. The faster you walk (say 6kph/7kph - my normal walking pace on the flat but I am tallish, with long legs), the more energy you need. For me this would put it about 3 calories/kg/hr. Walk up a steep slope - then I\u2019d push that to 4 or even 5cal/kg/hr. Running - this would push things to say 6 calories/kg/hr - again depending on speed (i.e., effort) and terrain. There is a lot of misinformation on the internet - but this energy expenditure rate has been known and well researched for over 100 years. To illustrate what I mean I cite The British Antarctic Polar Expediton (1911 - 1912) - Falcon Scott\u2019s journey to the South Pole, was done on 4,500 calories a day (very high in fats - for energy) - probably half or less than what was necessary, but done by careful calculations from naval and army experience in cold climates. Woefully under their neds, probably because they miscalculated a shelter component (lack of).More recently two men (one British and one American), man-pulled sledges across Antarctica (in the same manner as Scott\u2019s), and calculated on 8,000 to 9,000 calories.In actual fact - ALL - expeditions expended something like 10,000 to 11,000 calories a day as both lost significant weight, pulling heavy sleds in extreme conditions for upward of ten hours a day. The weight of the sled is added (as would be a pack). However, if you work that out, they still only burned 9 to 10 calories an hour.Incidentally, recent research (stimulated by re-reading Scott\u2019s diary), also reveals that Scott\u2019s expedition was weakened by incipient - if not actual - scurvy. Of course this would have exacerbated the lack of food and extreme temperature they experienced ( minus 40), further weakening the men. Answer Follow\u00b7 1 Request ",

            "answer_text": "While i am typing this answer my calories are burning\u2026. I suppose you are seating relaxed and reading this answer your calories are still burning. Then you may be mulling why people still are hefty? Large girth ? Let me explain you something about calories. Human can gain calories in three ways by protienBy carbohydratesBy fatEvery 1 gram of protien will give you 4 calories . While one gram of carbohydrates and fat molecule will give 6 and 8 calories respectively.When you eat you start storing protien, carbo and fat. While easiest task for your body is to utilize or break protien molecule followed by carbo molecules and at last fat moleculesThats why calories of protien is utilizes by the body primarily. And fat start storing as reserve.A normal human being need calories according to his daily work and chore. Even if he do nothing he will still burn calories for mainy interior procesd like respiration etc.When task is easy then body burns protien and fat will start burning at last when your body need strength and potential to carry the workSo it's totally on your work diet and your body weight that how much calories eill you burn by any activity.Even if you are walking you are burning calories but not enough to excite fat molecules to start burning.",
