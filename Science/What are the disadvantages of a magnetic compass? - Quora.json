            "answer_text": "Well you would have to be a boy scout or a sailor, with some training in magnetic compass use, because they are a little tricky to use.They are really hard to read, not only for reasons of normal holding and keeping level, but because of their reaction to being moved at all triggering an significant oscillation around the actual reading.When mounted in boats and aircraft they are often gimbaled to stay level as the craft attitude changes. And again, given acceleation, turning and turbulence the card oscillates.You may have to carry special maps.They are impossible to read at night. A match won\u2019t do. Flashlights have a strong magnetic influence from their electric current.You need to know the magnetic deviation for your area since the needle doesn\u2019t point true north as on maps, but to the earth\u2019s magnetic pole which can be a local deflection of up to 40 degrees. This is quite serious if you\u2019re travelling long distances where the adjustments are different.You can\u2019t use a magnetic compass if you\u2019ve got any steel nearby or on you.As you get closer to the poles, the lines of magnetic force becomes quite vertical and spirit compasses are quite useless. This line of magnetic unreliability runs across Northern Canada.Early ships compasses floated the magnetic needle on the surface of methyl alcohol so it couldn\u2019t freeze. When a few crew members broke into the compass and drank it and went blind, the Royal Navy used ethyl alcohol instead.But they have guided explorers and ships and travellers for nearly 3000 years. That\u2019s quite something!",

            "answer_text": "Can be skewed by ferrous metal and induced magnetic fields from electrical wires when current is flowing. Also, you need to know the magnetic variation for the location on the earth you are to find true north. The mag var shifts over a period of time and updated maps to read a compass against them should be used. Gyros (Ships) and GPS will show true north. SINS (ships inertial navigation system) also show true north. Don\u2019t know if SINS still exist, but that was what the gyroscopic systems were used in. INS (inertial navigation system) is the same kind of thing without the ship attached. Several components went into a INS or SINS to make them work. GPS has become almost defacto the one everybody uses. But, GPS is satellite based. A casualty in that system or overcast or trees, then degraded or no GPS. I was lucky and only had to do land nav once at Pensacola. Soldiers and Marines plus Seals are trained in this stuff. Others are also I\u2019m sure. A magnetic compass alone will only show magnetic north. That is it. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t point exactly to the geographical north/south, you have to correct for the magnetic declination, which depends on your position, and varies with time, as the magnetic poles move.You also have to correct for local fields caused by nearby ferrous metals, and possibly electric currents. This is known as the magnetic variation.The magnetic needle has to be suspended so that it is free to move in the horizontal plane, but sufficiently damped to reach a steady position in a suitable time. This is always a compromise.",
