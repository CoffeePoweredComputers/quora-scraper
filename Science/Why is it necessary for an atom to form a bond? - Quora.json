            "answer_text": "Elements are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons compose the positively charged nucleus whilst electrons orbit in orbitals (or shells). Each orbital can hold a certain number of electrons and if their outermost orbital is full they are more stable. Not every element has a noble gas structure (full orbitals) so therefore they bond due wanting to attain greater stability of their electron orbitals. To do this they either donate or accept electrons from other atoms. Metals donate electrons (forming positive ions) as it easier for them to lose electrons to reach the noble gas structure; whilst non-metals gain electrons (forming negative ions) as they only require a few electrons to reach a full outer orbital. Non-metals (or metals) bond by sharing electrons with each other as they cannot form ions with each other (It is difficult for a non-metal to lose electrons or metals to gain electrons). Formation and breaking of bonds ultimately is why chemical reactions occur, for example forming water from hydrogen and water requires breaking of 2 bonds (H-H and O=O ) and then forming 2 bonds (H-O). Each of these bonds is just electrons (as non-metals, they share electrons, both atom donating and accepting electrons).  Hope that helps. if you have nay other questions feel free to ask in the comments :) ",
