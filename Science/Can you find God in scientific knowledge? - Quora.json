            "answer_text": "Can you can find God in scientific knowledge? I couldn\u2019t, but I have to think many claim they have or can. You can attribute something as being \u201cgodly\u201d when it most clearly is not. Theism has been doing this since the time it was invented. It becomes a question of what passes for evidence of \u201cgod\u201d. It is a concept that lends itself well to being given credit for anything a person cannot explain. \u201cWhy did little Jimmy get cancer?\u201d is a genuinely tough question and for many years there was no known origin of cancer. Nobody even knew about genes, much less that it\u2019s like nature\u2019s lottery where some girls are given a glorious bustline and others get cancer and die young, and that the genetic \u201ccoding\u201d could be understood to some degree. They didn\u2019t know about genes, so it was far simpler to give credit to a deity figure. Even once cancer was finally given the name cancer, it was still a matter of \u201cgod\u2019s will\u201d whether it came after you or not. If the person is \u201cgood\u201d then it was seen as some sort of test like Job, if the person was \u201cbad\u201d then it was seen as some kind of divine retribution. In this, if someone believes in the concept of deity and believes there can be a deity anywhere, then they can find that anywhere because anything and everything can stand as evidence. For example; if say with 100% certainty that people are allergic to oxygen, then the evidence for that is everywhere; anytime someone gets sick, I just attribute that to the oxygen they\u2019ve been exposed to. People who are healthy and rarely get sick? High immunity to specific allergens. Old people? Same; there are varying degrees of allergy resistance and they have a high resistance. Somebody dies? It\u2019s that allergy that killed them, the cancer that they had was given to them by oxygen. It\u2019s preposterous, but would you like to be locked in a chamber for two months with nothing but oxygen to prove it\u2019s not a fatal allergen? Of course not; you know you\u2019d be dead of dehydration in three or four days, but that\u2019s just evidence for me that you really know humans are allergic to oxygen, otherwise you\u2019d do it. The quality of answer you demand determines what can stand as an acceptable answer. If \u201cbecause god\u201d is acceptable to your mind, then yeah, god\u2019s everywhere. If you require an explanation that bears up to logical scrutiny and peer review from both sides of the argument, that is proven and provable, there is no god. There is a little mudball in the Milky Way hurtling through space, and riding that mudball are humans. Some may say that there are answers to all the questions you might ask about the finer points of that, but most people realize that any answer that finds \u201cgod\u201d as an answer is probably not being entirely honest with itself. To my knowledge, no human has ever survived more than 214Gs. Ever. Kenny Brack survived a G-load of 214G in an IRL crash at Texas Motor Speedway in 2003. The human body is incredibly fragile. If a deity made everything, why put planets like Mercury so close to the Sun and so far away from earth, knowing full well that no human could possibly survive a launch propelling them hard enough to get there in their lifetime, and that they couldn\u2019t survive even if they got there? Why not put Earth in a universe by itself, orbiting alone around a single Sun? To some people, they can say it was a deity \u201csetting a goal\u201d for us, when it reality no deity was involved in it, and deity was created by humans as an explanation for everything that couldn\u2019t be explained at that time. Unfortunately, they pushed that concept so hard and so forcefully, and so reliably, that everybody started believing it and teaching it themselves. Now we\u2019re in a society that will allow stories in a book to refute genuine scientific findings, and impede scientific progress. If somebody wants to see \u201cgod\u201d in everything, then yes, it can be seen in science, even if there is nothing even remotely godlike in it to be seen. It all depends on whether the person looking at the evidence is willing to accept a cop-out answer because it\u2019s easier. In my opinion, theism is a product of lazy research. To those who support it, no evidence is necessary. To those who oppose it, no evidence will suffice. If someone is aching to see \u201cgod\u201d everywhere, then there is nothing that can be said to prevent them from seeing it wherever they look, from the cancerous tumor in a child\u2019s brain, to the bliss of climax.

You probably have an idea and you\u2019re trying to confirm it, you\u2019re not objective, you\u2019re begging to be mislead, Confirmation bias is something you need to look at, to start with. If you\u2019re trying to be diligent, you\u2019ll ask what other mistakes you\u2019re making.You asked a question but you didn\u2019t define God, if you believe your notion is the only one, you\u2019re VERY mistaken.Finding god in knowledge would mean that god is a subset of knowledge. Perhaps you meant evidence of God, but you didn\u2019t say that.However, whatever you find will be your subjective interpretation, nor will it be able to identify a specific god. So, if you think of using it as your killer argument, forget about it, you see what you want to see. I personally don\u2019t want to see anything that isn\u2019t really there.Now, let\u2019s see how maybe yes. \u2026 Well, if you remember that science and nature is not a killer argument (unless you want to be laughed at), and you believe that the world was created by \u2026 let\u2019s say maker, instead of God or creator, too much baggage. In that case, the universe is the truest expression of the maker\u2019s intent. And scientific knowledge is the most directly inspired work. You could view science as the pursuit understanding the maker\u2019s work. Or as a puzzle given us to keep us busy, or a gift. Or as a test to see how fast we figure things out. Maybe to see if we can figure it out. Maybe even to see how long it takes us to realize we don\u2019t need religion. Here it\u2019s interpretation, but if the universe was made, science is the closest we are to the maker. The one thing that no honest person can say we made up. But what you won\u2019t find is a signature or confirmation of any specific religion. ",

How an a physician not examine the human body and not see design, implying a grand Designer? With all the laws of nature, how can one doubt a Supreme Lawgiver. The Bible told of the laws of nature before science ventured this truth (cf. Job 38:33). In other words, science would not be possible without God or a Lawgiver. It was the Christian worldview then that made possible science and Christianity is therefore called the \u201cmother of modern science.\u201d Even Einstein saw God as a \u201cgreat mathematical\u201d mind that humbled ours and great harmony of design in the universe, though he was no Christian. He also said, \u201cThe harmony of natural law \u2026 reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of humans beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.\u201d In other words, the Anthropic Principle has a very theistic result (cf. Isaiah 45:18). It can be said that one may realize there is a God via science (just as in contemplating the universe itself) but one cannot find God via science or nature\u2014one needs the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit speaking of Jesus via preaching of the Word of God taken by faith. Jesus is the spirit of prophecy! Just believing there is a God will never satisfy man nor save him, one must know God and have a relationship with him to be saved. ",

But the more they find out about how life functions, the more they prove that we have a Creator: Psalm 139:13-16 (NIV) 13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. 14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. 15 My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, 16 your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be. Remember all that talk for years about how 95% of DNA is \u201cjunk DNA?\u201d Well, they have now found that this is not so true as they thought. I\u2019m a computer geek, myself, and the best comparison I can give is this: The DNA they understood all this time is application software (You know, MS Word, Excel, etc) and the DNA they didn\u2019t understand is the Operating System w (OS), like Windows or iOS or Linux, or whatever. They have been comparing how much Human DNA is like Whale or Chimp or whatever to prove that we \u201cevolved.\u201d Nah! What happened is, our Programmer reused bits of programming that worked correctly to design the next critter. LOL! Why reinvent the wheel every time if you don\u2019t have to? Computer programmers do this all the time. If you know how to do task X in C++, why invest a new way to do it for the next project? Just copy and paste the code into the next project and you\u2019re well on your way. Next task! :-D But Biologists were looking at things differently than engineers might, and wanted to start over with each new critter, OR to take some bit or piece of a creature and modify it in an evolutionary way to be something new. And it just doesn\u2019t work that way. Read SIGNATURE IN THE CELL by Dr. Stephen C. Meyer for more details. It turns out that DNA is a computer code of immense complexity and it programs for LIFE in all its great abundance. Oh, and they\u2019ve also found that each cell is full of micromachines. Without these little workers, our cells cannot live, and each cell resembles a city. It\u2019s quite amazing. But King David of Israel somehow grasped all this over 3000 years ago. Amazing!

            "answer_text": "We know Him by revelation and only by revelation. God reveals Himself to those who seek Him with all of their heart. (Do you think it was coincidence that Jesus was tortured at a place called The Skull?) The battle for your soul is raging in your mind. (So get out of your head for a while: seek God with your heart.) One of Oxford\u2019s definitions of the word science is \u201ca systematically organized body of knowledge on a particular subject.\u201d So basically, science means knowledge. But knowledge is not wisdom\u2026 (and information is not knowledge). Of course we need information to get knowledge. Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in the best way: i.e. it is \u2018connecting the dots\u2019. But all the knowledge in the world means nothing if we die ignorant of who God is. So ASK to know Him. You do not have because you do not ask. If you really really want to know Him will He reveal Himself to you. Be honest with yourself about yourself; He only hears you in the realm of truth, so you must be completely honest. Finding God will set you free. We are slaves to whatever we love\u2026 whatever has taken God\u2019s place in our lives. Knowing God will set you free, and once He sets you free, you are free indeed. So search for Him with all your heart (here is the promise) and you WILL find Him. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. The skies declare His glory and the firmament speaks of His handiwork. Nature is God\u2019s \u2018other\u2019 Bible. Sir Isaac Newton, \u2018the father of modern science\u2019 declared \u201cThis one thing I know; I am a great sinner, and Jesus is a great Savior.\u201d He was given supernatural knowledge of God\u2019s natural laws, able to search the universe through a telescope\u2026 but able to enter heaven on his knees.

            "answer_text": "You asked, \u201cCan you find God in scientific knowledge.\u201d Thank you for the question. I am eager to answer it, as it is close to my heart. First: science. Scientific knowledge generally takes two forms: insights and answers. I suggest that scientific knowledge gives us some very good insights into what god or God might be. On the other hand, science cannot reveal something as subtle and imperceptible as God. So, second, the insight I get from science. Here is a summary of my thinking. Science tells us that molecules are the stuff of matter. These, in turn, are composed of atoms, which are organizations of subatomic particles, which are themselves made of still smaller particles. Each constituent particle bit moves with great energy in a space that is unimaginably large in relation to its size. So, science tells us that the things we perceive as being material are vastly empty of matter, and the perceived material of the world is, in the largest part, a shifting pattern of local condensations of energy. The stuff of the world arises as something like waves of variously condensed energy within a great and continuous sea of energy that is never still. All perceived things are joined in this one universal field of dancing energy. So, science tells us that the material world we perceive as many separate things is fundamentally an illusion, however useful and necessary this illusion may be. It suggests that our perceptible world of things is very much like Plato\u2019s allegorical cave, and we wonder at the very reality of our world. Like Heraclitus\u2019 river, the material world both is and is not material. Certainly, a rock is a rock. Yet, a rock is also a local condensation of energy, which I perceive as a rock. In the fundamental view of the world, and contrary to my every-day perceptions, both my rock and I are inextricably immersed in and connected within the ever-changing energetic whole of existence, which transcends all that we perceive. Now, within this limitless and unbroken field of energy, I know for an absolute fact that one spot is aware \u2014 me. This raises the most interesting question of all: is my awareness an isolated and accidental artifact, or do I arise out of a greater awareness? The very continuity of the energetic reality, in which my life and awareness arise, argues strongly that a greater and pervasive awareness is not only possible but likely. So, considering the likelihood that our perceived universe arises within a boundless, continuous, transcendent, active, and aware existence, what might we suppose this great core awareness to be? What shall we call it? It is possible that people have called it by many names. Thus, in this scientific view, I find the insight that God is not a differentiable and separable phenomenon. God is not a personality in the human sense of personality. God is not \u201csomething else,\u201d a separate thing that exists \u201cout there.\u201d God is simply the universal awareness which arises now in one form and now in another, in the great interplay of all existence. God is all and all is God. A Hebrew teacher said about two thousand years ago, \u201cThe kingdom of God is within you.\u201d Have I found God in scientific knowledge? No. But science tells me to look in the same place that Jesus told me to look. Or as Tung-shan said in the 800\u2019s, \u201cIf you look for the truth outside yourself, it gets farther and farther away.\u201d I hope this is helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to believe based on FAITH, not just some physical evidence. Agnostics and atheist seem to be looking for absolute evidence when they will only find reasonable evidence. They also seem to want to skip the faith part. Per the Bible, Jesus said \u201cblessed are those that believe but have not seen.\u201d The Apostle Thomas said he would not believe Jesus was alive unless he could feel His crucifixion scars. All the people on earth now have not seen Jesus and no one has ever seen God so how can man believe in Him if the requirement is to see him or see his miracles or power. You see not all people who watched Jesus do His miracles when He walked here on earth did not become believers so evidence is not the best way that\u2019s why God says through faith instead. The other issue seems to be that a thousand years is like a day to God so God has only performed visible miracles a few times in the history of the world. God has created man in his image and has given man a free will to choose God or chose something else. Some people can look at the evidence, including just the beauty, intelligence, complexity and magnificence of the heavens/earth/life and reasonably conclude there must be a God. God could make everyone believe by showing up each day and performing miracles and demonstrating his power, but this would override our free will, which He does not want to do. It is your choice to be agnostic or atheist and God although He loves you as part of His creation and because you are created in His image, does not want to interfere with your choice. He has established enough evidence for you to reasonably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that He exists. It is either His will or your will up until your death. This is your God given right that God went out of His way to establish. Choosing your \"will\", rather than God's \"will\", will separate you from God forever per the Bible after you die. So I would suggest you keep seeking, asking God for help, studying faith, as well as the evidence and maybe you will become a Christian, and not remain agnostic or atheist ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, consider a couple of observations. Firstly, your question on its own is clear evidence for God. If there truly was no God, questions such as yours and about life\u2019s purpose, would never arise. No God? Nobody to question, nobody to blame for sufferring. It would never enter our minds. Secondly\u2026 Here\u2019s something to consider. Why not let scientific evidence give an answer?Here is what we do know, and a logical conclusion. Scientists can\u2019t tell us how or why the Universe came about as the sheer power required and unleashed is so far beyond Planck density that they can\u2019t even theorise it. What, though, do we know? That it was no random uncontrolled explosion, no \u201cBig Bang.\u201d The Big Bang Wasn't The Beginning, After All How do we know that? All matter is energy in a form. Huge energy! That energy had to exist in order to create matter. The logical conclusion is that pure energy was existing prior to the advent of the Universe. What else do we know? The Universe is strictly controlled by laws we can measure, understand and work with. Laws of maths and physics control everything. We know about the four primary forces and the delicate balance between them and that if any laws were put out of balance the Universe would collapse. Given the technology we can send a craft to anywhere in the Universe, regardless how long it would take, knowing it will arrive on time at the place sent to. This despite the constant movement and rotation of galaxies and solar systems. So, we have a Universe of organised energy, of matter, governed by strict laws that we can measure and understand. We live on a unique planet in a galaxy perfectly set up for life. A literal jewel in space. (See the movie, \u201cThe Privileged Planet\u201d. How many have watched it?). Evolutionists rail at the word, \u201cdesign\u201d, but literally, the Universe and everything in it accurately meets the definition. Nothing in the Universe could have occurred by random, unguided, natural processes. So we have design and law. Strict control that prevents the whole shebang collapsing. Nothing random. Here, again, is the implication that is anathema to evolutionists - it was created by an intelligence of incredible power. Third\u2026 Have a look at the human mind, for the answer\u2026 The human brain is a mystery. More than being a high-speed processor of information, the human mind is beyond the realm of science to explain. Our brain is more than a wrinkled walnut inside our skull. More than a physical thing. It is what sets Mankind separate from any other type of creature. Its capacity is virtually limitless. Even incredibly intelligent animals like the Octopus and dolphins and whales pale in comparison to a life that totally dominates the earth and everything on it. Nothing can stand in man\u2019s way or thwart his plans except the laws of nature, and in most cases he can adapt machinery to overcome those as well. I think of flight, here, within and without earth\u2019s atmosphere. Man alone, has the power to destroy the earth and cause his own extinction. (Something he seems hellbent on doing, right now). Man is godlike in this. Man is inherently a spiritual being in that more than having a concept of a higher power and a need to ask the big questions of life, he can think abstractly. Mathematics is a prime example of the insurmountable gulf between man and animal. Man alone has a concept of eternity and a desire for eternal life. Hence the fact that for thousands of years, he has sought the Holy Grail, the Fountain of Youth, the reason why we get old and die before our time, a way to extend our lives. He rails against death and grieves his loss. This fact, the human mind, is a powerful argument against evolution which is a reactionary process by definition, not an anticipatory one. Like cruise control in a car, it reacts and adapts to environmental changes, it does not look into the future. Evolution would never produce the human mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Like many people who were raised in a somewhat religious family, in my teens I fell away for a lot of reasons, among them was the fact that a lot of what many Christians emphasized seemed unlikely to me. However, I was always interested in science. I ended up finding some success in computer science, but I have always been particularly interested in physics and cosmology. The progress of physics during my lifetime has been simple: 1. We have it all almost all figured out, just have to put together relativity and quantum mechanics to describe a steady-state universe. No room of God or supernatural in this material universe. Oh, but this Big Bang thing is surprising! 2. Well, we have it almost figured out except that we don\u2019t know where most matter is hiding (dark matter) or what is all this energy expanding the universe is (dark energy), and what all these other dimensions required by our theories uniting relativity and quantum mechanics are. Of course, we all know there is no God or anything supernatural. So this must all be more material stuff like the material stuff we see because we all agree that science is materialism! 3. Now that we all have computers and can make better observations, and calculations, and know something about information theory, our entire universe seems so mathematically unlikely, life is improbable, there hasn\u2019t been time enough for evolution, and consciousness as an information source defies all our analysis, so the only explanation is a multiverse created by an eternally hidden cosmic force that is infinitely powerful and capable of anything, creating all possible universes. But, because there is no God or supernatural, this power cannot be conscious because then it would be God so maybe consciousness doesn\u2019t exist at all and is just an illusion! At some point, a person with just a shred of common sense and accepts their own consciousness has to say, \u201cIsn\u2019t God a simpler explanation?\u201d Of course, God always gives us the freedom to choose. No amount of science will ever force anyone to believe. The nature of free will requires other explanations to present themselves. We always have a choice. That too is a part of our unlikely universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course yes, The most rewarding and meritorious attitude, in the eyes of Islam, is to approach religious issues with the spirit of a scientist. Islam is very liberal in this matter. It may demand from a person to believe in certain principles but, at the same time, it advises him to try to base his belief on evidence. It sets him free to raise any question and does not condemn him when he doubts, if his doubt is followed by an intensive effort to find the truth. If any other religion advises him to avoid discussing principles other than its own and makes him fear provoking the anger of God by doing so, Islam makes one feel secure from God's anger if he pursues his search for the truth. As a matter of fact, Islam never advises one to avoid discussion that may lead to a new knowledge and a new discovery of a truth. Be not afraid, Islam advises, to discuss any religious principle, whether it is Islamic or non-Islamic. Never worry or fear God's anger because He is the God of truth, He never condemns a person for seeking truth. On the contrary, the more one seeks the truth and conducts intensive research, the more he deserves the Divine reward from the Islamic point of view. The most rewarding and meritorious attitude, in the eyes of Islam, is to approach religious issues with the spirit of a scientist who welcomes any evidence that may prove or disprove his theory (or a theory to which he may subscribe). When our belief in God precedes any other religious belief, the evidence which produces such a belief must be universal and available to every rational being, whether committed or uncommitted to a particular religion. Islam demands from its followers to believe in God, the Creator of the Universe, but it does not advise them to base such a belief on the statement of any religious book or any authoritative words, not even the word of the Holy Qur'an or of the holy Prophet. Our belief in a holy book, such as the Qur'an, or in a holy prophet, such as Mohammad, must be preceded by our belief in God. A religious book is holy because it is introduced by a man whom we consider a prophet. Prophethood is conceivable only if there is God, because a prophet is a messenger of God. Our belief in God, therefore, must come before our belief in a religious book or a prophet, not vice versa. No religious book is believed by all people, and no prophet is universally recognized. Therefore, it would be futile to rely on an authoritative statement of a prophet or a holy book when dealing with an atheist who disclaims all heavenly revelations and denies the whole concept of God. The Holy Qur'an offers the universe as evidence on the existence of its Creator. The material world, its celestial bodies, the earth, and the other planets, are viewed by Islam to be the main evidence of the Creator of matter and energy. The material world is observable by the atheist as well as by the believer, by the illiterate as well as by the philosopher. One may reflect on the formation of the heavenly bodies and the existence of the matter and energy without being committed to any particular religion or recognizing any religious book. Now you may ask - But why should a person consider the existence of the material world as evidence of the existence of the creator of matter? Is it not probable that matter existed without a creator? Suppose someone views that matter or energy is infinitely old, and that it never was preceded by non-existence. Would you be able to disprove his views? When one says that matter or energy is infinitely old, one assumes that the material out of which the billions of stars were built, existed simultaneously. When we are aware that each star contains billions of tons of materials, and that the balance of the raw material is much more than the material which is contained in the stars and planets, we realize the improbability of such an idea. We cannot conceive that all these quantities of materials existed at once and that nothing of it was preceded by non-existence. Our reply to you - To say that only a portion of the material is infinitely old, and that the other portions came to existence at a later stage, is to admit the need of a creator, because the inanimate material does not increase by self-reproduction. Only living beings are capable of multiplying by self-reproduction. To allow any gradual increase in the material quantity is to admit the need of a creator. The Creator of the Universe ",

            "answer_text": "It should be remembered that science by definition can\u2019t prove anything, it can only form reasonable conclusions, therefore, no theories are permanent; throughout the entire history of science we continually saw well established scientific theories being replaced by new ones with more evidence. Some of them eventually were disproved by simple mistakes creating variables in experiments. In the 1800\u2019s, scientists kept making discoveries that \u201cproved\u201d that there\u2019s a civilization on Mars with irrigation systems. This fact became so well established that it eventually became a theory. However, as science progressed and equipment improved, they realized that was simply because of the quality equipment they had in those days and illusions caused by looking too much through a telescope. So far however, most scientists and science itself agrees that you can find God in science, even increasingly many Atheistic scientists recognize it. Here\u2019s some quotes from a few pretty high profile ones: \u201cWe take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs\u2026because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism\u2026Moreover that materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.\u201d \u2014 Professor Richard Lewontin, Evolutionary biologist, Harvard University \u201cEvolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it only because the only alternative is special creation, and that is unthinkable.\u201d \u2014 Sir Arthur Keith (He wrote the forward to the 100th anniversary edition of Darwin's book, Origin of Species in 1959) \u201cIn fact, evolution became in a sense a scientific religion; almost all scientists have accepted it, and many are prepared to \u2018bend\u2019 their observations to fit with it.\u201d \u2014H. S. Lipson , FRS, Professor of Physics, University of Manchester, UK in \u201cA Physicist Looks at Evolution,\u201d Physics Bulletin, vol. 31 (May, 1980), p. 138 These scientists actually dropped science to prove what they believe in, as a matter of fact, they actually help strengthening the fact that Science currently favours God. Why does Atheistic scientists have to go to this extreme to try prove their theories? Because they\u2019ve ignored the fundamental principles of science to do so. The most important principle in science is the law of causality, all of science revolves around it, it states that everything that has come into being must have a cause. Since the universe came into being, it must have a cause, and if it has come into being, it must have a beginner, either that\u2019s from a big bang or from the all mighty God of the Bible. This is very dangerous ground to tread upon for an Atheist, how do you explain that everything came into being by chance without contradicting the law of causality, most foundational principle of science? They\u2019ve tried to solve by suggesting that the universe is continually expanding and contracting in on itself, thus, avoiding a definite beginning (a.k.a the Cosmic Rebound Theory). This theory fell out of favour and it contradicts the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics because there\u2019s simply not enough matter and energy for the universe to do that. The other area that clearly reflects God in science is Anthropological Constants. Here\u2019s practical example to explain what that is: In Apollo 13, the thing that nearly caused the death of everyone on board is one of the oxygen tanks that moved 5.08cm (2 inches) out of place, causing it to get damaged, explode, affecting the other oxygen tanks and the lives of the astronauts. This is what a anthropological constant is, space shuttles are very complex and precisely tuned to survive in outer space, the very least thing that goes wrong could mess things up really bad. The universe however, is even more precise and complex than that, even just one cell in your body is more complex and finely tuned than a space shuttle; if our solar system\u2019s gravity levels were alterered by just 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000001%, our sun would be destroyed and planet earth would collapse in on itself. All this evidence obviously means that the universe was designed, and as the theliological argument states: Every design must have a designer. Random chance can\u2019t possibly produce such a finely tuned universe. Here\u2019s one last quote: The beginning seems to present insuperable difficulties unless we agree to look on it as frankly supernatural. We may have to let it go at that. \u2014 Sir Arthur S. Eddington, The Expanding Universe, page 117 ",

            "answer_text": "I am a former atheist, and an evangelical Christian. I believe that there is much to see in the universe, in life, and in the human experience that all can readily be taken to infer (or at least be reconciled with) the wisdom and workmanship of God. However, ultimately it gets back to the \u201cevidentiary standard\u201d, and a branch of philosophy known as \u201cepistemology\u201d. \u201cHow do we know what we know?\u201d I've listened to the demands of atheists that believers \u201cshow evidence of God\u201d (as though He should be expected to have a street address with a driver\u2019s license and two major credit cards). Likewise to many of my fellow Christians, who try to argue that God's existence should be regarded as virtually self-evident, or that Biblical references should be taken at face value, even by non-believers. All this kind of back-and-forth disputation does is make each side feel that the other side is being inherently unreasonable. On the side of unbelief, there is a tendency to treat Science as Truth. And it must be confessed up front that Science requires the presupposition of \u201cnatural processes\u201d. Science is not so much the \u201csearch for truth\u201d as it is the attempt to \u201cexplain currently unknown processes in terms of the current overall worldview\u201d. This does tend to rule out \u201cscientific study of the supernatural\u201d, and thus scientists come to regard references to supernatural events with suspicion. Not necessarily out of overt hostility, but more like professional prejudice. But while this is understandable, one must also admit that many discoveries of Science are very different from what scientists had expected, and bring considerable increase in complexity to our picture of the Cosmos. Big Bang cosmology, quantum physics, evidence of \u201cfine tuning\u201d in various aspects of nature, and the immense complexity revealed in biochemistry have all contributed to a strong arguement that Nature and Life are the works of a Divine Creator. Ultimately, it seems that the various worldviews\u2026. from strict Materialism and Atheism, to Divine Creation and Biblical Faith, are all capable of arranging various \u201cfacts\u201d and ideas about the Cosmos into an overall picture of Reality that suits their beliefs. In this sense, the Universe becomes something like a \u201cRorschach Test\u201d. Neither Science nor Faith can result in a literally self-evident and logically-irrefutable system of thought, such as to utterly silence one\u2019s opponents. We are all, ultimately, believing what we want to believe. This does not, of course, mean that \u201cthere is no truth\u201d. But it does mean that we \u2018cannot jump off our own shadows\u201d, as it were. We are engaged in a kind of iterative process, but there is an essential element of ourselves in everything we think. True Objectivity belongs to God. ",

Which of these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.\u201d (Job 12:7-10)Read more at 6 Bible Verses on Experiencing God through His Creation - Activist Faith Read the other verses and they too show you that God reveals himself through His creation and using science one can see God\u2019s design by examining the creation. Intelligent Design is a scientific approach to identifying intelligence, be that human, another intelligent being, or God. There is a strong attack against it because evolutionists are afraid of it because it challenges them on their playing field- the scientific fields of study. ID doesn\u2019t address who the designer is, just that the complex specified information CSI pattern or irreducible complexity IC artifact originated from intelligence! This approach is taken to follow the most restrictive approach to science which says that God is outside the realm of science so we look for the intelligence rather than God. Looking at nature, we can distinguish the natural from the designed using science. Some ID proponents will choose to speculate about the designer which is appropriate as long as the scientific endeavors focuses on the intelligence. Intelligent Design is not the only way to see God in creation. We see the amazing design of life with all the complexity, which should lead us to wonder about God. Our natural machines we build don\u2019t materialize out of nowhere and the biological \u201cmachines\u201d are far advanced compared to our machines. To say that life originated from innate matter is the greatest absurdity for it flies in the face of the Second Law of thermodynamics. Even open systems are under the control of this law and while simple decreases in entropy moving away from equilibrium can be found, complex systems don\u2019t materialize out of nowhere. For example, we can put all the materials together to build a house. If lightning hits those materials, there is a theoretical possibility that the house will be built just like the first cell could form, but we know it will not happen because the probability is just too small! Energy has to be applied precisely in pounding in nails, lifting and positioning parts, applying paint, putting in wires, installing the plumbing and much more. Essentially, low probability events - like the lightning example - are the reason that the Second Law of thermodynamics holds true for the low probability is so low it can never happen! Finally, we see God in the beauty of nature. Who has not gazed up at the night sky and felt that awe and wonder? Have you not seen a rainbow and marveled at the beauty? Or have you not seen the beauty of a flower filling you with amazement? The beauty of creation reveals the existence of God! ",

If you were trying to prove the existence of say the Christian god, then you would have to show that people could raise the dead, move mountains with their minds, make the blind see, heal diseases by touch and so on, as these are the claims, made in Christian literature, that any Christian can do. Obviously, out of billions of Christians, not a single one can do any of these things. If they could find one, they would be shouting it from the rooftops and demanding that science come and test their miracle worker. They of course don't have one.

Gratitude leads one to praise God often, which is the key to loving God. Prerequisite to gratitude is consciousness or awareness of God. A keen sense of the principles that belies existence helps in keeping one constantly conscious of God but it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition to approach God. One has to be sincere and do good works to approach God. Sincerity addresses the intellect while good works is driven by the will. They complement each other. Knowledge can fortify one\u2019s faith and love for God but is not sufficient to approach God. Thanks for asking. ",

But they will never go beyond other than what The God will allow. they guess and have theories, but theory is no substitute for facts. And the fact is nothing came about by the hands of mankind. Not this universe. Stars. Planets. Flowers. Rain. animals. Insects. People. Mankind had no part in any of the above coming into existence. So, no matter what any human says, none, not one can deny the facts, we didn\u2019t bring this nor ourselves into existence. Nor can any duplicate a planet, we can\u2019t figure out the human brain, let alone create one. And cloning doesn\u2019t count, because they are using what The God has already created. Let scientists make exactly like or a better human, without using any parts of any human already here. Bring into existence a human equal or better. Let them produce a planet from nothing. And The God gives them an easier challenge, in The Quran, create a fly. Knowledge is given to make us think, ponder, reflect, understand, reason. This universe didn\u2019t created itself. If it takes intelligence to make the Hubble scope, can we realistically believe that that which the Hubble scope captures didn\u2019t come about by intelligence? The camera took intelligence to make, but not the eyes cameras are based on? Intelligence to make a plane, but not the birds? Intelligence to make robotics, but not the human? How can a doctor study the human body and the way it is put together and not believe? How can anyone study anything in existence that we had no part in and not believe? We cannot produce anything without using elements of what already exists. And we CANNOT produce a planet no matter how much Star Trek wants to think we can. The \u201cGenesis Project\u201d in Star Trek will never happen. We can never produce a planet nor the various life that exists on earth. How can people have knowledge and still be blind to truth and facts? Science wants to disprove The God. It will never happen. Out of all the belief systems, theories and study over the centuries, one remains consistent, The God. In every century, there will always be the belief in Him. Why? Because He does exist, He created it all and no matter how hard people try to evict Him, they will never succeed. And one other fact remains, we all find out the truth the moment we die. And we can\u2019t even stop that, no matter how hard science tries to prolong or prevent it, death comes to us all. So let\u2019s see science stop death. And there is even wisdom and intelligence to death, for if no one died, what would earth be like? Could it even house the 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 and more people from the past till the present? Not even including future generations or the hundreds of other life on earth? None of them ever to die. How would life be on what appears, now, to be a very big planet, but how small would it be if nothing died? ",

            "answer_text": "Scientists are individuals with several extraordinary qualities. However, these qualities differ among scientists from various disciplines and depend on the nature and type of research a scientist is engaged in. The impact of scientific research is reflected in a society and the entire humanity at large and scientific research can make human life better or even bring a disaster for human beings. Thus, it is important to consider various qualities of scientists and their impact on a scientist\u2019s research and its consequences. The qualities2 of an ideal scientist can be broadly divided in three main categories: behavioral or spiritual, mental or intellectual and physical qualities. In this article qualities of an ideal scientist will be reviewed from Islamic point of view. Knowledge and Discovery \u2013 An Islamic View According to the teachings of Islam, knowledge3 doesn\u2019t only mean reading, remembering, analyzing or discovering new facts or even making a new invention based on discovered knowledge. Knowledge is based on piety [taqwa]4 and that the seeker of knowledge should have special characteristics reflected in his pure and godly intentions and thinking, wise words and finally virtuous actions. Knowledge without these characteristics is considered as being of a very low level.5 Whatever a scientist \u2018observes\u2019, \u2018discovers\u2019 or \u2018creates\u2019 is a sign [ayah] of God, a fact already known to God and created by God \u2013 being the ultimate source of knowledge6. A scientist is thus blessed with opportunity [toufiq] by God to seek knowledge, do experiments, analyze data and present result or make discovery. The difficulties that a scientist faces in the path of acquiring knowledge, and the joy and pleasure of making a discovery or creating new knowledge for the sake of God are special and their reward is reserved only for the elected friends of God. All the mental capabilities and ideas leading to discovery, health and physical strength and the brain used by scientist to acquire knowledge are among the greatest blessings of God. The power of imagination [wahm], intellect [\u2018aql], creativity [khallaqiyyah] and the power of thinking [fikr] are among the great blessings of God that a scientist uses all the time to do research and without these blessings, research is impossible. A scientist must understand and accept these basic realities. Thus, according to the teachings of Islam, a scientist cannot honestly say \u2018my data\u2019, \u2018my research paper\u2019, \u2018my discovery\u2019 or \u2018my invention\u2019. Whatever good things that come in the way of scientist, in any form, are in fact blessings of God and a scientist must realize that even if he doesn\u2019t remember God in his intellectual pursuits, God remembers him and blesses him abundantly with success and so he must thank God all the time for his favors. Even difficulties and hardships that a scientist faces during his quest for knowledge, and making a discovery are tests of his patience and hidden blessings of God. Thus in his good times as well as in hardships, a scientist must thank God and seek His help. In the final essence, acquisition of scientific knowledge and making discovery are not the ends, but a means to seek pleasure of God, serve His creatures and are God\u2019s blessings in this world upon a scientist. It is up to him to use these blessings either for the sake of God\u2019s pleasure, thankfulness and worship and reduce suffering of human beings or for worldly, selfish and materialistic gains and bring eternal destruction for himself and humankind. Qualities of an Ideal Scientist A scientist should be first a good human being. Motivation for his research should be primarily based on alleviating human pain and suffering and seeking pleasure of God and doing his duty. Scientists have different motivations, including, curiosity, love of discovery, winning awards, becoming famous, better financial life, career promotion and finally competing with a colleague or a group. All these motivators potentially make a scientist successful in his career; however, these can also lead a scientist to fall in an evil trap, do wrong to himself, his colleagues and society and humanity at large, commit sin and thus, lose divine blessing in his research. A good scientist prioritizes various motives for research and keeps his duty towards God and his creatures as the top motivator. His heart feels the pain of suffering of creatures and serves as powerful internal force to go forward with scientific research under difficult circumstances and various pressures. In this way, he is never carried away by short-term materialistic or selfish goals and worldly attractions. In modern times, due to rapid advancement in communications, internet and availability of sophisticated and diverse scientific techniques, a scientist cannot remain isolated and do research alone. Thus, he should be a good team worker, be humble in attitude and respect his colleagues and their opinions. Another pivotal characteristic is truthfulness. Scientific research by itself is discovery of a hidden truth which starts from observation and ends with creation of new knowledge or discovery of a fact which may lead to an invention. Thus, until a scientist develops habit of being truthful all the time, he cannot be a good scientist. He can make deliberate or unconscious error of evading or missing truth in his observation, doing experiments, data analysis, inference and writing his results in the form of thesis or research publications. A scientist with habit of being untruthful can easily fall prey to plagiarism and scientific misconduct and exaggerate his findings to make short term worldly gain. Patience and persistence are two very important qualities of a good scientist. A scientist has to often deal with failures in his experiments, lack of facilities and funds, uncertainties, unfavorable and hostile environment as many may not believe in his findings. Thus, he should never give up his quest and curiosity and have trust in God [tawakkul] and seek God\u2019s help in face of uncertainties, difficulties and adversities. No scientific discovery is possible without firm patience. A scientist must realize that patience bears fruits and he has to wait for the moments of success or discovery; it will surely come sooner or later. A scientist must have sharp observation and he should be able to see things, phenomena, events and data differently, and with creativity from various aspects and he should also be able to accurately quantify observation. This is the essence of scientific research as the results that a scientist comes up with form the basis of further inference and application of scientific knowledge. A scientist should also be very responsible in making observations, doing experiments, and publishing his results. He should consider the impact of disclosing his knowledge and discovery to others and before submitting it to a journal or sending it to publisher in any form. Sometimes, a discovery can be harmful to humanity if disclosed or if used by irresponsible individuals and so he must weigh pros and cons. Listening and accepting points of view that are not in agreement with his own or scientific flexibility is another quality of a good scientist. Often, scientists disagree on a key scientific point, mechanism of action, interpretation of data, have different approaches to scientifically pursue a problem or may have disagreements on other scientific issues. A good scientist respects and considers opinions of other like him from other disciplines, or with expertise in techniques not known to him as worthy of acceptance and approval. A good scientist realizes beauty of combination of various aspects of observation, diverse opinions, creative and novel ideas and techniques which often lead to new discoveries, ways to novel solutions and approaches. Due to rapid expansion of knowledge, creation of new disciplines at a very fast pace, diversity of scientific techniques and communication revolution, often, a scientist is not aware of many new facts and discoveries, and has to be courageous and honest enough to express his ignorance in front of others. Humbleness in thus another characteristic of a good scientist who appreciates efforts and superiority of his colleagues7 and accepts what is scientifically proven, even though it may be against or better than his own views or current state of his knowledge. This humbleness in fact motivates a scientist to always be a good learner. Knowledge and skills of a scientist can often lead another scientist or a colleague to become envious towards him, stop his progress and harm him in various ways and deny his due rights. This can also harm a society indirectly because if a talented scientist is not allowed to work and denied facilities and opportunities, society will not able to enjoy fruits of his intellectual endeavors; a disease may remain uncovered, a mechanism leading to better understanding of the cause of an illness or a potential treatment may not be discovered if a scientist is not allowed to pursue research. Thus, a good scientist has eyes and mind free from envy, that appreciate knowledge and skills of his colleagues, give their due rights and respect, help and promote those who excel him in knowledge, talents and skills, even though it may apparently harm his own career. According to a tradition8 reported from Imam Ali (as), a researcher or seeker of knowledge should have several diverse characteristics which are summarized in table 1. Spiritual and Mental Behavior and Attitude Good intentionHumblenessFreedom from envyHigher level of understandingCompassionate by heartTruthfulness by heartIntegrityPietySatisfactionGnosis of things and mattersSalvationWell-beingDivine guidanceVirtueMemory Visiting the learnedDiscussion with the learnedRefined mannersTolerance in behaviorLove of electCompassion in behaviorTruthfulness in words and actionPiety in actionGentlenessResearchFaithfulnessSoftness of speechVirtue in actionAbstinence from sinsResearch in action Table 1. Characteristics of Researchers in the view of Imam Ali (as) Ontological Aspects of Qualities All the intellectual and mental qualities described for a good scientist grow as a scientist pursues his career and makes new discoveries or publishes more scientific papers. As a scientist acquires more knowledge, his capacity to acquire more knowledge increases and his \u2018reservoir\u2019 become more spacious, this is opposed to material things where reservoir becomes gradually filled and less spacious as said by Imam Ali (as).9 Accordingly, progress in a scientist\u2019s intellectual capabilities is reflected in his ability to go deeper into a topic, know more about less and unknown, comprehend better, make precise and accurate comments, evaluate delicate aspects of knowledge, write more scholarly, do better editing, think laterally, enter into scientific debates with more depth and diversity, develop a general comprehension into broader areas outside his own discipline and guide students more effectively. From an ethical and spiritual point of view, during stages of acquisition of knowledge, a scientist may be trapped in a stage [known as stage of knowledge by the gnostics] whereby acquiring knowledge becomes his aim and not means to serve God and remove suffering of His creatures. His aim becomes to win intellectual discussions with his like and prove his superiority of knowledge and skills. The scientist also feels pleasure to be called as a \u2018scholar\u2019, \u2018intellectual\u2019 or a person with knowledge and loves to acquire more knowledge for the sake of worldly gains, praises, awards, be ahead of others, promotion, and only for pleasure that he feels in acquiring knowledge and to become famous as a scientist or scholar.10 It is important that at this stage, the scientist should get out of this state of mind with spiritual exercises and concentrate at his duty towards God and His creatures. Until he comes out of this stage, and enters into stage of acquiring knowledge as a duty towards God again, all his efforts in acquiring scientific knowledge, making discoveries, publications, everything will be for the sake of personal motives, worldly gains and devoid of divinely blessings and the rewards in the Hereafter. Such a scientist will only progress intellectually and get fame, promotion in academia and acquire high worldly status; however, his spiritual and ethical qualities will be lost and replaced by selfish intentions. He may acquire great successes in his scientific career, however, it will be devoid of divine blessing and pleasure reserved for those who acquire scientific knowledge and make scientific discovery for the sake of God and serving His creatures. Additionally, when a scientist is in the beginning stages of acquiring knowledge, he may feel to know a lot about a specific topic or area of research, admire himself and behave proudly. However, as he grows and makes progress, his horizon become more wide and high, and gradually finds that he knows very little and there is a lot more to learn in the never ending journey to acquire knowledge. Thus, a good scientist never falls into the trap of self-admiration [\u2018ujb] and is never proud [mutakabbir] in his behavior towards others. As he gradually, he develops a sense of ignorance inside himself and becomes more humble in his attitude as he acquires more knowledge. Towards his colleagues and likes, the people of knowledge and scholars, he develops a special love and respect and socializes with them. In order for a scientist to be \u2018complete\u2019 and \u2018perfect\u2019 in all spheres, in addition to his intellectual, mental attainments and social life, he must pay equal attention to ethical and spiritual qualities and self-purification throughout his career. Accordingly, for a good scientist, it is necessary to have spiritual qualities, pure godly intentions, and special behavioral characteristics mentioned above [table 1]. He should also make further progress in sincerity, become more refined, acquire higher levels of piety and divine characteristics with his career progression from a junior researcher or student until becoming an established senior scientist, professor or still higher. Good Scientist in the Modern Age In the modern age, a scientist has a more challenging task. As opposed to past when a scientist usually had to travel long distances to find a teacher, do research in isolation and often with few simple techniques, a scientist in today\u2019s world has easy access to scientific knowledge, has to work with networks where many scientists are connected together and he is faced with information overflow and has to read a lot of literature before coming up with new ideas and adopt an innovative approach for his research. Thus, a good scientist should be a good reader, able to differentiate between various levels and categories of knowledge reported in scientific literature, should be able to work with modern technology, internet, necessary softwares, and should never be tired to learn new scientific techniques and acquire new expertise, whenever required to learn in order to pursue his research goals and to make a discovery. Additionally, since modern science is essentially multidisciplinary and entails diverse approaches, a good scientist should be a good team worker and collaborate with scientists from various disciplines and never hesitate sharing his ideas with them or be shy of learning from them. He should never hide his knowledge and love teaching his students and colleagues and make use of all the tools available to come up with authentic data and make a discovery necessary for solving a problem \u2013all these in order to ease pain of the creatures of God. This process is hard test for a scientist as he has to take care of rights of other scientists working with him as well as the fact that he has to fulfill the right of knowledge and skills he has been blessed by God. Faithfulness and loyalty are two essential qualities of a scientist when working in a team with others. A scientist should never claim knowledge and ideas [either in written or spoken form] or discovery which belongs to others as his own. He shouldn\u2019t disclose data that his colleagues have acquired and shared with him and do not want to publish or discuss with others. Additionally, he shouldn\u2019t disclose intellectual or other weaknesses of his colleagues that he personally comes to know while working with them. According to the Prophet Muhammad (swas), this is regarded as the worst treachery [khayanat].11 Removing the name of a colleagues or student from publication or not mentioning verbally their contribution is an act of scientific misconduct. He must always give credit to others, in written and verbally for their intellectual contributions and thank them. Conclusion According to the teachings of Islam, knowledge is a divine light [noor] instilled in the heart of a person by God.12 It illuminates the heart of a scientist and guides him. If combined with faith in God, this light leads a scientist to become successful not only in this world, but hereafter also. A scientist\u2019s words and actions reflect this divine light, if his aims are godly. A scientist remains alive after his physical death because of his written words left as a legacy for mankind or his invention which serves humanity to remove their suffering and make their life better. A scientist is constantly in a state of evolution towards more knowledge and higher qualities in all spheres and his quest to see realities of creation, created by God. Every time he makes a new discovery, he, in fact discovers a new name [ism] of God, and His new attribute [sifat] which increase his gnosis [marifat] of God. He becomes more responsible in his duties towards himself, knowledge he has acquired, his colleagues, students, society and finally God. At every higher level of knowledge and discovery, there are new challenges, more complex uncertainties and more severe difficulties waiting for him. A scientist should never be tired and remember God, thank Him for his favors and His tests, and seek His help and never forget his duties towards Him. Finally, a prayer attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (swas) can be a good tool which a scientist can often use to seek divine help: \u2018O Allah, show me the things (or facts) as they (really) are.\u201913 Url Qualities of an Ideal Scientist : An Islamic Perspective ",

My personal point of view is that an omnipotent omniscient god is unfalsifiable with the scientific method: if an omnipotent god exists, he could have willed the test to have the outcome it has, no matter what result you get in a test, so basically you can\u2019t trust the outcome. And trying to trick such a god to reveal itself won\u2019t help either, since he is omniscient and will know that you are trying to trick him. So you can\u2019t test the god hypothesis scientifically and get a conclusive answer. ",
