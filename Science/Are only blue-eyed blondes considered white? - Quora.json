            "answer_text": "It really depends what country you\u2019re from. Race is a cultural construct, and each culture has its own definitions of \u201cwhite\u201d. Indians think light skin is better than dark skin, though it\u2019s a continuum over there. I hear that Persians have a similar complex. Italians think anyone who has hair lighter than dark brown is \u201cbionda\u201d (blonde). Americans think if you\u2019re from a Spanish-speaking country, you are \u201cnot white\u201d, even though Spain is Western European. They made up the \u201crace\u201d of \u201cHispanic\u201d just so they could express their racism towards anyone of Latin origin. My ex-wife is Swedish, but with dark hair and green eyes. She was often stopped by racist skinheads in Sweden demanding to know her origin, since she wasn\u2019t blonde enough to be a \u201creal Swede\u201d. Maybe the original poster of this question is from around there. ",

            "answer_text": "I have only ever seen questions like this from the US. It is very odd because they have a lot of ancestry from Britain and Ireland which are not blonde majority countries at all. Most people are brown-haired, from light to dark and only half of Brits are blue-eyed. So\u2026you are saying British and Irish people aren\u2019t white? The other country a lot of white Americans have descent from is Germany. Although in the north there are many blondes, not so much in the south. And how about within one family, where you might get one blonde sibling and one brunette. Despite having the same parents, would you honestly think one was \u2018white\u2019 and one not? ",
