            "answer_text": "Be as real as you can. Be yourself.  Every great introduction starts with a story. Tell a little bit of your background. What have you been doing in your life? What led you to create this channel. What\u2019s so unique about you that thousands other Youtube creators doesn\u2019t have? Communicate your USP (Unique Selling Proposition). Discuss about what value you and your channel are going to add in people\u2019s live. Remember, just be happy, positive, energetic and enthusiastic. I would suggest to do these things before uploading your introduction video: Write a proper script about your introductionRecord itWatch it as a viewer and pick out pros and consEdit. Edit. EditIf not satisfied, do it all over againOh, and one more thing; use a good camera and keep the sound quality smooth. Nobody wants to see a jittery video with your voice sounding as if you\u2019re speaking from inside of a cave. ",

The reason being, they don\u2019t know you, and they probably don\u2019t want to, they\u2019re here because of your content. So a simple, \u201cHey guys, welcome to SHOW NAME, I\u2019m your host NAME.\u201d Then get into the content from there. ",
