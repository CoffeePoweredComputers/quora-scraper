Here are my few recommendations. -Physical chemistry by Peter Atkins (detailed enough for undergraduate level and I will highly recommend) -By G W Castellan -By Glasstone One mentioned below I haven't read it but heard good enough reviews. -Physical Chemistry: A molecular approach by McQuarrie There are good set of online video lectures too. You can have a look there. ",
