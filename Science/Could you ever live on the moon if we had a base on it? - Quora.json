            "answer_text": "NO! YOU could not live on the moon; you could visit it, work there, stay there for short term but you could not live there as permanent resident. BUT your 20th generation potentially could if your children are born there, raised there and adapt to lunar environment. The biological intelligence needed to make lunar surface your home, even with a base, is insufficient for you. With no atmosphere, your biology will degrade fast. Your next generation will start showing some weaknesses but the issue of bone density would need to be corrected - biologically. You see, your species is designed for optimal function in Earth. The biology is just right for it. Exo-Earth settlement for any long term basis will always be artificial - meaning, for example, you will never - as a species - fully mature to adapt to a planetary or lunar environment where your biology was never designed to do well. Surely, however, you can attempt to colonize Earth-class planets but at circa 2018, at the time of this writing, the adverse pathogens of your species continue to dominate Earth at the expense of 85% of civilization they infected, and destroyed\u2026effectively destroying ancient history wherein lies many secrets that your species could benefit from. In other words, your species remains inhibited from fully maturing its capacity to effect technology needed to make it to the next Earth-class planet. And even once you get there, to think that we would invite you with open arms is, well, too arrogant of an assumption. The pathogens of your species were invited with open arms by Native Americans of your species. I believe they have since been eradicated by the infections these pathogens spread. Your species needs to work out a way to build solar shields on lunar surface to build any base that would allow you to stay there long term without having an adverse affect on your biology. If you keep focusing on shielding, your species will not evolve to adapt to lunar environment. So, can you live in a base? NO! Not on permanent basis. ",

            "answer_text": "Could you ever live on the moon if we had a base on it? Please allow me to caution you - your question needs refinement. I do not have the extreme wealth that a government or international business has so in that sense I could not create a \u201cbase\u201d on the Moon, let alone pay the \u201cbase\u201d to support my living there if there were a \u201cbase\u201d. Would I like to? Certainly. I believe the human race has to get into space seriously. All the energy of the Sun and all the resources of the solar system await us. \u201cBase\u201d needs more detail - would that be \u201coutpost\u201d or \u201ccolony\u201d? The European Space Agency has proposed a Moon Village, a scientific outpost with the potential of becoming an industrial center facilitating the expansion of humanity into the solar system  The people working in an \u201coutpost\u201d would work there for a modest amount of time and then return to Earth. Closed Loop Ecological System (CLES) will be necessary for reducing the great expense of transporting consumables. Do a Google Search [NASA Closed Loop Ecological System (CLES)] and consider how CLES might be implemented . . . it\u2019s complicated. A \u201ccolony\u201d would consist of more than a few researchers and would certainly require CLES. People would move there, have careers there, live there as families, raise their children there. As several of the people who have posted answers have said, there is the problem of probable physical deterioration in the one-sixth g of the Moon. One likely solution has been proposed for colonizing asteroid 433 Eros - an extensive rotating environment, essentially a city that has matured over a many iterations. It must have started off much, much smaller. MetroCircus, A City for an Asteroid, the Moon, or Mars  For asteroid 433 Eros, if the Metrocircus were about one kilometer in diameter, it would have to be running at about one revolutions every 73 seconds to produce an artificial gravity similar to Mars\u2019 gravity. At two kilometers in diameter, running at one RPM it would produce an artificial gravity similar to Earth\u2019s gravity. Note that there is a single small car. It is detachable so it can separate from the Metrocircus and allow for loading and offloading colonists and equipment. Here are vector diagrams with values for a lunar and a Martian Metrocircus.  Note that the cars of the Lunar Metrocircus, when they are not running around the track, will have to be supported against lunar gravity, but that's just another factor to be incorporated in the design.  Again, note that the cars of the Martian Metrocircus, when they are not running around the track, will have to be supported against Martian gravity, but that's just another factor to be incorporated in the design. For both the Martian and lunar Metrocircus the cars that are for loading and off-loading colonists and any equipment will not only have to be supported against the local gravity, but their interiors will need the ability to rotate into alignment with the direction of gravity - their floors should always be perpendicular to \u201cdown\u201d.

We don\u2019t know the effects of long term exposure to low gravity. It could be that after two or three years the body is so degenerated that the effect can not be reversed. But does this means you will die or just that you would die if you returned to Earth? No one experimented with humans other then on the space station where the crew is rotated back to Earth after only six months. No one knows the answer. The other part of this is economic. How to pay for living on the Moon. Either you most be a profesional astronaut and them your employer pays for it or you must be a billionaire who is willing to spend much of your billions to pay for living on the Moon and flying all the food, air and water that will be needed up to your new home. I think what many ppaople are overlooking is the living on the Moon or Mars means that you share a small enclosed space in a prusrized compartment with al the other people. Think of a six people living together in a single wide trailer that is buried underground. Going \u201coutside\u201d is a little bit more complex then a space station EVA. You would still need about 40 minutes to put on the space suit and two or three hours in the airlock \u201crebreathing\u201d pure oxygen and reduced pressure. You don\u2019t silly walk out the for. It is a three hour process because of the reduced pressure in the space suits. On the space stone they can come right back inside but on the mon or Mars the exterior of the suits will be contaminated and I imagine the airlocks will have t shower or many \u201ccar wash\u201d like spray system followed by air jets and finally dust filers. The suits would need to be very clean before to take them off. Bathing Moon or Mars dust of quite bad for your health. So for the most part you live indoors and under ground and robots do the work on the surface. I assume almost no one will want to live on Mars or the Moon when they find out what it is actually like there. Some profesional astronauts will enjoy their work there but they would be related back home as they are now on the space station. ",

If we could build a base I don\u2019t think it could sustain life for long. If it did sustain life for long then I think it would require very strict military discipline as if it were a submarine or navy ship. Everyone would need a job. I don\u2019t go in for that sort of hierarchy of command and discipline and routine and dangerous work myself. But that is what would be needed. Sealab was a technical and social bust. Now if we could get past all the above the atmosphere would not be of any appeal at all. The worst most miserable winters day in northern Maine would be wonderful in comparison. The hottest stickiest most miserable day in the tropics would be preferrable. One could never ever enjoy being outside. Never work or relax in the sun. Breathe the lovely crisp air or the breeze of the beautiful salty sea. Now I could never be happy with a lifetime inside like as if imprisonment were okay. Outside would be too hot or too cold to enjoy. If you trip and fall you risk a puncture and death. Even if they beam up everything so I could see all the first run films and watch and hear videos of all the music and watch the pats & Sox & bruins & celtics & revolution and surf the internet and check out facebook I think I\u2019d feel cut off from going to the theater or the game or restaurants or catching a jet to fly to somewhere for a change of language.

More so I would be able to see if Helium-3 is all so many people think it is. If it is then me and my fellow teammates, mining Helium-3 we would provide the world with a true solution to the dependence of oil. And if nothing else if a nuclear war broke out on the Earth, or a pandemic, or some asteroid crashed here killing billions. I could watch it all from the Moon. Also the Moon has enough water in the form of permafrost and enough resources for a well equipped colony to live there indefinitely. As long as the hydroponics worked as they should. We would have enough oxygen and food so no one went hungry. Or died because of lack of food. Once the climate on Earth became stable enough we could then travel back and rebuild Humanity. Of course rebuilding Humanity would be easier if a genetic vault was placed on that Moon colony. Together with the necessary technology for artificial gestation. Not to create clones mind you, but to use the several samples to create entirely new humans.  But still without any tragedy, building enough infrastructures on the Moon would greatly help Humanity as whole. So if one day we chose to make a move for Mars, we would have much more data on what works and what does not work. The Moon should've been a step taken immediately next to building the ISS. In a matter of fact it should've been made instead of building the ISS. But there's no turning back now. What was done was done. All we can do now is move forward. Or try to. ",

Yes humans could, but in addition to a base, with food and water, you would need a space suite when walking outside the base. . There is plenty of water on the Moon for all your needs, but you would have to grow your food in suitable pressurised greenhouses, and augmented by other foods from Earth. . But what would you do on the Moon and how long do you plan living there. ? . I should have made it clear that living on the Moon, would be subject to a time period and radiation levels. . You would need not just a roof over your head in a pressurised base, with food and water, and access to physical excercise, but you time would be limited depending on how your body handles the low gravity and other environmental, and mental conditions. . At a rough guess I would suggest anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months, at a time. It would be easier than in the International Space Station, where there is no gravity and very confined space to move around, and where you can\u2019t walk at all. ",

Though I must admit I would not be able to stay for long.Because of hormonal issues my bones degrade a bit faster than regular and with low gravity on the moon this would probably go even faster. I would enjoy the opportunity to go to space and observe the earthrise from the surface of the moon. I would enjoy the company of other people who have a passion for space. And then I would probably want to return home to Earth. One of the things I would miss the most in a moon station is the opportunity to travel. Humanity will not create a moon base large enough to stay long enough for a long long time to come. So at first the bases we\u2019ll see are cramped and small to be as efficient as possible and make it possible to lift units with our current rocket technology. Bases like that are good for research, for long term occupancy they are too small. ",

You ask \u201ccould I?\u201d and the answer is yes since your question brings into play, a base that assumes it has provisions to allow survival including ability to replicate low gravity. Now would I? Only if living on earth became impossible or substantially intolerable. Would not mind visiting for a short while. I am sure it would be facinating. Been looking at the moon in my telescope for my long life. I particularly remember a fall night in about 1954 as I scanned its surface and tried to imagine what it would be like to walk there. Only 15 years later I watched in awe as the feat was accomplished. It will be another 50 years later this year. My only disappointment is that with all this technological advancement, we seem no wiser, no more peaceful, and that much closer to annilation than we ever been. On second thought, maybe spending my last days on the moon really does makes sense! ",

(Not likely that I would be asked, unless they need someone to night calve on the Dark Side) As a space junkie since before I could read, and yes, I\u2019m of the generation that watched the Apollo landings and cried when Challenger went down, and as a Science Fiction writer it\u2019s a question I\u2019ve often wondered about. And, sadly, as much as I would love to go into space, I\u2019m not sure I could stand being stuck inside what would be a glorified prison for the rest of my life. I suppose if I could be guaranteed plenty of excursion and exploration time I would go, but if it meant staying inside the base itself I would have to pass. Too many years spent living under th eopen sky, I suppose. ",

A rotating habitat which consisted of a wheel like structure with an inclined floor facing inwards could in theory deal with this issue, but would be incredibly restrictive to live with on a daily basis. Imagine the hassle involved just trying to get out through the hub. If it was me personally, I\u2019d love to visit a moon base, but would not want to live on one. You would need a special kind of person to do that, maybe they could stock them with submariners, these guys are crazy enough to do this kind of thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes with difficulty. Besides having to create a habitat that is not only air-tight but will have to have the ability to scrub air and produce oxygen for long term settlement. There is also another big problem on the Moon, and that is the surface dust, which is very fine and very abrasive, dust that could have the ability to destroy equipment in mere hours. An efficient ultrasonic cleaning system will be needed in every airlock to stop the dust getting into the habitat. At this moment in time we only have space craft that will be able to carry small payloads to the Moon, so the construction of the a habitat will be very expensive. That is unless we use a orbital assembly system and tow large units to the Moon in some way. ",

But getting there would require that I be much younger and fitter than I am now, and although there may be rudimentary moon bases in the not too distant future, they will not be the comfy places shown in movies. And by the time they are, even if I am still around to enjoy them, I doubt that centenarians will be among those who can go to the Moon. That answer, of course, does not address the interest and excitement of being on another world; and if I were twenty or thirty years younger, my answer would be \u2014 YES! Just as soon as the Lunar Hilton is in operation, I\u2019d sell my house and hope I can net enough to pay for the trip. ",

Depending on the size of the base you may have in mind, it can be exorbitantly expensive to build and supply necessities there that cannot be manufactured or produced there . The key may lie in the economics of rocketry , so when it is solved then it will be all gravy ahead! I can only hope that the base and more of them if necessary will not spoil the natural face of the Moon as seen from here. I would not want any light pollution emanating out of the Moon surface or any unsightly developments at all. I can see that construction will be largely concrete so to be easily camouflaged sensibly,. No outdoor streetlights or floodlights ! ",

I would suspect that some time this century, will see the existence of Moon bases. However, I very much doubt if they are going to be (initially at least) for the ordinary tourist. They will be constructed for scientific purposes only. If I can recall correctly, the Moon is only about three days journey time, and so, getting there and back to Earth should not pose too much of a problem...relatively speaking that is. ",
