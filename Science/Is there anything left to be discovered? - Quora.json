            "answer_text": "Extensive unknown archaeological remains exist all over the earth. Detailed archaeological surveys of the surface of the earth are restricted to tiny portions of 1/10 of 1 percent. Doing a survey of a piece of terrain and sinking test pits is a slow business. Archaeologists often go for what they can find a surface indication of .That or they have evidence or an educated assumption that the area they are going to excavate has a high change of provided a return for their research. This assumption can be based on terrain - humans usually build structures near fresh water and other resources. Documentary sources, sedimentation that shows a habitation contaminated that source, etc. Even some of the easy stuff to find - huge mounds strewn with sherds have yet to be excavated in the Middle East. It will take many centuries to go through even the known sites. While it is probably the larger of the \u2018stone\u2019 civilizations and cultures have been found the \u2018wood\u2019 ones who built only in wood have perhaps not been. They are harder to find. Certain environments are also harder to excavate in, swamp, under the sea, jungle, tundra, mountains, etc. Political difficulties also delay or hamper excavations - such places like Somali, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraqi, etc. There are probably in excess of 2\u2013300,000 maritime wrecks that could be investigated - thousands of known or possible sites in the ME. It took over a century to excavate Baalbek, Giza is still being investigated. Good archaeology requires; time, massive amounts of man hours, money, expertise, will and an environment that permits it. Tons of sites buried under existing cities which make it very difficult to find. Good times for future archaeologists. ",

            "answer_text": "If you take space as the domain:  1) yet to realize a propulsion system to travel greater distances. The current chemical and electrical propulsions are pretty much useless when it comes to cover large distances as in between stars. It is also necessary to transfer greater loads off the earth's gravitational field. 2) we still don't know what is inside our earth! And no definite proof on how the magnetosphere of the earth exists. 3) yet to realize controlled nuclear fusion. And many more such as analysis of black holes, asteroids, quasars, other planets, long term effects of space on human beings, birth of humans in space, artificial gravity, good space suits... The list goes on. On earth: Yet to identify the cure for baldness! And common cold! Human genome mapping, communication with other animals, explore the depts of the ocean... Etc.So, as said by others, we are just getting started and there is a lot to be invented and discovered. ",
