            "answer_text": "You have to have some kind of idea what \u201cdropped\u201d means here. A million miles of string is going to be quite heavy. If you \u201cdrop\u201d a million miles of string in high gravity\u2014forget the blackhole\u2014the mass of that string is going to accelerate through its million-mile fall. And there\u2019s no string we know of that isn\u2019t going to snap under those forces. Just to envision that: A million miles of string might weigh something like 40 tons. So, imagine a moderate sized humpback whale.  Transport it to the top of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, about 60 miles up. Tie a 50-mile string around its tale. Hold one end of the string. And drop Whalesie. Woosh! Your intrepid cetacean picks up speed as he hurtles towards his very soon-to-be Earthly doom. You think that string is going to hold when the first shock flies back through that string? Well. 1 million miles is a much longer distance to accelerate over. And in space, where there\u2019s no air resistance to slow your speedy whale\u2026 it\u2019s easily going to snap any material we know of.  But to return to your hypothetical question, you would drop your string and see your string fall and fall and fall endlessly toward the blackhole, redshifting until the end were no longer visible. And, assuming you can even hold it, you would not be able to exert enough force on your string to pull it back up. Why, if you had an enormously large reservoir of energy to reel in the string, you\u2019d again find that somewhere, the string had snapped. But far more importantly, 1 million miles is about 4x the distance from the Earth to the Moon. And so there are much bigger questions, given the characteristics of this blackhole, whether you\u2019re even alive to reel it in. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you asking if you lower a string into a black hole, could you pull on the string and extract it from the hole? The answer is no. I'll let other question answers go into details about why but I'll just leave you with a little bit of black hole knowledge. To understand black holes at all you have to understand that spacetime is curved. In curved spacetime straight lines curve in strange ways. We can see that even on the earth, as two objects moving due north, parallel to eachother from the equator, moving in a straight line, will meet at the north pole - two parallel straight lines converge in the curved spacetime of the earth. In black holes this effect is even greater. Once to pass the event horizon, there is no straight path which will take out out of the event horizon because the spacetime is curved to such a ludicrous degree that effectively every direction is down. Any two straight lines, in any direction, even diametrically opposed, will curve back down towards the singularity. If you took an indestructible ruler and placed it in a black hole, and extended it to infinity, the ruler would be straight as an arrow, but both ends would be in side the singularity, for the same reason that the parellel walkers on earth in the last paragraph met at the north pole. So if you consider your string, if you dip it into the black hole and try to pull it out, the string itself has nowhere to go except deeper into the black hole. You're pulling it in a direction which is so wildly distorted by spacetime curvature that it doesn't even exist in the reference frame of the string beneath the event horizon. ",
