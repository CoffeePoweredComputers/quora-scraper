            "answer_text": "How many potatoes should you make per person for mashed potatoes? I can always use the leftovers, and my kids always loved spuds, so I\u2019d do at least 2 large spuds per kid. A lot less for older folks, and other small appetites. But, it\u2019s always better to make too much, rather than not enough. Spuds are cheap. Good tucker. You can just about live on them. == FWIW: reposted: ========= We had had to make do in the beginning. Mum cooked, Dad supplied:- I don\u2019t know if you read my earlier story - Wayne T's answer to Have you ever run away from home? - but we were a bit poor and a bit remote when I was a young human. My dad used to travel 40 miles to the Victoria market by foot, bus and train, and come home with heavy sugar bags or potato sacks full of whatever vegies they\u2019d sell off cheaply at the market\u2019s close on a Saturday, (he had to feed 6 of us on bugger-all money. Our diet was very much \u2018pot luck\u2019 sometimes. We had chooks, ducks, and goats, too. The goats gave milk and more goats, the chooks gave eggs and chicks, but neither the ducks nor the chooks were long for this world once they were of \u2018Sunday dinner\u2019 size or not laying, and the younger goats were looking worried.) One week the market had a lot of cheap spuds and not much else. Dad bought bags full of the things. We were eating the damn spuds for a fortnight or more: Sauteed, fried, grilled, mashed, boiled, stuffed, barbecued, roasted, in pies, topping shepherds pies, deep-fried chips, and potato cakes, peeled and in their bloody jackets, and as bloody soups\u2026 Then he planted a bunch of those left over. At least we didn\u2019t run out of ammo for our spud guns. Thank God for Mums and Dads\u2026 :) :) :) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how your fellow diners like mashed potatoes. I use one large russet potato for two people, but once cooked five pounds of russets for lunch for four people (thinking I would have leftovers to make potato cakes the next day). One of the guests, a young teen with a love for potatoes, dived into the pot and finished it off. There were no potato cakes the next day, but I had a happy young guest. Try to use russets, unless you are looking for a more plain and homey dish. The russets will be lighter and fluffy. ",
