            "answer_text": "To conduct scientific research one has to have a theory or hypothesis that can be tested. One such test is that if a particular test is repeated in the same environment then the proberbility is that the same outcome will be achieved. So basically scientific research needs to form an idea, determine a way to test it. Open your findings to the scientific community for discussion and further testing. A theory will attract support from those that have similar theories or those who have theories which are strengthened by the new research and ultimately a theory will be accepted or rejected. That said theories can go in and out of fashion. And unless totally undisputable theories remain open to challenge and or amendment indefinitely. When doing research there are practicalities to be taken into account for example having a control groups and for experiments carried out in the same way have a proberbility that the outcomes will be consistent. One other basic requirement is the research acts n a neutral way putting aside bias that are formed by previous knowledge and socialisation which could prejudice their findings. ",

            "answer_text": "Research has the purpose of discovery. Research endeavors to find out things that are interesting. Hell, even if it isn\u2019t all that interesting, it might be worthy of research. Scientific research uses the scientific method. One can do research without staying on the scientific pathway, but science requires certain techniques and attitudes to be followed. These rules came out of the age of the mid 1600s when science was born in an effort to dismiss authority. Of course this was a time of kings and popes, and \u201cscientific\u201d notions supported by the authority. \u201cNullius in Verba\u201d was the new saying. On the word of no man was the idea that changed the world. In Missouri they call it \u201cshow me\u201d. In engineering it is called: :\u201dshow up and do the job\u201d. What it really means is that we all should be skeptical of pontificaters. The veracity of a scientific statement is determined by the quantity and quality of the experimental evidence. You have a hypothesis? Frigging\u2019 do it Hoss. Or shut the F up. ",
