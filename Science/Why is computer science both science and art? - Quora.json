            "answer_text": "This question is a little confusing, so I will try to answer the different possible meanings. First, \"computer science\" as a discipline is considered a branch of logic, which is a branch of mathematics. Mathematics, for reasons known only to the Victorians, was classified as a Humanity. Technically, Humanities are not Arts but the two are often confused. By this line of reasoning, computer science is a humanity and thus assumed to be an art. Computer Science, as a field, is experimental, replicable and driven by hypothesis. This qualifies it as a \"science\", although if Computer Science qualifies then so does all of mathematics. It's a very poor ontology. The second line of reasoning splits software development into three different categories - the sciences (where the software is a model of a system from which a hypothesis about the system can be obtained), engineering (where the software is designed and developed as per standard engineering practices and philosophies) and the arts (software being an expression of a perspective, not the perspective itself). Thus, the direction you look at the software determines what it is. Frankly, I hold that the division between sciences and art (which is modern and largely arbitrary) and also between science and engineering (which is also modern and arbitrary) interferes with understanding, rather than illuminates. The entire ontology (ie: model of how things connect and relate) is a hopeless mess with no meaningful relationship to how subjects and disciplines actually connect and relate. As such, unless you are provided with a clear-cut association between a subject and a label, ignore the label. A label that says nothing and describes nothing means nothing. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you define \"art.\"If your definition of art is \"the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power,\" then CS is not an art. (As a counter example, Architecture does combine both engineering skills and this definition of Art) If your definition of art is \"a skill acquired by experience, study, or observation,\" which is more \"craftsmanship\" than \"art, \" then probably, but then this term applies also to many other sciences and professions as well. There are always certain people who elevate their profession to an art form. The term \"science\" in CS refers more to its relationship to \"studying through logic\" (the original, broader term of science - as discussed by Plato) than the modern definition  of the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.)  For example, an alternative term is \"Computer Engineering.\" ",
