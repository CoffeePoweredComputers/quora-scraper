            "answer_text": "In science fiction universes, traveling the galaxy is a snap \u2013 just engage the \u201cwarp\u201d or \u201chyperspeed\u201d drive, and off you go, cruising the cosmos at several times the speed of light. But back in reality, we\u2019ve all been taught that the speed of light is a strict traffic law that can\u2019t be broken. This is true, but slightly misleading.Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, first published in 1905, asserted that the speed of light is a constant (300 million meters per second), no matter who measures it. It\u2019s always the same whether you are in motion or at rest. This line of thinking is a lot different than we\u2019re used to experiencing. For example, if you try to measure the speed of an oncoming car from a moving vehicle, you end up getting the combined speed of both cars. This is why cops have to stay parked. Light is different, because no matter what you\u2019re doing it always goes the same speed.The speed of light affects us more than we realize \u2013 it helps us understand the difference between cause and effect. If things could move faster than the light we see them by, we\u2019d be in for weird experiences. If you were a catcher trying to catch a superluminal fastball, you might feel the ball hit your glove even before the pitcher starts his wind-up: The effect before the cause. That\u2019s because the image of object would be traveling at the speed of light, trailing the faster baseball like the slower sound of thunder trails after the image of lightning.Now that we have a taste for Einstein\u2019s theory, we know that baseballs don\u2019t go faster than the speed of light. But is there anything that can? It turns out that the speed of light is only a limit on objects \u2013 like baseballs \u2013 as they move through space. The movement of space itself, however, can make the speed of light seem slow.Right after the Big Bang, the universe had a monstrous growth-spurt called inflation. The whole thing was over in less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, but the universe grew exponentially in that brief blip, repeatedly doubling in size. At the end of inflation, although the universe was still smaller than a car, the outer edge had traveled many times faster than the speed of light. Since then, the universe has continued its expansion, but at a more reasonable, steady pace.This ultra-fast growth seems to contradict what we\u2019ve just discussed, but it makes sense if you understand the distinction between expansion and motion. When astronomers say that the universe is expanding, they\u2019re talking about the rather abstract concept of space-time. Basically, space-time is the three physical dimensions of our existence-length, breadth and depth-combined with the additional dimension of time; think of it as a wire grid that connects every part of the universe to every other part. When we say an object has motion, we\u2019re referring to its change in position relative to the space-time grid. The speed of light is only a constraint for objects that exist within space-time, not for space-time itself.To better visualize the theory, astronomers often illustrate the expanding universe as a loaf of raisin bread rising in the oven. The raisins are galaxies and the rising dough represents space-time. As the dough expands, the raisin galaxies find themselves farther apart from each other, even though they are not moving relative to the dough between them.Now let\u2019s imagine that there\u2019s a beetle in the loaf and it starts crawling toward a faraway raisin (don\u2019t worry- we\u2019re not going to eat it anyway). The beetle represents anything within space, such as baseballs, spaceships or photons. When the beetle burrows through the bread, he is moving relative to the dough, and all the other raisins. The speed of light limits how fast the beetle can travel, but not how quickly the bread can rise. Just because the expansion of space can break the speed limit, it doesn\u2019t mean that we can go faster than Einstein said we could.So, while the speed of light remains an unbreakable barrier for those of us within the universe, it can\u2019t limit the expansion of space-time itself. The universe keeps right on expanding, but the speed of light limits how much of it we can see, and how fast we can move. It may not be fair, but that\u2019s physics. ",

            "answer_text": "The current rate of expansion of the universe is thought to be about 7070 km/s per megaParsec A megaparsec is a unit of distance approximately equal to three million light-years. This rate is not a speed, it is a speed per distance, so it cannot be compared to a speed (like that of light). The SI units are actually inverse time, or per second, since the distances cancel out. We can say that two objects separated by a megaparsec (roughly the distance between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies) would further separate at a speed of 70km/s due to the expansion of space. As it happens these two particular objects are approaching each other faster than that (at about 300km/s) because of gravity and will merge in a vast cosmic dance in about four billion years. Objects separated by more than four thousand megaparsecs (about 12 billion light-years) do further separate at a speed exceeding that of light: this radius gives us the Hubble volume. The current observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter, so most of it is separating from us faster than the speed of light. We can still see objects beyond the Hubble Volume for two reasons: The object may have been within the Hubble Volume when the light was emitted; andThe size of the Hubble Volume is dependent on the rate of expansion which is a function of time.The world-line of the light reaching us is therefore a complicated integral of its constant peculiar velocity over its location, the rate of expansion, and time. [Thanks to Giacomo Baso for his comment and reference to a paper which made these details clear. Check out that paper if you want the details!] The rate of expansion is slowly increasing and, given time, distant objects will move beyond the event horizon. This is a different event horizon than that of a Black Hole: it is defined as the surface from which emitted light would not reach us in even infinite time. It depends on the future evolution of the rate of expansion of the universe and is, typically, more distant than the Hubble Sphere. Beyond the event horizon objects will not be observable in any way and will have effectively left our universe. It is thought that this will eventually happen to all objects in the universe beyond our Local Group of galaxies and, depending on unknown details of the long term evolution of Dark Energy, may even lead to a Big Rip in which all matter is torn apart :-( ",

            "answer_text": "When we say the universe expands, we mean that all distances in the universe become larger with time. Moreover, they all become larger at the same rate, everywhere in the universe. We can measure this rate of expansion of space by asking ourselves: \"How long will it take until all distances become twice as long?\". The answer turns out to be a bit complicated. However, if we make some simplifying assumptions, most importantly that a parameter called the Hubble parameter is constant and will remain constant forever, we can get the following answer: At the current rate of expansion, distances in the universe will become twice as long in approximately 9 billion years. The universe itself will become 8 times as large, because it's 3-dimensional, and each dimension will become 2 times as large. 23=823=8. Notice that this means the farther away a galaxy is from us, the faster it would seem to move. Why? Let's see: A galaxy that is 1 million light years from us now will be 2 million light years from us in 9 billion years. So it would seem to move 1 million light years during that time.Another galaxy, that is now 2 million light years from us, will be 4 million light years from us in 9 billion years. So it would seem to move 2 million light years during that same time.Yet another galaxy, that is now 4 million light years from us, will be 8 million light years from us in 9 billion years. So it would seem to move 4 million light years during the same amount of time as the other two!This observation, that farther away galaxies move faster from us, is called Hubble's law. Of course, in the simple examples I gave above I didn't take into account that the galaxies are, in fact, already moving. However, their speeds at such close distances are small enough that it wouldn't matter. What about the relation to the speed of light? Well, all the galaxies that currently less that roughly 14 billion light years from us all move slower than light with respect to us. However, Hubble's law says that galaxies farther away move faster, so galaxies that are currently more than 14 billion light years from us move faster than light with respect to us. Is there a contradiction with relativity here? No, because nothing is actually moving faster than light. There's a \"loophole\" here that comes from the fact that speed is something that you measure relative to space, but in this case space itself is expanding, so speeds are no longer meaningful. It's like standing on a moving sidewalk (usually found at airports). You can be perfectly still, and not move at all with respect to the moving sidewalk, but the sidewalk itself is still moving. In conclusion: Space is expanding at a constant rate, not a speed. Things in space, like galaxies, move because space itself is expanding. Their speed relative to us is proportional to their distance from us. So if they're far enough (namely more than 14 billion light years), they move faster than light. They move at that speed whether they want to or not, because space itself is moving. (For anyone interested in how I arrived at 9 billion years, and knows some cosmology: I solved the equation a\u02d9/a=Ha\u02d9/a=H where aa is the cosmological scale factor and HH is the Hubble parameter. Assuming that HH is constant, the solution is a=eHt=2Ht/log2a=eHt=2Ht/log\u20612. This means that aa doubles itself after a time t=log2/Ht=log\u20612/H, which evaluates to roughly 9 billion years.)

            "answer_text": "Rather than throw a bunch of math or concepts at you, let me explain why that question makes no sense by an analogy that is simultaneously accurate to the physics and easier to understand. Suppose I had a ruler that was getting longer, and ask the question: \u201chow fast is this ruler expanding?\u201d Consider: How would you get a speed out of that? Well, I could measure how fast the endpoints were moving away from each other, I suppose. However, then a ruler twice as long would be expanding at twice the speed, even if it is expanding at the same \u201crate\u201d (in the sense that it takes just as long for one inch to grow into two inches). And if you wanted an infinite ruler (think the number line, if you want - an infinite line with a tick mark at regular intervals), you don\u2019t have endpoints to measure from. So the \u201crate\u201d at which the ruler expands can\u2019t really be talked about in terms of a speed. However, you could ask a question like: \u201cIf I wait one second, how many current-inches will be in a future-inch?\u201d (Or, more precisely, you use calculus to take a limit rather than averaging over one second, but same idea). In others\u2019 answers, this corresponds to taking the time derivative of the scale factor and dividing by the scale factor; i.e., dotaadotaa - one can consider this to be the rate that the universe is expanding at relative to its current size, if you want. So even though you can talk about the rate at which the universe expands, you can\u2019t really talk about the speed at which it expands. That said, like the ruler case, even though you can\u2019t talk about the rate of expansion of the ruler, you can talk about the speed of the endpoints of the ruler, relative to some fixed reference point. In this case, the \u201cfixed\u201d reference point would be Earth* and the \u201cendpoints\u201d of the universe are not actual edges of the universe, but rather the edges of the observable universe. These endpoints move away from us at exactly the speed of light - in fact, one might even say that this is (more-or-less) how we define the observable universe: by those things which move away from us at less than the speed of light. (Others have discussed cosmological redshift; what you need to know of that here is that the points which move away \u201cfaster than the speed of light\u201d are so far redshifted that they become invisible.) For a more technical take (like others\u2019) that also explains things like inflation, see: The Universe Never Expands Faster Than the Speed of Light. *Some technicalities here involving how we measure the speed of the earth using the cosmic microwave background, but what I presented is essentially correct.

            "answer_text": "With my unscientific but imaginative view, In my opinion, there is two kind of space. One of them our usually space with time. Our space-time is have been expanding since big-bang. It contains this energy (of big-bang) and distributing wavy. The second space is outer space, ther is no energy, so no time. Only but only nothingness. Our universe is expanding in it. Also I think, our universe has a spin. This spin causes to expanding after bigbang.If I called as \"A\" the starting point coordinates of our universe according to this nothingness space, our current border of our universe can be at a circle/sphere/torus \"B\"...I think, this distance between \"A\" and \"B\" is enlarging at a rate \"C\" (speed of light) per distance. Because every rate in expanding causes to a new wave for our universe and this waves are spreading in the all universe. This rate is limiting maxiumum speed.We can determine and calculate separation speed of galaxies in universe, like ants at inner surface of a ballon. We can see and determine objects wich are moving away in/on this surface and we have numbers about that. But If we can see only a few percent of our universe, our assumptions and calculations will be relative. We have to find the distance between \"A\" and \"B\".  Current science says that, everywhere is already \"A\" . Ofcourse as logical, the result is true. Everywhere is \"A\". But my knowledge is insufficeint about proof of this. I did not read like any survey (It is my fault).and I think according to nothinness space, A was only a coordinate point.  Until now humanity already try to understand universe from in, but I think, we have to imagine also from out, in order to understand. There could be no valid data about \"outside\", but all big triumphs was started with an imagination. Now your answer, I think universe is expanding with the rate \"C\", but it's speed should be different accoding to IABI, we can now calculate separation speed of only near observable objects. But without knowing lenght of all circumference of our universe, the will be only relative... ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll often hear that \u201cthe universe is expanding faster than the speed of light\u201d. However, this statement is akin to statements like \u201cgreen is bigger than happy\u201d. It\u2019s not even wrong. There are two big things to remember about the expansion of the universe. First, the universe doesn\u2019t expand at a particular speed, it expands at a speed per distance. Right now it\u2019s about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. That means that galaxies that are about 1 megaparsec (1 parsec = 3 lightyears and change) away are presently getting farther away at the rate of 70 km every second, on average. Galaxies that are 2 megaparsecs away are presently getting father away at the rate of 140 km every second, on average. Notice the awkward phrasing there: distant galaxies are \u201cgetting farther away\u201d, but oddly enough they are not \u201cmoving away\u201d.  Initially, the distance between Red and Yellow is 1, and the distance between Red and Green is 2. After doubling the size of the \u201cuniverse\u201d the distances are 2 and 4, respectively. Yellow receded by 1, but Green receded by 2. Green would seem to be \u201cmoving\u201d faster than Yellow, but in fact all of the dots are sitting still while the space they inhabit expands. The easiest way to think about the expansion of the universe is to think about the expansion of something simpler, like a balloon. If for some reason you have a balloon covered in ants, and you inflate it slowly, then the ants that are nose-to-nose (pardon, \u201cantennae-to-antennae\u201d) with each other will barely notice the expansion. However, the farther two ants are apart, the more the expansion increases the distance between them. If an ant on one side tries to run to one of her sisters on the far side of the balloon, she may find that the distance between the two of them is increasing faster than she can close that distance. The distance at which this happens (where the rate at which the distance decreases because of the movement of the ant and the rate at which the distance increases due to the expansion of the balloon) is a kind of \u201cant horizon\u201d. Any pair of ants that are already farther apart than this distance can never meet, and any pair closer than this distance may (if they want). In the picture above, if an ant can run a distance of 2 during the expansion time, then an ant starting at the yellow point could reach the red point, but an ant starting at the green point will always find itself maintaining the same distance from the red point. The \u201cant horizon\u201d is a decent enough analog for the edge of the visible universe. The speed at which the ant runs is described with respect to the part of the balloon it\u2019s presently standing on and the speed at which light travels is with respect to the space it travels through (technically with respect to objects that are \u201csitting still\u201d in space). The oldest photons we see are those that have come from just barely on the near side of the distance at which light can\u2019t close the gap. It\u2019s not that things beyond that distance are moving away faster than light (almost all the galaxies and gas and whatnot are moving slowly with respect to \u201cthe balloon\u201d), it\u2019s that the light they emit just isn\u2019t moving fast enough to overcome the expansion. Light beyond that is still moving at light speed, and it may even be trying to move toward us, but the distance is simply expanding too fast. Here the analogy breaks down and starts making our intuition incorrect. When you inflate a balloon the sides are obviously moving apart. You can use a rule (maybe a tape measure) and a stopwatch and you can say \u201cdudes and dudettes of the physics world, the speed of expansion is ____\u201d. Even worse, when a balloon expands it expands into the space around it, which begs the question \u201cwhat is the universe expanding into?\u201c. But keep in mind, all that physics really talks about is the relationship between things inside of the universe (on the surface of the balloon). If you draw a picture on the surface of a balloon, then if the balloon is dented somewhere or even turned inside-out, the picture remains the same (all the distances, angles, densities, etc. remain the same). Point of fact: it may be that the balloon is a completely false metaphor for the universe as a whole, since the best modern measurements indicate that the universe is flat. That is, rather than being a closed sphere (hypersphere) it just goes forever in every direction. This means that there is genuinely no way to describe the expansion of the universe in terms of a speed (there\u2019s no \u201cfar side of the balloon\u201d to reference). It\u2019s a little subtle (\u201csubtle\u201d = \u201cmath heavy\u201d), but there are a number of phenomena that allow astronomers to clearly tell the difference between things \u201cmoving away\u201d and things \u201cexpanding away\u201d from us. For example, beyond a certain distance galaxies no longer get smaller (the way things that are moving away should), instead they get redder and stay about the same size independent of distance, due to a lensing effect of the expansion. Isn\u2019t that weird? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, that is the conclusion of those theories that have it. However, this isn't a problem. Nothing can go faster than light. Nothing material can even go at the speed of light. However, this is local. It's true everywhere and everywhen in the universe. But the only thing you can do with General Relativity is start somewhere and move and see how your clocks and rulers work, and different paths will get different results. At big distances, this doesn't work to get a single idea. You cannot simply divide a distance by a time and get a speed, in the general case. You have to be very careful with your math. Any overall picture you get in your head of the universe, like, well, the universe is so many light years across and so many years old now, and hey, that seems to be faster than c, is bogus. Guaranteed. All that intuition we have fails to work. It all involves imagining that you can understand distances that great in terms of Galilean ideas, which are known to be completely wrong. People do it anyway, because people want a picture. However, if you are going to take one aspect of relativity, such as the constancy of c, you have to take everything about relativity. You cannot simple pick and choose. Even under Special Relativity, there are problems. Take Barnard's Star. (Please!) It's about six light years away. So, you can intuit that the light has been traveling for six years, and so you are seeing it six years ago. That's sort of OK given enough caveats. Then you say, \"gee, I wonder what it's like now.\" That isn't even a meaningful concept. Depending on the observer, \"now\" can mean anything from six years ago to arbitrarily close to your now. ",

            "answer_text": "The farther things are from us, the faster they recede from us. How far does something have to be for the expansion to be noticeable? Well... The universe is very big. The distance to the Moon is almost ten times the length of the Equator. The Sun is almost 400 times as far away as the Moon from us. The nearest star is almost 300,000 times as far away as the Sun. The center of our own Milky Way is almost 6000 times as far away as the nearest star. And the nearest great galaxy (Andromeda) that is like our own Milky Way is almost 80 times as far from us as the center of our own Milky Way. Light takes some two million years to reach us from there. Now as it turns out, Andromeda is not receding from us at all; rather, the Milky Way and Andromeda are on a collision course (a collision that will take place billions of years from now, so no need to worry.) But that is because the relative motion of these two galaxies is determined by their local dynamics and mutual gravity, which overwhelm the expansion. If there was only the expansion, Andromeda would be receding from us at a speed of roughly 40 km/s, or about 144,000 km/h (90,000 mph). Despite its incredible distance from us, Andromeda is still part of our local neighborhood (which is why the local dynamics dominates over the expansion). At the other extreme, there is \"light\" in the form of the cosmic microwave background, emitted by the hot gas that filled the universe 13.7 billion years ago. That gas is receding from us at a speed that is within a tiny fraction of the speed of light, that is, 300,000 km/s (roughly a billion kilometers or 675 million miles per hour). ",

            "answer_text": "My humble opinion, it is both. It is a matter of quantum relativity. If the expansion is moving faster than light, then light is a particle. If the expansion is moving slower, it is a wave. And it is a quantum reality that the light is both at the same time. Wherefore in my mind the answer is, it is a matter of quantum relativity and position perspective. Look at it this way, we look at galaxies and stars around our own and say, \u201clook they are moving away from us\u201d and yet we are looking into the past because they are light years away, wherefore one might say, \u201cIn the past things moved away from each other very fast, does that mean they are really moving towards us?\u201d That is not what is happening either. The conclusion must be that, the present time is position relative. We measure speed by saying, that an object is moving an amount of distance in an amount of time, but time is relative. Therefore distance is also relative. We say, the further we look out into space, the faster things are moving away from each other, but if we were on the other side looking back we would experience the same thing. So how can this be? My thought experiments show that this is due to the mono pole effect of gravity. No matter where you are, you the center of the observable universe, but the universe itself has no center.

Two points very close move apart quite slowly, but two points on opposite sides of the balloon are moving away from each other (in all direction by the same amount in fact) quite quickly when confining your measurements to the surface of the balloon. You might be tempted to say, how about the diameter, like the diameter of the balloon, we don't have access to that perspective. We can use the balloon model of the universe to help us understand the universe universe that wraps around on itself, the balloon is a two dimensional surface warped around into a third dimension, our universe is like a three dimensional version of the balloons surface wrapped around onto itself in a fourth dimension, but this is just a model, the fourth dimension isn't traversable like our three dimensions. Its also possible that the universe is infinite in size in which case instead of balloon it would be a rubber sheet infinite in size being stretch out evenly in all directions of its 2D space, in this version of our universe there is not limit to how far away to points can be and how fast they are moving away from each other.

            "answer_text": "Thanks MM for the request on this question\u2026 There are many qualified answers below, yet perhaps the \u2018qualified\u2019 is the \u2018assumption\u2019 the universe is expanding. In business/finance we used to issue \u2018qualified\u2019 opinions\u2026.kind of cover your butt answers. Most of the previous answers have in them \u2018Hubble\u2019 parameter and \u2018speed of light\u2019 etc etc\u2026 And if you follow the history you will understand more about the redshift and parameter and universe is in expansion beliefs. If you follow their math/physics, you will understand more about \u2018dark energy\u2019 \u2018QFT\u2019 etc etc. And when you combined it all in a \u2018big picture\u2019 and \u2018the results\u2019 with critical thinking, I ask how can anyone believe it? Expansion of the universe belief is the biggest blunder of science, bar none. Hubble\u2019s 1929 redshift precipitated expansion beliefs and the later 1998 \u2018increasing rate of expansion\u2019 which has led science to trying to justify/explain it. Which has led to imagining what propels the expansion (redshift) between galaxies which is what led to \u2018something=dark energy\u2019, which they say comes from \u2018nothing\u2019. So now they have something from nothing physics with the postulate about \u2018the speed of light\u2019; which has led them to being illogical, and so, false assumptions= false beliefs. They are trying to prove why the universe is \u2018expanding at an increasing rate\u2019 when it is not expanding. Expansionist believe the expansion is measured/proved by the redshift observed; quoting Stein\u2019s answer : \u2018The expansion of the universe is measured by the Hubble parameter, which has units of 1/time. Astronomers typically quote the Hubble parameter today (and many incorrectly call it the Hubble \"constant\", but it is not constant), and give it in units of ~70 km/s/Mpc. km and Mpc are both units of length, so this really has units of 1/time.\u2019 That redshift, Hubble\u2019s Data (of redshift b/w galaxies) led to the Hubble Parameter being used in Einstein\u2019s Field Equation. Einstein first stated/believed the universe was \u2018static\u2019 or in stable orbits (his equation was without a \u2018constant\u2019 to account for change/expansion or contraction) ((a constant is a term used in an equation, algebra 101)). After Einstein extrapolated his numbers he put in another term(constant) in his equation, a \u2018contraction\u2019 constant. Then, Einstein changed the constant to expansion in when Hubble found redshift from distant galaxies\u2026.all the other (errors) precipitated from there/that. They still believe the universe is expanding, because of the redshift data\u2026. And that \u2018assumption\u2019 about light, whether \u2018redshift\u2019 or \u2018speed of light\u2019 postulate, (causing errors) is the false belief/assumption/perception that the \u2018expansion\u2019 of the universe rest in. And that \u2018rest in\u2019 is getting very restless when reading my answers\u2026 So, now, get out of that error/box to fast forward to now/logic and Snell\u2019s ToE: If you can understand that there is \u2018endless\u2019 redshift at the event horizon of most galaxies\u2019 black holes, which is redshift being evident in a \u2018contraction\u2019 event (the galaxies are contracting into their black hole). There is endless redshift at the event horizon (redshift=expansion to expansion believers) and galaxies are contracting. Then you might be able to understand the \u2018redshift\u2019 of Hubble\u2019s Data is also \u2018redshift\u2019 in a contraction event, a contracting universe=Snell\u2019s ToE. Just because redshift is detected, does not mean expansion is (always) assumed; as is what \u2018dark energy, expansionist, QFT\u2019 science has assumed: \u2018the universe is expanding because redshift is detected\u2019. My ToE explains it simplistically\u2026 there is much more to the ToE/explanation but the outline/premise is laid/solved:  If it helps you understand, consider it a gift. douG ",

            "answer_text": "The expansion of the universe is such that, if we consider a galaxy at a distance, d, away from us, (greater than a few million light years), its velocity of recession, v, is given by the expression; v=Hxd, where H is Hubble\u2019s constant. This expresses the rule that Hubble discovered in 1929. It isn\u2019t that the galaxy is actually moving away from us, through space, but rather that the space between us and this galaxy has been expanding, since the beginning of the universe. So, the red shift of a distant galaxy is not a Doppler shift, it's a cosmological shift, due to the expansion of space, while photons are in transit. The further a photon travels, the longer ago was it emitted, and the greater the red shift that it will have. It just so happens that this is the only rule that is seen to be the same wrt any point in the universe. So, any and every point, in the universe, looks like the centre of expansion. This agrees with Einstein\u2019s idea that the universe should be homogeneous, and look the same, at large scales, at any and every point. Whatever value H has, there is some distance, d(h), at which Hxd(h)=c. This defines the Hubble horizon of our universe. However, if we could travel that distance, at superdooper-extreme-ultra light speed, we would find that things look very much the same, on a large scale, as things look to us from the earth. It has been recently discovered that the rate of the expansion of the universe is increasing. So, H is no longer a constant - it is very slowly increasing. At the moment, with the present value of H, which is 73.8 km/sec/Mpc, d(h) = 13.4 billion light years. ",

If you fix one point on the elastic, from that point of view, every other point moved away at some speed, but points closer to it moved slower. Instead, what you can say is that the elastic expanded at a rate of 2s2s. It\u2019s the same with the expansion of the universe. Points close to Earth move away very slowly, but points very far away (15 billion lightyears or further) move away from Earth faster than the speed of light \u2014 relative to the position of Earth. This does not violate the law that nothing can accelerate to a speed higher than the speed of light \u2014 each individual star or planet is moving at speeds much slower. It\u2019s just that more space is being created between the stars. For a lot more information, see Expansion of the universe - Wikipedia. ",

It seems crazy right!? But apparently it's what's happening. I guess the shortest answer would be that no object can move in space faster than the speed of light, but that doesn't apply to the fabric of the universe itself. That observations seem to show that the further away from us a galaxy is the faster it's moving. So some galaxies might be moving 2 times faster than the speed of light, while others are moving way faster than that. But to make things even more trickier, if you were on one said galaxies, then to you we'd be the one's moving faster than the speed of light, not them. It would be like the difference between being an observer inside a river going downstream, and being an observer looking at the river current. So when we look at the farthest galaxies, we are looking from the perspective of one ridding the river, but when we look at the galaxies closest to us then we are looking from the perspective of someone on the margin of the river. Now. You could say \u201cBut how can that be? We're either moving faster than the speed of light or we aren't?\u201d and that's just it. In the galaxies apparently already moving way pass the speed of light, the speed of light limit still applies. The stars and planets aren't moving faster than light, what astronomers seem to indicate is that the space between us and those galaxies is the thing moving faster than the speed of light, not the galaxies themselves. Seems confusing? Yeah\u2026 Tell me about it. It's one monumental headache and no amount of aspirin can fix it. Here you go. A more in depth explanation. Although it will not help you understand this any better. It simply gives you more information. Can The Universe Expand Faster Than The Speed Of Light? ",

            "answer_text": "It's sort of apples and oranges.  Light speed means something is going from place A to place B, really fast. It is traversing space. Space expanding, however, isn't traversing space. It's space getting bigger. People use the analogies of raisin bread rising, so the raisins are carried apart even though they're not moving relative to the dough, or the stretching of a ruler so it gets longer, or dots on an expanding balloon.   But, I think I get what you mean: can space expand so quickly or things be so far apart, that the expansion of space will carry them apart so their relative motion is faster than the speed of light? The answer is YES. As far as we can tell, beyond the space we can see is just more space. On and on. So at ANY expansion rate of space, with enough distance between A and B, the space between them can expand faster than light. Light from A would never reach B. You could never travel there, communicate with B, or even see it. Eventually, if humans are still around, we might only be able to see our own galaxy, with everything else being carried away by the expansion of space. If we lose the records, we'd never figure out how the universe formed.  (Note: this doesn't violate the rule about c. nothing is traversing space faster than c. These two places could never outrun a photon. Any photon they measured would still be going c.)  And since the data suggests the rate of expansion is picking up, this could potentially happen fast and relatively near (albeit, far in the future). The big Rip theory posits that spacetime itself could be eventually torn apart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip  ",

            "answer_text": "Locally it expands the space between the Earth and the Sun by 5 meters per year.[1] according to the referenced study. The calculated amount should be a little more than 11 meters per year. The variance is unexplained completely but the details are not directly measurable either as the Earth / Sun tidal recession works out to 4.76x10\u22129m/s4.76x10\u22129m/s and the effect of the Hubble Parameter works out to 3.59x10\u22127m/s3.59x10\u22127m/s both combined are too far below the detectable level with the variations of Earths orbit locally, however, over longer timeframes it should be. The universe is 879,873,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers across. Using the mean measured Hubble Constant of 75 kilometers per second per megaparsec (30,800,000,000,000,000,000 km) for the expansion of space. (75 kps as an acceptable number within margin of error, number has changed several times) You can then calculate the rate of expansion for the entire universe and that number is 2,113,636 kilometers per second. That says the expansion of the universe across the entire diameter is expanding at 7.05 (+/-2.33) times the speed of light. Diameter of the universe 93,000,000,000 LYMegaparsec 3,300,000 LY((Universe Diameter / Megaparsec = 28,182) x 75 kps )=2,113,636 kps or 7.05 x the speed of light.This means the universe expands 0.0000000000000000000008 % every earth year.Footnotes[1] https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1743921309993012",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking For the simplest interpretation of your question, the answer is that the universe does expand faster than the speed of light, and, perhaps more surprisingly, some of the galaxies we can see right now are currently moving away from us faster than the speed of light! As a consequence of their great speeds, these galaxies will likely not be visible to us forever; some of them are right now emitting their last bit of light that will ever be able to make it all the way across space and reach us (billions of years from now). After that, we will observe them to freeze and fade, never to be seen again.  \u200b As for your specific question of what was happening during the period of rapid expansion (or \"inflation\") that was thought to mark the early universe, I have to admit that I'm a little less clear on that. However, the basic idea of the theory of inflation is that the part of the universe which we can see (the \"visible universe\") is only a tiny part of the universe as a whole, and that the universe underwent exponential growth during the inflationary era. Therefore, there certainly would have been points which moved faster than the speed of light with respect to each other during inflation. Whether any points within our visible universe moved faster than light with respect to each other is something I'm less clear on, but I'll work on learning more about this specific point and update this if I find anything! To answer the broader question in detail, we need to specify what we mean by the universe \"expanding faster than the speed of light.\" The universe is not a collection of galaxies sitting in space, all moving away from a central point. Instead, a more appropriate analogy is to think of the universe as a giant blob of dough with raisins spread throughout it (the raisins represent galaxies; the dough represents space). When the dough is placed in an oven, it begins to expand, or, more accurately, to stretch, keeping the same proportions as it had before but with all the distances between galaxies getting bigger as time goes on. The bottom line is that different pairs of galaxies are moving at different speeds with respect to each other; the further the galaxies are, the faster they move apart. So when we ask whether the universe is \"expanding faster than the speed of light,\" I am going to interpret that to mean, \"Are there any two galaxies in the universe which are moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other?\" So how do we measure this? As discussed in a previous question, the universe's expansion is determined by something called the Hubble constant, which is approximately equal to 71, measured in the technically useful but conceptually confusing units of \"kilometers per second per megaparsec.\" In more sensible units, the Hubble constant is approximately equal to 0.007% per million years -- what it means is that every million years, all the distances in the universe stretch by 0.007%. (This interpretation assumes that the Hubble \"constant\" actually stays constant over those million years, which it doesn't, but given that a million years is extremely short on cosmic timescales, this is a pretty good approximation. It also assumes that when we talk about the \"distance\" between two galaxies, we are referring to the distance between them right now -- that is, the distance we would measure if we somehow \"pressed the freeze-frame button\" on the universe, thereby stopping the expansion, and then extended a really long tape measure between the two galaxies and read off the distance. There are many other distances that can be defined in cosmology, but this is the most useful one for the current question.) If we use the definition of distance given above (and only if we use this definition and no other), then the Hubble constant tells us that for every megaparsec of distance between two galaxies, the apparent speed at which the galaxies move apart from each other is greater by 71 kilometers per second. ......................................................................

            "answer_text": "The actual rate of expansion has been changing constantly throughout the history of the universe, and continues to change today.   I do not really like it when people say the universe is expanding at some velocity X, as it is miss leading.   The expansion rate depends on distance.   The current rate is about 68 km/s / Mpc.   A Megaparsec (Mpc) is about 3.26 million light years. That means the distance between us and a galaxy that is about 14.5 billion light years away grows at a rate of about 1 light year per year. The changing rate of the expansion rate of the universe has some curious effects.  For example, the CMB radiation we see today was emitted from a location only 20 million light years away.   A billion years ago, that CMB radiation passed by a galaxy that was about a billion light years away from us.   So the light started off relatively close to us in intergalactic standards, moved away billions of light years and then finally traveled that distance to reach us where we are today.  All the time the light was heading on a straight path towards us. Galaxies that formed are separating away from us at a rate of more than 3 light years per year.   In order for the light to have ended up further away from us a billion years ago, it had to travel through a region of space that was moving away from us faster than the speed light.   If the hubble constant remained constant, it would have been impossible for that light to ever reach us.   However, the hubble constant was changing.   So the light travelled on it's journey in space moving away from us faster than it could come towards us, until the light reached space that slowed down enough for the light to finally make forward progress towards us. Actually determine how the Hubble constant is changing is tricky.   There is one free parameter in General Relativity that should determine the rate of change, and that is the cosmological constant:  In this plot Hubble's constant is related to the slope of the curves.   As you can see depending on the value of the cosmological constant.   The top curve corresponds to our best measured value. ",

            "answer_text": "The expansion of the Universe is described by the Friedmann equations. The Scale factor, aa, which appears in these equations, is a measure of the (linear) scale of the Universe, relative to the reference value of a=1a=1 today.  The \"speed\" of the expansion is often described in terms of Hubble's constant, which currently has a value of about H0\u224868H0\u224868 km/s/Mpc, which means that expansion is causing the distance to an object that is currently one Megaparsec away from us to increase at a rate of 68 km/s. Something twice as far away will have a distance that's increasing at twice the rate, and so on. The \"acceleration\" of the expansion is given (again from the Friedmann equations) by a\u00a8a=H2+H\u02d9a\u00a8a=H2+H\u02d9 where over-dots, as usual, indicate time derivatives. In a Universe dominated by matter and dark energy (as ours currently is), and setting a=1a=1 (present day), we can write this as a\u00a8=(1\u221232\u03a9m)H20a\u00a8=(1\u221232\u03a9m)H02 where \u03a9m\u22480.31\u03a9m\u22480.31 is the matter density of the Universe (in units of the so-called \"critical density\"). This gives a\u00a8\u22482500\u00a0(km/s/Mpc)2a\u00a8\u22482500\u00a0(km/s/Mpc)2 or, in slightly nicer units, a\u00a8\u22488\u00d710\u221214m/s2/Mpca\u00a8\u22488\u00d710\u221214m/s2/Mpc. This means that the (apparent) acceleration away from us, due to expansion, of an object one megaparsec away, is less than a trillionth of a meter per second squared (and, again, it scales with distance). This is why the acceleration is only measureable over extreme distances and very long periods of time. It's also worth noting that the speed and acceleration are not constant; what I've given are the values at the present day. ",

            "answer_text": "It was Edwin Hubble (1889-1953), an American astronomer who observed that the universe is expanding - by measuring the redshifts of a number of distant galaxies. And when he measured their relative distances, it was discovered that the redshift of distant galaxies increased with distance. The only explanation for this observation is that the universe was expanding. This came to be known as the Hubble parameter. The best measurements for this parameter resulted in a value of about 68 km/s per megaparsec. (One megaparsec is equivalent to 3.26 million light-years.) Since this discovery in 1929, scientists have been trying to measure the universe's expansion rate - the Hubble Constant - more accurately. By 2012, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope had made the most accurate measurement ever made and it was 74.3 +/- 2.1 kilometers per second per megaparsec. But again, the latest report says that the universe is expanding 5 to 9 percent faster than astronomers had earlier thought. The current precise value for the Hubble constant is 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec. Consequently, the the universe is stretching 0.0073% every million years. Looking at it another way, distances between cosmic objects should double in about 9.8 billion years from now. It is an accepted theory that the Universe is not finite, and it does not have a \u201ccenter\u201d from which the galaxies are speeding away in all directions. A more appropriate way to see it is that it is the \"space\" that is expanding and so the distance between galaxies is expanding; the galaxies themselves are not. Essentially, different pairs of galaxies are moving at different speeds with respect to each other; the further the galaxies are, the faster they move apart. If the Hubble constant is 73.2 then, at a distance of a little over 4 mega parsecs the galaxies appear to be receding faster than the speed of light. So, the universe does expand faster than the speed of light, and, perhaps more surprisingly, some of the most distant galaxies that astronomers can see right now are currently moving away from us faster than the speed of light! As a consequence of their great speeds, these galaxies may not be visible to us forever; some of them are right now emitting their last bit of light that will reach us billions of years from now. After that, we will observe them to freeze and fade, never to be seen again. However, the statement \u201cuniverse is expanding faster than the speed of light\u201d is misunderstood. As mentioned earlier, it is the space between the galaxies that is stretching. Relativity is not violated. We need to understand that the true motion of a distant galaxy right now (at the time of our observation) has no effect whatsoever on the light that was emitted billions of years ago. In other words, the galaxy was not moving faster than the speed of light at the time when the light was emitted - therefore, the light was able to travel towards us while the galaxy was moving away from us. Since we are aware that the farthest objects recede fastest, we can see that after the light was emitted, the galaxy was moving away from us faster than the point at which the light is located, and that this disparity will only increase as time goes on and the distance between the galaxy and the emitted light keeps increasing. Therefore, we can easily have a situation where the galaxy keeps on moving away faster and faster, eventually reaching and exceeding the speed of light relative to us, while the light which it emitted billions of years ago reaches us at a steady 299,792,458 meters per second. It may interest you to know that the Hubble Space Telescope has recently calculated the distance to the farthest galaxy ever measured. The galaxy, named GN-z11, existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang, or about 13.3 billion years ago, meaning that scientists are \"seeing\" the galaxy as it looked over 13 billion years ago. However, it's actual distance now is like 32 billion light years, calculated by using it's redshift of 11.10. This corresponds to nearly 0.99% of speed of light with reference to Earth. ",

You can talk about the \u201crate\u201d at which a given volume of the universe is expanding (for example you could say that the visible universe is expanding at a rate of such-and-such per cent per year). What you can say, however, is that one specified point in the universe is moving away from another specified point at a particular speed. For example, you can say that a point located on the \u201cedge\u201d of our visible universe is moving away from us at, say, the speed of light (although even saying that will sometimes provoke comment about taking into account proper speed as compared to the co-moving speed, which I believe is irrelevant). So the answer to your question would be \u201cboth\u201d, depending on the two points whose speed of separation you want to express. A pair of galaxy groups close to each other may be separating at a few thousand kilometres per hour; a pair that are, say, 100 billion light-years apart will be separating ar a speed in excess of twice the speed of light.

If you had a sphere that doubled in size every second and the sphere was unbreakable, it would get to a point rather quickly, where the sphere would look like a singularity. If you were inside that sphere, you would see out into infinity. In conclusion the universe is expanding on the inside at a certain rate which would appear to be unmeasurable but matter is still limited to travel at less than the speed of light. If you could be on the outside of the universe it would appear to be contracting.  Perhaps this contraction balances the expansion on the inside or makes it possible. I have envisioned a simple mechanism that can determine the state of expansion in the universe at a local level. Take a look and see what you think.

So close to us, the rate of expansion is so slow, we can\u2019t detect it. At distances out to the closer galaxies, we can measure the rate of expansion - and it\u2019s starting to get quite fast. We see the colors of stars starting to shift towards red as the lightwaves are stretched by the expansion of space. (This is why astronomers call this effect \u201cRed shift\u201d.) At even larger distances, the speed is getting really fast - and starlight is shifted out of the visual spectrum altogether and into the realms of InfraRed, microwaves, radio waves and so forth. But eventually - when you get very far away - the expansion rate is so fast that it exceeds the speed of light\u2026and at that point, starlight (and any other information such as gravity waves) can\u2019t ever reach us because space is stretching faster than the light/gravity/whatever can cross the distance to us\u2026and beyond that, we can\u2019t see or know ANYTHING whatever about what happens further away.

            "answer_text": "Question: At what speed is the universe expanding? Is it faster or slower than the speed of light? The rate of expansion of the universe is an estimated 70 km/s per Mega-parsec. A Mega-parsec is a unit of distance equivalent to nearly 3,000,000 light-years. This means that every parsec equates to 3.3 light years. This rate of expansion is not a speed, it\u2019s the speed of expansion per distance, so it cannot be compared to, say, the speed of light. This means that the universe will expand 70 km/s for every 3,000,000 light-years that the universe has. Now, does this mean that the universe is boundless? The answer is yes, technically. We can say that two objects distanced by a mega-parsec such as our galaxy (Milky Way) and our neighboring galaxy (Andromeda) would be further diverted at a rate of 70 km/s due to the expansion rate of the universe. Interestingly enough, this does not take a toll on the distance between the two galaxies. This is due to the fact that (because of gravity, these two objects attract each other) the Milky Way and Andromeda are approaching each other at approximately 300 km/s. In about 4 billion years, these two will collide and generate a massive cosmic explosion. But then again, don\u2019t get uneasy about it because if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ll be long dead before that takes place.  The Hubble volume is a spherical region of the Universe surrounding an observer beyond which objects recede from that observer at a rate greater than the speed of light due to the expansion of the Universe. There are two main reasons as to why we can still see objects beyond the Hubble Volume: The object was within the Hubble Volume when the light was emitted, therefore, we can see the light long after it has fadedThe size of the Hubble Volume is altered by the rate of expansion that the universe hasThe odds of the light of an object reaching can be determined by dividing its constant velocity by its location, the rate of expansion, and time. The universe's rate of expansion is steadily increasing and, given time, distant objects will be no longer visible. In the future, it is possible that a light won't reach us even with an infinite time-frame. It all depends on the future evolution the rate of expansion of the universe and is, typically, more distant than the Hubble Sphere. Beyond the event horizon objects will not be observable in any way and will have effectively left our universe. It is also fair to say that if the universe is essentially boundless, that any point in the universe can be considered the center of the universe. So you can now say that Earth is in the center of the universe.  ",

            "answer_text": "Currently, we are certain that we live in a universe that is expanding at an increasing rate. As you read this, the universe expands at about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This means that a galaxy 1 megaparsec away from us is receding at about 70 km/s, another galaxy 2 megaparsecs away from us is receding at 140 km/s, and so on. This is Hubble's law. Following the same logic, one could do the math to compute how far a galaxy has to be in order to move away at the speed of light. It turns out, galaxies 4300 megaparsecs away from us recede faster than light. This distance defines the \"Hubble sphere\", an imaginary sphere centered at us, outside which everything recedes faster than the speed of light. Note that, since the universe expands at an accelerated rate, the Hubble sphere increases its radius as time goes by. Can we see light coming from galaxies outside the Hubble sphere? Receiving light from a source moving faster than light might seem odd, but this is actually possible. Imagine a galaxy outside the Hubble sphere, which emits a light pulse towards Earth. The pulse tries to makes its way to us, but it is \"dragged\" away from Earth by a region of space receding faster than light. It looks like we will never receive this pulse -- but wait a sec! As the universe expands, the Hubble sphere gets bigger, too. Now, if the rate at which the Hubble sphere expands is larger than the net velocity at which the photon recedes from us, the pulse will eventually pass from a superluminal region into a region receding from us slower than the speed of light. Take a look at this video, which transforms these words into a cool animation. Of course, as long as the pulse is traveling a region receding from us at a velocity smaller than the speed of light, it will eventually reach us. The conclusion is that we still can observe galaxies receding faster than light! Put another way, the Hubble sphere is not the limit of our observable universe. How can we tell the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light in the first place? The wavelength of a light pulse traveling the universe is stretched as space expands, so the light gets redder. (That is, its wavelength increases.) This so-called cosmological redshift is measured by astronomers, so distant galaxies can be labeled by their redshift. The higher redshift of a galaxy, the faster it is receding from us. For any plausible model of our expanding universe, there exists a relatively simple conversion to translate redshift into recessional velocity. Not surprising by now, some of the galaxies we have observed exhibit redshifts resulting in superluminal recessional velocities! Finally, one should note that, in practice, a receding galaxy may \"disappear\" from our observations due to cosmological redshift. Light coming from the galaxy gets redder and redder, leaving the detectability range of our instrument (our eyes or even a radio telescope). In addition, the time between successive pulses will increase so much that the galaxy will fade out until it vanishes. ",

The metric expansion of space is the increase of the distance between two distant parts of the universe with Time. It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. What is the meaning of unit km/sec/Mpc ? It means for every megaparsec (about 3 million light years) you go out, the Universe is expanding 74.2 km/sec faster. So a galaxy 10 Mpc away would be moving away from us at 742 km/sec. We all know what is the unit to measure the speed of light. It\u2019s km/sec. As far as the question in concerned you can not compare the expansion rate of the universe with the speed of light. We all have studied in our higher grades that you can not compare two different dimensions.

            "answer_text": "The expansion of universe has no definite speed. Suppose two objects are very close to each other. They're moving away from each other at great speed. But now imagine two objects which are galaxies apart. Obviously, they're moving away from each other at even greater speed. This is because the fabric of the universe is stretching. Therefore, the farther the subjects of interest, the greater their separation per second. If we're comparing Earth and a planet in another galaxy, the speed of universe's expansion is scary fast, but comparing Earth and Mars, the speed is extremely slower than that. In fact, there are such areas in universe which are moving away from each other at speeds faster than light, areas that have millions of galaxies between them. However, this doesn't violate any laws of physics, because actually, no object is travelling in space at superluminal speed. The space is stretching at superluminal speed. Such areas would never be able to interact with each other because light would never reach the other area from one. ",

It then seems likely that there are parts of this vast space that are moving away from us at greater than the speed of light.  Anything in the parts of space that are moving away from us faster than the speed of light are impossible to observe, and that makes this idea hypothetical but still constant with what we know about the part of the universe that we can see. If the theory of cosmic inflation is even roughly correct, Inflation (cosmology) , there was an incredibly brief time right after this universe got started during which the expansion rate was much greater than the speed of light, but this expansion rate did not continue.

So we can say that earth is at the center of universe. Now if we gaze into sky, light from galaxies which are nearer to us redshift less as compared to galaxies that are farther away. This observation concludes that galaxies located at farther distance from earth move away from us at higher velocities as compared to galaxies that are closer to us. Infact rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating. Hence, there are some parts of this universe which have attended expansion velocities greater that speed of light. Hence, light emitted by galaxies in such regions will redshift to such a great extent that they attain infinite wavelength till they reach us and hence such light can never reach us. It is possible that earth is also present in such region of the universe with respect to other distant parts of this universe and therefore earth is permanently invisible to those distant parts. To answer your question in short, universe is expanding at speed lesser as well as higher than speed of light depending on who is observing that region of the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a theory that follows that line of thinking. According to that theory it follows the big bang theory where the size of the universe is finite, and expanding. At this point the universe is expanding below the speed of light. According to that theory, one day deep into the future the universe will expand faster than the speed of light, and at the same time dissipate at the speed of light. The outer edges of the universe that are dissipating will experience the lessening of gravity and particle attraction at the same time. Stars, planets, and even black holes will fall apart. The theory is called the \u201cBig Rip,\u201d and it is just a theory. The farthest quasar detected is some 29 billion light years away - that is 29 billion years ago. It is of course farther away than that now, and there are expected to be even more things farther than that. The red shift is very high of these objects, but it is within the realm of possibility. The other theory also includes the Big Bang theory, but that the universe is infinite. The velocity of the galaxies could just be from the big bang itself with those ahead of us moving faster, and those behind us moving slower, and those to the side, just moving away from angular direction. The thing is we don\u2019t even know how fast our own galaxy is moving through the interstellar medium, or what direction. Both these ideas could be wrong, and the universe could be infinite with no beginning and no end. Nobody knows for sure. You make up your own mind based upon what you read. ",

He was studying the red shift occurring in the lights coming from the far distance galaxy ,He proposed the expanding universe theory which is well described by Hubble law.He calculated Hubble constant using red shifted light coming from nebulae ,stars etc and proposed this constant has 500 km/sec per mega parsec .But now after removing errors it is said to be H= 67.15 \u00b1 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc . Hubble constant is not a constant but a parameter which changes after every million years this is because of increment of dark energy which make universe expand at greater velocity. The value of the Hubble constant will not be same for every time ,it will change according to amount of dark energy present in the universe also due to the push or kick given by the big bang. ",

            "answer_text": "The universe is expanding in all directions, we know this because on a large scale we see objects moving away from us on average. I say on average because for smaller scales this is not always true. For instance, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are in a collision course. But back to the large scale, objects are moving away. Astronomers found out that the further away an object is, the fastest it is moving away. Based on the data, they concluded that the space is expanding. Then they determined that this expansion is equal to 67.15 km per second per Megaparsec (1 Mp = 3.26 million light years). For instance, a galaxy which is one Mp away is receding at 67.15 km/s, one that is two Mp is doing it at 134.3 km/s and so on. Given the fact that the light travels at 299,792,458 km/s we can do the math and find out that those objects which are 446,500 Mp away are effectively receding faster than the speed of light. ",

This rocket has multiple stages, but they\u2019re stacked so that only one at a time can fire. You fire the first one off and get some speed going, then hit the explosive bolts and eject the now empty first stage. Now you fire the second stage, and then the third, and then the fourth. Each stage increases your speed from where you started from, so that each stage is moving faster than the last. Now let\u2019s say that you and a friend are in similar rockets, but pointed away from each other, and do the same thing. The farther you go, the faster you\u2019re both going relative to each other. You can still talk to each other, but the lag is getting longer and longer, and not just from distance. Eventually, you\u2019re both travelling at around 50% the speed of light from where you began. Relative to where you started, you\u2019re only moving 50% the speed of light, but from your friend\u2019s perspective, you\u2019re moving away at almost the speed of light. The same thing is happening in space right now, in every point in the universe, simultaneously. Each point is getting father and farther apart. The forces that keep atoms together and planets formed are able to hold it all together, but in the black void of space, there\u2019s not enough gravity to overcome this expansion, and so it continues to grow and grow, until two points are moving away from each other so fast that, from their own relative perspective, the other is going faster than light.

What happens if you fire a basketball back at the other car at the speed limit of 100kph? It never hits the other vehicle. In fact, it simply drops and bounces in the position at which it was fired. So it is with objects very distant from us. There is a point in the universe beyond which light is not fast enough to close the gap with us (analogous to the basketball). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we know how fast space is expanding.  It's been measured very accurately by numerous observations using everything from Hubble Space Telescope to the Planck Satellite. The answer is 68 km/s every Mpc. Now, what does that mean? This means two objects that are 1 Mpc away will have space between them expanding at 68 km/s. Two objects that are 2 Mpc away will have space expanding between them at 136 km/s. This will go on (though at large distances, higher order corrections come into play). So you see there isn't a single \"speed\" that space is expanding it.  It is expanding everywhere, so there can't be a single speed if you think about it. Therefore it is meaningless to compare it with a single speed, namely the speed of light, and ask if it is faster or slower. It all depends on what length of space you are talking about.  ",

            "answer_text": "The question is incoherent as the statement contradicts one of its primary arguments. We define speed as displacement/time or as dx/dt. Since space is the primal concept we utilize in defining speed, the speed of a change in space is inherently nonsensical.  A correct statement of your question would have the premise that, if we were to observe the universe from the outside, what would be the speed of a stationary point mass.  This speed we would be measuring could theoretically be bigger than the speed of light. However this phenomena would not be contradicting general relativity as stated in the proposed Alcubierre Drive, which theorizes that an object can move in space by simply expanding the space behind it while propelling itself forward. To clarify things a bit let me introduce a simple example:  Imagine you have a pencil and a paper. You define two points - A , B - on the paper which you will move between with your pencil. You put your pencil on A and move to B. And you do this with the maximum speed at which you can move your pencil. In another attempt you put your pencil on A, but instead of moving the pencil you bend the paper so that the point B coincides with point A. Even though you moved your pencil with maximum speed, you can go between two points much faster by simply bending the paper. Principally, the same phenomena applies to the universe which means that you can theoretically travel faster than light. Call it a relativistic loop-hole if you will. ",

            "answer_text": "the universe is not expanding with the speed more than that of light.how can anything move with a speed greater than that of light .When astronomers talk about the expansion of the Universe, they usually express it in terms of the Hubble parameter. First introduced by Edwin Hubble when he demonstrated that more distant galaxies are moving away from us faster than closer ones.The best measurements for this parameter gives a value of about 68 km/s per megaparsec.Let's recap. Hubble. Universe. Galaxies. Leaving. Further means faster.  Which translates to if you have a galaxy 1 megaparsec away, that's 3.3 million light years for those of you who haven't seen Star Wars, it would be expanding away from us at a speed of 68 km/s. So, 1 megaparsec in distance means it's racing away at 68 km/s.So you need not worry about physical laws being broken !!!! Read more at: Page on phys.org ",

            "answer_text": "To put it in simple terms imagine universe as a sweet bun and galaxies in it as raisins. Now when you ferment the dough the space between two raisins expand.  Same thing happens with the universe. Space between galaxies expand but they are themselves intact due to gravitation or dare i say gravity due to dark matter. The important thing here is that galaxies are not moving \"through\" space but \"in\" space just as the raisins are moving in bread or with the bread and not through the bread. The Galaxies are fixed or embedded in space just like raisins in bread but the fabric of space is expanding. Now lets assume that the fabric of space is expanding by 1 units every second in every possible direction spherically emanating from a point . There are infinite number of possible directions. For simplicity let's consider two points placed horizontally at a distance of 1 unit Called A & B. A is on left hand side and B on right.  After 1 sec each particle moves with space horizontally apart by 1 unit and 1 unit was the horizontal distance between them initially. So the distance between them will be 3 units after 1 sec.  So accordingly the distance between A & B should be 5 units after 2 seconds. But NO, wait it is 7 units ! How ? So after 1 sec Lets place two particles C & D at the previous position of A & B respectively.  So now C & D are 1 unit apart from each other and A is 1 unit from C on left and B is 1 unit right from D. Now After 2 secs C & D are 3 units apart. And A is 2 units apart from C since it was 1 unit apart from C after 1 second. Similarly B is 2 units apart from D on right. So the total distance between A & B will be 7 units (2+2+3)!  The more is the amount of space between two particles the more is the speed of getting apart from each other ,even if the rate of expansion itself is constant. To put it in perspective galaxies closer to each other move at slower speed apart from each other than the two galaxies which are farther away from each other ie the rate of getting apart from each other increases with the \"amount\" of fabric of space in between the two or the \"distance\" between the two. So there will be a point of time when the rate or speed of getting apart from each other will be more than the speed of light and ultimately it will fade away. Infact every night we lose a few galaxies in the background of our observable universe. The andromeda galaxy, nearest galaxy to our own milky way will collide with each other about 4 billion years from now and form a entirely new system. This is a classic case of gravity overcoming space expansion. At local levels gravity is in play but millions of light years away space expansion is more dominating. In general galaxies are moving apart from each other and after a finite but humongous number of years we will lose almost every galaxy in our observable universe. ",

            "answer_text": "The rate expansion of universe is not measured in units of speed of light. It is rather measured in a different unit called speed per distance. ( The expansion speed is roughly 67 km/s/megaparsec). To be short\u2026 Imagine 3 points on circumference of a circle of fixed radius, such that separation between point 1, and pt.2 is x units and pt. 2 and pt. 3 also equal to x units. The separation between point 1 and 3 becomes 2x then, right? Imagine, you expand the circle in such a way that 1 and 2 are now separated by a distance 2x, thus the separation increased by x units. So is the case with 2&3. But if we look at 1&3 the separation increased by 2x units rather than increasing by x units analogous to the previous 2 cases.  So with this we can conclude than farther the two points are, the quicker they will increase the separation between themselves as time passes. Such is the case with universe, the farther two objects are, faster will they appear to be moving away from each other. Hope you understood :) ",

The really short answer really is that the velocity you are thinking of is a local quantity in universe according to general relativity. That is, I can only say in a meaningful way how fast things close to me move. However counter-intuitive one finds it, if you do the maths you'll see that it impossible to define velocity in the way we perceive it in any unequivocal way on galactic scales. The underlying coordinate system is changing in time and space, so the calculation of how something has moved in the coordinate system becomes meaningless as you are comparing apples and oranges.

We also believe that this velocity is mostly related to the distance between us and the object, In other words the further away, the faster.  Since Hubble first suggested that relationship, every test suggests that it is true.Unfortunately the red shift from the objects furthest away from us suggests a velocity considerably faster than the speed of light.We know from countless experiments on earth that that cannot be. There has to be another explanation. So we deduce that it is the actual fabric of space which is expanding. The cosmological expansion (qv).So the galaxies do not have a velocity faster than the speed of light. They are merely points in an expanding universe. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the geometric model you use for the universe and how you define THE \u2018speed of expansion\u2019. If you assume the universe has the shape of a hypersphere, then according to that model, the radius of the hypersphere is increasing at the speed of light and its circumference is increasing at two pi times the speed of light. If you define the \u2018speed of expansion of the universe\u2019 as the speed of increase of the radius, then it is equal to the speed of light. If you define the \u2018speed of expansion of the universe\u2019 as the speed of increase of the circumference, then it is equal to two pi times the speed of light. I prefer to think of the universe as expanding at the speed of light, because the speed of expansion of the radius of the hypersphere determines all other speeds of expansion \u2013 no matter how you define them. Interesting note: The edge of the observable universe (The observable universe is a 3D sphere embedded in the 3D surface of the hypersphere.) is currently 13.82 billion light years away. That\u2019s the distance at which things are moving away from us at the speed of light. It is no coincidence that 13.82 Bly is also the radius of the hypersphere. The radius of the observable universe has always been equal to the radius of the hypersphere. When the universe had a radius of one meter, the radius of the observable universe was one meter. When the universe is twice as old as it is now, and its radius twice as great, the radius of the observable universe will be twice as great. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many concepts about our universe that is missing and/or incorrect. These concepts mostly have to do with what we conceive as spacetime. It would also be helpful to know what a universe would be like without particles and without spacetime\u2026 otherwise known as the true void universe. I will provide these answers using Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything which is still unknown by physicists\u2026 The physicists can catch up to us later! When physicists say the universe is expanding, do they mean the particles in the universe are moving farther and farther apart, or that the spacetime that the particles are in is expanding making the particles in spacetime get farther apart, or both? It would help considerably if physicists knew the structural nature of spacetime. Spacetime is a medium composed of a single component building block called, \u201cThe Gordon Omnipresent Dot\u201d or the GOD entity. (They are called entities and not particles because particles exist \u201cin\u201d spacetime where these entities exist \u201cas\u201d spacetime.) Each GOD entity creates a planar radial energy field. (To understand the true math of a GOD entity is not easily accomplished because in order to do so you must go through a learning process called \u201cThe Ruby Slipper Conundrum\u201d. Before the Big Bang GOD entities were aligned on each other\u2019s energy plane concentrated at a center point but always pushing outward. This created the expanding parallel planar universe that had 2 spatial dimensions. But these GOD entities would align in a cubic lattice matrix when the parallel planar universe became unstable finding the axial direction of GOD Entities as the las dimension in which energy can be aligned in. This is what happened when the parallel planar universe became unstable. triggering a vacuum decay phenomenon where energy was distributed into the newly created third dimension. The rearrangement of GOD entities into the cubic alignment is known to us as the Big Bang where our 3D spacetime was created along with the creation of particles \u201cin\u201d spacetime. Spacetime is an energy medium and some of its energy during the Big Bang made the jump to higher Gordon Energy States and was able become the energy of particles. The key to this process of particle creation is the realization that there is a hierarchy of energy in our universe which is expressed in the GOD Equation:  This little equation shows that energy exists in only three Gordon Energy States where the value of G (representing the Gordon Energy State) can only be 0, 1, or 2. When the value of G = 2, E2 energy is the energy of mass. When the value of G = 1, E1 energy is the energy of light (photons). When the value of G = 0, E0 energy is the energy of the spacetime energy medium. Most of the universe's energy is in the E0 Gordon Energy State existing as spacetime (94%). Only a small amount of this energy (6%) was able to make the jump to higher Gordon Energy States during the conditions that existed only during the big bang. The repelling nature of GOD entities still exist in our 3D spacetime. The energy fields of GOD entities go out into infinity but these fields are not measured in terms of distance because it is the collective energy fields of GOD entities that first create our parameter of distance. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything shows that a quantum distance represents a certain amount of spacetime energy along a path. It always takes the same time unit (a quantum time unit) for energy to move a quantum distance. That is why energy moves at c which is defined as a quantum distance divided by a quantum time unit. As the E0 energy of spacetime along a path increases, it would relatively slow the speed of light from our outside perspective. As the E0 energy of spacetime decreases, it would relatively increase the speed of light. We can now consider what the speed of light would be in a universe with no energy (no spacetime). The speed of light would increase to infinite as the energy of spacetime decreases to zero. But as the energy approaches zero, the quantum distance becomes relatively larger (infinite with no energy) and therefore as energy goes to zero there is no different place to go. All points would be indistinguishable from any other point making them essentially the same point. So the speed of light would be infinite and zero in a void universe. It can be concluded that the void universe exists as all points existing as a single point. So to answer your question\u2026 the energy of spacetime is relatively expanding outwards, in doing so the E0 energy gradient in spacetime is forever decreasing. As the energy of spacetime relatively decreases, the relative speed of light increases. It was the E0 energy gradient that physicists know as dark energy that accelerates matter outward from the Big Bang. Is the acceleration of matter outward considered the expansion of the universe? Is the acceleration outward of the GOD entities of spacetime considered the expansion of the universe? Either way, the expansion of the universe will never exceed the speed of light since the speed of light is a relative constant depending on the amount of E0 energy in the underlying spacetime. In any case - I hope this gives you some more insight\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I have thought of a way to accommodate a big bang and expansion, and not leading to faster than light velocities, which I consider to be a difficult idea to accept. It goes like this; The universe was mainly radiation as commonly believed, but the size is not necessarily small. This radiation is kept together by its own gravity- since energy gravitates- and also as gravity is the result of momentum conservation, and that radiation does have momentum, and it is conserved. (relation between momentum conservation in particles and the inverse square gravity has been worked out in Bertrand theorem). Trapped radiation in a closed path has a rest-mass- again due to momentum conservation of the trapped radiation. Radiation circulation produces the spin due to its momentum, and gives rise to a magnetic dipole moment- coming from its electric field. A charge is created here as well, as trapped radiation has to be in the form of a standing wave in order to not interfere and cancel itself. Standing waves of an electric field has a non-zero divergence.. that is an electric charge is created in addition to the rest-mass. Now, radiation follows a hyperbolic partial differential equation (HDE)- an equation representing advances in space and time, and as such can\u2019t represent mass. Mass is not a propagating quantity, but could be spinning of course. This requires an elliptic PDE instead. Hence the Kline-Gordon equation is hyperbolic, whereas Dirac equation is elliptic. Elliptic equations can represent vorticies and circulation and no propagation. That is also why the \u2018rotation\u2019 matrices of Pauli are included in the Dirac equation. Note also that deflection (needed to produce circulation) does not need energy as it is happening normal to the motion- as in the case of the effect of a magnetic field on a moving electron normal to it. Therefore, to create matter from radiation we need something to provide the momentum and deflect the field to move into a closed path and becomes a rest-mass- that is, change the field locally from advancing and hyperbolic, to circulating and elliptic. One example is two gamma radiation rays can\u2019t create a pair, without the help from a nucleus- a boundary/discontinuity. In fluids as a second example, the boundaries and discontinuities provide the needed momentum to deflect a hyperbolic flow into an elliptic one, resulting in vortices and turbulence. Also, a super-cooled liquid can\u2019t freeze without a seed that can break the symmetry and initiate the change of state from liquid to solid- despite the fact that the process here gives out energy and not need any to form a solid state. There is no flow here, but the logic of the problem is of the same sense- symmetry that need to be broken to go to the next phase. Now, apply the above to the early universe. Solidification/trapping of radiation into matter requires a seed. The seed can in fact be just a single electron. This becomes a possible explanation to the \u2018singularity\u2019 issue. The size of the radiation-only universe need not be tiny of course, but it must have expanded and cooled down to allow condensation to start. Once condensation started, it will spread and will be violent.. like in the case of a super-cooled liquid. This could have resulted in a \u2018big-bang\u2019 at the early universe, resulting in a scatter and flying off of matter, and in an increasing manner as the number of seeds increase. This process will continue naturally till it consumes all the radiation that can condense and produce matter. Pair creation in present time presents an example of that era. This way, it is possible to avoid the greater than light speed expansion- by associating the singularity with the first seed- not the whole universe at that time, and taking the radiation only universe to be much larger than that of a singularity. According to this scenario, we must conclude that energy and matter must have existed together from the start, even if matter was just one grain or a single electron. This scenario can also explain why all the electrons positrons are the exact copies of each other- it\u2019s like crystallization producing identical crystals. ",

Now you have 10 points between each 1cm that will expand at 1cm per second. Now you have a 110 points. > After 2 seconds you now have a line that is 110cm long. Now insert just as above 10 points between each of the 110 points. Now you have 1210 points that will grow at 1cm per second. > After 3 seconds you now have a line that is 1210cm long. Do you see where this is going? By iteration 19 the length is 6,115,909,044,841,450 KM. By iteration 20 the length is 67,274,999,493,256,000 KM. This means that in 1 second, the first and last point moved 61,159,090,448,414,500 KM away from each other in 1 Second! Note that light moves at 299, 792 KM per second.

            "answer_text": "People have touched on this before, but put simply: relative to, say, someone on Earth, we see everything around us expanding at a rate proportional to their distance from us. The farther away something is, the faster it recedes. If we observe the recession of something far, far away from us, it's speed will be (relative to us) extremely fast, and these extremely fast speeds can match or exceed the speed of light.  This does not contradict relativity because the expansion of the universe is not a measure of and does not reflect any one object's velocity, relative to any observer. It is a measure of the growth rate of all physical space. Thus the relativistic implications of superluminal speed do not apply. ",

            "answer_text": "The point is, that there's nothing actually travelling faster than light. It is the space between us and distant objects that is \"growing\" and thus creates an illusion of faraway objects moving with respect to us. In our current cosmological model we incorporate the cosmological principle, and this means that the rate of this \"growth of space\" is constant throughout the Universe. Thus, for objects sufficiently far away from us, the rate of growth of space between us and them  may exceed the speed of light. As as example think about two points on the surface of a ballon that is being inflated. each of the points is at rest with respect to the baloon surface, yet the distance between them is increasing, because the surface itself is growing.

            "answer_text": "Expansion of the Universe Peer Review, Fact, Logic and Math Check Requested and Welcome! First a few facts: The speed of light is 300,000 km/sec The expansion of the universe has been determined to be 68 km/sec for each 1 million parsecs 1 million parsecs is equal to 3.26 million light years The estimated age of the universe since the big bang is 13.7 billion light years The question is, how much space is needed to have an expanding universe at the speed of light? The 68 km/sec is associated with a distance of 1 million parsecs. If we divide 68 km into the speed of light (dividing speed into speed), we will get a number that relates the two. How Can the Universe Expand Faster Than the Speed of Light? 300,000 km/sec divided by 68 km/sec = 4409 This means that the 68 speed goes into the speed of light 4409 times. We can obtain that level of speed in the expanding universe if we count 4409 times 1 million parsecs or 4409 million parsecs. In other words, the accumulated distance of 4409 million parsecs of space will collectively expand at the speed of light. 4409 million parsecs times 3.29 light years per parsec equals 14,505 million light years. (14,505 million = 14.505 billion) This means that space is expanding at the speed of light if we assume that the space involved is at least 14.5 billion light years across. Assuming this is correct (using rounded off numbers), This has two immediate implications: Any visible event or object that is closer than 14.5 billion years or whose light began moving toward us while it was less than that distance away is or will be visible to us, eventually. Light coming from beyond that distance will never reach us.This distance is derived and defined by a rate (light) multiplied by a time so we can also use it as a measure of time. I.e. 14.5 billion years - is nearly a billion years older than the big bang. If accurate, this means that the big bang event itself should be visible to us, eventually. Our visible horizon predates the big bang in time.It may also imply that since the origin of everything occurred later than 14.5 billion years ago, that means that everything created by the big bang is within our visual range and that there is nothing to be seen beyond our visible range. This has implications for speculations about the causes or source of dark flow and movement of super galaxy clusters that appear to be moving toward something \u201cbeyond our visible horizon\u201d.This also implies that the rate of the expansion of the universe is close to but has not yet reached the speed of light. It would take another 0.8 billion years for the universe to expand to 14.7 billion light years before there is enough expanding space to create a visible horizon beyond which we will never see.I welcome comments and math/logic checks to confirm or discount this analysis - with the understanding that I rounded off and used crude approximations for the values involved. The results should be within +/- 5-7% or so. ",

Cosmic expansion is not the only way more distant redshifters can show added shift. I question the Hubble Parameter with all due respect. A different explanation does seem possible: If a steady source of electrons were liberated from say a cluster o negatively charged stars, and began accelerating say as they grew more distant from gravity behind, a given point in that procession would be pushed more from behind because of repulsion from the trailing elections while the forward electrons, being spaced further apart than the trailing ones and thus pushing back on trailing ones less than forward ones push back on them. The more forward they go thus the faster they go. And so be it for stars of such charge forever though they never attain c as their mass approaches infinity. We have an example of such acceleration with beams from polar jets. An electron\u2019s mass approaches infinity to fast that it never gets there. ",

His result: 74.2 \u00b13.6 kilometers/second/megaparsec. That means for every megaparsec (about 3 million light years) you go out, the Universe is expanding 74.2 km/sec faster. So a galaxy 10 Mpc away would be moving away from us at 742 km/sec. Adam\u2019s measurement jibes well with other measurements, so there is reason to be confident in his results. The Universe is expanding at 74.2 km/sec/Mpc - Bad Astronomy ",

It follows Hubble\u2019s law, which can be derived from the equations of general relativity for a universe which is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. Hubble\u2019s law relates the relative expansion speed between two distant galaxies as: v = H*d where d is the separation between the two, generally measured in Megaparsecs (unit of 3.26 million light-years). H is measured to be in the range from about 68 to 73 kilometers per second per Megaparsec. So if two galaxies are separated by 100 Megaparsecs or 326 million light-years, their relative separation velocity will be around v = 70*100 = 7000 kilometers per second (light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second).

They did so because if cosmological redshift does not equal velocity and distance, then they have no way beyond the distance of relative paralax of accurately deducing distances. Cosmological redshift has nothing to do with the expansion of space, it is light quanta interacting with plasma in space, each interaction lowering the energy level and shifting it towards the red end of the spectrum.

The reason for that is the universe does not expand from a single point but from all of its points \u2014 including the ones introduced by the expansion. This means the farther two points are, the more points between them to expand, meaning the farther two points are, the faster distance grows between them. So no, for example the Andromeda Galaxy closes the Milky way faster than the expansion (so they will collide in a few billion years), but the edge of the observable universe is the boundary where the distance between us and them grows faster than the speed of light, so no information from us can ever reach them and no information from them can ever reach us.

Of course there is every possibility that it might happen , but the proofs of relativity theory are pretty strong and handle most of the exceptions so I believe it is not so.
