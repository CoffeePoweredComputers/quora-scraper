            "answer_text": "Uranium 238 with 92 protons and 146 neutrons makes up 99.3 % of naturally occurring uranium on Earth. The other 0.7 % is mostly Uranium 235 with 92 protons and 143 neutrons. There are also trace amounts of Uranium 233, 234, and 236. In the crust of the Earth, Uranium (all isotopes) makes up 2.7 parts per million by weight. Because the half-life of Uranium 235 is only about 13% of that of Uranium 238, the percentage of Uranium 235 has gradually decreased over geological time. ",
