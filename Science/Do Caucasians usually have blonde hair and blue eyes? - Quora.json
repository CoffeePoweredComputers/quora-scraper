            "answer_text": "Not all. I'm a Caucasian, but I don't have a blonde hair and blue eyes. My hair color is a light brown, but my hair is so rich and thick that it appears darker brown, especially when someone sees it from the far. In summer, it becomes lighter. When I was younger my hair color was dark blonde (it grew darker overtime) and in summer, it was becoming completely yellow. My eye color is a light green. My mum told me that when I was a newborn, my eyes were grey. My skin is usually light, although not extremely pale. It easily gets tinted in summer.  That's basically how I look like. Heck, I even have a mole on the cheek, but on the left one. In my native country, the vast majority of people have brown hair, brown eyes and a white skin. ",
