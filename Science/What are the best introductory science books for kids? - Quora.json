            "answer_text": "Especially when it comes to physics and astronomy I'd definitely recommend the \"George\" series by Lucy and Stephen Hawking. Summary of the first book: It's about a boy named George whose new neighbor Eric is a scientist who has a computer which can create windows and even DOORS to space. When an old enemy enemy from Eric past turns up with an evil plan George and Eric's daughter Annie have to make up a master plan to save her father. It's a really exciting and interesting read for kids and they learn a lot of science which is explained easily. My parents read it to me when I was about eight or nine and since then I want to be an astronaut (and I'm 15 now). I'm still really into astrophysics (I answer a lot of questions on this topic) and I've gained much more knowledge later through books and Quora. Lucy and Stephen Hawking's book offer a perfect way to get to know about astronomy and physics and unless you, the parent, have studied physics/astronomy there's much for you to learn as well. Book titles: Book one: \"George's secret key to universe\" (2007) the different planets of our solar system and their characteristicsHow stars are born and how they dieBlack holes Book two: \"George's cosmic treasure hunt\" (2009) What is needed for life to exist Why different planets (and moons) aren't fitting fir people to live there*I forgot the rest* Book three: \"George and the Big Bang\" Different theories about how our universe came into existenceThe big bangThe collider at CernSchr\u00f6dinger's cat The \"Higgs\" particleWorm holes and vacuums Book four: \"George and the unbreakable code\"  Hie computers and computer language worksHow quantum computer work*I forgot the rest*well, that's it about my recommendation. What's left to say is that these books are DEFINETLY WORTH THE READ at any age. Your child(ren) will love them!:))  ",
