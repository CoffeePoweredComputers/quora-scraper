            "answer_text": "Why do we perceive many colours would be a better question. Light strikes the surface of the Earth. Eyes have evolved to use that light to see, perceive things in our environment that we cannot touch or taste. Eyes evolved to take advantage of the fact that the light the Earth receives has a range of wave lengths and those wave lenghts are not always reflected in the same way by different parts of our environment allowing us to perceive even more information about our environment. That\u2019s what colours are. ",
