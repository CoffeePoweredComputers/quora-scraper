            "answer_text": "\u00a9Short Answer: Motion and rest depends on frame of reference, unless when traveling at speed of light. According to my theory, (0,c) are binary states (0,1) of motion in our Local Universe. (or more precisely, \u201c0\u201d is formed by Equi- Preferential combinations of different senses of \u201cc\u201d) All other states of motion are grey states created by various combinations of \u201c0\u2033 and \u201cc\u201d States of motion. i.e, \u201cc\u201d is relatively true unity state of motion. So, under normal conditions, combining \u201c0\u2033 & \u201cc\u201d won't create a Super-Luminous state of motion ( greater than speed of light state). Space-Mass-Energy and other forms of Reality are varying concentrations of singular entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Driving force of Local Universe, including expansion of the universe is fueled by interconversions of Space-Mass-Energy. Space-Mass-Energy and other forms of Reality are expression of Cumulative Process Value-Time Content/Density across Process Value-Time Volume or Value Volume. Brief Explanation: We have to understand that Absolute Origin is not just zero or nothing. The Absolute Origin should have been unbiased to all options, i.e, it should have equal probability of being something, anything, nothing, past-present-future etc etc. Absolute Origin (which i named as Entity(S)) should be like super imposed summation of all possibilities and impossibilities, past-present-future etc. Entity(S) should have been unbiased to all it's options because being Absolute Origin nothing should be there to pre-biase. In an Counter argument, if Entity(S) was born with an entity that could bias Entity(S), then there should have been equal probability for another equally unbiasing entity (which could nullify effects of biasing effects of biasing entity) to have came into existence same instant. The reason for this is summarized as Law of Equi-Preference proposed by me, & briefly it states that \u201cEach Unbiased tendency should have equal preference to all it's realizable options\u201d. Action-Reaction are like active components/preferences/tendencies when sphere of action of Equi-Preference is inflated. Primeval atom which is thought to have underwent Big Bang to create our local Universe is like Root/Incarnation of Entity(S). Quanta/Atom of Reality are Roots/Incarnations of Primeval Atom (Like points of possibilities that unwinded out of Absolute Totality). Quanta/Atoms of Reality can be perceived as expression of Process Value-Time. Space-Mass-Energy and other forms that express Reality are varying concentrations of Quanta/Atoms of Reality, i.e, Space-Mass-Energy and other forms of Reality are expression of Cumulative Process Value-Time Content. => Big Bang and expansion of Local Universe are changes Cumulative Process Value-Time Mathematically, When we combine E=m*c^2 and c=dx/dt or dx=c*dt => dx=((E/m)^(1/2))*dt (will express space after integrations) E= (m*(dx/dt)^2) & m=(E*(dt/dx)^2) dt=(dx*((E/m)^(1/2))) => Time can be represented as an outcome of Space-Energy-Mass interaction. i.e, Space-Energy-Mass represents Cumulative Time Content and Time flow can be Represented using Space-Energy-Mass interactions. EXTRA INFO: Chronomechanics DO YOU THINK SPACE IS 3D?? Parallel or Alternative Universes aren\u2019t optional, it\u2019s part of the Grand picture The Real Reality. Their inescapable Reality can be pointed out using Probability. There are infinitely infinite and beyond options in which Reality can recreate itself, but still it travels through a very narrow range when compared to options available. Infinitely infinite and beyond numbers of Realities can be traced by minor adjustments of paths and options realized. According to my Theories, Entity(S) is The Absolute Origin of Real Reality. As Entity(S) is the Absolute Origin, it should be totally unbiased to all it\u2019s available options. So, Entity(S) is the Absolute Totality. i.e, Entity(S) is super-imposed summation of Past-Present-Future, all Possibilities and Impossibilities etc etc. Primeval Atom that formed Our Local Universe is one of the Roots/Incarnations of Entity(S). Space-Mass-Energy and other forms that defines our Reality in Our Local Universe are made of varying concentrations and recipes of Quanta(s)/Atom(s) of Reality. Quanta(s)/Atom(s) of Reality are Roots/Incarnations of Primeval Atom(s). Quanta(s)/Atom(s) of Reality are like infinitely infinite sided dices and perceived as representation of Process Value-Time. So, Spectrum of Reality we evolved to Perceive will dictate Our Qualia of Reality perceived. Collective name for my Theories is Chronomechanics. According to My Theory, Space-Mass-Energy and other forms of Reality are made of varying concentrations of Singular Entity called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Space is of lower density, Mass-Energy of higher densities. Simple Math and Brief explanation on how i developed one part of my theory: E=m*c^2 (Energy-Mass Equivalence) - This has been proven by Einstein beyond any doubt with best knowledge of mathematics and physics. and c=dx/dt (velocity=change in position w.r.t change in time), this equation help us understand that it takes 8 minutes for sun\u2019s rays to reach earth. When we combine E=m*c^2 and c=dx/dt or dx=c*dt => c=(E/m)^(1/2)=dx/dt => i. dx=((E/m)^(1/2))*dt => Space and Energy-Mass are equivalent entity, this is similar to \u201cE=m*c^2\u201d proving Energy-Mass Equivalence. ii. E= (m*(dx/dt)^2) & m=(E*(dt/dx)^2) => Mass-Energy can be visualized as Energy-Mass-Space-Time interactions. iii. dt=(dx*((E/m)^(1/2))) => Time can be represented as an outcome of Space-Energy-Mass interaction. iv. Similarly, Space-Mass-Energy and other Physical Quantities can be represented as functions of Cumulative Time Content. => Big Bang, Expansion of Space and other Physical Phenomenon can be visualized as change in Cumulative Time Content of Our Local Universe. : Space-Mass-Energy and other forms of reality are formed by varying concentrations of Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Above gives only the Quantitative figures. Space-Energy-Mass should be in an objective configuration to give us Qualia of definite point in Time we have already perceived. For now it may seem impractical to change/rewind Time of whole Universe, so we have to pragmatically choose a optimum sized Space-Energy-Mass configured system where we can apply our Time Reversal. We may need Catalyst for making two points in time to become reversible. \u00a9 ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there Kirti. Namaste from India. Thank you for the answer request. I'll come up with an all-encompassing definition of motion for you, which you can apply in any scenario and get adequate results. We say that an object is in motion when the surroundings of the object (everything surrounding the object) changes position from time to time (with respect to the object). For instance, I'm (at present) laying down on my bed and typing this answer (was actually sleeping. Woke up because of this notification ring. Lol). Anyways. So at present, I'm laying down on my bed. So you would say that I'm at rest. But no. I'm still at motion. Because everything surrounding me (my bed, my planet, my planet's sun, my planet's sun's cloud of stars etc) that is, EVERYTHING surrounding me are moving (changing position from time to time) with respect to me. And thus, I'm not at rest, but instead, in motion always. But yes, if you consider my planet only, then am at rest. Thank you. Happy reading. Ardhendu Chakraborty. ",
