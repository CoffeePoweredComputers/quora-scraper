RacismRacism is the perception that people are not all equal to each other, but are divided into upper and lower, distinguished by either skin color, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation etc. The most common type of racism , and what has given the original name in the word, Italian. (breed / razza = breed) is racial racism. Tribal racists believe in biological differences amongst the tribes, on the basis of which they identify those in superior and inferior.

            "answer_text": "Injustice according to Dictionary and Thesaurus | Merriam-Webster is unfair treatment : a situation in which the rights of a person or a group of people are ignored. Injustice has created history, stories and poetry for all time: The tale of injustice to \"Lucrece\" has been told time and time again since its historical occurrence in 509BC. Lucrece is the lauded as the heroine for her role in ending the reign of Kings in Rome. The Roman Empire. Thereafter, a republic led by consuls established by Brutus and the others avenged her rape and death by exiling the royal family of Tarquin, the assailant prince. Articles on ancient history. Lucrece was a victim of rape and of historically universal interest, in the movingly tragic tale of injustice - an incident that altered history. http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu. In Lucrece the poem's value lies in its psychological portrayal of both the perpetrator and the victim. The rapist earns himself nothing but condemnation and shame, while in her state of mental and emotional crisis of injustice, the victim demonstrates that she deserves nothing but sympathy and support. In his representation of the historic rape and suicide of Lucrece, Shakespeare challenges readers to avoid epistemic injustice (like Islamophobia, worldwide racism, misogyny, and Shakespeare's \"Othello\" myth of Inter-racial couples ) by reflecting on the nature and credibility of their sources. Therein is the present today's problem of true judgment in a world of social inequality where there is rampant political injustice, that lacks every and all aesthetic relation with truth. Another example of injustice is by spreading misunderstood truths. This was best replicated in the form of Junaid Jamshed, the orthodox Pakistani clergyman who blabbered his belief in an outmoded version of his religion with an unwavering but resilient style. He had never been accused of blasphemy for wrongly imitating an anecdote from the hadiths, wherein he dubbed women 'twisted ribs', in his usual endeavors to belittle one half of the global population. He was often criticized and at times revered by the Pakistani media! Now all that will end for good. The 52-year-old Junaid Jamshed is no more. He recently died in a plane crash! Many examples of social and racial injustices today play their dramas through 'moral discourses' that aggravate and prompt untruthful morality through injustice, based on \"A supposed right to lie from altruistic motives\" wrote Immanuel Kant.
