            "answer_text": "Picture space as it should or originally was it could have been. Absolutly nothing for all time and distance. Yet from the verry begining there was a spot that was somehow diferent. How is not relevent. Just something not like the rest of the infinite nothingness. It didn' have to be a energy or a object. Just something. Space as nothing is the purest possible thing. No barrior, no limits, no resistance at all. Prestine. Accept for that something. From the something maybe the field, the aether, the electromagnetic energy, or the plasma. However you wish to call it. Dark energy was born. Then the energy spread with infinitely perfect speed threw out the purity of space A faint energy field now feels every inch if space instantly. This would be the only, first, and last time this could ever happen. For now the energy is like a barrior to unlimited speed. Today particles are the producer of the fastest speeds. Light speed. Light is made when energy withen a particle is to strong to stay in the particles orbital. A particles speed and dencity and friction determine light speed. One day man made speed greater the light speed may be made. If we can figure out how to hold energy longer in a partickes orbital or some other means. There are two possibilities I can think of from this point. Big bang formed from the energy field. Or the universe is infinitly filled with matter everywhere simply forming out of the field or dark energy naturally. Forming dark energy, to dark matter, to particle, to hydrogen to star systems, to black holes, to galexies. Everything just forming randomly threw out all of space. Just a thought. But a interesting thought to me. ",

            "answer_text": "I think this is a philosophical question. In any case, I think I can give a philosophical answer: I would say that it is safe to assume that anything that exists must have an energy equivalent. Or to say it otherwise: to have an energy equivalent is the definition of \u201cto exist\u201d. So, yeah, if dark energy and dark matter exist, and we have evidence that they do exist, then I think it is safe to assume that they have an energy equivalent or as you say it: that there is energy \u201cbehind\u201d.
