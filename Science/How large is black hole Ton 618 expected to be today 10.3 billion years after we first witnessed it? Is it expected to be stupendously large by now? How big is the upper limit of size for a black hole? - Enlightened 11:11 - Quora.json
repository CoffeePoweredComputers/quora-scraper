            "answer_text": "Black holes grow by accumulating material. There is no upper size but there is only a certain amount of nearby material for them to consume. In general objects won\u2019t just fall into black holes - like water going down a drain or something - they orbit them. Gravitational interactions between orbiting bodies will send some towards the black hole but they equally flick stuff away from the black hole so over time the supply of nearby material dwindles. This places a limit on their growth. ",
