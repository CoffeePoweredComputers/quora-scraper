            "answer_text": "Well, at the extreme end of the scale are mylar Space blankets -- very very thin, very warm (well, reflecting your heat back inwards). They do make crinkle noises. I do know some crafty folks who have sewn a layer of mylar blanket between two layers of snuggly fabric for a really, REALLY warm quilt. You can't put them in the dryer, though -- hang to dry only, and they have a limited number of washing-machine cycles they can survive. Microfiber and polar fleece are really good engineered fabrics that get a lot of warmth without much bulk; wool also works, and wool has the advantage that it's still warm even if it's wet (the physics of the hair structure itself pulls water into its center like a sponge, leaving the outside still fluffy and warmth-trapping).
