            "answer_text": "How is RNA able to replicate itself? Short answer: Neither DNA nor RNA are capable of \u201cself-replication\u201d (can not \u201creplicate itself\u201d). The only case of \u201cRNA replication\u201d (a misnomer) taking place in cell nuclei is the transcription of RNA (from DNA) to messenger RNA (mRNA), performed by RNA polymerases. DNA, in turn, is a passive macromolecule \u2014 on its own, DNA does nothing \u2014 it has only one function: to safely store the digital DNA code of the genome. In order to replicate DNA, several different, closely cooperating RNA and supporting protein molecules (enzymes) are required, one prominent such is DNA polymerase. Some RNA structures \u2014 and their functions \u2014 are listed here (several are used for DNA replication, none of them for \u201cRNA replication\u201d):  RNA Types (table source: www.the-scientist.com article The RNA Age: A Primer).

The most stripped down RNA pathogens are viroids, infectious particle smaller than any of the known viruses - loops of infectious RNA that do not code for any proteins, they are just RNA genomes that on entering a suitable pant cell will trigger the host enzymes to copy them. There are two known viroid families: Pospiviroidae which replicate in the nucleus and Avsunviroidae which replicate in the chloroplasts. Classification of the Pospiviroidae based on their structural hallmarks International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)  ",

            "answer_text": "RNA cannot replicate direcltly. That takes place ony in certain vruses. During the RNA world DNA was invented to be used as back-up. Today RNA is transcribed from this \u201cmaster\u201d DNA. I have a theory for the origin of eukaryotes with its organelles and bacteria which is not yet accepted, but which might very well be true. In fact, it avoids a theory that has a lot of problems, the endosymbiosis theory. There are two parts of the theory: The Eukaryote Expansion Theory, that explains how eukaryotes evolved from the RNA world, and the Organelle Escape Theory, that explains how organelles and bacteria occureed.

            "answer_text": "As brilliantly expressed by Henry, these passive nucleic acid molecules do not replicate themselves. They are simply rather small basic protein recipe libraries. They are replicated by the machinery of the cell. Which, by the way is inherited directly from the parent cell. A cell always comes from a cell, complete with all machinery including organelles, phospholipid cell membrane, etc. and \u201chits the ground running\u201d. Franklin Harold\u2019s book \u201cThe Way of the Cell\u201d provides a very good background for a fuller understanding of this issue. ",
