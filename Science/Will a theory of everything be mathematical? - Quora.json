            "answer_text": "No hypothesis, upon which a theory is based, is mathematical. The mathematics allows the theory to make a quantitative prediction, which can be compared to experimental result. Compare a theory to a factory, mathematics to the machines that make a product (and even the raw material in some cases), and the product to experimental prediction. A theory of everything will at heart, have to make quantitative predictions, not just wave hands in the air and say, \u201cIt covers everything, trust me!\u201d ",
