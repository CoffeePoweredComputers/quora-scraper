            "answer_text": "Atoms are named primarily by the number of protons in the nucleus. Hydrogen has one, Helium as two and so on. Other atoms we've all heard of are oxygen, carbon, iron and nickel. There are many more, some you've likely not heard of. Not all atoms of the same name are the same. Along with protons, there are neutrons in the nucleus. This is noted by adding a number after the name. Most uranium on Earth is \"Uranium 238\", where 238 is the \"mass number\". There is also some \"Uranium 235\" on Earth. It has the same number of protons but 3 fewer neutrons. It is famous because it is radioactive (it can break up, releasing energy). [Correction - U238 is also radioactive, but it has a longer half-life than U235]  Atoms have electrons around them, in equal number to the protons, and some of them can be stripped away at times, making the atom have an electric charge. All atoms with the same atomic number (number of protons) and mass number (number of neutrons) act the same. I hope someone can answer whether there are any differences at all, but there are no \"old atoms\" or \"scratched\" ones. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to answer this carefully because \"the same\" has many meanings. All hydrogen atoms are identical, located in different places and moving on different relative vectors. The electron for these identical atoms is in only a handful of possible energy states, but each atom can be in the same or different state from its neighbor. An isotope of hydrogen, such as deutrium, is similar to hydrogen atoms, but has neutrons which give it greater mass. And the stability of these isotopes varies from element to element. Obviously atoms of a different element aren't much like hydrogen at all. But each atom will be similar to its element-brother. Identical, within the range of differences I listed above. But if this question is asking if atoms are all exactly the same, a single item that exists in multiple places, no. Because they have the minor differences I listed above it clearly isn't one atom found everywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "I will assume you mean all atoms of the same element. Yes, sort of. They all behave the same way, but atoms are not elementary particles \u2014 they do respond to environmental conditions like electric and magnetic fields, so a carbon atom in an extremely strong magnetic field will have its electron orbitals slightly shifted, causing diamagnetism. In a strong electric field it will have an induced electric dipole moment. Other atoms are even more susceptible. But every carbon atom will respond the same way; so you can consider them \u201cthe same\u201d with those qualifications. ",

This has real consequences in the classical world. Two atoms, likewise in the same energy state and of the same composition, are completely identical. Again, this has real consequences in the classical world. The reason why electrons or entire atoms can enter the same state is because of a curious effect in quantum mechanics. This effect is what gave the field its name. \"Quantum\" means \"countable\". You can literally count the number of states an electron can have in an atom, and they will be the exact same for any other atom of the same composition. ",
