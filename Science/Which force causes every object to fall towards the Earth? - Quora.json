            "answer_text": "What force pulls objects toward the Earth? No force pulls objects toward the Earth, but the spacetime curvature which the Earth creates around itself \u201cpulls\u201d the objects toward the Earth. Actually, the objects move freely along the natural path as dictated by this spacetime curvature and for this free motion no force is required to \u201cpull\u201d the objects toward the Earth. Hence, parachuters who jump from an airplane, feel weightless while moving freely toward the Earth before opening their parachutes. Or, free passengers in freely diving airplanes, hover inside the airplane as if they are astronauts in spaceships away from the earth in free space. There are videos on Youtube showing such passengers under experiments. Force of gravity appears only if and when such a free motion toward the earth, along the route dictated by the spacetime curvature, is prevented or inhibited for any reason. Hence we feel a force (our weight) pulling us down to the Earth when standing on the Earth. Because the land is preventing us to move freely towards the the center of the Earth as we should have been moving along the route of the spacetime curvature. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity brings everything toward Earth.  Any object that has mass (even you) has a gravitational pull, but people are too small to have a noticeable gravitational force. Planets are large enough to create a lot of force to pull other masses toward them. Not only does everything fall toward the Earth, but it all accelerates at the same rate. All objects accelerate toward the Earth at 9.81 meters per second per second. ",
