            "answer_text": "The best science fiction stories are simply great stories about people who happen to be in a plausible \"what if\" setting.  That's often settings like a future, in space, an alternate history, on a different planet, or from a different planet. Even the characters who are from a different planet have to follow the same guidelines as any other character in any good fiction. They have to be well-rounded, well-defined individuals who are neither one-dimensionally evil, nor perfectly virtuous, but conflicted and complex, like all of us are. All speculative fiction needs to follow the same guidelines for what makes a good story as any good fiction, but science fiction has the added requirement of being plausible. If the science fiction story's \"what if\" is not plausible in the least, then the story is not science fiction, but fantasy.  There are some caveats to that requirement. For example, it's difficult to write any story about interstellar travel without stretching that plausibility to, or beyond, its limit. So faster than light travel, folding space, wormholes, warp, are among the unlikely or impossible technologies that are often \"allowed\" to pass. But for the most part, the science has to be sound for it to be called science fiction vs some other sub-genre of speculative fiction. And what are these guidelines for what makes a good story? Good stories are about something readers consider interesting, weighty, unusual, or important. Great stories often include all of the above, by making an interesting, weighty, and unusual subject interesting. Other elements necessary: Plot: Something has to happen to make the reader want to read on, not always an easy task. The something should drive the story, not the opinion you want to express. This is not to say that your story cannot contain a message, only that the message should not be a primary reason for telling the story. Pacing: Something needs to change. The story must go somewhere. Events must affect the characters. Things cannot be the same at the end as they are in the beginning.  Weight: Something important must hang in the balance. If nothing is at stake, then why should anyone read?  Characters: We have to care about the people. This does not mean they must be perfect and likable, but they do have to be real enough to elicit an emotional reaction, positive or negative. Growth: The characters should be changed by their experiences. If your characters don\u2019t learn anything, they won\u2019t be very interesting. This doesn't mean your villain becomes a good guy and vice versa, but both should learn something.  Conflict: This is not just an outer struggle, like a war, but must include inner struggles. A prejudiced character is challenged by being befriended by someone from the race they despise. The story should show them struggling with the attitudes they hold at the beginning of the story, even if, in the end, they lose that struggle and still end up a bigot. Empathy: Make it a goal to put your readers in the place of your characters. Part of a storyteller\u2019s job is to make unreal things real. It\u2019s not just describing the scene, it\u2019s living it through your characters. Setting: Setting should be treated like another character, not over-described, but important enough to the plot so that your story could not just happen anywhere. Your setting should have a flavor, an atmosphere.  Context: Both the setting and the circumstances of the plot should influence the characters\u2019 decisions and actions. Research: You should know enough about what is important to your story to make it plausible. If you don't do not fake it, find out about it. Research it. Don't be tempted to show how much research you did for your story. Know more than enough about the space vehicle your characters use than you need to, even if most of that knowledge is not used in the story. That way, it will all seem plausible. ",

            "answer_text": "Characteristics of Sci-Fi -  1.  Sci-fi is normally set in some future or off world setting where technology and science has advanced to a level far beyond what we have in the here and now.  2.  Humans are often not the only race in Sci-Fi novels and movies having either been found by other more advanced races or having found other races advanced and otherwise.  3.  The main conflicts in Sci-fi often revolve around energy crisis, control over food, power, air(if on another planet), weapons or just one race rulling all while others have nothing. It can also have themes of war or exploration. This does not go for all sci-fi as there are lots and lot that have plots that don't involve these themes at all but they are very prevalent.  4.  As per the genres name, science rules supreme.
