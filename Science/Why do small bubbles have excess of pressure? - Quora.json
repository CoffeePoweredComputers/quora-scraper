            "answer_text": "Because of the surface tension of the liquid surrounding it. Any liquid surface has a force along it resulting simply from the fact that there is no liquid at one side of the interface and there is at the other. If the surface combs, tension is still there, and if it closes (a bubble), it continues to be. Then, for any bubble, inner pressure should equate outer pressure plus surface tension, so it is larger. Surface tension is not huge and can be neglected versus pressure for large systems. But the difference of pressure for a bubble is inversely proportional to the radius, so that the effect can be important for a small bubble. This is interesting. For instance in boiling water, it means that liquid surrounding vapor bubbles is forcibly at 100 \u00baC but at a pressure that is below 1 atm. Wait a minute, then it should be steam! - Not really, it is still liquid and this is an example of meta-stables states in Thermodynamics. You can see a derivation of the excess pressure of a bubble here: Surface Tension ",

            "answer_text": "The balloon analogy can be used to understand this phenomena. A flaccid balloon has zero tension on its surface, and the pressure inside it is same as the atmospheric pressure. While inflating the balloon, you push air into it,thereby increasing the pressure inside it. This excess pressure aids in the inflation process. The balance between excess internal pressure and surface tension of the balloon\u2019s membrane keeps it from collapsing/deflating. Similar is the case with bubbles. ",
