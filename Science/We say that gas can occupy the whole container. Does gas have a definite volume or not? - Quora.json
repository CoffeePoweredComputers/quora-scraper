            "answer_text": "Hey there Mohit. Namaste from India. Thank you for the answer request buddy. Let's get straight to the answer. Short answer- No. Long answer- read on. You see buddy, you've actually let out the answer in the question itself. It depends on how you define the word \u201cdefinite\u201d. Actually, we define \u201cdefinite\u201d as something which has an end (HOLD ON), BY ITSELF AND NOT BY THE INFLUENCE OF ITS SURROUNDINGS. This is the main crisis out here. Now put the same logic in case of solids. They have a definite volume irrespective of the fact that their surroundings are exactly of their size or 1000 times bigger. It doesn't matter for solids as they'll always retain their size/volume BY THEMSELVES. Coming to gases and liquids now. You can most definitely make the analogy here. If the volume of the container changes, the volume of gases also change. Important thing here is, if you fix the volume of the container, the volume of gas is fixed until then, but isn't definite, as here, this fixing of the volume is only a result of the influence of its surroundings. If the surroundings change, then the volume is destined to change for sure and thus (going by our definition) gases don't have a definite volume. Feel free to ping me up in the comments section in case of a query. Thank you. Happy reading. Ardhendu Chakraborty. ",

            "answer_text": "For gases PV=RT so volume is constant at given tempreture and pressure. If you want to fill a container with gas then how will you fill it, it is already having air in it. So first you expel air from it by creating a vacuum then you fill it with another gas, when there is no pressure gas will fill whole vessel if you go on increasing the gas then pressure will also increase because gases are compressible. But at a given pressure amount of gas will be same in a given volume at a given temprature. ",
