            "answer_text": "Dipole\u2013dipole interactions are electrostatic interactions between molecules which have permanent dipole(s). These are discussed below in van der Waals forces. These interactions tend to align the molecules to increase attraction (reducing potential energy). An example of a dipole\u2013dipole interaction can be seen in hydrogen chloride (HCl): the positive end of a polar molecule will attract the negative end of the other molecule and influence its position. Polar molecules have a net attraction between them. Examples of polar molecules include hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chloroform (CHCl3). Often molecules contain dipolar groups, but have no overall dipole moment. This occurs if there is symmetry within the molecule that causes the dipoles to cancel each other out. This occurs in molecules such as tetrachloromethane and carbon dioxide. The dipole-dipole interaction between two individual atoms is usually zero, since atoms rarely carry a permanent dipole.
