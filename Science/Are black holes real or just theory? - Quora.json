            "answer_text": "Yes to both. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cjust a theory\u201d in science. People without a scientific education frequently think \u201cjust a theory\u201d means \u201clittle more than scientific speculation\u201d. In science, a \u201ctheory\u201d is the highest graduation point. Contrary to doofuses, theories don\u2019t graduate to laws. A law, is a mathematically explained fundamental function of a given aspect of the universe. A theory explains the complex interactions of nature. A theory explains how germs work, how gravity works and how tectonic plates move. Black Holes are real. Theories explain how they work. ",

Science has two categories of things which are considered true: direct observations and well-tested theories. Like many things in physics (such as electrons or gravity) black holes can't be observed directly, only their effects can be observed, therefore they can only ever be a theory. Using the phrase \u201conly a theory\u201d or something to that effect shows a gross lack of understanding of how science works. ",
