            "answer_text": "I love this question. The answer is completely YES! Minorities can be racist, just like women can be sexist. I first hand witnessed both of these of the summer of 2018 in a program for students. Here come the stories! Kids, gather around! So, I went to this summer program in Chicago, called Mikva Challenge. Part of this program, consists of meeting with a group of other students in the same program once a week, on Fridays, for a couple of hours. In these meeting, some activities would go on. These are some examples of answers to the question. The point I\u2019m making is that minorities can and are sometimes racist, and unbelievably biased and whatnot. So, here are a few examples. Once, we were having a discussion (the entire group of around 25 students. By the way, most of these students were Latinos, and there was a greater amount of young ladies than young men. I believe there was only one white guy, and about twice as many girls as boys) and this one girl was talking. The main part of the program was to work in aldermen\u2019s offices. That girl worked in an alderman\u2019s office, and she was talking about her experience. She said, \u201c\u2026 his husband\u201d and immediately, without wasting a single second, nearly the entire class was like, \u201cAwwwww!\u201d And then she said, \u201c\u2026 is a police officer, so obviously he is biased.\u201d To which the rest of the class, if you will, reacted in disgust. I saw some of the girls pouting due to that. (These people are 17\u201320 years old BTW). (To those who didn\u2019t get it, the class reacted to the alderman being gay as something to be celebrated and as something cute without even thinking about it. And then when she said his husband is a police officer, they also automatically reacted disgusted.) So this class of accepting *ahem* people ready to accept anyone (that is, anyone who isn\u2019t a white, well-off, religious man, obviously, and of course, anyone who holds all the same views that they have, no less than 100%) acted sort of weird for people that labelled themselves that. But oh well, what can we do. So, in summary, yes, minorities can be racist. And very, very biased and unforgiving of your social status, no matter who you are as an individual, because while it\u2019s racist for people to assume stuff about minorities, all people who are not minorities in any ways are all the same. According to them of course. ",

            "answer_text": "The hard, pedantic answer is yes, of course. Everyone is racist to an extent, and something that counts as racism exists in every population. However, there is also a practical answer. Essentially, \u201cWhy should we care\u201d? Because a marginalized group may think some negative things about a dominant group, but there isn\u2019t really a power structure in place to capitalize on that. A white guy calls black people Thugs, and black people get targeted by the police, and truly horrifying political policy. A black guy calls white people\u2026I donno, dishonest\u2026well, nothing happens except white people use that as an excuse to call more black people thugs. So from the practical perspective of people actually dealing with the fallout of racism, saying that minorities are racist too just comes across as pedantic at best. At worst, and FAR more often, it is an excuse to legitimize racist institutions against marginalized groups. In modern lingo, Racism tends to be described in the context of a power structure that benefits the racists. Without that power structure, calling something racist is meaningless. Of course, you could then point out exceptions: A white guy may have a hard time getting a job at a black barbershop, and sure, that is TECHNICALLY a power structure that hurts a white person. But when you are looking at police brutality, poverty, or school segregation, that argument sounds like rules lawyerly, grammar Nazi nonsense, and its hard to blame them for rolling there eyes at you. Minorities may be racist. But given the power structure that is arrayed against them, why should they care enough to put forth the energy to call it that? Lets end the legacy of Slavery, Jim Crow, the Drug War, and Redlining, and Im sure that in exchange, POC will gladly back away from the stereotype that white people can\u2019t dance in return. ",

            "answer_text": "This question (as initially presented prior to the merge) implies a number of incorrect assumptions: #1. Privilege is exclusive of whites. This is not true - not in the US, not in the XXI century. There are abundant examples of extremely wealthy minorities who, in some cases, have come to dominate entire cities: wealthy Chinese in Pasadena and Arcadia in Los Angeles, Cubans in places like Coral Gables and Pinecrest in Florida, Iranians in the Westwood section of LA that has become known as \u2018Tehrangeles\u2019, Indians in Cupertino, CA, etc. These are but few examples, as there are many such neighborhoods and cities across the country. The net worth of residents in these communities is much higher than the national average and, in turn, a lot higher than many whites\u2019. The gap between many high- achieving minorities and the white population at large is certainly becoming smaller (if not closed) in many cases. And as we know, money = power and power = privilege. #2. In order for someone to be racist, they must be privileged. Even if we were to assume that only whites had privilege, minorities CAN and some ARE indeed racist. Racism is the belief that some races are superior to others. Many Northeast Asians view themselves as being superior to Southeast Asians. The Japanese certainly justified their cruelty to the Chinese during WWII with their perceived sense of racial superiority. In Latin America, people who have a lighter skin tone believe themselves to be racially superior to darker-skinned individuals even though both groups may be of mixed ancestry. Latin Americans can also be racist towards Asians and vice-versa. There are also well-documented instances of racism towards blacks of any nationality in Latin America and Asia. In some cases, there is also racism against whites by blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, etc. Even in the US, there are tensions between minority groups, which we sometimes hear about in the news. A good example of this is how Korean immigrant grocers shot at predominantly black rioters during the Rodney King riots in LA and how many of them only employ other Koreans (or at least Asians) in their stores. I\u2019ve also heard in more than one occasion of Indian-born parents with US citizenship not being thrilled at all about their kids dating a white person. So, racism is almost a universal phenomenon that, although repugnant, is present in almost every race and ethnic group regardless of geographic location as well. #3. Only whites draw privilege through their race and use this power to oppress nonwhite minorities. This is another false premise. Privilege and power to oppress others often happen within ethnic groups without the need for racism to be present. The 1994 Rwandan genocide is a clear example of this, where members of a Hutu majority slaughtered an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsis. A similar horrific case of genocide also occurred in Cambodia in 1975\u20131979, where the Khmer Rouge regime senselessly annihilated between 1.7 and 2.5 million people. One can also see the historical oppression of the Dalit caste (deemed untouchable) by the Brahmins and other castes in India. Or, the oppression of people of African or indigenous descent in many Latin American countries. Here in the US, some successful minority groups oppress less fortunate minorities of the same or different race by exploiting or actually abusing them. East Bay buffet owners stole $6.5 million, forced workers to live in racially segregated dorms, DA says Saudi Princess Accused of Slavery in Calif. Valencia restaurant owner accused of slavery, beating employee - Los Angeles Times Since victims of intraethnic exploitation are less likely to report these abuses, many cases don\u2019t make it to court and the perpetrators are not held accountable. In conclusion, racism is an evil that exists throughout the world. Oppression by the privileged may occur in combination with racism, but, as illustrated in the previous examples, privilege is not required to be present for the oppression of entire groups to occur.

            "answer_text": "Minorities, not only can be racist, but quite commonly are. Demographic disparities across the globe create majority and minority communities in every society and what typically happens is that racism from majority communities is regarded as oppressive while the same behavior from minority communities is seen as a survival or self protection mechanism. Looking at the manner of interaction between minorities and the so called majorities, i find an intolerable amount of baiting and advantage taking based solely on racialist sentiments. I say this with every sense of responsibility, being a black African and my opinion has quite often put me in conflict with colleagues and friends. Take a look at the voting patterns in the US particularly comparing voting figures during Obama\u2019s elections and the recent Trump/Clinton contest and racist bias jumps at you from the African American numbers. Consider the experience of anyone from a different part of the world trying to marry a partner from the Asian sub-continent even here in America. From the reaction of the media and other leaders of modern thought One might be led to believe the definition of racism has been carefully honed to only mean something that gives advantage to European Caucasians, ignoring the fact that increasingly they constitute a rapidly shrinking proportion of the global population. I however think the notion that racism is only a white against any other race thing is largely informed by the fact that Northern American and Western European societies are currently the global growth poles and experiences of immigrants to these societies tend to be quite often expressed and broadcast more than the experiences of so called majority in the other parts of the world. As societies in Asia and Europe gain prominence a greater balance in the recognition and understanding of racialist bias will be achieved In conclusion bias by one distinct racial community against the other on the basis of race is racism no matter the size of the discriminating group.

            "answer_text": "Yes. They're human. As a black person, I've encountered more anti-white racism from other black people than I have racism against blacks from white people. For some reason so-called \u201creverse racism\u201d is more socially acceptable than racism against non-whites. There is definitely a double standard when it comes to what non-white people are able to say about white people vs what white people can say about non-whites. (This disparity is often treated in a casual, comical or dismissive way, but I find it offensive and unfair.) Racist acts perpetrated against white people by blacks receive less attention and condemnation from the media and from the public than the reverse does. They shouldn't; hatred is hatred and injustice is injustice regardless of the race of the perpetrator or the victim. How much more attention would the Chicago torture case (in which four black youths tortured a disabled white youth while shouting racist things) or the recent case of the black nursing home worker abusing white residents have received if the races of the victims and the perps had been reversed? Black folks would probably be marching and rioting in outrage. I believe that the unfortunate reason for this is the cultural Marxist belief in victim groups vs oppressor groups, which essentially classifies people as either good or bad based on their perceived degree of societal disadvantage or oppression (rich vs poor, man vs woman, white vs black, etc) and judges the victim class differently than the oppressor class, even if their actions or attitudes are the same. The actions of victims are always justified or rationalized by some adverse circumstance or condition, while members of the oppressor group are treated as inherently evil, and their behaviors and attitudes given more gravity. ( They're \u201cprivileged\u201d, so they have no external excuse for their misdeeds; therefore, they're simply evil on the inside.) The ideology of \u201csocial justice\u201d isn't just. Justice is impartial. Even sharing this perspective on Quora is apparently considered a \u201csin\u201d according to the dogma of political correctness. (Let's see how fast some offended person flags it for removal, even though it's not in violation of any policy.) ",

            "answer_text": "This is a passive Liberal line that equates to grandiose fiction. Every single nation on Earth has racist and separatist division claims. Every single one. So for some Liberal platform of ignorance to placate the concept of 'white privilege' that's just ludicrous. There was a question raised a couple of days ago about why British police are quite happy handcuffed to the perpetrators whereas in the US the suspect is cuffed behind and incapacitated immediately. It is because in the US they expect a greater level of resistance and a significantly less level of respect for the badge of authority than in the UK. THAT IS A CULTURAL STANDARD. It has nothing to do with racism. It has to do with the concept that a policeman is not only fair game but a registered target. Minorities in any format need a greater incorporated recognition of cultural heritage and associated practices. I live in an area where there is a high Sudanese population. And from this I can activately see what a polarisation of communities is all about. After a period of near 10 years (most are from the Sudanese civil war period) they are still the most likely group to cause major offense. Not every single one mind you as there is large community groups catering for incorporated equality  (it is a theme in the area). I had a brief day with a male Sudanese refugee who befriended me. Then he pulled out his 'rap sheet' for me to help him with. It was a volume of about seventy pages. Ranging from unpaid utility bills to loans in default to serial offenses with police officers such as spitting and talking back.  Big pages of bills. And what was worse, when he was registering anger issues because of this, HE WAS BEING TREATED AS BIPOLAR ! This is one example where a series of proper education of how to live and love this society would make a difference. This person is becoming a disenfranchised non-member of society due to regular breaches of the rules.  He will hate it. His kids, they will detest it. And so a needless cycle of discrimination starts due to what amounted to regular isolation and disenfranchised behaviors towards him. The reason I bring this case up is because this is where it starts.  Racism is a choice and more importantly it is not a negative choice nor a disfunctional choice. It is a means of distinction and empowerment.  However every culture has the right to both distinctive behaviors and empowerment. The difference in interaction between the cultures and races should remain the chief concern. ",

It says so, here in these writings so it must be true. If I don't get my way, I will lobby until I get it done be it via a sidetrack.My point is, that different skin colours are the least of our worries. There a myriad ways that we can use to hinder each other and to bully our way into the lives of other people. Racism is just a visible manifestation of human discrimination. And, as other people have rightfully stated, racism is not limited to light skinned people against darker skinned people. I know, I grew up seeing it around me. We have all noticed it. ",

What I can do is explain what's it's like to be generally disliked and a minority with in the local community. I grew up in the ghetto and many times in different states I was the only white person that I saw. The worst was when I lived on 71St street in Kansas City. I would get harassed for having money or called white trash. I was once stabbed and robbed for my wallet the contained around ten bucks and told by the police \u201cthat's what happens when you go to places your not welcome\u201d. The police often asked things like\u201dwhat's someone like you doing around here at night?\u201d In truth I lived their because I was 14 and homeless. I was tired of living in a house of biker gangs and domestic abuse (I kept that to myself).I was always out at night because I was looking for a place to sleep or was heading to a friends couch. Racial slurs became uncomfortable nicknames that resulted in violence if objected to. People who saw me acted if I was hooked on drugs and kept a distance. It seemed the older the person was the more I was unwelcome. I really couldn't blame them the past had showed them white people couldn't be trusted. It was hard to gain the trust of people my age but not impossible. Only once was I ran out of a girl friends house by her parents for being white. Atlanta was pretty bad to as well as Memphis and a few others, but I learned racism isn't the same for everyone nor is it limited to any race. If your white and homeless or living in section 8 housing in the inner cities. Then you face and learn to accept most discrimination on some level. However it wasn't bad all the time. Some of the best people you can ever meet and many of the friends who stuck around after I came out as trans* I met in the ghettos of America. Just as hate isn't limited by ethnic background neither is love and respect. I've lived in 14 states and have never had a house hold income over $15,000 a year. I feel for people who make it out of this life only to be treated less than equal. They clawed and fought to over come harsh odds and deserve more respect than those who where born into it. ",

When he did they wound up fighting. The black guy losing pretty badly. From what it looked like the guy had some serious training. This started the attacks. Suddenly Asian students were getting attacked by black students on a weekly basis. Not only the Vietnamese but also the Chinese, Hawaiian, etc. Soon it spilled over into attacks on Hispanics. The slurs between both sides were pretty bad. On a side note, it did bring a lot of people together, from all sides. Another time when I was working in Texas we had a bunch of contractors from India. My boss, one of the smartest people I've ever met, and also African American, had flown us in to deal with an issue dogging us for months. At lunch the second day, one of the contractors tells us \u201cI'm probably not going to be able to find another job if people find out I worked for a black.\u201d Ironically this fellow was darker than my boss and had told us he had been a member of a low caste in India. I think everyone can be racist, it's all a matter of who's the dominant ethnicity and culture in a country. ",

It\u2019s fun to play the \u201cI\u2019m not racist\u201d game by giving a nonsense definition of racism that technically does not apply to your particular mode of racially-focused detestable behavior. This question presupposes that there are no instances in which a minority is capable of harming a white person (assuming this question is USA-focused). But that is plainly false. A group of black men corner a white woman in an alley - selecting her because she is white - and then brutally rape her. (Yes, such things have happened. Mentioning it does not make me racist.) How is that not racism? The claim that black people or people of any other given minority group have zero power in this world is, ironically, a claim that is racist against minorities. The whole claim that \u201cminorities can\u2019t be racist\u201d is based on a double standard and is objectively false, and if you really care about killing the evil that is racism, you will stop saying it, because it is counter-productive.

I know people in Mexico who are mixed (The majority) and are racists, toward whites, indigenous or blacks (Minorities), and if they move to the USA (And becomes a minority), they will still be racist. Basically, I don\u2019t believe that only a majority can be racist. In Latin America actually that is very incorrect. In countries like Mexico (I talk about Mexico because is the case I know) You may found some very few people who actually are White, Indigenous (These 2 are minorities), or mestizo (the majority) having supremacist ideas.

You can also use the word racist to refer to systemic racism (which latently creates systems of oppression). A minority cannot be systemically racist. Systemic racism is a label for a culture, not a person or group of people. A minority can however, participate in racist views that uphold systems of oppression (think of that one surgeon guy who's name I thankfully don't remember who endorsed Donald Trump). That guy was being racist and oppressive, but towards his own minority race.  If we remove concepts of oppression, then a minority can be racist towards a majority. Will that cause any problems for the majority (in the big picture)? Very unlikely. ",

The minority most at risk of receiving racism (people with dark complexions) can be racist and have good reason to criticize their white majority power-wielding neighbors, although this attitude has been foisted on them to a great extent. The tone in America appears to be still mired in absurd racial attitudes/myths, so racism is not easily obliterated, with the minority continuing to experience humiliation, deprivation and unhappiness due to the majority's racism (see for example Gary Young's book 'No Place Like Home: A Black Briton's Tour of the South').
