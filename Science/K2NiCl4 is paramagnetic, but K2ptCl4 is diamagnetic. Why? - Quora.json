            "answer_text": "We need a little knowledge of coordination compounds. In K[math]_2[/math][NiCl[math]_4[/math]] the complex part is [NiCl[math]_4[/math]][math]^(-2)[/math] and in the other compound it is [PtCl[math]_4[/math]][math]^(-2)[/math] . This implies that in both the compounds the metal part has a oxidation state of +2 ( because the OS of Cl is -1) Since both of them belong to the same group. Thed block configuration will be same that is nd[math]^8[/math]. Cl being a weak ligand should not lead to pairing. But in case of Pd, Pt ,in +2 configuration, the last two electron shift to the next p-orbital leaving all paired electrons irrespective of the type of ligand. Due to this effect, the platinum complex is diamagnetic and the nickel remains paramagnetic. ",
