            "answer_text": "Compounds can exist in all three states(solid, liquid, gas) provided that they can be heated/cooled enough(to their respective boiling/melting points). You might think Oxygen is a gas, but take a look below, liquid oxygen also exists:  (Image Source: Wikipedia) You might think Carbon Dioxide is a gas, but take a look below, solid carbon dioxide(also called dry ice) also exists:  (Image Source: Wikipedia) Thus we conclude that any compound's state can be changed by changing the temperature and pressure. Natural existence depends upon the temperature and pressure of the place where the compound is. It is the same with Water. Water exists in all 3 states. A Solid below 0\u00b0 C as Ice, a Liquid between 0\u00b0 C to 100\u00b0 C as Water itself, and a Gas above 100\u00b0 C as Water Vapour.  (Image Source: Britannica) Note: Room Temperature is around 25\u00b0 C thus we usually see Water as a liquid. However, it is possible to observe Solid Water(Ice) if you look into a freezer and Gaseous Water(Water Vapour) if you boil water. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Water can be existed in three forms - solid ,liquid and gas . They have the same molecular component ,i.e. H2O . The difference os only in the interaction between the mlecules . Solids have maximum interaction , liquid have the medium one and vapour (gas) the least. In the solid state ,it is named as ice , in the liquid state, it is said to be water and in vapour state it is called water vapour . Thus , acording to the question , water is a liquid ",
