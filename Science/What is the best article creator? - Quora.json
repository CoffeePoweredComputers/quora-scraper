            "answer_text": "As far as i know the best article creator tool is Spinner Chief 5 v9.2.6. It is able to rewrite any text by changing individual words & phrases and it also rewrites sentences. The tool is highly accurate because it uses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. The example of what this software is able to do is just below:  I was looking for a tool that is able to rewrite articles for a long time, because the tools I have found until that moment were inaccurate and slow. I could spend hours manually editing badly re-written text by such software. This software was different from other tools, highly accurate and fast, so rewriting any kind of text using it was much simpler and quicker. Actually, a completely automatic rewrite done by the tool is usually of the highest quality and 100% unique. You can compare if with free software you can find online. You will find that it is much better. If you wonder why, this is because free article spinners in most cases (if not in all the cases) use random synonyms replacing. This means that if a word has ten possible synonyms, the spinner chooses a random one. But SC5 is much better than such software. So the probability of choosing the right one is around 10%-50% for such words. This means that most of the words won't be altered correctly and that the content you get will not be not grammatically correct. This is great software because: It is quite fast - rewrites 500 word article in less than twenty seconds and uses NLP.It has a powerful text editor you can use to change synonyms and you can add your own synonyms.There are more than 6 different editor layouts from which you can choose from.It can be used on a desktop PC, a mac, or even on your phone because it has both a desktop and a web version.It detects the right and wrong synonyms all the time.You could try this article creator tool here. You will like it for sure. ",
