            "answer_text": "In USA, high school juniors are 11th grade In US, most states require turning 5 sometime between July and October to enter kindergarten. If you started school as soon as old enough too, and did not repeat any grade levels, then you should 16 on the first day of the school year and turning 17 during that school year or the following summer. As a rule of thumb, in most cases, if starting on-time and never repeated a grade, your grade level should be your age at when the school year starts plus five. 11th grade: 16 (11+5=16), 6th grade: 11 (6+5=11). Age=Grade+5. Grade=Age-5. For those with September birthdays in schools that allow entry into kindergarten with the 5th birthday as late as September 30 or October 1 and thus starting kindergarten while still 4, then your your grade level should be your age at when the school year starts plus four (start junior year at 15, finish 16). Age=Grade+4. Grade=Age-4. A significant minority of summer birthdays (Jun-Sep) start a year late or fail a grade. ",
