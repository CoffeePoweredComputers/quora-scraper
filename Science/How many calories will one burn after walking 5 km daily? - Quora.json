            "answer_text": "I am showing you my daily activity data from mi band 4  I start my day at 5am,through out the day i feel active. There is lot of advantage of running in the morning. 1. Improves your Productivity for the Day Ever heard the saying that the early bird catches the biggest worm? Well, it turns out that a morning run will help you keep \u201ccatching worms\u201d throughout the day. This is because exercise gives you both mental and physical stimulation. It not only increases your alertness but also helps you get out of bed at the right time. After a good run, there is more endorphin and adrenaline flowing through the body. This results in an exquisite feeling called \u201crunner's high\" which can last for hours after you finish your workout. 2. Improves Heart Health Want to reduce the risk of heart disease by almost half? A five-minute run every day is what stands between you and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Research shows that runners have a 27% lower risk of early death and a 30% lower risk of death from cardiovascular problems. This is true for all runners, no matter how fast they run or for how long. By all accounts, running helps you stay healthier and live longer. What's not to like? 3. Jump-starts your Metabolism One of two things happens to the food we eat. It can either be consumed by the body as a source of energy, or it can be stored up as fat. If you are looking to keep fit or trying to lose some weight, you don't want your body to store up fat. In this case, you should start running in the morning before you have breakfast. This is because, after a workout, your body uses a meal to restore itself rather than storing it up. What's more, a morning jog will boost your metabolism, helping your body burn calories all through the day. It also means that you will likely feel hungry after you finish, making you less likely to skip the most important meal of the day. 4. Better Joint Health There was a time when people thought that running was bad for your joints. However, recent studies have shown that runners are actually less likely to develop joint problems. The reason for this is that runners are likely to be fit and to carry less weight thus reducing the amount of strain on the joints. Running in the morning has also been linked to better and developed muscle strength which helps reduce the chances of ostereoarthritis. 5. Improved Mental Health Running has a very positive impact on your mental health. You can view a morning run as an investment in your body. This creates a sense of self-worth and achievement. Running outside is particularly helpful, as it gives you time to take in the beautiful sights of nature. The earlier you run, the more you will notice, since there won't be many people or cars around. 6. Improved Sleep If you are one of those people who tosses and turns for a long time before getting to sleep, you need to consider running. Studies show that people who work out in the morning spend more time in deep sleep than those who work out in the afternoon or evening. An additional barrier to good sleep is lack of routine. After a few days of getting up early to run, you will start to feel tired earlier in the evening. Once you build a routine of going to bed and waking up at the same times each day, your sleep will improve. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want, you can reduce your weight by 9 to 10 kg without going to gym, but for this you must know the right way to walk. To lose weight, you must run or walk very fast every morning and morning. Sometimes you get the desired result, sometimes some people do not lose weight by walking or running. After all, what is the reason for this, have you ever tried to know? Do you know that you can lose 0.46 kg by just walking? Yes, it is possible, but how much you walk a week depends on this time. How many calories to burn from the body depends on body weight and walking speed and ability. If you run at a speed of 5-6 kilometers per hour, you can burn around 400 calories in an hour. If you walk 4 kilometers a day, 300 extra calories are burnt in a day. A person needs to walk around 2000 steps to lose weight. There are 100 calories burned in a mile. If you want to know how much you walked in a day, how many calories were burned, then you should use a pedometer. The pedometer keeps note of every step you take and also tells you how many calories you have burned. With this, you can also manage your progress and walking schedule. \u2022 1.6 km = 2000 steps + 100 calories burned. \u2022 Lose weight 0.45 kg (1 lb) a week = 500 calories burnt daily. \u2022 If you walk 10 thousand steps daily, you will lose 0.45 kg (1 lb) in a week. For a long time, it is considered an excellent workout, walking is one of the easiest exercises. Best of all, you don't have to spend anything for it. In fact, it helps you save money as fuel.  ",
