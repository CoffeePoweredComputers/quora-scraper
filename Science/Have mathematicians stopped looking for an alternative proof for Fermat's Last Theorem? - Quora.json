            "answer_text": "Not really. The proof that exists is the result of a combined effort of many mathematicians. Taniyama, Shimura and Ribet among them. Just to name a few. Of course it all culminated in Wiles making the last step in a herculean manner. Wiles proved a conjecture (well part of it) that is named after the first two mentioned above. And Frey, another important figure, suggested a connection between their conjecture and Fermat\u2019s conjecture. That connection was proven by Ribet. (After work of Serre). Wiles proved a huge part of the conjecture which was enough to finish off Fermat. His methods were developed further to finish off the deeper conjecture which is ultimately the real deal here. Mazur is yet another name that should be mentioned in the development of the methods that led to this. I am sure I forgot a couple of names. Fermat\u2019s conjecture led to many important developments in number theory. Attempting to find another proof might do the same. But it\u2019s just not as attractive as an unsolved problem. There are many other unsolved problems that call for the attention of mathematicians. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt it. Mathematicians are always looking for at least three things after a proof has been accepted. First, is there a shorter proof? Second, is there a more elegant proof? Third, is there a totally different sub-discipline of math or a totally different approach that will yield the same conclusion? That is, a different proof for the same theorem. Mathematics, contrary to popular opinion, is at least as much an art form as a science (at least the way I researched and practiced in my career). You would not ask that an artist stop doing different interpretations of themes done already, would you? And if you did, do you think the artist would heed your words? ",
