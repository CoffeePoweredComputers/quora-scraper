            "answer_text": "(I am clipping these references from Wikipedia)First it is necessary to understand what is meant by Ion or Isotope.Isotope Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number, although all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \"equal\") and topos (\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"place\"), meaning \"the same place\". Thus, different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. The number of protons within the atom's nucleusis called atomic number and is equal to the number of electrons in the neutral (non-ionized) atom. Each atomic number identifies a specific element, but not the isotope; an atom of a given element may have a wide range in its number of neutrons. The number of nucleons (both protons and neutrons) in the nucleus is the atom's mass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number.For example, carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13 and 14 respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons, so that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7 and 8 respectively. Ion An ion (/\u02c8a\u026a\u0259n, -\u0252n/)[1] is an atom or molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. So the short form of the difference is which particle in the Atomic structure is changed, if it is a neutron you get an Isotope, zero charge and atomic number remains the same atomic mass however changes.  If it is an electron more or less then you have an Ion, positive or negative charge, atomic number and mass remain unchanged. ",

            "answer_text": "Ions are atoms which have a missing electron or an extra one. This is what gives the ion its positive or negative electrical charge. Isotopes are atoms which contain a different number of neutrons.  This leads to a significant difference in physical properties. For example, hydrogen is known to have three isotopes: hydrogen(0 neutrons), deuterium(1 neutron) and tritium(2 neutrons).  All three have only 1 proton and 1 electron each.  Yet tritium is unstable and radioactive while the other two isotopes are stable and non-radioactive. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus  is what defines the name of the element and is also the same number as its atomic mass. The number of isotopes in a sample of an element in relation to the total number of atoms in that sample gives its atomic weight because  both protons and neutrons have mass. So: Atomic mass = number of protons.  Atomic weight = ratio of protons to neutrons. ",

An ion is an atom that gains or loses electrons to achieve an octet structure, typically of the nearest noble gas. Isotopes are forms of the same element that have the same number of protons but have different numbers of neutrons. So to answer your question, the difference between the two structures is that in isotopes, you have different number of neutrons and in ions, you have different number of valence electrons and total electrons.

            "answer_text": "Isotopes are atoms of the same atomic number/ same number of protons in the nucleus of its atom, but have different numbers of neutrons in their respective nucleus. Like ions, isotopes may be charged. H+ D+ T+ But unlike isotopes an ion may be a electrically charged atomic or molecular species. Eg. H+ and [SO4]2- are both ions The word isotope refers to atoms only, or the atom within the molecule. Eg. H, D, T H2O, D20, T2O So we talk of deuterated water, or tritiated water. D2O itself is not an isotope, but the Deuterium atom within D2O is an isotope Likewise H within H2O is an isotope. Tritium within T2O is an isotope. Both H+ and H3O+ are described as ions. Likewise [SO4]2- as a whole is an ion. D+ and D30+ are also ions. But D within D3O+ is an isotope of hydrogen. Neither D30+ or D20 are as a whole isotopes. Another difference between isotopes and ions is that isotopes always differ in mass/ weight. The Tritium atom has more mass than the Deuterium atom which has more mass than the hydrogen atom. Chemical reactions involving tritium are going to be slower than similar reactions involving hydrogen. ",

Now, if an element managed to gain or knock out an electron, it would become an ion, positively or negatively charged. Now, each element has an atomic mass. You can find the number of neutrons in an element by subtracting the atomic number from the atomic mass. Why? Each atom is composed of electrons, neutrons, and protons, and electrons weigh almost nothing. Now, if you managed to somehow knock a neutron out or gain one, then you would have an isotope of that element. ",
