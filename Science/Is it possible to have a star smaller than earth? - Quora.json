            "answer_text": "While most people below have talked about mass, I believe the person asking the question was referring to size. There have been many discoveries of large gaseous planets commonly known as \u201cpuffy planets\u201d. While many of them are similar in mass to Jupiter, they are much larger in size. Some of these planets are more than twice the radius of Jupiter! This is because these planets are typically pretty hot, either by being located close to their star, or because they are young. There are also many small red dwarfs similar in size to Jupiter. There is a star known as EBLM J0555\u201357 that is similar in size to Saturn. Also all degenerate stars, such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, are far smaller than that. In fact, neutron stars typically have diameters of about 12 miles, similar in size to many asteroids. Keep in mind that both red dwarfs and degenerate stars are more massive than planets, It\u2019s just that the puffy planets are much less dense. Some puffy planets are as dense as styrofoam, while neutron stars are denser than the nuclei of an atom. There is also a class of object known as brown dwarfs. Also called \u201cfailed stars\u201d, these objects have masses in between that of stars and gaseous planets. The boundary between these objects and planets is about 13 Jupiter masses, however this may vary somewhat depending on the metallicity (the amount of elements other than hydrogen and helium) and how the object formed. Similarly, the border between brown dwarfs and stars varies by metallicity as well, though is typically around 80 times the mass of Jupiter. As a result, there may be some overlap between brown dwarfs and planets and brown dwarfs and stars. Brown dwarfs are neither stars nor planets, but I thought talking about them would be useful. ",

            "answer_text": "A main sequence star (such as most of the stars we see in the sky) would never be smaller than a planet. It would have a much greater mass (at least .08% of the Sun\u2019s mass in order to sustain fusion, which, at a minimum would be 100 x more massive than Jupiter. Stars that are outside the main sequence, such as red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, etc. may be much smaller (well, not red giants) than many planets, but their mass is many times more than the planet, and in some cases many times more than the Sun. Thus the planet will always be orbiting the \u201cstar\u201d. ",
