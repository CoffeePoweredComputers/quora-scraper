            "answer_text": "This is a great question. I suggest that the graph of technological development follows an exponential curve which can be seen at the end of chapter one of my recent book Technology and Society - Rewards and Challenges. My review covered the period from the Renaissance to the first decade of the 21st Century. From this perspective, a technological explosion occurred in the preceding century. For instance, consider the social impact of the invention of the transistor and the internet! As time goes on, it is wise to expect a turning point in human affairs (health, transportation, education, work etc) in the current century because of the accelerating development of Cybernetics, Nanotechnology and Artificial Intelligence.
