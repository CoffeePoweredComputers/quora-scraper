            "answer_text": "PH4+ (phosphonium) is a cation where negative ions can form salts similarly to NH4+ (ammonium). You can look at NH4+ to see how it reacts. However, there is a major difference: NH4+ has the electrons more likely to be found in the N atom than the 4 H\u2019s. This is because N\u2019s electronegativity is high enough for this to occur (only N, O, and F have this). P\u2019s electronegativity is almost equal to H\u2019s. This means that electrons are evenly spread. There won\u2019t be particularly strong ion bonds compared to NH4+\u2019s because of the absence of H\u2019s that are electron-deprived (giving them a partial positive charge to attract to the negatively charged anion). This means that PH4Br is not as strongly bonded as NH4Br, for example, but I\u2019d bet it\u2019s still a fairly strong ion bond. ",
