            "answer_text": "Hell on Earth, immediately. Ninety nine percent of the people, or even more, in most industrialized countries would be dead within a matter of a few days or weeks. Turn off the electricity, shut down the trucks, and there would be no water, no sewer , and no food in the city. People would be starving within a matter of days, and dying of thirst within a week or two. Contagious disease would be killing the remaining survivors off fast within a few weeks. Most people probably think they could find something to eat out in the country side, on farms, but most farms these days produce only a few specific crops, and the crops are ready for harvest only a few weeks out of the year, and there aren\u2019t many farms within walking distance of most cities. MY grand parents grew eighty to ninety percent of what they ate. When I was a kid, we grew more than half of our own food, but as a working farmer myself, I bought ninety percent or more of what my family ate at the supermarket. Growing food for family use is a great hobby, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot cheaper and more practical to just BUY what you need, even if you own the land and machinery and have the necessary gardening skills. If you have the land, and the skills, it can save you a lot of money, you eat healthier, and it\u2019s good exercise, but in terms of money, if you have a good job, you can earn money to buy food easier than you can grow your own. I couldn\u2019t grow an orange to save my soul, without building a greenhouse, and the veggie season where I live runs from June till late September. If I want a tomato in January , I have to buy one produced either in a greenhouse or someplace a thousand miles to the south of where I live. I grew apples and peaches, by the thousands of bushels. You can\u2019t live on either one of these fruits, and the peaches got ripe from early July thru August. The apples got ripe from August thru early October. All my production was sold and shipped within a few days of harvest. Anybody who might have come to my house to steal food would have found a few veggies grown in a backyard garden, during the summer. Otherwise, almost all the food in the house was something bought at a supermarket. I can earn enough money to buy a bushel of potatoes at a local farm market or supermarket in a tenth of the time it would take to grow a bushel. Gardening works as a hobby, and as a way to profitably use otherwise free time, but it\u2019s just not economic if you are a working farmer. People living in places that still have preindustrial economies that produce their food locally, and that don\u2019t depend on trucks or the electrical grid, etc, would still be ok, except for having to defend themselves from other people attacking them in order to obtain food. A small more or less self sufficient community of people that practices preindustrial agriculture wouldn\u2019t be able to defend itself from well armed and desperate invaders determined to rob them of whatever food they might have, and probably enslave them as well. Of course such invaders would have to arrive on foot or by bicycle or canoe etc, but they would have firearms, and there would be a lot of them, and they would be in a do or die situation. Steal food, at gun point, or starve themselves. A large community of such people might be able to organize an effective defense. ",

            "answer_text": "If they ALL ran out right now, we\u2019d go back to a 16th -17th century type lifestyle. A much more local economy, far more people working on farms. as agriculture would be much more human-effort plus horse and water wheel intensive. Something like the Amish is the States. Of course it would be a very traumatic changeover. Remove oil-derived nutrients and mechanisation from the picture, and the food yield a farmer can obtain is about one third that possible using machinery, pesticides and fertilisers. Moreover, the soil that is used in industrial agriculture is nutrient-deficient and compacted. So without oil-based input it won\u2019t grow many crops. The bottom line is that without mechanism and fertiliser world food production will plummet. It would lead to a drastic decrease in world population. ",

We would be limited to hydro, geothermal, nuclear and existing biomass, solar, and wind. We would drop back to about 1/3 of our current energy. There are no where near enough EV to make up the difference. Waste to fuels facilities exist, but are on the order of 1%. cane ethanol would work and we would drop our import tariffs on Brazil to get it. All the wasted time and effort on fossils would stop cold, and all those reserves would be applied installed solar and wind ASAP. A moonshot. It would be WWII rationing and production and in 5\u201310 years, we would be better off and renewable. I\u2019m an optimist. ",
