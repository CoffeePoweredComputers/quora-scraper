            "answer_text": "I would just keep reading and see how it plays out, because this would only happen in a story. Giant squid (Archeteuthis dux) are extremely elusive. Only about 7 human beings have ever seen a living giant squid, and it wasn\u2019t in person- it was on a video monitor on a ship linked to a camera at the end of a mile and a half long tether hanging in deep water. Here it is:  Credit: Ocean X That footage was groundbreaking because humans and giant squid have no opportunities to meet one another. These squid live at fantastic depths and never come to the surface unless they\u2019re extremely sick and dying. The only reason we even know about their existence is because they wash up on beaches after they die, and deep sea trawlers sometimes catch them in deep sea nets as by-catch. The squid never survive the trip to the surface, though. They are invariably crushed under the weight of the fish in the net and/or the decompression. Judging by just how many we find (and we find them all over the world) They\u2019re obviously fairly common, yet we know very little about them. Like I said, a living one was finally captured on video just a few years ago (in 2012, and the same team did it again last year) Giant squid seem like prototypical sea monsters, and have certainly inspired storytellers for hundreds of years. It\u2019s easy to see how the very idea of a gargantuan squid surging up from the depths and dragging ships to their doom haunts the imaginations of many, but the truth is a little sobering. Giant squid aren\u2019t that giant. Oh they\u2019re big alright, but not pull a ship under big. They can reach 40 feet long, but most of that length is in their arms and two long feeding tentacles. The body of a giant squid tops off at about 6 feet long and about a foot in diameter. Overall they weigh about 200 lbs or so. Here\u2019s an adult specimen laid out:  img credits: google  If, for whatever reason, there was an interaction, I can\u2019t imagine a human being having much of a chance against an adult giant squid. The suckers that line their 10 rope-like arms are also ringed with sharp teeth.  credit: google. Just being grabbed by one would flay a persons skin. Look at what those suckers do to sperm whales:  Img credit: Wikipedia/Smithsonian There are some large squid in the ocean that definitely can be dangerous to humans- the Humboldt squid. They don\u2019t frequent the same waters that regular people do (usually keeping to the deeper parts of the ocean) But clocking in at about 2/3 the size of the Giants, complete with similar toothy suckers, Dosidicus gigas are fearsome hunters: they school and work together to catch prey, and are known to be aggressive. Local fisherman tell tales of the \u201cRed Devil\u201d snatching unsuspecting sailors off the decks of ships, but again the reality is a bit more timid: These squid are far more interested in pouncing on schools of fish like an organized pack of wolves than looking for ships to terrorize. As I said, being deep water critters, people generally have to go to these squid to wind up in dangerous situations, but it has happened. There are even outfits that do organized shark cage dives into schools of humboldt squid! There are plenty of creatures under the waves that could make a meal out of you, but the elusive and mysterious Giant Squid is among the least of your worries. Until we know more about it\u2019s behavior and ecology, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re just stuck with stories. Thanks for the A2A! ",
