            "answer_text": "The chemical equation is 2H2O = 2H2 + O2 Keq = [H2]^2 [O2]/[H2O]^2 The value of Keq at 2000K is about 10^-10 so at 2000K water is very slightly decomposed into its elements. At room T I can\u2019t imagine how small Keq is but it has to be greater than zero. So in the presence of O2 in the normal atmosphere the decomposition is depressed. Therefore, placing water in a vacuum and allowing it to vaporize and maintain some pressure without the presence of extra O2 the decomposition of water will be increased. Whether the reaction is kinetically labile is another question perhaps a catalyst is needed. So what you need to do is find the Keq at several temperatures and extrapolate to room T. The equations are in any Physical chemistry text. So yes a vacuum will change the decomposition of water because a component of the \u201dequilibrium\u201d is being removed . You just happened to pick a reaction that is almost not reversible at room T so the effect will not be measurable. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The water evaporates and the vacuum is slightly worsened briefly till whatever produced the vacuum takes care of the temporary intrusion. The water molecules would drift apart in vacuum - think of deep space for example as vacuum - but will remain as water molecules. Dissociation into hydrogen and oxygen needs much more energy and can happen when some high energy photon interacts with the molecule. ",

When you break down nothing into its smallest parts, you still have, well, nothing. Not oxygen nor hydrogen. Maybe you are confusing a vacuum with water. ",
