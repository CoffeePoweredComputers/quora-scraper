            "answer_text": "When, in science, a phenomenon is said to be \"random\", what does that mean? Is randomness determined by analysis of observations? Unlike mathematics, science is based on observations. When all initial conditions are accounted for, and repeated observations of a phenomenon show a variety of results which cannot be deterministic based upon the mathematical model chosen to predict the result, there are two choices: The phenomena is \u201crandom.\u201dThere are \u201chidden variables.\u201dIt is important to realize that \u201crandom\u201d does not mean \u201cstatistically unpredictable.\u201d For example, a radioactive atomic substance can have a determined half-life. But if you examine a single atom, you cannot predict when it will undergo spontaneous fission. Many quantum events are essentially random at the individual particle level. Even in classical science, experimental observations of phenomena based on continuous models are often subject to some amount of randomness. This is why scientists do not use Real numbers directly--scientific notation gives a numeric measurement two dimensions: precision and accuracy. When you did science experiments in school, you likely encountered some randomness on your measurements. This is part of the nature of the physical world, and many experiments get ever more precise and accurate results, but many mathematical models only have been observed to a limitted precision and accuracy, and what scientists find within yhe confidence level of measurement is random variation, when all known confounding factors are accounted for.

            "answer_text": "What is random? The most frequent description involves the expression \u201ccan\u2019t predict.\u201d For example, you cannot predict which light bulb on the assembly line will be defective. Or you can\u2019t predict the next lotto numbers. This, we all accept. Another descriptor involves the expression \u201ccan\u2019t explain.\u201d For example, I can\u2019t explain that tornado; it just appeared out of nowhere. Random? This type of randomness compels explanation. So, we make up theories, and often they are plausible. Another example is that global cooling occurred 50,000 years ago (last ice age). Again, no explanation but for unverifiable theories. We want to believe the theories because they give comfort. Yet, we know today\u2019s theories are built upon the ruins of yesterday\u2019s explanitons*. Yesterday\u2019s randomness is explained by today\u2019s theories. When it comes to tornados, volcanos, weather, and whatnot, the phenomenon of fractals, call it organized randomness, comes home - with a thud. *Explaniton \u2013 a particle of explanation for which the probability of truth is positive.
