            "answer_text": "Changing in season cycle is due to the fact that earth(it\u2019s geographical axis) is inclined 23.5degree from its vertical axis(imaginary). And as earth revolve around the sun, it receives different Insolation (Incoming solar radiation) due to apparent shift of the sun between to hemispheres.  This generates reversal of the season between N and S hemisphere.   According to this factor - from March equinox to september equinox -For N hemisphere - High sun seasonFor S hemisphere - Low sun seasonFrom September equinox to march equinox -For N hemisphere - Low sun seasonFor S hemisphere - Sun sun season[ Equinox - when thermal equator and geog equator coincides. Solistices - when thermal and geog equator does not coincides and are max distance away from each other either south or North. This causes change in the season cycle on earth. And finallyyyy - Due to this the duration of the day varies due to the apparent shift of the sun and it is different on poles and equator. During summer solstice(June) - latitude - 90N = 24Hours day D& 0 Hours night, 0(equator) = 12Hours day & 12Hours night, 90S= 0 Hours day & 24Hours night. If we move to N hemishphere the duration of the day goes on increasing and night duration is decreasing making N pole experiencing 6 months day.During winter solstice(Dec) - latitude - 90N = 0 Hours day D& 24 Hours night, 0(equator) = 12Hours day & 12Hours night, 90S= 24 Hours day & 0 Hours night.",

            "answer_text": "It's due to the inclination of our earth's axis (ranges from 21.5 - 26.2 degrees over an avg of 40k years) and the planet's revolution around the sun.  When's sun's moving towards northern hemisphere, the day length is more and correspondingly in southern hemisphere day length gets shorter. But, over equator both day and night length is almost same.
