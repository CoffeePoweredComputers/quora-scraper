            "answer_text": "Fun question... if there were to be 2 identical snowflakes, who would ever know? The short answer is, we don't know with 100% certainty that every snowflake is unique, but we can be very very sure. The long answer somewhat depends on your definition of \"unique\" (macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly?) and your definition of \"snowflake\" (how small would the snowflake have to be for it to no longer be a snowflake?). But more or less, it's all about probability. Some things in nature are exactly alike (elementary particles, for example). As molecules go up in complexity, so increases the probability that they'll differ from one another. Water for example is 2 hydrogen molecules + 1 oxygen molecule.  However, naturally occuring water molecules can contain an atom of deuterium in place of one of the hydrogens, and sometimes, the oxygen molecule will contain isotopes 18 or 17 rather than the common isotope 16 (which accounts for 99.762% of naturally occurring oxygen isotopes), already making them \"not unique\". Let's look at oxygen variation alone: a 1mg snowflake for example, contains about 3.34e13 molecules of water. Of these, 7.95e10 molecules would contain isotopes 17 or 18 rather than 16. These 7.95e10 different molecules will be scattered throughout the snowflake and can lend it different designs.  If we look at a very small snow flake (a picogram of a snowflake), which would contain some 33 water molecules, then less than one molecule will be different, and it would actually be reasonable to assume that you could find 2 pico-snowflakes that are identical to each other. However, looking at the big picture of a single snowflake:  There are hundreds if not thousands of features on that single snowflake (try counting the number of individual spikes)... Each one of them grew independent of each other.  According to probability, there are N! permutations for N things.  So, if there are say, 100 of those individual spikes, then there are 10^157 permutations to that arrangement.To give an idea of how big that number is, there are 10^80 number of atoms in the entire observable universe. That is a difference of 10^77 times! And that's how we know with a very high degree of certainty, that every snowflake that has ever fallen in the history of the universe has been unique. ",

            "answer_text": "We couldn't know for sure that all snowflakes were different, but it just seemed very, very, very likely that they were. However, finding one pair of identical snowflakes proves the whole theory wrong. ...and we've done just that. I had heard of this finding long ago, but I'm just gonna borrow the link that Chris Rentsch already drive-by-dropped for his answer, since it explains the math, the mistakes, and the eventual discovery of identical snowflakes: \"I was therefore pleasantly surprised to read in the bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that matching snow crystals were recently discovered by Nancy Knight of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The crystals in question admittedly aren't flakes in the usual sense but rather hollow hexagonal prisms. They are also not absolutely identical, but come on, if you insist on getting down to the molecular level, nothing's identical. They're close enough for me.\"http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/907/how-can-they-be-sure-no-two-snowflakes-are-alike ",
