            "answer_text": "When a charged particle enters a magnetic field, the field exerts a force on the charged particle given by [math]\\vec F = q(\\vec v \\times \\vec B),[/math] where [math]F,q,v[/math] and [math]B[/math] are the force, charge on the particle, velocity of the particle and the magnetic field strength respectively. The direction of [math]\\vec v \\times \\vec B[/math] is the direction of the force exerted on a positively charged particle. In case of a negatively charged particle, the force is in the opposite direction. [math]\\Rightarrow \\qquad |\\vec F| = |q| \\vec v| \\times |\\vec B| \\sin \\theta,[/math] where [math]\\theta[/math] is the angle between [math]\\vec v[/math] and [math]\\vec B.[/math] If [math]\\theta = 0^o[/math] or [math]180^o,[/math] there is no force acting on the particle and the particle continues to move with uniform velocity. If [math]\\theta = 90^o,[/math] the force acting on the particle is the maximum possible and the direction of the force is perpendicular to the path of the particle. The particle then moves along a circular path with the force acting as the centripetal force. When [math]\\theta[/math] has some other value, we can resolve the velocity into the direction perpendicular to [math]\\vec B[/math] and the direction parallel to [math]\\vec B.[/math] The component of the velocity in the direction parallel to [math]\\vec B[/math] will not be affected by the magnetic field. However, the component of the velocity in the direction perpendicular to [math]\\vec B[/math] will subjected to a force of the magnetic field which would result in a uniform circular motion. Hence the particle would have a component motion along a straight line as well as a circular component. Therefore the path of the charged particle would be in the form of a helix. ",
