            "answer_text": " iTheoretically, in case of roller support, there 3 different parts that is hard surface or fixed surface, second is roller and a beam. They don't have any rigid connection between them. So now, if we apply horizontal reaction beam will easily move in horizontal direction as there is no rigid connection between roller and beam & roller and fixed surface. Even if u try to rotate, it can rotate. But if we apply vertical loading, that fixed surface will give reaction. It's just act like a load bearing structure, one above other. If you wanna experience this physically, take a ruler/scale and a bottle. Put them on floor. Floor is fixed surface , bottle is roller, and ruler will act as beam. Now try to push ruler horizontally, it will move, try to apply some moment , it will rotate. Since roller support is free to move on application of horizontal or moment it can't give reaction for them. Now try to apply vertical load on that ruler, it won't move as roller, beam and fixed support all are rigid. I hope, now you're clear with roller support ",
