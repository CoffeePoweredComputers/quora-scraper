            "answer_text": "The field of artificial intelligence is essentially when machines can do tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses machine learning, where machines can learn by experience and acquire skills without human involvement. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data.The deep learning algorithm would perform a task repeatedly, each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome.   8 practical examples of deep learning Virtual assistants. Whether it\u2019s Alexa or Siri or Cortana, the virtual assistants of online service providers use deep learning to help understand your speech and the language humans use when they interact with them. Translations.In a similar way, deep learning algorithms can automatically translate between languages. This can be powerful for travelers, business people and those in government. Vision for drones and autonomous cars.The way an autonomous vehicle understands the realities of the road and how to respond to them whether it\u2019s a stop sign, a ball in the street or another vehicle is through deep learning algorithms. The more data the algorithms receive, the better they are able to act human-like in their information processing\u2014knowing a stop sign covered with snow is still a stop sign. Image colorization.Deep learning algorithms are able to use the context and objects in the images to color them to basically recreate the black-and-white image in color. The results are impressive and accurate. Facial recognition.Deep learning is being used for facial recognition not only for security purposes but for tagging people on Facebook posts and we might be able to pay for items in a store just by using our faces in the near future. Medicine and pharmaceuticals.From disease and tumor diagnoses to personalized medicines created specifically for an individual\u2019s genome, deep learning in the medical field has the attention of many of the largest pharmaceutical and medical companies. Personalized shopping and entertainment.Ever wonder how Netflix comes up with suggestions for what you should watch next? Or where Amazon comes up with ideas for what you should buy next and those suggestions are exactly what you need but just never knew it before? Yep, it\u2019s deep-learning algorithms at work. The more experience deep-learning algorithms get, the better they become. It should be an extraordinary few years as the technology continues to mature. ",
