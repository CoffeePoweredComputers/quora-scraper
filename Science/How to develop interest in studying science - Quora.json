            "answer_text": "Why do you want to develop an interest in science? Is it for you or for someone else? Is it because you were interested in science once and are now disillusioned by it because of how you are being taught in school? If you are looking to become interested in a subject because of your parents or someone else, stop. There is no real way to force yourself to become interested in a topic. You will just waste your energy and your time trying to be something you are not. I would not wish that on anyone. Be you. There is no one in the world like you, and you will wind up exactly where you are meant to be. If, however, you were once interested in science, and have fallen out of love with the field; that can be fixed. Remember when you loved science? What were you reading? Watching? Doing? Why was it fun? Go back and do those things again. Enjoy them! Then, while you are reliving the glory days, try to figure out the aspect you enjoy the most. Gather more books and materials along that vein and continue your enjoyment. In no time at all you will be back to loving science. Good Luck, and always be you. ",
