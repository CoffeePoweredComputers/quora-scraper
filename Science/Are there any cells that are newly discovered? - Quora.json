            "answer_text": "Classifying cells is a technology-driven field. The first technology was simple light microscopy, so we got a lot of cell types named for shapes (e.g. goblet cells) or natural colors (red blood cells, white blood cells). Then came various organic stains. So we have eosinophils \u2014 eosin is the organic dye they preferentially take up. Later came various immunochemistry techniques to classify by virtually any protein on the cell surface. So CD4+ T-cells and the like. The latest technological advance is single cell RNA sequencing, the results of which can then be put through computer algorithms. Cells aren\u2019t so much in distinct types as in clouds of similar gene expression. In any case, our ability to split them up is far outpacing our ability to name them. The below map is from a technique called tSNE and the author has colored the various regions to highlight differences in gene expression pattern.  ",
