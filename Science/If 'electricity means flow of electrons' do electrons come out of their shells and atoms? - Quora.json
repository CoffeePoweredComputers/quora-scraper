            "answer_text": "Yes, the electrons left their atoms, came out the shells when the metal was first formed. If we have a neutral copper atom, then we have a set of electron-orbitals or \u201cshells\u201d surrounding the nucleus. The electrons are trapped, they\u2019re part of the copper atom. But if instead we have many atoms forming a metal, something weird happens. The outer electron \u201cshells\u201d all merge together. The electrons leave their original atoms, and start orbiting all through the entire piece of metal. (Really, this effect defines the \u201cmetal\u201d concept.) It\u2019s as if the electricity which had been frozen and trapped inside atoms has \u201cmelted\u201d into a liquid. It\u2019s like an \u201celectric fluid\u201d inside the piece of metal. (This \u201cfluid\u201d is also called the \u2018electron sea,\u2019 or the \u2018ocean of charge.\u2019) Copper behaves something like a water tank, where the \u201cwater\u201d can swirl around inside, even while the copper remains unmoving. (The water is the metal\u2019s common electron-cloud; its sea of negative charge.) If we form the copper into a long rod, then the rod behaves as a pre-filled pipe full of fluid. Bend this rod and connect the ends to form a closed ring, and now we have a \u201ccomplete circuit\u201d where the movable charges can flow along, even while the solid ring remains still. In other words, all electric circuits seem to contain \u201cdrive belts\u201d inside them. When the closed belt of electrons starts to slowly turn inside a circuit, we call it by the name \u201celectric current.\u201d The belt moves slowly, but the whole thing starts and stops instantly, like a solid belt. \u2014- But here\u2019s a second issue. Electricity isn\u2019t the flow of electrons. Instead, electricity is the electrons themselves, moving or not. In physics we define the word \u201celectricity\u201d as the quantity of electric charge, where Quantity of Electricity is to be measured in coulombs. It\u2019s part of the SI metric system, the MKS standard units. In that case, matter is made of electricity (atoms are made of charged protons and electrons.) Wires are always full of electricity; they contain hoards of movable electrons. Batteries are actually electricity-pumps, and when we turn off the lights, the electricity remains right where it started: sitting inside the wires. But then all the grade-school textbooks contradict the international science standards and definitions. Instead, these books insist that electricity is the motion, the flow, the amperes. They define \u201celectricity\u201d as the flowing motion of the charges. In other words, they don\u2019t know the difference between \u201cwind\u201d versus \u201coxygen.\u201d Their mistake has caused a hundred years of confused students, as well as preventing the entire public from being able to grasp anything about electricity. As long as everyone believes that electricity is made of moving electricity, or that electricity disappears whenever electricity stops moving, or that \u201cair\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d are exactly the same thing \u2026nobody has a hope of understanding. To slice through the BS is simple. Just accept the fact that Electricity DOESN\u2019T mean the flow of electrons. Instead, electrons themselves are the electricity, protons are the electricity, and any charged particle is a tiny piece of electricity, even when it\u2019s not flowing. The unit called \u201campere\u201d does not measure the quantity of electricity, instead the ampere is just a flow-rate. \u201cAmpere\u201d means \u201cCoulombs of electricity flowing per second.\u201d ",

Infact conductivity of a material is dependent on the gap between conduction band and valence band. Which is nothing but the energy required to remove electron from the atom ",
