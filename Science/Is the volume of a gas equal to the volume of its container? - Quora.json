            "answer_text": "Yes, a gas will always have the volume of its container. The volume will not change if you change the number of molecules, what will change is the pressure. There are some great videos where they heat water inside a 55 gallon drum. The water turns to steam and they allow some of the steam to escape. At this point the number of molecules has changed, and the temperature has changed, but the volume hasn\u2019t changed. Then the seal the drum and spray it with cold water. The volume hasn\u2019t changed. But as the temperature of the steam inside changes the pressure inside can no longer withstand the pressure outside and the drum is crushed. Sorry I don\u2019t know how to hyperlink to you tube videos, but just search for \u201c Crush 55 gallon drum\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The volume of gas will conform to the volume of the container. As you introduce the gas into the container, then other variables, such as temperature and pressure, will alter to keep everything in balance. The ideal gas laws give a general idea of this relationship and the modifications for real gasses allow for the complication of intermolecular force.[1] Of course this is only applicable for a container with regular laboratory size. On a truly large scale, gasses are contained by gravity and the volume they occupy is more a distribution function than an exact volume.  Footnotes[1] Ideal gas law - Wikipedia",
