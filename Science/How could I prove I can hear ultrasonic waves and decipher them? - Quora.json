            "answer_text": "The tricky part is going to be coming up with a source for those ultrasonic sounds, which you know is generating the frequencies of interest and radiating them as sound. This will take some instrumentation and careful measurements to determine the frequencies and their amplitudes. Make certain that the gear is not accidentally emitting anything within the \u201cnormal\u201d range of audible frequencies which could lead to false results. Once you are sure you have such a system and it is working properly, just put the generator, a silent switch, an operator, and some witnesses in one room, and the sonic radiator and yourself in another where you cannot see them or hear what they are doing. Then just have the operator press the switch \u2014 or not \u2014 and you respond whether you can hear anything \u2014 or not. Perform enough trials to minimize any error caused by guessing. Not sure what you mean by \u201cdecipher them\u201d, though. Do you mean that if the device were used to send Morse code you could understand what was sent? Or that somehow a \u201cvoice\u201d is translated to ultrasonic frequencies and that you can comprehend it? That would be considerably more difficult, as some very specialized equipment would have to be designed and tested. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy. Get an ultrasonic unit (medical or industrial, it doesn\u2019t matter), ensure a transducer is actively emitting sound waves above 20,000 kHz then if you can truly hear the signal, explain what they mean. Of course this is absolutely impossible even if by some miracle you could hear the UT because those signals are used to propagate through a medium. The ONLY \u201cdeciphering\u201d going on is when return signals are used for diagnostic purposes; other than that, the signals have NO meaning. ",
