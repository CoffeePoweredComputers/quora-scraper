            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a long story but Moses was ordained a prophet and a leader for the people of God but was only a forerunner to Messiah\u2014not the real thing, which is why he couldn\u2019t lead God\u2019s people to the promised land, a role taken over by Joshua. His advent was highlighted by the giving of the Law which was essentially a prescription of death because it couldn\u2019t save people from their sins. A number of events show why he was punished\u2014Israel under the law was doomed to fail albeit the remnant would be saved, so Moses is a type of the Law\u2019s inability to save. Moses was punished essentially because he was flesh. Although a faithful and meek man his ministry (the Law) highlighted the weakness of the flesh because man couldn\u2019t keep it, thus neither could Moses or the priests (nor anyone else) keep from sin. The key points are that: 1. He struck the rock when he was supposed to speak to it. Striking is symbolic of putting to death and thus he was striking the Rock (which was Christ) thereby symbolizing Christ\u2019s death but the second time he was told to speak to it (the risen Christ) but he struck it a second time in a rush of personal pride. 2. Because he was a forerunner of Messiah but not sinless himself he was kept from entering the promised land but at the same time died in hope of the resurrection which was typified in the crossing of Jordan.
