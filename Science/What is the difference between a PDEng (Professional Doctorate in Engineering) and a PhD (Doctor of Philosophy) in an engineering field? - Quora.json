            "answer_text": "Although the PDEng and PhD are both postgraduate degrees, the PDEng programme and the PhD process are not equivalent. The PDEng is a practical oriented professional doctorate in engineering which is better suited to the direct needs of industry, whereas the PhD focuses on scientific research. The three most pronounced differences between a PhD and PDEng programme are: The PhD has a duration of 4 years whereas the PDEng has a duration of 2 years;The PhD trainee is directly engaged with the university, the PDEng trainee with the professional field;The PhD focuses on research, the PDEng on (technological) designs.If you are an ambitious student who has completed a Master\u2019s degree and would like to focus on technological design, then a PDEng programme might be the perfect opportunity for you! :)",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This is my own opinion. You have two choice here. You can either decide to stay with the industry and build something in the areas you are passionate about. Something like a new technology or a machine. Something tangible and of immediate value to companies. If you decide to go down this road, PhD would be a fancy dream and may be a desirable thing on your business card, but you won't have time to do that. And it is certainly not necessary. Or the second option would be to go into academia, finish your PhD and choose the teaching career. You will be doing research too, but on a more theoretical level, with little if any value to companies/businesses. They are interested in products, not in theories. Honestly, I don't see too many people who switched successfully from one career to another. It is possible, but it is highly unlikely. In sum, if you decide to stay with the industry, you absolutely don't need a PhD to succeed. If you decide to do a PhD, this would be a different route fpr your career. ",
