            "answer_text": "We live on the Earth. We cannot live anywhere else. We generate unwanted \u201cstuff\u201d that we have to dispose of in some way. No matter what way we choose, we are leaving that \u201cstuff\u201d on Earth. Therefore, it follows that Earth has always been a dumping ground, and very likely always will be. Recycling is a way to ameliorate the effects of that dumping. Observe trees. They dump their unwanted leaves on the ground. But, then they use those leaves, recycled into fertilizer as a source of needed nutrients. Good trees!! ",
