            "answer_text": "Depends on what other needed activities don\u2019t get done while you\u2019re occupying your time in casual conversations. This kind of chat is certainly common enough in kids \u2014 but in adults, I\u2019d find it a bit odd. There are only so many hours in our days. If you\u2019re not spending them in productive or constructive activity, then you\u2019re growing as deeply as you could be or accomplishing as much. Of course, realize that I\u2019m also a 75 year old village elder (now retired, thus available to chat here on Quora) who grew up poor and didn\u2019t watch television until my teen years because we didn\u2019t have one. So I\u2019ve never had \u201ctoo much time on my hands\u201d. It sounds to me like maybe you do have too much time on your hands. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is. If you have talk for long times you can use a earphone/ headphone to minimize damage. But prolonged use of earphone or headphone is also isn't good for ears. The best way is to old landline phones if you have to talk long. I know it sound a bit old school but is the best way to talk long. ",
