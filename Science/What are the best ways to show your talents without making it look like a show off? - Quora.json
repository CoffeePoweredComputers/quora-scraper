            "answer_text": "I believe it is way past time for us to get over that notion of shining too brightly and making others look bad. Everyone has the opportunity to shine, and if they don\u2019t take theirs, don\u2019t allow them to make you feel like you\u2019ve done anything wrong in using your natural strengths, gifts and talents to bring value. I believe the 2nd most important part of your question is to focus more on the value you can provide, and how it benefits others. When we look at what we can contribute that makes a positive impact to our team, our family or the world, it feels amazing. I\u2019ve never met a client in 18 years that didn\u2019t want that. We all want to know we matter, that we make a difference in some way. If you are focused on what you might give that benefits others and pleases you in the process\u2014that is a win-win. To move into action on this, you might volunteer to head up a project that uses your talents, but perhaps isn\u2019t part of your formal job description. Or, you might find another way to put those talents to good use in a volunteer capacity. Eventually, as your experience in this arena grows, people will take notice and more opportunities will open up to you as a result. The more willing you are to acknowledge the gifts and talents of others, the less likely anyone would see you as a showoff. Give those you work with genuine positive feedback whenever you can. All of us will benefit by co-creating workplaces that are supportive in recognizing the gifts and contributions of each individual. We all win in an environment like that, and we are more willing to take innovative risks. Best wishes! ",

            "answer_text": "Talent is a genuine skill in an alternate environment. First you have to identify what truly is your talent i.e singing dancing etc. If you think Singing then go down deep and identify what type of singing i.e Carnatic, Bhajan, Pop, Rap etc. Once you have really identified it, you have to practice it till you have reached a stage where you are ready to perform. After this you will just flow like a water without any hesitations. and yes others will not see as a Show off or Airy or Artificial. A talent looks like a show off only when people are hollow from inside and just trying to flaunt it or rather cover their shortcomings. ",
