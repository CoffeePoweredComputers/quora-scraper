            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s do this with a story, shall we?  There was an egg, call him Robert. Robert was a cosmic egg, and he was full of energy from inside. But, something unusual happened inside the body of this egg, may be the energy inside him lost its balance, and Robert cracked open with a Bang! Now, there was nothing around the blasted body of Robert. So, there were no atoms, no electrons, nothing. So, there were no forces like, Gravitational Force, Electromagnetic Forces, Strong Force or Weak Force. Because, hey! if there is no matter, there can\u2019t be any gravitational force right? But, the energy found more space as it came out of the egg, and had no restrictions to expand. So, it expanded. As the energy spread out of Robert, he gave a birth to 3 kids named, Quarks (Up Quarks and Down Quarks, they came out together from the womb!)Sister ElectronBrother NeutrinoAs these 3 started their first cry, on the other end, another 3 kids were born from the womb of Anti-Robert, Anti-quarksSister Positrons (Positive Electrons)Brother Anti-Neutrino Along with them, other like Robert gave a generation of Top Quarks, Bottom Quraks etc.  So, there were kids everywhere. As these kids started going to school together, they met each others and, well as you can imagine, school fights were inevitable between Robert\u2019s Kids and Anti-Robert\u2019s kids. They annihilated each other and more energy was born out of these matter. Some didn\u2019t fight and stayed away, others destroyed themselves in fights to produce more energy and then more kids.  Later on, as Robert\u2019s and other neighborhood kids became adult over time, they found internet and found the category of group sex. So, well it happened.  1 Down Quark+ 2 Top Quark = Proton.2 Down Quark+ 1 Top Quark = Neutron. Yes, that\u2019s how Protons and Neutrons were born. Then, the space cooled down further while started expanding continuously. Another generation moved on.  Now was the time for Protons and Neutrons. A Proton went on a date with his neighbor kid Neutron and they eventually became inseparable. Thus, their coalition formed the first hydrogen. Similarly, two Protons and two Neutrons decided to have a live in relationship in a same home, and thus we got Helium. A time came, when the universe was filled with 75% Hydrogen families and 25% Helium. Now, hydrogen had their own neighborhood and they called it the \u2018Hydrogen Cloud\u2019. (See the image below) Hydrogen Cloud was moving over time in the space, and as they came closer and closer, gravitational force among them started mixing them up, rolling them around a center, just like we crush apple pieces in a mixer. And due to this immense pressure and temperature, they started forming other elements of the periodic table you see in your chemistry book.  (Image: A Hydrogen Neighborhood, Hydrogen Cloud) On the other hand, helium neighborhood started doing the same and they formed stars like our own Sun.   So, yeah, that\u2019s all in all, in a few million years what happened after the Big Bang. If you\u2019ve seen this American Sitcom \u2018The Big Bang Theory\u2019, then you know the song. Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...The Earth began to cool,The autotrophs began to drool,Neanderthals developed tools,We built a wall (we built the pyramids),Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries,That all started with the big bang!

            "answer_text": "In the Big Bang, it was space that exploded. Here is a poem I wrote about it. (My favorite paragraph is the last one\u2014but don\u2019t skip ahead.) If someone would like to format this better for Quora, I\u2019d be happy to accept the help. Most of the lines should be single spaced, and the whole poem should be indented. Stanzas should be double spaced, but not lines. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The Creation a scientist\u2019s myth by Richard A. Muller At first there was nothing no earth, no sun no space, no time nothing. Time began and the vacuum exploded, erupted from nothing, filled with fire everywhere furiously hot and bright. Fast as light, space grew, and the firestorm grew weaker. Crystals appeared droplets of the very first matter. Strange matter fragile bits a billionth of the universe overwhelmed in turbulence of no importance they seem as they wait for the violence to subside. The universe cooled and the crystals shattered and shattered again, and again and again until they could shatter no more. Fragments electrons, gluons, quarks, grasped at each other, but were burned back apart by the blue-white heat, still far too hot for atoms to endure Space grew, and the fire diminished to white to red to infrared to darkness. A million year holocaust had passed. Particles huddle in the cold and bind themselves into atoms -- hydrogen, helium, simple atoms from which all else is made. Drawn by gravity, the atoms gather and divide and form clouds of all sizes stars and galaxies of stars, clusters of galaxies. In the voids there is empty space for the first time. In a small star cloud, a clump of cool matter compresses and heats and ignites and once again there is light. Deep within a star, nuclei are fuel and food, burning and cooking for billions of years, fusing to carbon and oxygen and iron, matter of life and intelligence, born slowly, buried trapped deep within a star. Burned and burdened, a giant star\u2019s heart collapses. Convulses. A flash. In seconds energy from gravity, thrown out overheats, explodes, ejects the shell of the star. Supernova! Growing brighter than a thousand stars. Still brighter, brighter than a million stars, a billion stars, brighter than a galaxy of stars. Cinders of carbon, oxygen, iron expelled into space escape free! They cool and harden to dust, the ashes of a star the substance of life In Milky Way galaxy at the edge of Virgo Cluster (named five billion years later, for a mother), the dust divides and gathers and begins to form a new star. Nearby a smudge of dust begins to form a planet. The young sun compresses, and heats and ignites and warms the infant earth ",
