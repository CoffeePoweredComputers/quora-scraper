            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not that gravity alter the passage of time directly. Gravity is the warping of spacetime. The distance between points always varies depending on the path taken. The straight path can be defined as the shortest one. But on a curved surface there can be more than one \u201cshortest path\u201d. It\u2019s the same in spacetime except thanks to the Lorentz metric, a straight path is a longest one. Clocks measure \u201cdistance\u201d (duration) along their path thru spacetime, so there cannot be any standard time unless there is a standard way of making a path thru spacetime. Mathematically this means that there must exist a time-like Killing filed (Killing is the name of a mathematician, not an adjective). If the universe were static (as Einstein originally thought) there would such a field and there would be a reference frame in which everything (on average) was stationary and we could use that frame to define a standard time. There would be deviations where there was local curvature (near a massive body) but we could just regard them as deviations from the standard. The problem is that in an expanding universe there is no time-like Killing field, so there is no standard time, even on a universe wide average. The best we can do is define time in terms of the observed local phase of the universes expansion. This is what cosmologists do; they define a co-moving reference frame. Operationally it\u2019s the reference frame in which the Cosmic Microwave Background looks isotropic. What phase it is, is the temperature of the CMB. So when you hear that the universe is now 45 billion light years in radius, \u201cnow\u201d refers to the \u201cseeing the same CMB as us.\u201d Of course this is a kind of coarse grained standard and is not something you can use to compare times to nanoseconds as required for example by GPS. For that we set up a local reference frame. GPS is referenced to an imaginary reference frame that has an elliposid approximating a non-rotating Earth. Then your receiver calculates corrections for the known rotation rate. ",

            "answer_text": "There isn't. Well done. Only a handful of people understand that time is relative. Now is universal, but duration differs. So, here's how it works. There are 2 different types of time. Cosmic time and atomic time. Cosmic time is based on the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, etc. 1 cosmic year is the time it takes the earth to orbit the sun once. A cosmic day is the time it takes the Earth to rotate once on its axis. This is divided into 24 cosmic hours. Atomic time is based on the decay of atoms. Think half life of plutonium or carbon. So, atomic time is basically related to aging. Now cosmic time isn't affected by gravity, but, atomic time is. When gravity is stronger, we age slower. The problem is that from our perspective, it's cosmic time that changes and atomic time which is constant. You see, our rate of perception is an atomic process. When our clock runs slower, so do we. We never realize that our clock is running slower. From our perspective, it appears that cosmic time is speeding up. If we go into an area where gravity is weaker, it appears that cosmic time slows down. ",
