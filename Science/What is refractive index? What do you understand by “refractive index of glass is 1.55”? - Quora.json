            "answer_text": "The refractive index of a material, say glass, is a measure of the extent to which a ray of light entering the glass from air is bent. More fundamentally the refractive index is equal to the velocity of light c of a given wavelength in empty space divided by its velocity v in a substance, or n = c/v. ",
