            "answer_text": "Mostly, that can be described in one word: miniaturization. this is the motherboard of the grandaddy of them all, the IBM 5150:  One of the most obvious differences is quickly visible: the sheer amount of chips! CPUs back in the day lacked a lot of the functionality that is taken for granted these days - memory interfaces, advanced math functions (like proper division :) ), I/O\u2026 Another very important part of the motherboards\u2019 size was the low density of memory chips avaliable, and hence the computers of the day needed a lot of them. I believe the entire right part of the pictured board consists of nothing but memory chips! Another important factor was the packaging of the components themselves - today, pretty much every component is surface mount, but back then, all of them were just through hole. That applies both to chips  and various passive elements.  Just for fun, compare the amount of chips on a modern motherboard:  Also, the production of PCBs has advanced leaps and bounds since then - more layers, denser traces, easier to make vias, better design and simulation tools, etc. Same applies to hard drives, floppy drives, power supplies\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The advancement of technology over the last fifty years can be owed to one single thing\u2026 miniaturization. In 1965 it was observed that the amount of transistors on a computer chip doubled every year. In simpler terms, every year we build the same performance into a chip half the size. As the chips get smaller, we can either put more chips in the same space (improving processing power) or make the device using the chip smaller. From your perspective you see computers as starting out the size of an old fashion TV and shrinking down into the tiny laptops of today, but it\u2019s even more amazing when you look at the whole picture, when we went from computers the size of a coat closet in the 1960\u2019s to a supercomputer that fits in your pocket (modern smartphones) today. Unfortunately, the original observation (which has become known as Moore\u2019s Law), is becoming harder and harder to maintain, as circuits approach the sub atomic level. So things might not continue to shrink at the pace you\u2019ve become accustom to. ",
