            "answer_text": "An experiment is said to be random if its outcome cannot be predicted with certainty before the experiment takes place.  Coin flipping is the canonical example: you always get either H or T as a result, and it's nearly impossible to know which beforehand. Is coin flipping truly random?  Perhaps not. If you designed an extremely precise coin flipping machine, and you were able to very tightly control every variable in the experiment, then it ought to be possible in principle to predict whether the coin will come up H or T. The reason it ought to be possible is that the physics of coin flipping is classical mechanics, and classical mechanics is deterministic: if you know all of the input parameters to infinite precision, then the theory will predict the outcome with certainty. Don't get discouraged, though. Despite what can be done in principle, in practice, no one has built such a machine. And even if someone does manage it, that still doesn't mean that classical mechanics can't give us random experiments. There are many classical systems that exhibit chaos, which is the property that the slightest error in initial measurement can dramatically change the predicted outcome. That still might not satisfy you, though. The impossibility of making the prediction isn't because of some fundamental randomness; rather, it's merely due to the unknowability of the initial conditions. Suppose we could know the initial conditions. Would there then be any truly random experiments? The consensus nowadays is yes. No classical systems are fundamentally random, but many quantum mechanical systems appear to be. Quantum mechanics makes statistical predictions, and there are good reasons to think that we'll never be able to do better than that (see Bell's theorem). Quantum mechanics is nondeterministic, and many quantum experiments are, as far as we know, fundamentally random. At the end of the day, the question is mostly philosophical wankery. An experiment can be random even if its outcome is determined, so long as the observer doesn't have enough information to predict the result. Probability is useful whenever you have to reason on incomplete information, not just when you're facing things that are fundamentally unknowable. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition , randomness is picking a number that is uniformly distributed.  But when you are considering finite set of elements in natural world it is highly unlikely yo achieve uniform distribution , This probability of choosing an element in real world can not be exactly same as probability of choosing another element.  And also two successive random numbers required to be independent and there should not be any correlation between these two. Any correlation between two random number make it predictable and guess worthy, and they does not remain random any more (Random Number -- from Wolfram MathWorld ). So in real all the random number  used are psuedo-random numbers .  It is impossible to produce an arbitrarily long string of random digits and prove it is random. Strangely, it is also very difficult for humans to produce a string of random digits, and computer programs can be written which, on average, actually predict some of the digits humans will write down based on previous ones. There are a number of common methods used for generating pseudorandom numbers, the simplest of which is the linear congruence method. Another simple and elegant method is elementary cellular automaton rule 30, whose central column is given by 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ... (OEISA051023), and which provides the random number generator used for large integers in the Wolfram Language. Most random number generators require specification of an initial number used as the starting point, which is known as a \"seed.\" The goodness of random numbers generated by a givenalgorithm can be analyzed by examining its noise sphere. True Random Number Service offers  true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs. ",
