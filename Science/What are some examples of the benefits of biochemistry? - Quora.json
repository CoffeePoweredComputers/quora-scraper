            "answer_text": "Biochemistry is sometimes called, the \u201cchemistry of life\u201d. This shows that biochemistry deals with the chemical elements, compounds, molecules at the cellular level of all living things (organic chemistry). 1. In nutrition. Biochemistry helps us to know the composition of various food types, their importance before and after consumption, during digestion e.t.c. Dieticians and nutritional health experts can actually use these facts to do their jobs very well. Toxicology (the study of poisons) is also an important part of biochemistry. 2. Medicine/Clinical Pathology/Forensics. Autopsies are carried out well, because of knowledge of biochemistry. Biochemistry has already mapped out what a \u2018normal\u2019 body should be like at death. So pathologists carrying out autopsies can detect abnormal conditions with knowledge of biochemistry. There are still a lot of benefits of biochemistry, but I'm typing on my phone, so I just wrote a few. ",

            "answer_text": "Biochemistry is the study of life processes which means you can be a great tool to the revolution of medicine. My gut tells me you want more than this. If you want to pursue biochemistry because you love it, go ahead and do what you love. If you're interested in a good pay, I don't think it's a great career choice. From where I come from (Nigeria), there's nothing for biochemists here, we are not valued. If you choose to go with your passion and also desire to be financially stable, you should develop other areas of your life (Self development) and this would require a lot of reading and partaking in work shops and trainings and taking online courses. I wish you the best! ",
