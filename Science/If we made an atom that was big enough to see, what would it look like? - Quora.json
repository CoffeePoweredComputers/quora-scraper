            "answer_text": "You wouldn\u2019t see the electrons; they have no particular location. Just probability. And since they are point-like, they seem to have no size, only charge and you can\u2019t directly see electricity. The nucleus would be a tiny structure, 1/1000th the size of the atom. If your eyes were good enough, the structure of the nucleus would be like writhing/vibrating \u2018ping-pong\u2019 balls. But none of this is true! The atom is a quantum creature and could not exist as you described. ",
