            "answer_text": "Yes Henri, a physical black hole can grow in mass and radius just by \u2018consuming\u2019 only light, but very very very slowly. The received light adds only a little bit of energy to the black hole that cannot escape afterwards, so the total amount of energy increases. That is why black holes always keep on growing, because there is always light to \u2018consume\u2019, if nothing else is around. Nothing can escape a black hole, nothing. That increased energy of the physical black hole makes is more massive (energetic) and therefore the physical radius will also increase. Needless to say that the almost meaningless Event Horizon or Schwarzschild radius of the non-physical but popular definition of a black hole will also grow, but that meaningless growth is so extremely small, relative to that meaningless relative big EH / S radius for most black holes, that its hardly meaningful to mention.

            "answer_text": "A black hole would not grow if nothing by light fell into it. Light is electromagnetic energy and energy does not take up space it simply occupies space where anything else could occupy at the same time. So light does not contribute to growth of inorganic things. Light does contribute to the growth of organic organisms on earth but not inorganic things like black holes. There is evidence that a black hole grows whenever it merges with another black hole. But after reaching a certain size limit they seem to stop growing. ",

            "answer_text": "Could a black hole still grow if it consumes nothing but light? Yes, I\u2019m sure of it. Light is a form of energy, and so is matter. It doesn\u2019t matter what form of energy the black hole consumes, it will still grow. Interestingly, there\u2019s a distinct possibility that black holes usually consume light. See the 2013 AMPS paper an apologia for firewalls. Footnote 31 refers to Friedwardt Winterberg\u2019s 2001 paper gamma ray bursters and Lorentzian relativity. Winterberg talked about the direct conversion of an entire stellar rest mass into gamma ray energy. He said this: \u201cif the balance of forces holding together elementary particles is destroyed near the event horizon, all matter would be converted into zero rest mass particles which could explain the large energy release of gamma ray bursters\u201d. I think Winterberg was right about this. ",

Photons don\u2019t emit any gravity. So they are completely insensitive for gravity. Black holes are extremely cold 2.7 kelvin. That\u2019s why blackholes don\u2019t emit light. ",
