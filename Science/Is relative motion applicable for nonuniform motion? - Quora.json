            "answer_text": "Yes it is applicable. In fact, RELATIVE MOTION is applicable to every single thing that is in motion with respect to any other thing. Let me give you some day to day examples:- You are sitting in a train and the train starts moving forward and you feel a sudden backward jerk. This happens due to inertia. But point to be noted is that when train starts, it accelerates i.e. undergoes NON UNIFORM motion. But your body wish to be at rest. Hence there is a relative motion between the train and your body and you feel a backward push.When you drop a stone and throw another from the same height and at the same instant, then they both fall with same acceleration (9.8 m/s^2) due to gravity. Hence because of acceleration, they both are under NON UNIFORM MOTION. But the stone that was thrown with some velocity will reach the ground earlier as their was relative motion between the two non uniformly moving stones.",

            "answer_text": "Yes absolutely. Non-Uniform motion means traveling unequal distances in equal amounts of time, and, relative motion is the calculation of the motion of an object with regard to some other moving object. Now, imagine you are moving in a car, which is accelerating at 5m/s^2. Now, if I am an observer, standing on a still ground, I will see you accelerating with 5m/s^2. But, if I am also in a car which is accelerating at 3m/s^2, your acceleration relative to my acceleration would be 2m/s^2. This suggests that relative motion is applicable in a non-uniform frame of motion. Hope you understood. ",
