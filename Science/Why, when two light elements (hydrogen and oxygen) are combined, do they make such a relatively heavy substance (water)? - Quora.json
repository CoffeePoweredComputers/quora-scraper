            "answer_text": "Why, when two light elements (hydrogen and oxygen) are combined, do they make such a relatively heavy substance (water)? The atomic mass of an atom and the density of that atom joined by some billions of billions of its brothers are two related, but different matters. The density is dependent on other than simply the mass of its constituent; it also depends on how closely the molecules, in large amounts, can pack themselves. Water molecules are such that they can pack ver densely in the liquid state and (unusually for molecules) slightly less densely as a solid. It packs so well that it has roughly twice the density of liquid methane, to which it is roughly equal to in molecular size and weight. Of course, methane is also weighed down by the bottle that keeps it a liquid under pressure. From a molecular standpoint, water may be made up of 2 hydrogens (mass=1) and an oxygen atom (mass=16), but methane is four hydrogens and a carbon atom (mass=14). The difference is how the various electrical charges are distributed over the molecule. That is also the major difference in their radical differences in physical and chemical traits. In chemistry, geometry is everything. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not that water is a heavy molecule, it is the mass of 2 Hydrogen atoms + 1 Oxygen atom. What makes water a liquid a room temperature instead of a gas like both Hydrogen and Oxygen are, are it\u2019s intermolecular forces. Both Hydrogen and Oxygen are diatomic molecules, which means they bond with themselves, and because the difference in the electronegativity between the bonded Hydrogen atoms and the bonded Oxygen atoms is obviously 0(same electronegativity)this makes the molecule non-polar(which means there is no attraction between the H2 molecules and no attraction between the O2 molecules)(difference of below 0.5=non-polar, 0.5\u20131.7=polar and 1.7+=ionic), this makes the density of both Hydrogen and Oxygen gas extremely small, which allows them both to be gases at well below room temperature. But the difference in electronegativity between Hydrogen(H, 2.2) and Oxygen(O, 3.44)is(3.44\u20132.2)1.24 which makes the Hydrogens-Oxygen bond in water polar, this means that even though they will share the elctrons, the higher electronegative atom(Oxygen in this case)will hog the shared electrons, making it partially negative, and Hydrogen partially positive(because it has less time with the electrons, and conservation of charge). Now because this is happening to every molecule of H2O, there begins to be electromagnetic interactions between the partially positive Hydrogen atoms on one water molecule and the partially negative Oxygen atom on another water molecule, for polar molecules, they would usually be called dipole-dipole interactions, but because Hydrogen is involved in the intermolecular forces, it is called Hydrogen bonding, this causes the water molecules to attract together and \u201cclump up,\u201d this makes H2O dense enough to be a liquid at room temperature, hence a liquid. Because there\u2019s electromaegnetic interactions between the moelcules, there is binding energy(energy of attraction between the molecuels) and therefore requires energy(heat, photons)to overcome the binding energy(it requires heat to diminish the attraction between the molecules)between the molecules and allow H2O to pass into the vapour phase(become a gas).
