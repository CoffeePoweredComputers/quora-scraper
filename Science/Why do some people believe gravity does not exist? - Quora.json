            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy do some people believe gravity does not exist?\u201d Do you mean gravity, as in a \u201cforce\u201d, that magically attracts one object to another, across a void, and is not divisible, or explainable with an underlying mechanism? Gravity, as an innate property of matter? Gravity as it is commonly accepted that it was \u201cenvisioned and asserted to exist per Newton\u201d?  I mean, we are not discussing whether some accept that the repeatedly observable phenomenon exists, are we? You toss a cannon ball in the air, the cannon ball falls to the ground. We are not discussing those who would suggest \u201cno it does not\u201d, are we? Cause that would be silly. Why would we bother. We know what we see. And in that sense, gravity definitely exists. If that is what we are discussing. People who think cannon balls do not fall to the Earth, then stop reading here. Look elsewhere for you answer.  If we are discussing the \u201cforce\u201d as an innate property of matter. Action at a distance across a void. Magic. Then read on. For I am \u201cthat guy\u201d. One \u201cof those\u201d. And I have my reasons. Well thought out reasons. Reasons I have worked for years to come up with. Don\u2019t expect a short answer. It\u2019s not. Don\u2019t expect a simple answer. It\u2019s not. But if you really want to know. I will give it my very best shot to explain. If I don\u2019t finish, remind me and I will come back and continue. It\u2019s late where I am, and I may run out of steam.  GRAVITY Perhaps you know. Quantum mechanics does NOT include gravity. Perhaps you know, there are two dozen or so \u201ccandidate theories of quantum gravity\u201d attempting to explain and mathematically describe whatever underlying field or agent or combination of somethings, that cause that darn cannon ball, to appear to fall. It falls. I do not argue that. Newton also did not argue that the ball falls. He observed the phenomena closely. He measured and calculated and gave us what we call the \u201cNewton\u2019s Law of Gravity\u201d. So let\u2019s start there. We\u2019ll come back to quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. We all know the common stuff about Newton. The whole apple story (whether true or false), and his calculations. But did you know that in a letter to some guy named Bentley, he had these specific comments to make: (From this web site: Original letter from Isaac Newton to Richard Bentley) Newton said this: \u201cTis unconceivable that inanimate brute matter should (without the mediation of something else which is not material) operate upon & affect other matter without mutual contact; as it must if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential & inherent in it.\u201d And Newton said this: \u201cAnd this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe {innate} gravity to me.\u201d And Newton said this: \u201cThat gravity should be innate inherent & {essential} to matter so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of any thing else by & through which their action or force {may} be conveyed from one to another is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters any competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.\u201d Interesting, eh? Newton HIMSELF, not only did not believe in the \u201cforce\u201d of gravity. But thought it an \u201cabsurdity\u201d. And thought any who believed in the \u201cforce\u201d of gravity was an incompetent thinker devoid of his faculties. Couldn\u2019t be much clearer than that, could he? He finished that paragraph with this closing sentence: Gravity must be caused by an agent {acting} constantly according to certain laws, but whether this agent be material or immaterial is a question I have left to the consideration of my readers. In short, he reported what he observed. He had his own thoughts as to the cause, but rather than assert that which he did not know, or not know, he left the decision as to the nature of gravity to the discretion of his readers. He did not in his texts even so go far as to attempt to sway them by calling them incompetent or absurd if they thought gravity to be a force. He left them free to make their conclusions without even that influence. A wise man was Newton.  Fast forward to Einstein. He gave us better calculations. But not perfect. If they were perfect, then spiral arms would move as his calculations predicted and there would be no need to invoke the presence of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, in order to stop his equations from being falsified and tossed in the garbage. BUT. Einstein tried and failed, for 40 years to come up with equations that would unify quantum mechanics and relativity. AND. He died before we knew there were problems requiring the inference of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. He once said, \u201cA hundred experiments may prove me right, it takes only one experiment to prove me wrong.\u201d (I paraphrase from memory, forgive if that is a little off, I am sure I got the sentiment correct). I also heard that when presented with the theory of a Big Bang, he said something like \u201cSir, your calculations and knowledge of mathematics seem spot on\u201d (they were after all based on his own equations), \u201chowever your knowledge and understanding of physics sucks\u201d. (paraphrased again, lol). IF Einstein were here today, would Einstein, do you think, continue to assert that relativity was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I suggest not.  Enough prefacing. I am going to provide a concept. One I think is correct. But i am going to only give the short version. (I am as I thought I would, running out of steam). Ask for more, if I don\u2019t get back to it, and I will get back to it.  GRAVITY, AS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENA. (My personal explanation, not to be confused with the theory of Erik Verlinde, which is not the same). First I suggest, matter is not physically substantial. Rather it is made of paired progression and regression of waves, in sets, orbiting a common center, while propagating through a \u201cvibrating\u201d mechanical field. So what is \u201cphysical\u201d. The particles that make up the \u201cvibrating\u201d mechanical field. Or put another way. To build a universe, from scratch. Start with an infinite void. Fill the infinite void with an infinite number of Planck scale, permanent, particles, that are all identical, and are all exactly this shape:  Pack them all in close to one another. Till they are adapt the mathematics of \u201cclose-packed spheres\u201d: Close-packing of equal spheres - Wikipedia But remember, these are not \u201cperfect regular spheres\u201d. They are wave-deformed spheroids. So although on average they can adapt to the mathematics of close packed spheres, if you rotate one, it\u2019s 12 neighbours will experience pushes, and relief from being pushed. As you can see from the nature of the shape of the individual particles. Every particle will be surrounded by 12 neighbours.  (Image is from this web site: The cuboctahedron) Now imagine, in a universe filled entirely with close-packed-wave-deformed-spheroids, if every one of them was to spin at a high rate of speed, all in the same direction. Clockwise.  (you have to mentally add layers on top as well, to imagine a universe filled with the Red-Blue-Blur-Ball shapes.) That is what I believe, and expect we will determine, the universe is made of. An infinite number of these, in a propertyless void, with no charges, nor forces, and no friction acting upon them, all rotating at high speed, creating a \u201cfield\u201d. Similar to, but not identical to David Bohm\u2019s Pilot Wave Field. To take a step back and show it more visually, this is the concept in a nutshell:   And thus, I do not, as Newton himself did not, believe in the \u201cforce\u201d of gravity. I do not believe in \u201cgravity as an innate property of matter\u201d. I believe in the transfer of frequency, wavelength, orientation, and polarity, and the progression and balanced regression of these features of the field when in harmonious, or less than harmonious motion.  A couple more quick points, before I quit for the night. The \u201cnegative space\u201d. That is, the space between the balls. IF they were perfect regular spheres, the negative spaces would be, tetrahedrons and octahedrons.  (I got the picture from another answer given here on Quora, I do not know the original source. It shows what I want to show. I do not suggest any relation to the contents of the other answer:What are the positions of tetrahedral and octahedral voids in an HCP unit cell?) So, the collection of shapes, assembled and spinning and oscillating due to the shape of the wave-deformed spheroid are Cuboctahedrons, Tetrahedrons, and Octahedrons, and the shape itself. I should add in, that the shape of the wave-deformed spheroid itself, is the mathematical combination of an e-mode wave-function and a b-mode wave function.  Put one e-mode and one b-mode together, and you get:   Now, I am not suggesting (yet), that you should stop believing in \u201cGravity as a Force\u201d. I haven\u2019t nearly presented all the necessary evidence to suggest such. But I am going to wrap up for now, and come back to this. In the meantime, I\u2019ll ask this question. Have you ever asked yourself, \u201cwhy do you believe in forces, that is, action at a distance across a void\u201d.  Some circumstantial pattern comparisons that may, or may not be supportive. Like Newton said, \u201cForces\u201d as in, action at a distance, and \u201cpure un-contained energy\u201d (energy with no medium\u201d, if they don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d to exist, to explain existence\u2026 IF a physical, mechanical \u201cclock-work-like\u201d mechanism, can show that it\u2019s properties, show up in a \u201cfractal\u201d or \u201cinverse holographic\u201d demonstration (are observable/infer-able at various scales, throughout physics, If like a convoluted set of gears, in a massive machine, CAN, viably, explain the perception of \u201cforces\u201d, and the perception of \u201cparticle wave duality\u201d, and orientablity, and polarity, and relativity, and visibility, and heat and friction, ans all the rest, Then, thereafter to imagine that \u201caction at a distance\u201d, or anything else that seems \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d, or \u201cwithout logical justification\u201d, Just would no longer feel \u201cright\u201d.  Clockwork universe - Wikipedia   But, we HAD to generate a belief in \u201cdark energy, and dark matter\u201d, so what would Einstein say about that?  So, we have to consider the necessary inferred existence of \u201cdark matter\u201d and \u201cdark energy\u201d. A \u201ccrack\u201d in relativity. Einstein said: \"From the just proved assertion, that the speed of light in a gravity field is a function of position, it is easily deduced from Huygens's principle that light rays propagating at right angles to the gravity field must experience curvature.\" And: \u201cThe principle of the constancy of the speed of light can be kept only when one restricts oneself to space-time regions of constant gravitational potential.\u201d From this Wikipedia page: Variable speed of light - Wikipedia Einstein believed in a 4D universe. E=mc^2 IF ALL mass is treated as \u201cpointlike\u201d, and has \u201cspin\u201d, and \u201cpolarity\u201d and \u201corientation\u201d, and THEIR INVERSE, then, All things are going in every direction and back again, in order to be considered \u201ca point\u201d. Dark matter and dark energy \u201cpermeate\u201d existence. Inferred. They are \u201cmedium-like\u201d. The \u201cradius\u201d of wavelength x frequency is inverse to frequency x wavelength. At all \u201cpoints\u201d as all times. For each expanding point, all 4 dimensions exist. And all \u201cpoints\u201d are part of, integrated with, the \u201cgravitational field\u201d and the \u201c3D\u201d existential field.   CUBOCTAHEDRON Are there patterns which lend credence to a cuboctahedron based universe, indicating close packed spheres. Consider the Amplituhedron:   (Ignore the little math pieces under the drawing on the bottom left. A little about the amplituhedron (or what I call the \u201chyper-coboctahedron\u201d, 6 descending and 6 ascending waves, occupying the same time and space, matched and inseparable from one another. Going forward and backward at the same time. An amplituhedron is a geometric structure introduced in 2013 by Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka. It enables simplified calculation of particle interactions in some quantum field theories. In planar N = 4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory, also equivalent to the perturbative topological B model string theory in twistor space, an amplituhedron is defined as a mathematical space known as the positive Grassmannian. Amplituhedron theory challenges the notion that space-time locality and unitarity are necessary components of a model of particle interactions. Instead, they are treated as properties that emerge from an underlying phenomenon. The connection between the amplituhedron and scattering amplitudes is at present a conjecture that has passed many non-trivial checks, including an understanding of how locality and unitarity arise as consequences of positivity. Research has been led by Nima Arkani-Hamed. Edward Witten described the work as \u201cvery unexpected\" and said that \"it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be.\" From Wikipedia: Amplituhedron - Wikipedia   Snowflakes form in \u201cfreefall\u201d, sort of coming, and going, 10^20 water molecules get together. Crystallize into a planar, 3D, 6-pointed cuboctahedral framework based pattern, that can be observed over and over again:   Have you ever seen the framework of a snowflake predicted to such level of details? Or are they \u201cjust\u201d 6 sided?  There is a theory by a gent named Garrett Lisi. E8 theory. Here is a pictogram made from that theory, compared to the cuboctahedron:    Supersymmetry laid out:   And the \u201cshape\u201d itself. Called THE RED-BLUE-BLUR-Ball. Or RBBBs for short.  Think about hydrogen orbitals.  (which are much larger than 1 RBBB.)  I realize that pattern matching is circumstantial. Sometimes legal cases are built only on circumstantial evidence when there is enough of it. Keep in mind that patterns are math. Here is another \u201cmatch\u201d of sorts. BOHMIAN MECHANICS a.k.a. De Broglie Bohm Theorem, a.k.a. Pilot Wave Theory. Here is the cover of a book written by David Bohm about his group wave theory. Note the pattern he chose to put on the cover. Now, imagine it is a deflated balloon and \u201cblow it up\u201d. Add a 3rd dimension to it\u2019s flat, 2 dimensional form. Then compare, in your minds eye to the Red-Blue-Blur-Ball.  You see what I mean?  Have you seen or heard of Hadley Cells? They are persistent patterns of vertical and horizontal movement of air in our atmosphere. This particular depiction grossly exaggerates the depth. But look at the similarity. Keeping in mind that the top of our atmosphere is a close approximation of the line between \u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cnon-existence\u201d (the vacuum of space). Again, circumstantial. Just a contribution to a collection of potentially supportive mathematical pattern matching.  Note also, that it is always \u201clopsided\u201d, and \u201cstirred\u201d because of the tides of the Sun\u2019s and the Moon\u2019s gravitational impact.   Or consider the \u201cshape\u201d of Jupiter if the infrared spectrum is isolated.  See the \u201ctroughs\u201d, their curvature, their depth? Yes, it is circumstantial. Yes, it may be that the confirmation bias is strong in me. Yes. Perhaps \u201cforces\u201d (action at a distance) really does exist. I just wonder, and am putting that assertion to the test. Considering an alternative. Looking for a better explanation. :-)  Or consider the CMB. A magnetically oscillating \u201cbackground noise\u201d that is the backdrop to the portion of the universe we can observe. It has been analyzed by a NASA mission called IBEX. And the magnetic fluctuations deciphered. They have revealed a pattern of e-mode and b-mode oscillations. A researcher name Marc Kamionkowski did the math.  When monitored over time, shows this pattern:  Which equates to this pattern:  Here is a story about Marc\u2019s teams findings about the nature of the CMB published in Scientific American: Proof that the Universe Inflated Rapidly After the Big Bang Here is the picture that accompanied the story:  Recognize it? :-D  This article discusses how Strontium atoms choose to assemble themselves when laser light is shone through them. Do they reveal an underlying \u201cgroup wave\u201d pattern. A \u201chidden variable\u201d pilot wave, like that which David Bohm suggested, like that which I suggest? Look at the groupings the ground state and excited state atoms chose to assemble into and you can\u2019t help but wonder why they did so. The article asks the question, could this methodology be refined to the point it reveals the nature of some \u201cnew physics\u201d. Circumstantial. But compelling.

            "answer_text": "The only group I know of that believes that seems to be the Flat Earthers. Their problem is a bit complicated - and there are several competing flat earth theories (all of which are untenable) that require different consideration. Some Flat Earthers claim that the Earth is a circular disk - like a coin, say. With tall walls of ice around the rim to prevent the oceans (and maybe the air) from falling over the edge. If this were the case then the center of gravity of the disk would be in the middle - somewhere deep below the North Pole. If this were true - and there was gravity as we know it - then as you moved away from the pole - gravity would no longer pull straight down - but rather at an increasingly diagonal angle! So you\u2019d feel like you were walking uphill - even on level ground! Even the Flat Earthers can\u2019t cope with that idea\u2026so they can\u2019t accept gravity as a fact.Other Flat Earthers claim that the Earth is more like a cylinder - maybe long and thin like a pencil - with us living on the flat end of the cylinder. If the cylinder was VERY long compared to the diameter - then conventional gravity would be VERY nearly vertical everywhere. So these Flat Earthers COULD be content to believe in gravity. However, if they do that then there are problems with what holds up the Sun and Moon and prevents them from falling to Earth. Note that for other complicated reasons, they have to believe that both Sun and Moon are only about 3,000 to 4,000 miles above the surface of the Earth and each are about 30 miles across(!!) - so with regular gravity, they\u2019d just fall down!Yet others claim that the Earth is an infinitely large flat plane. Almost all of it is covered in a thick ice sheet - but the part we live in is a circular hole in the ice. The thickness of the Earth is immaterial. These people are under the mistaken impression that gravity would cause problems for this idea too - but in fact, it would not - because the gravitational pull of an infinite plane of any thickness you like is always straight down. But because they don\u2019t seem to have thought of this - they too are mostly disbelievers in gravity.So - if not \u201cgravity\u201d then what? The general idea (which is actually kinda clever) is that some unknown force (cosmic acceleration or universal acceleration or electromagnetic acceleration) is pushing the (flat) Earth, Moon, Sun, stars and (tiny) planets upwards with a constant acceleration of 9.8 meters per second squared. If that were true (and there were no gravity) - then it would indeed FEEL like that was gravity present. Many non-Flat Earthers complain that the speed of the Earth would very soon exceed the speed of light - which is impossible. But that\u2019s a mis-reading of the theory of relativity - and for once, I have to leap to the aid of the flat earthers and point out that speed must always be measured RELATIVE to something - and there is nothing to measure it\u2019s speed relative TO if everything is moving at the same speed. What fails with this theory is the details: We know that (because the real world Earth isn\u2019t a perfect sphere - and because it\u2019s spinning) - there is less gravity at the equator than at the poles. The universally accelerating Flat Earth would have precisely the same acceleration (and therefore the same feeling of fake-gravity) everywhere.We know that there is less gravity at the tops of tall mountains - which universal acceleration can\u2019t explain.When you are out at sea - where there is relatively low density water beneath you and less high density rock - or where the composition of the rocks beneath you is different - you get slightly different gravity readings\u2026so, same problem again.What about tides? When the sun or moon is overhead - the apparent downward acceleration is lessened - which can\u2019t be explained by upward acceleration alone. Sometimes they try to \u201cfix\u201d this by claiming that the sun and moon \u201cattract\u201d water upwards (which seems a lot like \u201cgravity\u201d to me!)\u2026but what they fail to understand is that you get a high tide both when the Moon is overhead AND 13 hours later when it\u2019s below your feet. The \u201cmoon attracts water\u201d idea fails to explain that second tide - which in reality is due to the fact that the Earth/Moon system rotates about a point that\u2019s not at the center of the Earth - so we have a small amount of centrifugal force being exerted on the side of the Earth furthest from the Moon - which causes that second tide.Personally, I also dislike the theory because the Earth (which appears to be made of rocks) is being universally accelerated - but if I dig up a rock and drop it - then it falls to the ground\u2026meaning that it\u2019s no longer being accelerated by the mysterious force. The whole theory is a typical Flat Earther mess. When faced with one problem with their theory (why doesn\u2019t the gravity vector tilt?) they come up with a quick reaction to it (the Earth is accelerating upwards) - and DON\u2019T think through all of the ramifications of that idea before getting so invested in it that they will not re-think it. What\u2019s bizarre is that if they quietly dropped the \u201ccoin-shaped\u201d Earth and instead went with a very long cylinder or an infinite plane - then gravity would have worked out just fine for them. But these people aren\u2019t the sharpest tools in the shed\u2026so we can\u2019t expect logic or reason to penetrate their skulls. ",
