            "answer_text": "Before the lockdown was implemented, I was living a robotic life like most of us. I knew I had to make changes, I knew I had to inculcate certain habits to make those changes, I knew I had to START\u2026but I just kept living almost as if somebody had put a socket and a battery in me and I switched it on every morning, did the routine stuff, and then switched it off at night only to go off to sleep. But, the lockdown changed things for me or maybe it was just me who pushed myself to change and take charge. The number #1 thing that I learned is that I am Resilient. I realized that sooner or later I have to take charge of my actions because it only takes a few seconds to indulge in self-destructive habits but it takes a LOT OF WORK to develop that drive and discipline in you. I used to find A THOUSAND reasons to not work out but since the lockdown was imposed and because everybody was propagating the idea of home workouts, I decided to take charge. Of, course it is easier said than done. You can't just get up from your bed and start working out because you saw a video of somebody doing some amazing workout routines on Instagram. It takes a LOT MORE than just that. Therefore, I decided that my workout routine cannot be boring, which meant that I needed to do something that involves a \u201cfun\u201d element as part of my workout. Which is why I started dancing. Of course, I keep making changes to my workout but dancing is what keeps me going and self-motivated. The secret to being resilient is- Do the tough thing but DO IT YOUR WAY. (Applies to all domains in life) The number #2 thing that I learned is that Everybody is a treasure in themselves. They do not need to keep finding that treasure in a loved one/job/money/fame. Do not get me wrong here. I don't mean that relationships are not important and that other humans who we bond with to form relationships should be discarded to discover your self; or that all jobs are worthless. What I intend to say is that as humans, we forget to validate ourselves. In a world where people feel validated only when OTHERS COMPLIMENT THEM or OTHERS TELL THEM ABOUT THEIR STRENGTHS, they will very quickly feel invalidated when those same others WILL CALL THEM OUT ON THEIR WEAKNESSES, BELITTLE THEM, CRITICIZE THEM. That is why it is important to find that treasure within you. I am still in the process of doing that but it has been a wonderful and empowering journey. The number #3 thing is that we have to keep moving ahead with time and the developments and degradation that are taking place in nature and society. Some 20 years ago, the environment did not require as much care and concern as it does today, but how many people can honestly say that they are doing even small bits to reduce the pollution or the harm that is being done today? Yes, the environment wasn't fucked up 100 years ago so you sat on your sofas and watched the TV but it is IS fucked up today so why are you still living with that 100-year-old mentality? Times have changed, so move ahead with it and take action accordingly. If one human can do just their bit, it will make a tremendous change in the universe. The same thought applies to every other area in life. Adapt and grow. ",
