            "answer_text": "Typically enthaply, but you have to be careful, because anyone can define any letter however they want in a particular equation. H can also be height, or the Planck constant, or head, but in those cases it is usually lower case. Enthalpy is the main way to store energy in fluids like water/steam in power cycles. It is the sum of pressure-volume energy plus internal energy, where internal energy can be thought of as heat energy. It is used when the fluid\u2019s kinetic energy or gravitational potential energy or other energy mechanisms are either not important (which is often the case) or they are addressed separately. Enthalpy represents the amount of work that can be done (which is the same as energy) in many applications. For example, the enthalpy increase in steam (due to burning coal) in an old steam locomotive gets turned directly into the mechanical energy to move it through the dessert as it is chased by train robbers. But I digress\u2026 ",
