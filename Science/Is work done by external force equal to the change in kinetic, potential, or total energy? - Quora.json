            "answer_text": "The work-energy theorem: the total work done by all external forces equals the change in kinetic energy. Another version: the work done by all non-conservative forces equals the change in total (kinetic + potential) energy. We\u2019ve separated the conservative forces from the non-conservative forces. The work done by a single external force? Unless it\u2019s one of the above \u201ctotal\u201d work, can\u2019t be connected with either change in energy. ",

            "answer_text": "In general it contributes to the total energy change which is a sum of kinetic and potential energy. Depending on the physical situation an external force may influence either potential energy only (raising a body in a gravitational field) or only kinetic energy if there is no potential energy contribution to the total energy. Of course there may be cases when both types of energy change, like in case of a starting rocket, when applied force exceeds significantly the rocket weight. ",
