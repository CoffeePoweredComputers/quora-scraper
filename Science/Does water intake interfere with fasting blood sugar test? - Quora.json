            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Some folks think that by drinking water, they\u2019ll \u201cdilute\u201d the glucose (sugar) concentration in their blood. That\u2019s impossible - because when you drink water, it goes into your gut - NOT your bloodstream. So unless you\u2019re injecting an intravenous saline solution, you won\u2019t affect your BG (Blood Glucose)levels. While the water you drink does ultimately provide the fluid your body takes into it\u2019s cells, interstitial spaces, bloodstream and so on, it is a controlled process, and your renal system is the controlling component. ONLY the amount of fluid needed is \u201cadded\u201d to the circulatory system\u2026 and it\u2019s kept at a relatively constant pressure (with some variation, obviously - but like BG levels, it\u2019s still a controlled process).

            "answer_text": "No. You can drink water and it will not change your blood sugar to rise. It may even help to bring it down a little. Because it will make you pee and some (not much) of the sugar will pass. But that if is only water. If you made tea or coffee with it then it would change it. If you need to do a blood test from a fasting , water is all you can before the test. I have been told that before the test it is wise to drink water because it is easier for the tech to find the vain for the draw. ",

When my plasma levels have dropped significantly, I will have high blood sugar, even though the amount of sugar in my bloodstream is probably about the same as when I started. This is exactly due to the reading being a concentration measurement. After a gallon of water has been drunk, processed by the gut, and absorbed into the blood stream, my blood sugar will return to normal without the aid of insulin. ",

Conversely if you aren\u2019t hydrating sufficiently the reading might be slight \u201coff\u201d and other readings as well. Sometimes the technician will ask if you eaten and drank anything within the last so many hours to make appropriate comments that accompany sample. ",
