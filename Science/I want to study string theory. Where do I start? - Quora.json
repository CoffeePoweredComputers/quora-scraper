            "answer_text": "For someone just starting college, the most important subjects to start with would be vector calculus, complex analysis, differential geometry, and linear algebra.  All of these are essential for having any chance of understanding basic string theory, so they should be mastered before moving on to more advanced topics.  Topology and group theory are also very important for string theory, although I do think it's possible to have only a vague understanding of these subjects and still learn some basic string theory.  Algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and even category theory are often used in advanced string theory, but not necessary for grasping the basics. The most immediate prerequisite for string theory is quantum field theory, since nearly all of the concepts in string theory are things that grew out of quantum field theory and are based on quantum field theory.  You should probably have at least a year of quantum field theory under your belt before attempting to learn string theory, although I think some very bright people may be able to attempt it with only a semester or so (this certainly would not have been possible for myself).   Unfortunately quantum field theory itself has a lot of other physics prerequisites that need to be met before one can start learning it.  And general relativity is the other big physics prereq for beginning string theory. The prerequisites for quantum field theory are having a solid understanding of quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, and electromagnetism.  Statistical mechanics is also a really good idea, although less essential than the other 3.  Note:  by classical mechanics, I mean an understanding of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics, calculus of variations, Euler-Lagrange equations, etc... not just what's covered in an introductory physics class on Newtonian physics. For general relativity, fortunately the prerequisites overlap a lot with quantum field theory:  mostly electromagnetism and classical mechanics.  But general relativity is where differential geometry becomes very important.  (Differential geometry is also important for quantum field theory, but perhaps not as much as linear algebra and group theory--some of it can be picked up along the way.) So basically, it's a long road.  But start taking lots of math classes, as well as physics classes.  And eventually (probably not until graduate school) you will have all of the required tools in order to start learning string theory.  If you are the kind of person who would enjoy string theory, then you'll almost certainly find each of these subjects interesting in their own right and worth studying for their own sake.   It's a long road, so if any of it starts to seem boring or tedious, remember you can always decide at any time it's not the road for you and jump track to something else.  Or, you may find that the further you get, it becomes more clear it's exactly the road for you!  Either way, buckle up and enjoy the ride :-) ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to invest your time and energy in studying string theory, maybe \u2014 first and foremost \u2014 you can begin by surveying some popular books on the subject by Brian Green, Michio Kaku, Leonard Susskind and such. It\u2019s always a good idea to get a bird\u2019s eye view of the vast \u2018landscape\u2019 of string theories ;) so that you know what the theory is all about, what it tries to achieve, and what sort of ideas and concepts you must know as background knowledge to be able to make any progress in understanding anything about it at all. Then, I would strongly recommend to read, in parallel to any of the books by the authors mentioned above, one or more of the following books: The Trouble with Physics by Lee SmolinNot Even Wrong by Peter WoitFarewell to Reality by Jim BaggottAfter reviewing the history of the subject, these will make the case why string theory is neither a \u2018science\u2019 nor a \u2018theory\u2019 and give a recent account of why it has failed as a research program altogether. If you go through at least one book from each side, you should be able to judge for yourself whether it is a worthwhile investment/commitment for you to delve into the \u2018string universe\u2019. As a bonus, you\u2019ll definitely find a list of relevant references in these books \u2014 irrespective of the direction you chose \u2014 to further your understanding of the universe and you can follow from there on. Good luck! ",
