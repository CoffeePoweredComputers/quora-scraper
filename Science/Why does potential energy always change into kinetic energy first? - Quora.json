            "answer_text": "Potential energy is related to the energy within the system when object is at some height. As soon as it comes to the zero height means hit the ground its all potential energy get converted into kinetic energy and then turn into heat,friction or in other form of energy. This is because the potential energy initially gives some velocity to the system at zero height which included as K.E. after which it collaspe and produce other form of energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Potential energy is energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects. It is a stored energy. When the potential energy is by virtue of height of an object, its falling down is the most proximate thing and while falling the stored potential energy gets converted to Kinetic energy in its mechanical term. Other Common types of potential energy are gravitational potential of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential of an extended spring, the electric potential in the form of electric charge and the reactive potential in the form of chemical potential.
