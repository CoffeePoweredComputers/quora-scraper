            "answer_text": "What days of production? Are you trying to liquify hard bar soap? If so, as you have already learned, it really doesn\u2019t work. Liquid \u2018soap\u2019 is synthetic detergent, which works in the same way as real soap does but is made of synthetic ingredients, whereas hard soap is made from fats and an alkali and can\u2019t be liquified so you get something like liquid hand soap or dish detergent. What you get when you try to liquify soap is a very slimy mess that will separate, just as you\u2019ve seen. ",
