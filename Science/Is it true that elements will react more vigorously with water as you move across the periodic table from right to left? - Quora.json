            "answer_text": "Nope. Although there are lots of periodical properties that do vary across the Periodic Table, the reactivity of elements with water does not follow a specific trend nor does it vary smoothly. Let me show this with actual examples:  If you move across the Periodic Table from right to left, you will go from Group 18 elements (the so-called noble gases) back to Group 1 elements (the alkali metals). The corresponding reactivities with water, however, do not change accordingly: noble gases do not react at all with water;Group 17 elements (the halogens) do react with water, though only elemental fluorine does so vigorously. Chlorine and bromine rather seem to dissolve in it and iodine even dissolves poorly in it, thus hampering its actual reaction;Group 16 elements (the chalcogens) do not react with water. Gaseous oxygen dissolves poorly in water;Group 15 elements (the pnictogens) do not react with water in general. Antimony and bismuth become reactive toward hot water and when heated, respectively;Group 14 elements (the carbon group) show a trend: the more nonmetallic elements do not react with water whilst metallic elements necessitate heating;Group 13 elements either do not react with water (B, Ga, In), develop a dense oxide layer that prevents further oxidation underneath thus stopping the reaction (Al), or slowly dissolve (Tl);transition metals display fluctuating behaviour but in general poor reactivity toward water;Group 2 and 1 metals do react with water and their reactivity increases on going down either group. Group 1 metals are more reactive than Group 2 metals and that may be taken as a pattern, though limited to a portion of the Periodic Table.Once again, when one tries to describe the reactivity of elements toward water there is no clear trend on moving from right to left because the elements and their fundamental characteristics vary enormously doing so. Other fundamental properties (ionisation energy, electronegativity, shielding) do vary more smoothly and therefore their patterns clearly surface. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what answer you want. The problem is that the only elements that react really vigorously with water are groups 1 and 2. All the rest are pretty much \u201cmeh\u201d. If you drop the data points into a computer program and ask it to fit the best straight line, the line rises smoothly from right to left. The real reactivities don\u2019t do any such thing, and generalizations about a straight line aren\u2019t appropriate. An accurate statement is \u201cIn general, group 1 elements react quite vigorously, group 2 elements less vigorously, and the other elements feebly or not at all.\u201d ",
