            "answer_text": "Essentially, the Pauli exclusion principle is generally relevant when you have a bound, energy-minimizing systems.* The \u201cbound\u201d requirement means that there has to be some sort of interaction, although it could be an interaction with an external potential (supplied by, say, a proton). The \u201cenergy-minimizing\u201d means that we\u2019re not really looking at a dynamical system like scattering, but rather an (approximately) equilibrium situation like an atom or a neutron star (and that\u2019s a part of why we want a bound system). In other words: the PEP doesn\u2019t come into play when they get close to each other. Rather it comes into play when it is pushed together and forced to do what it does when it is held there. What this tells you is that, for the potential emerging from this \u201cpushing force,\u201d instead of them both falling into the lowest energy state, due to the PEP, one will be forced up into the second-lowest energy state [or more properly the pair will be forced into an antisymmetric combination of those states]. *If you\u2019re doing calculations of other systems in sufficient detail that something like PEP becomes relevant, then you\u2019 probably need to understand more than Pauli exclusion to do computations, something like QFT - but that\u2019s a separate matter, and beyond the scope of this answer.

            "answer_text": "Pauli Exclusion is caused by the same Gravitational Flux that causes Masses to Attract one another, but that is a misconception in itself. Relative Spin is required for any attraction to occur. Newton was just wrong.What happen is that when two particles with similar spin approach the flux is on conflict on the near limbs. The Flux therefore loops around both particles to avoid that conflict. The Flux Field works to create even flux gradients and shorten field lines and that causes the attraction. You can think of it as an Energy thing. At some point, as the particles approach and the flux strengths intensify, the Flux would not loop around instead it will work to redistribute the field lines between the particles and push them apart. That is the basis of Pauli Exclusion. Where particles have opposite charges, however, this effect is not strong enough to prevent superposition, but then Pauli does not relate to particles of opposite charge. ",
