            "answer_text": "My stepfather\u2019s family was in the upper-class. They could own property because they had enough money to buy property. When my stepfather married my mother they had a lot of money by some standards but it was still advisable to use a mortgage to pay for the house they were buying. They considered themselves middle class. Some years later my stepfather got a promotion or two and my mother (because she is extremely smart) acquired a nursing degree in no time and found a job as a well-paid nurse. Now, with their combined incomes they might be considered upper-class (although I am still very poor). They were now able to buy a house with 5 acres in Guilford, CT (5 acres is a lot more land than a lot of people have). The only reason they are able to live in Guilford is because they are both great drivers and have several cars, so they are not worried about not being able to get anywhere. They seem to just take it for granted that they can be employed and earn a lot of money. They\u2019re sort of like aliens to me. Anyway, I feel very lucky to have a lease agreement on Orange St. I don\u2019t own any land, never have so far in my current life. I own things like a a few old laptops, my smartphone, beat-up guitar I don\u2019t play very well, a collection of books, artworks I made and a few of other artists\u2019 work I bought, assorted furniture, knick-knacks, and I have a fancy bicycle my Dad bought for me at my mother\u2019s old garage that I haven\u2019t ridden in years\u2026 Very little of it is likely to sell for more than a few hundred dollars even if I\u2019m lucky. Although I have so much artwork that if each one were worth an average of $100 it might be worth $150,000 or more collectively, but that has not been proven. It would actually be worth more based on some of the offers I have received over the years, but they are extremely sporadic and there seems to be no official price yet for individual works. So, I don\u2019t know what advise I can give. It\u2019s a bit like you have money or you don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never seen anyone truly successful in property that did not have the \u201cideal tenants\u201d in mind when (before!) purchasing property. AND, the \u201cideal tenants\u201d were never themselves, that is, no one acquiring property that becomes truly rich in property ever buys themselves the property. They\u2019re always angling to find a great place for someone else\u2026 You have to love buying property for people, other people, to truly amass a lot of it for yourself. Look at anyone rich in property\u2026. they couldn\u2019t possibly live in all their own dwellings. They rent/sell them. Preferably rent. ",
