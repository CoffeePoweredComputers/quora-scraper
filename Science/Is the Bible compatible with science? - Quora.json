            "answer_text": ">> Is the Bible compatible with science? Absolutely 100%. There is absolutely no reason to reject the Bible based on observable science. What is not compatable with the Bible is evolution and the big hang. But evolution/big bang is not compatable with science either since it in no way, shape or form resembles science. It is a religious belief based on nothing but fantasy, not evidence. It takes a lot of faith in the beliefs of other people to accept evolution. If a person is honest, they'll admit that if they were told to prove evolution without referencing the teachings of others and could only be based on their own observations, there wouldn't be one person professing evolution to be true. Yet the unbeliever always demands that the Christian set the Bible down. You can\u2019t agree to a fist fight and then tie your opponent\u2019s hands behind their back, beat the ever-loving pulp out of them and then high-five yourself for winning the fight. You're only a big man when you cheat. If people want to believe that matter created itself by natural means even though science says it is impossible, whatever. But don't lie and cheat by calling it science. If people want to believe that life started by itself by natural means from nonliving, inorganic matter even though science says it is impossible, whatever. But don't lie and cheat by calling it science. If people want to believe that an oak tree can produce panda bears and frogs can turn into a prince even though observable science says it is impossible, whatever. But don't lie and cheat by calling it science. Call it a fairytale because fairytales are the only place one species changes to something conpletely different. The Bible is completely compatable with real science\u2026science that is observable, testable and repeatable with consistent results every time. Evolutionism/big bang cosmology meets none of those requirements and is based solely on assumptions and biased beliefs\u2026and that is not science no matter how badly someone wants it to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Is the bible and science at loggerheads,  Most scientists once thought the world land mass was as it is today, they also said it was impossible to flood the entire earths surface, before they discovered the land mass was all one, and to flood it, all it had to do was sink,, to form the plagues of sedimentary rocks with their sea fossils,most of them all most two miles high, and that the water found in our oceans of 12,100 feet deep was more than enough to cover form and cover these 11,300 feet plagues, that still make up one third of the worlds surface even after uplift, when the land mas divided, The bible also states God created all in six days, or periods of darkness and then light, which were not twenty four hours long, the earth and plants being created in the first three periods of darkness and light, God called days, God creating the sun early in the darkness of day four, to protect the plants that were created in the period of light in day three, none of this disagrees with science, the earth can be any age, as for plants we cannot give them an age from the reading of the bible, but we can put an age on all living creatures, as when God created the sun and moon He explained, they were for times years and seasons, God had set a clock in place so all living creatures including man could given an age, so they can only have existed for about 6000 years, DNA evidence has suggested that 90% of animals and Humans have originated from pairs of individual types after a catastrophic event in the past, the bible calls the flood, is the bible compatibly with science, well I would say yes, from what we have now discovered and as science progresses will become more compatible, remember on these points science and the bible did not always agree in the past, science disagreed in the past, but have since changed their thinking, and that is what science is meant to do as new data becomes available.
