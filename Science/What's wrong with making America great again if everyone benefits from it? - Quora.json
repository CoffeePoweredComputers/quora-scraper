            "answer_text": "Before we can answer that, we have to define what a great America is. Most people that I\u2019ve seen describe it are looking back at the 1950s, specifically the fact that we were an economic power house. Some like the fact that we were a mostly unchallenged superpower, but I won\u2019t go into that. Well, others have shown that the 1950s weren\u2019t as perfect on the social level. I\u2019m not even going to touch on that, I\u2019d rather focus on the economic side. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with the basic events of World War II. Well, every country involved was running their industry at its maximum capacity, since that\u2019s what you do in a war. Doing any less means it\u2019s more likely you might lose. At any rate, the war didn\u2019t last forever, it eventually came to an end. And most countries turned their industry to recovering from the war. First they had to rebuild the industry, since that was one of the targets of the war. Then they had to rebuild their infrastructure and society in general. There was one notable exception to this. You see, the US as a nation and as an economy was unique in that it never really took much damage during the war, so we weren\u2019t in need of rebuilding. So while everyone else is dealing with rebuilding the necessities of life, the US was in a position to turn this massive industry towards making the US a consumer paradise. And when we did, we started selling it to anyone that would buy it. Because of this, the US dollar became the closest thing to an international currency in existence. By the time everyone else finished repairing the damage from the war, we had a massive head start on flooding world markets with our products and establishing ourselves as an economic powerhouse. Over time, the advantage of our head start started to fade. Our economy just didn\u2019t shine quite like it did when we had no real competition, and it eventually \u201csunk\u201d to where it is now. Which isn\u2019t as bad as some people think, by the way. Yes, we have a trade deficit on hard goods. The trade deficit disappears as soon as you consider soft goods and services. Yes, even with China. You see, one of the things that happened when we started getting competition for our hard goods is our economy shifted towards soft goods and services. We\u2019re no longer a primarily industrial economy, but rather an information and services economy. So, with all that in mind, what would it take to return us to the economy we had in the 1950s? Step one, we need another world war, one that devastates every major industrial base but ours. Second, we need to involve ourselves in said war, in such a way that it energizes our industrial base. Third, we need to shift away from an economy based on information and services and go back to an industrial based economy. Yeah, I\u2019m gonna say no to every step of that, with the possible exception of involvement in WWIII, assuming it started for some other reason. It would be offensively self centered to hope for a war just so that we gain economic benefit. And really, shifting back to an industrial based economy might be better for those that think they want to work in a factory, but would really just be waiting outside hoping that enough of the robots break down so that the company would need to hire more humans. If you want to repair the US economy so that the middle class isn\u2019t feeling left out, you need to deal with the disparity in income distribution. I\u2019m not saying we need to take away all the rich people\u2019s money and split it up evenly between everyone, but really, the disparity has been growing since the late 70s or early 80s, which is also when the middle class started feeling like there was something wrong. Henry Ford, when he started building cars, paid the workers on the assembly lines above average wages. Why? Because he knew that the better off the middle class was, the more money they\u2019d have to spend on the products the wealthy are trying to sell them. That\u2019s something that the US forgot somewhere along the way, and the middle class has been getting the shaft ever since. ",

            "answer_text": "It was a brilliant campaign slogan and one that resonated with ALL of us. Its power, however, comes not from truth but from nostalgia, the longing for a bygone past. The problem with nostalgia, and the slogan, is that it ignores many things about the past that were not \u201cgrreat.\u201d The 1950s, which is usually the period people talk about as \u201cgreat,\u201d had many many problems. My mother was a brilliant woman. She wanted to be an architect. Women did not become architects in the 1950s. Women could work only as nurses, secretaries or, like my mother, as teachers. Until 1965, blacks could not vote in most of the South and had huge barriers on the job. ( saw a minstrel show at my junior high in 1960, white teachers in blackface strumming banjos.) Pollution was horrible \u2014 I remember literally choking on air in LA. Taxes, by the way, were much higher than they are now, up to 70 percent for the highest rate. True, crime was lower, jobs were plenty, things were simpler \u2014 on the surface. So there is an appeal to making America \u201cgreat again\u201d but in many ways America has become greater since the Fifites. More opportunity for women and people of color. Cleaner air and water. Lower taxes. Lowering crime (since 1990). Those who oppose the president also support greatness and love America but we cannot for the life of us see how a sniping and mean-spirited president, rolling back environmental laws, offending our allies, comforting dictators, and insulting everyone who disagrees with him is making America great in any way.
