            "answer_text": " Bath every single day. Not necessarily use soap or shampoo everytime as it will dry out skin simply bathing with cold water is enough. Have coffee in mornings and afternoon but never in or after evening it will hamper your sleep. Caffiene is beneficial only in day time and never in dark. If possible have lemon tea it will not make you exhausted as coffee would once caffeine gets expelled from our system like after 4\u20135 hours after having coffee, duration varies from person to person. Stay away from mobile phone 2 hours before and while u sleep not just blue light will hamper ur sleep also radiations would do the same even worst i think. Dont speak when its not required it drains lot of energy listen more. I mean stop bag biting drains time and energy. Lower your sugar intake and try to consume lemon juice as much as possible. Lemon tea works wonder for me I feel more energised after having a lemon tea as compared to coffee. Avoid heavy meals stop eating when 70 percent of capacity is reached. Eating more than that requires some physical activity to support your tummy to get the food digested like taking a walk after meal, you may not be able to do this everytime so better eat less amount of food. Drink more water. Try to avoid having cold water it disturbs metabolism normal one is best. Also don't try to take a bottle and empty it in one go sip by sip give a continuous flow of water to your body. Wash your face frequently. Not necessarily with face wash or any soap simply splashing cold water on ur face is enough. If u cant control yawning just stop breathing for 50 seconds or so repeat it several times yawning will go away. Keep in mind yawning is a natural process to relax your lungs and fill it with ample amount of oxygen do this only when its required for example in a meeting,classroom etc. Never overdo any physical exercise if you are a office working guy stay in your limits dont try to push it your goal is to stay fit through exercise not to overburden your body. \u201cPush your limits in only those areas where it will be beneficial for you\u201d. One must feel fresh after exercise not dizzy and completely exhausted like a bodybuilder. Whenever you are in a conversation try to make eye contact i dont know why but it keeps you alert as compared to when you don't actively participate in conversations. Have some haldi doodh before you sleep it gives a headstart to your day also gives a good sleep. When sitting for long hours if possible then stretch your body from time to time. If not possible due to office environment go to washroom and stretch a bit, get that blood flowing. Meditation can also contribute to stay alert throughout the day as it reduces irrelevant waste of energy by keeping the mind cool. For meditation you don't need any app or music just sit at a place, close your eyes and just concentrate on breaths that's all. In reality its not meditation or anything alike but it does benefits so nothing to lose if you give it a shot.Now the thing is most of you reading this would already know these small steps the problem lies with implementation. Even if you know thousand tricks like this and don't follow them nothing will happen. Thank you",
