            "answer_text": "First off is the difference between fusion and fission Nuclear fusion is taking two atoms and combining them in to one atom, while nuclear fission takes one atom and splits it into two atoms.\u2026 Both reactions involve the nucleus of an atom, and in both reactions, lots of energy are released. Other than that, the two reactions are pretty much opposite. Fission is what is currently being used to produce clean energy, more so in the EU than in the US. Currently it uses continuous fission of Uranium (U-235). One must contend with decay of materials, fuel rods must be kept cool using hard water. Once Fuel Rods are spent, they must be disposed of carefully. There is a facility in Texas which stores the Nuclear waste deep underground. The Fukushima Daiichi Reactor in Japan is an example of just how dangerous Fission Reactors can be, in this instance it was caused by an earthquake. Fusion puts out much more electricity, instead of the possibility of making a Fusion reactor just a year ago many were thinking it might take another 30 years before a Fusion Reactor would be ready for the Electrical Grid. But a project collaboration between MIT and the Commonwealth Fusion Systems (a private company), have come up with new materials to make magnets much more powerful, they believe they can have a Fusion Reactor on line within 15 years. Until now every fusion experiment has operated on an energy deficit, making it useless as a form of electricity generation. Fusion works on the basic concept of forging lighter elements together to form heavier ones. When hydrogen atoms are squeezed hard enough, they fuse together to make helium, liberating vast amounts of energy in the process. However, this process produces net energy only at extreme temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius \u2013 hotter than the center of the sun and far too hot for any solid material to withstand. To get around this, scientists use powerful magnetic fields to hold in place the hot plasma \u2013 a gaseous soup of subatomic particles \u2013 to stop it from coming into contact with any part of the doughnut-shaped chamber. However a newly available superconducting material \u2013 a steel tape coated with a compound called yttrium-barium-copper oxide, or YBCO \u2013 has allowed scientists to produce smaller, more powerful magnets. And this potentially reduces the amount of energy that needs to be put in to get the fusion reaction off the ground. \u201cThe higher the magnetic field, the more compactly you can squeeze that fuel.\u201d Prof Howard Wilson, a plasma physicist at York University who works on different fusion projects, said: \u201cThe exciting part of this is the high-field magnets.\u201d The planned fusion experiment, called Sparc, is set to be far smaller \u2013 about 1/65th of the volume \u2013 than that of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, an international collaboration currently being constructed in France. The experimental reactor is designed to produce about 100MW of heat. While it will not turn that heat into electricity, it will produce, in pulses of about 10 seconds, as much power as is used by a small city. The scientists anticipate the output would be more than twice the power used to heat the plasma, achieving the ultimate technical milestone: positive net energy from fusion.

            "answer_text": "The preference for specific nuclear power generating technology deserves to be heavily influenced by which nuclear technology is safest. The world will not tolerate another major nuclear accident Fusion is widely extolled by advocates as being safe (but is that collective opinion justified)?  Some Reasons offered why Fusion should be Safe - Only tiny amounts of fusion fuel are inside a fusion reactor at any one time. Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantities or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel (Basic premise \u2013 If the fuel is not inside the reactor, it can\u2019t even theoretically explode inside the reactor or become a factor in an accident). No greenhouse gasses produced - No reactor meltdowns or decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen) No mining of fuel (fuel is extracted from water) Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus hundreds for fossil fuels) 1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power. Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume. Radioactive waste, mostly neutron activated fission chamber structural material remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands of years for Minor Actinides in spent fuel produced by fission reactors.. DT fusion reactors would however burn and require storage of significant quantities of Tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not seriously hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor. Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity) No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity) The nuclear future rightfully belongs to that technology that offers the world the most hope (and then goes forward rapidly to fulfill all of its promises).
