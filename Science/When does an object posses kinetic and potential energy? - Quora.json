            "answer_text": "Thank you for reading this answer : ) Kinetic Energy : \u201cWhen a force acts on a body by virtue of its motion (movement), then it possesses Kinetic energy.\u201d This means that Any object or body get displaced and are in the movement or doing any kind of work they contain Kinetic energy. NOTE - There is no kinetic energy without the velocity of the object. Example 1 : Suppose you took a pebble from the ground and threw it somewhere. when u r throwing the pebble, it has the force applied by you, it moves out to certain distance, then we say that the pebble has kinetic energy. Example 2 : Observe, You took a bow and an arrow. When you stretch the strings, the force from you and directed by the bow are converted in a force (kinetic) which makes the bow move in the certain direction, when you pull the string. Potential Energy : \u201cWhen a force acts on a body by virtue of its shape and position, then it possesses the Potential energy.\u201d The meaning of this sentence is When a force acts upon a body and changes its shape or changes its position from its original position, then it is said to have Potential energy. NOTE - There is no Potential energy without the height of the object or in other words without any gravitational force. Example 1 : In Example 1 of Kinetic energy, before you took the pebble, it was lying upon the ground. So there is maximum gravitational force i.e., it has Potential energy stored in it due to change in its position. When you throw it the, conversion of stored Potential energy into Kinetic energy takes place. Example 2 : In Example 2 from above, before throwing the arrow, when the string is being stretched, Potential energy is stored in the strings due to change in its shape. When your fingers leaves the strings, the potential energy stored in it changes into the Kinetic energy to the bow which makes it travel certain distance. I am in class 9 now, so may be I could not fulfill the curiosity, But I have tried to answer the question to the satisfaction. MAY IT HELP!!! THANK YOU : ))) ",

            "answer_text": "For Kinetic energy please see this link Explain kinetic energy and it derivation? | Socratic Potential energy is of several kinds. To name some Gravitational Potential energy. PE due to position of an object with respect to earth, normally taken as hearth\u2019s surface as reference. Recall the well known equationPE = m*g*hBuoyancy potential energy which is directly proportional to the depth of the object in a fluid. As the object rises its depth decreases. Hence Buoyancy potential energy decreases.Elastic potential energy possessed by a spring which follows Hooks Law. This is given by the following equation:PE = (1/2)*kx^2k is spring constant and x is deformation of the spring.Electric potential energy between two charges due to their relative position. It is given by the following equationU(r) = k (Q*q)/rMagnetic Potential Energy possessed by a magnetic dipole when placed in a magnetic field. It depends on the orientation of magnetic dipole and is given as dot product of the dipole moment and magnetic field vectors.U(Theta) = mu . BI understand you meant Gravitational potential energy while posing the question.Good Luck",
