            "answer_text": "Russian hackers:A group of Russian hackers, most notably the Turla APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is hijacking commercial satellites to hide command-and-control operations, a security firm said today.Turla APT group, which was named after its notorious software Epic Turla, is abusing satellite-based Internet connections in order to:Siphon sensitive data from government, military, diplomatic, research and educational organisations in the United States and Europe.Hide their command-and-control servers from law enforcement agencies.Despite some of its operations were uncovered last year, Turla APT group has been active for close to a decade, while remaining invisible by cleverly hiding from law enforcement agencies and security firms.Now, security researchers from Moscow-based cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab claim to have identified the way Turla APT group succeeded in hiding itself.The researchers said the group disguised itself by using commercial satellite Internet connections to hide their command-and-control servers.Turla is a sophisticated Russian cyber-espionage group, believed to be sponsored by the Russian government, that has targeted a number of government, military, embassy, research, and pharmaceutical organisations in more than 45 countries, including China, Vietnam, and the United States.Hijacking Satellite to Hide Command-and-Control ServersThe group is known for exploiting highly critical vulnerabilities in both Windows as well as Linux operating systems, but\u2026\u2026the satellite-based communication technique used by the group to help hide the location of their servers appears to be more sophisticated than previous ones, according to Kaspersky researchers. The Turla hackers exploit the fact that older satellites that orbit around the Earth:Don't come with support for encrypted connectionsRelies on unsuspecting users of the satellite Internet service providers across the worldThe group take advantage of this particular loophole in the design of these satellites, which can be easily exploited to freely intercept traffic between the satellite and a specific user.Here's How the Scheme WorksThe technique is quite simple because you have a lot of vulnerable satellites orbiting around the Earth and sending unencrypted traffic to a desired geographical location. The Turla APT group only needs:A rented house in an area where the vulnerable satellites provide coverageA satellite dish to intercept the trafficA landline Internet connectionTurla hackers sniff through the traffic that comes down from the satellite and select an IP address of a random user online at that moment.Once selected, the hackers then try to infect the target computer with malware in order to configure the domain names for hacker's command-and-control (C&C) servers to point to that IP address.Once Turla hackers gain the control of Satellite's user system, the hackers instruct the infected botnet computers to send the stolen data to the command-and-control (C&C) server (compromised satellite user).The sneaky part here is: The Turla hackers are effectively hiding their location from investigators as they can be anywhere in the range of the satellite beam, i.e. thousands of miles.

The carriers may be from the same or different uplinks. The audible effect of double illumination can range from almost no audible change to complete impairment depending on carrier power and other factors.[7] Double illumination is the main reason for the ID legal uplinks have. Someone accidentally turns on an uplink into the wrong satellite space, often when tuning or moving a dish, wiping out other services. But if has been a significant impact accidentally, it could certainly be used on purpose. Tamil Rebels Hijack US Satellite Signal 2007In 2007, this discussion moved from theoretical to reality. Rebel independence fighters in Sri Lanka have been pirating the services of a US satellite to send radio and television broadcasts to other countries. In 1997, the US government identified this particular group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, as a terrorist organization. The satellite belongs to Intelstat, a US company. Intelstat officials have been meeting with technical experts and Sri Lanka's Ambassador to the US to discuss measures the company it is taking to prevent the satellite's unauthorized use. The rebels maintain they are not accessing the satellite illegally.[8,9,10] The worst case, attacking the satellite itselfIn, January 2007, the New York Times carried this story: China successfully carried out its first test of an antisatellite weapon last week, signaling its resolve to play a major role in military space activities and bringing expressions of concern from Washington and other capitals, the Bush administration said yesterday. Only two nations - the Soviet Union and the United States - have previously destroyed spacecraft in antisatellite tests, most recently the United States in the mid-1980s. Arms control experts called the test, in which the weapon destroyed an aging Chinese weather satellite, a troubling development that could foreshadow an antisatellite arms race.[11] However, to attack a satellite probably does not require nation state space capability. Due to cost saving measures, the command & control channel to the satellite is unencrypted. The security is little more than a password. To hack such a system would require sophisticated & proprietary equipment, although with today's Digital Signal Processing systems it is becoming trivial. But, by the time it was noticed that a bird was put into a spin of death, the fuel is shot, there is very little fuel (and fuel is the primary limitation on the life span of a satellite), and there's a $75 million dollar paperweight spinning in space.[12] Source: http://www.sans.edu/research/security-laboratory/article/satellite-dos ",

            "answer_text": "o deal with growing communications  problems such as an increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum and a  growing risk of interception, the Defense Information Systems Agency  will begin considering the use of laser-based satellite communications  technology. Laser Light Communications announced a  Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the agency on June  10 in regards to the company\u2019s Global Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial All  Optical Network Technology.The research effort will focus  primarily on the potential use of an all-optical, laser-based, medium  Earth orbit (MEO) communication satellite solution that could be  seamlessly integrated into the global terrestrial communications  network, according to the release. Laser communications would bypass the  use of the traditional radio frequency spectrum by using pulses of  light to communicate large amounts of information \u2013 the effect would be  the same as using a fiber optic cable, but without an actual cable. NASA was the first to demonstrate the feasibility of  laser communication in 2013. The Lunar Laser Communications  Demonstration was able to transmit data from the moon to the Earth at a  rate of 622 megabits/sec, which was six times faster than previous  state-of-the-art radio systems.An all-optical satellite communications  system is potentially capable of significantly increasing data transfer  rates. Also, because the system doesn\u2019t use the radio frequency  spectrum, it won\u2019t have to deal with spectrum allocation or mutual  interference due to satellite spacing. The Defense Department currently  is faced with increasing demand on the electromagnetic spectrum for  military use while freeing up bandwidth for commercial use. ",
