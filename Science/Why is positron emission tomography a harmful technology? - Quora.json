            "answer_text": "Any diagnostic imaging examination that uses ionizing radiation to make images does have potential risks. Most diagnostic imaging examinations use as low a radiation dose as possible (the \u201cas low as reasonably achievable\u201d or ALARA policy). However, for any diagnostic examination, there is a tradeoff - risk vs benefit. If going to surgery vs observation is dependent on an x-ray examination of some kind (CT, x-rays, fluoroscopy, nuclear medicine) then the physicians caring for you will likely determine that the risk of the radiation (slightly increased risk of developing a malignancy) is better than the risk of either operating not knowing the cause of your symptoms or just observing you during which time you could get much sicker (e.g., a ruptured appendix or aneurysm) and surgery might not be possible any longer. Most PET scans are done using glucose (usually fluorodeoxyglucose where 18Fluorine - the positron emitter - replaces one of the oxygen atoms). This is because glucose is essential for metabolism in your cells so is readily taken up by them. A major use of PET scans is in searching for malignancies as they tend to have a high metabolic rate so they take up glucose more readily than normal cells. It is important that PET scans are functional images - they show whether or not tissues are metabolizing glucose. Scanning technologies such as CT and ultrasound, are predominantly anatomic (structural) imaging. In some cases, a PET scan is combined with a CT or MRI study. These combined machines keep the patient on the same scanning table so the CT or MRI scans, which show much more anatomic detail than the PET scan, can be aligned with the PET images so the radiologist and referring physician can see very precisely where the increased activity of the PET scan is located. These combined scans have the advantage of combining the very high sensitivity to metabolic function that the PET scan has with the very detailed anatomic images of the CT or MRI scan. An example of this is surgical treatment for epilepsy. This requires that the \u201cfocus\u201d in the brain that causes seizures be precisely located so that it can be removed. This is important so the neurosurgeon removes the minimum amount of brain tissue to reduce the risk of neurologic deficits. A PET CT or MRI of the brain can provide for both identifying that there is a single focus that causes seizures and and locating it precisely. PET CT and PET MRI scans are also often used to localize malignancies for subsequent biopsy (to confirm the nature of the malignancy and sometimes to determine what therapy would be most useful) or surgery and sometimes to determine if surgery is even possible. Radiation dose from the PET scan itself is quite low because the isotope has a very short half life. It usually has to be made on premises because the time to transport it from a remote lab would result in too much degradation of the isotope. Adding a CT scan results in a higher dose but adding an MRI adds no ionizing radiation (so no radiation dose added during a PET MRI scan). The most important aspect of any medical examination or test is whether any associated risks are less than the potential problems of not having the examination or test. Physicians make these decisions with patients every day. Our duty stems from the Hippocratic Oath which includes the famous quote, \u201cI will follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients and abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous\u201d. I would say that done for a medical need, a PET scan is not harmful because in the judgement of the physician and as explained and consented to by the patient, the harm from not doing the PET scan is worse than any increased risk of radiation-induced malignancy.
