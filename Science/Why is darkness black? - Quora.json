            "answer_text": "Okay.Your question made me delve into curiosity. As a science enthusiastic,I do get such questions for myself but rarely find answers.I still explore for more innovative,pleasing and convincing answers but rather in a different approach.Even I have the same question,but let's try to solve this question scientifically. First of all let us analyse what is a color? The most common answer on internet to define a color is- it is the property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way it reflects. But according to me color is just a frequency of EM wave. This frequency is a part of Electromagnetic wave which belongs to Visible spectrum of range 400nm to 700nm. Now we named different frequencies of this visible spectrum as present day colors for better understanding. It is difficult to remember frequencies of each color,so civil beings named these frequencies to distinguish among them and for easy rememberance. Everything that matters now is how we name these colors brings to your question. For example orange is the colour whose name is derived from the Sanskrit word \u2018naranga\u2019 mean \u2018orange fruit'. Usually orange is a tertiary color formed by mixing red and magenta which are primary and secondary colors respectively. Similarly black derived its name from words invariably meaning the colour black,the \u2018dark',\u2019ink',\u2019to burn'.Black figuratively represents emptiness or nothingness. Coming to the question instead of thinking why is darkness black?, black derived its word from darkness. So darkness is always black in color. We have special importance to few colors like black,white,red,green,blue,etc. Now coming to the point,darkness looks black in color because it's frequency is capable of absorbing all colors of light and hence black. Unlike white it doesn't reflect other colors.Darkness is absence of any color. Thanks to God. that is why we are able to see universe at least,which is black in color. You know? we cannot see other parts of EM waves such as X-rays,UV,Gamma,Micro,radio waves,etc. For eg: black hole is called with prefix black because it doesn't reflect light.but how do we conclude it's black in color when it doesn't reflect light?,what if the world is made with such frequencies? Paradox right? Of course we cannot see air.You know why? You may get another question like does objects around us have frequency so that they have energy,and we see their color? For eg: As I told color is a frequency so that it mean black paint has frequency of black so we see it as black? Not necessarily. We see objects because when light ray hits an object and reflected rays of that object falls on retina of our eye. These rays are distinguished by our eye within visible spectrum and so we are able to see it. Blind can see black nothing but darkness. Black hole is black because not light is reflected and is dark. Air is not visible because the air particles are so small,minute that they are deflected from their path by the energy of light ray rather than reflecting the ray. So color is a frequency and depends on the nature of surface.The entire story runs behind the word called \u2018color' where beautiful physics is blended behind to convey the meaning. I'm sorry for such long story but I think it makes sense and understanble. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Darkness is a entity where there is no light. It's mostly a relative phenomena because even in pitch darkness there could be a very little amount of light rays. We see things in many colours as they reflect light waves after absorbing the white light (which consists of 7 colours of rays; VIBGYOR). Let's say that the object absorb all the light rays in the frequency of Violet, then the colour of the object will be a mixed one of IBGYOR. This concept is not well understood by the paint manufacturers, yet well understood by optic physicists. So when there is no light wave coming i. To a space, then it appears as black; which is the absence of light rays to the retina if the eye. Yet if you have seen in DSLR cameras, when you increase the ISO (light sensitivity) then it can visualize even the dark objects which was invisible before. Human retina also can increase the ISO but the ability is limited than the modern cameras can detect. Over and out ",
