            "answer_text": "Nope? It's mostly pure water, but it picks up a bunch of other stuff from the atmosphere.  First of all, rain drops basically always condense around something solid, which in the upper atmosphere is dust of some kind.  That means every raindrop has some solids floating in it (which is why rain drops on a clean car leave spots and streaks when they dry).  Some of those particles dissolve, and some don't, either way, the water can't really be called \"pure\".  And if the rain falls through other dust, smoke or smog, it will pick up more and more particles. Now, beyond that, there are a number of different gasses that can dissolve in water.  Carbon dioxide is the most common one.  It's concentration in the atmosphere is low, but it will dissolve, at least a little.  In places with bad pollution, there will often be sulfates and nitrates in the atmosphere, which the rain picks up as well (plus some other pollutants).  Those dissolve in rain and form acids, at very low concentrations, once again, but they can have a cumulative effects. Now, in a relatively low pollution area with few particles in the sky, rainwater will be mostly pure, and very safe, but anything exposed to uncontrolled nature is almost always going to have some impurities.

            "answer_text": "It depends upon what you\u2019re talking about. If you are specifically talking about acid rain, then no - in fact, rain is not technically made up of any water at all - it is made up of acids, primarily sulfuric and nitric acid, which developed due to the reaction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxides with water present in the air. These oxides were released by various human activities, particularly the waste and smoke from industries, and are highly corrosive to not only metals but also to marine and tropical environments. If you are talking about general rain, then the answer is a mixture of yes and no. It is important to note that rain is simply condensed water vapour in the atmosphere. Thus, if there are a minority of impurities or other gases present in the atmosphere, water will generally not condense with these particles, and come off as generally pure. However, if there is a large amount of gases and dust particles, the particles may contaminate the rain droplets as they are condensing, thus making the water impure. Furthermore, gases such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide may react mildly with the water, if present in small quantities, and thus alter the composition of rain. Conclusion: It ultimately depends upon where you live and the surroundings of the atmosphere, but generally it will be next to impossible to find 100% pure rainwater. ",
