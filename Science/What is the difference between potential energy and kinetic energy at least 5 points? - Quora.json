            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy depend on speed , while potential energy depends on the position of an object in a field.Kinetic energy involves physical relative motion. Potential energy comes from nature of field- electrical, magnetic, gravitational etc.Kinetic energy changes on impact or change in speed. Potential energy changes with position of the objectPotential energy depends on the strength of object creating the field.Potential energy also depends on its own strength.",
