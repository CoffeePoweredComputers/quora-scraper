            "answer_text": " Negative ion of Nitrogen-14. The number of Protons determines which element it is. Atoms with 7 protons are Nitrogen. (6 protons makes Carbon, 8 protons makes Oxygen.) The total number of protons and neutrons determine Isotope. Only certain isotopes are stable; other isotopes are radioactive. Nitrogen-14 is stable, and the most abundant isotope by a large margin (99.6%). The only other stable isotope of Nitrogen is N-15, which has 7 protons and 8 neutrons. The difference between the number of protons and number of electrons determines the electric charge. An atom with an equal number of protons and electrons is neutral, having no charge. Charged atoms are called ions. If an atom has more protons than electrons, it is positively charged; if there are more electrons than protons, it is negatively charged. ",

            "answer_text": "An element is defined by the number of protons. Except Hydrogen and Helium, every other element have the same amount of protons, neutrons and electrons. 7 protons means that the element is Nitrogen. If the number of neutrons is different from the number of protons, that\u2019s an isotope of that element. If the number of electrons is higher than the number of protons, that element is a negative ion, and if the number of electrons is lower that is a positive ion. The element with 7 protons, 7 neutrons and 10 electrons is a negative Nitrogen ion. ",
