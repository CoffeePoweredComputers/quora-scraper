            "answer_text": "Does the potential to be an intelligent life not qualify an organism as being equally valuable (philosophy of science, human rights, philosophy)? What do you imagine value is? First of all, our imputation of values to a non-human organism can only be vain, fanciful and outlandishly approximate (probably wholly false). The only values we have available to impute are our own. Human values. How humans see and value things. Until the day we can hold a conversation with a candidate organism on the topic of values, we\u2019d be massive egotists if we just went ahead and awarded our values to other organisms. IF WE COULD converse with another organism on this topic, and IF WE DID FIND the organism largely shares our views on values - if its concept of values is similar enough to ours as to be convertible, with minor adjustments - then and only then would it make sense for us to speak of the value of its life. The value the organism itself has and puts on its own life. The whole thing\u2019s pretty speculative at this point. As of now, the only concept of values we have is purely made-up good ol\u2019 human value. How we find, appreciate and assign worth. Valuation is at its root subjective and personal, but people can and do share values and agree in them. \u201cWhat two can see has gone beyond subjectivity.\u201d Still, one-way assignment is not sharing. Unless and until another organism can share what it values and hear us out while we share ours, so that together we can agree in shared values, it would be no noble or exalted undertaking to assign values to it. Values that have really nothing to do with its life or frame. What twisted imperialism of values is this? The only side that could possibly gain by it (values-wise) is us, and probably the only thing we\u2019d gain in is hubris. A useless enterprise. A valueless enterprise. We deprive an organism of nothing that is theirs, nothing of nature, property or character, by not imposing our values upon it. In fact by not so imposing, we will be better able to observe the organism\u2019s real behaviors and nature. Now many of us can and do value life forms other than human. We value them for what they mean to us. Some of us assign a baseline positive value to life itself. It tends to get vague from there, but individual organisms or species do stand out - different ones to different humans. We may value them for their tenacity and highly-developed behaviors, instincts and processes. We may value them for what we can learn from them in study, or purely for the sheer pleasure of enjoyment they provide, just being alive each in their own curious way. We may value the beauty of their forms, their interactions, their fierceness or their cleverness. We may value their compassion especially, when it is displayed. But equal value to a human? Sorry, excuse me? I can\u2019t speak to your experience of human society, but I can sure speak confidently to mine. Humans give far superior value as conversational partners, co-conspirators and confidants, creative collaborators or sounding boards, life companions, and above all as mates (animals, too, display this kind of strong in-species preference). How shall any other organism be valued equal to a human, when humans are our kind and so peculiarly-suited to our own wants, needs, likes and loves? Animals can be boon companions in some ways! Yet many of us would far rather contemplate them in nature than domesticate them. Whereas when a human comes to live with us and share our life, we can feel reasonably assured that this arrangement is wholly natural to the human, that their consent to it is informed and full. There\u2019s a lot of value to that. Considering all the dimensions our shared life will have, it\u2019s value no other form of organism can possibly equal. We value a thing (or a being) primarily in proportion to what its existence means to us. Not merely by some abstract \u201cvalue level.\u201d What it specifically gives. We value use. This is not principally selfish, either. Between humans in my experience, the strong tendency exists for value to reach a tipping point where the other\u2019s happiness means as much or more to you than your own. The use you can be to them gives you meaning and purpose, whereas the use they can be to you gives mostly delight and joy. Mostly. In closing, I believe other organisms have value. In some sense, incalculable value. But at any rate, they have value to me. This is human valuation, and says nothing about them. Lacking any real sense of how other organisms conceive or process value (if they even do - anything similar enough to our concept to warrant the same word), I\u2019m sorry: I don\u2019t consider me, big mister homo sapiens sapiens, to have standing to assign to any of them their value. \u201cEquality\u201d has value only as an observation, where we know what we measure and indeed: it is the same. Equality has no value as an arbitrary assignment imposed from above. Or for that matter from below, or sideways. If equality does not refer to something quantifiable, then it refers to nothing.

            "answer_text": "Most life is nowadays considered intelligent, for example, science now even uses the term intelligence even for microbes[1]. We also now know that trees are highly intelligent, and they can have children, actively take care of children, and even have preferences among siblings: Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group.[2] And this isn\u2019t only the case among multicellular organisms. One of the most intelligent organisms out there is a single cell organism called slime mould that was even used to draft out Tokyo\u2019s tube tunnel structure [3]. Considering human beings only viable intelligent creatures is obsolete. It\u2019s largely an anthropocentric artefact of religion when the human was more special due to having \u201csoul\u201d. Should all life then be treated equally valuable? This is a question of ethics and a subject to worldview, some people do think that, and it is called deep ecology. Again, should cannot easily be derived from facts, and it is particularly difficult to do it convincingly.
