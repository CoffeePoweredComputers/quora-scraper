            "answer_text": "There is an irony in your question. The problem is you want to learn black holes, but what you can really do is read about correct or falsified data on internet. If you want to read, there is lot of information on lot of site. But, when you want to learn and work on them, internet wouldn\u2019t work. This is because, internet only shows the results or outcomes of a certain experiment and flamboyant pictures. But, it never explains about the deep machinery, techniques, theorems, struggles, investments that were put in. Secondly, most of the data on internet is falsified, They write things in flashy, polishing showing them as correct. But, some of the ifnormation in many resources is wrong. You wouldn\u2019t know that it is wrong unless you have deep physics background. So, I would suggest you to enroll in astrophysics, quantum physics or some other related course. Search for universites, one or other will definitetly offer course covering indept physics of black holes. That\u2019s only the best way to learn. You can get funds, machinery, help from good physicits to experiment. No more you don\u2019t have to be on shore, you can participate on learn. In my view, that\u2019s the best way. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many books and video lectures on black holes. Read Stephen Hawkings books- these will provide you with the basic knowledge on black holes. Then find the chapter on black holes in the book 'Theoretical Astrophysics' by T Padmanabham. I would also recommend you to follow some astrophysical websites/blogs to gain conatant knowledge. Hope this helps. Also feel free to ask any questions you have. I would always love to help you. ",
