            "answer_text": "The first to do it was the German Army during WWII. Their V2 rocket was the first object to be launched into space (defined as the Karman line - 100km of altitude)\u2026that happened in 1944. Figuring out how to do it is a different matter though - that goes back MUCH further. Rockets have been around since the Chinese started playing around with them in the 13th century. Doubtless they knew that they could make bigger ones that would go higher - so perhaps they thought up the idea of sending one up into space\u2026although it\u2019s unclear whether they understood the concept of \u201cspace\u201d. In the western world, it had long been known that the air pressure decreases as you go up a mountain - and it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to envisage an altitude where there would be no air left. Sir Isaac Newton had written about how an object could orbit the Earth in the 3rd volume of his Principia Mathematica (Printed in 1687)\u2026  Newton was thinking of a cannon rather than a rocket - but you certainly could build a rocket that would do that. So precisely who had the idea first is very hard to say. But the German V2 rocket was the first to actually achieve it. (Fun fact: My mother was nearly killed by a V2 - so had it been just the tiniest bit more effective, I wouldn\u2019t be here to tell you about it!) ",

Attempts were made in ancient China to \u2018reach the heavens\u2019 using rockets. However it was Konstantin Tsiolkovsky that is credited with first devising the rocket equation that would lead humans to enter space. The first man made object in space was launched by the \u2018Third Reich\u2019 using a V2 missile. Details are in the below video for Mark Felton  ",
