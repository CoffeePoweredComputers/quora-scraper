            "answer_text": "I am going to disagree with William Kaukler's answer. Ionic bonds are no stronger than covalent bonds. However, they are a more generalized electrostatic attraction and so ionic compounds can hold together with pretty effective bonding even in the melt. Some examples of bond strengths are given in Daniel James Berger's answer to Which is the strongest chemical bond and why? What this means is that the melting points of ionic compounds will invariably be lower than the melting points of network covalent substances, like diamond or silicon carbide or graphite, where bonds have to be completely broken before the substance can melt. Note: see the comment by Luan Weber which refers to a report of a computational study by J. Glosli and F. Ree in Physical Review Letters. The news item is P.Ball, Liquid diamond and carbon spaghetti, Nature 1999 (news section). \u201cCompletely broken\u201d should not be taken to mean \u201catomized\u201d or even \u201cdissociated into [math]C_2[/math],\u201d which is a high-energy gaseous form of carbon. Instead, in order to melt, enough covalent bonds must break to allow the remaining multi-carbon molecules to slide past each other. One of the liquid forms predicted is a sort of \u201cmolten-glass\u201d form of diamond, while the other consists of chains of carbon atoms, essentially polyynes. The 1999 computational results are at least partly supported by a 2005 experimental study by Johnson et al, cited at the Chemistry Stack Exchange, What is known about liquid carbon? More details can be found in a research report from the Advanced Light Source, here: https://als.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/actrep2005.pdf In fact, ionic compounds are characterized by moderate melting points and high boiling points \u2014 because to boil an ionic compound, you do need to break the ionic bonds. Once again, you mustn\u2019t think of this as atomization. For example, gaseous sodium chloride consists of \u201cmolecules\u201d with formulas [math]NaCl[/math] or [math]Na_2Cl_2[/math]. See What is Sodium Chloride like in gas state? (Chemistry Stack Exchange, which cites the original work). The reason you see low melting points for most covalent compounds is not because covalent bonds are weaker than ionic bonds. It\u2019s because most covalent compounds are composed of discrete molecules (held together by covalent bonds) \u2014 and the attractive forces between molecules are typically less than 5% of the strength of a covalent or ionic bond.

            "answer_text": "Ionic compound have high melting as well as high boiling point temperature because, The bond is formed between a metal and a non metal i.e., two oppositely charge elements( cations and anions) Thus, this would increase the force of attraction between them which holds them tightly, hence these forces cannot be destroyed easily. (Ex. NaCl, MgCl, etc..) Thus ionic compounds have high melting and boiling point temperature.(high temp. Is required to break their force of attraction) .. Hope u understood my point.. Thanku Thejus\u2026 :-) ",
