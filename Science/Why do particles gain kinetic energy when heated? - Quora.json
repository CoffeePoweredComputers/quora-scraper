            "answer_text": "It is easy to understand if the heating takes place by putting the sample in direct contact with something hotter. Molecules in a hot plate are vibrating with more energy than are molecules of a pot you place on top of it. Energy is transferred from plate to pot via collisions, and then the energy is transferred to anything inside the pot, such as water. I know this seems to beg the question, but so often, something is heated simply by putting it in contact with faster moving molecules. Another way to heat things is by friction. Rubbing an object causes the molecules to vibrate faster, which seems intuitive. Heating can also take place by absorption of radiation. In that case the absorbed energy causes molecules to vibrate faster, which is a form of thermal energy. It is detected as an increase in temperature. ",

            "answer_text": "To \u201cheat\u201d something, you must add \u201cthermal energy.\u201d The thing being \u201cheated\u201d therefore have more thermal energy that before. Since the thing being heated has the same number of particles as before, the average amount of thermal energy had by them increases. The average amount of thermal energy of an object determines its temperature. Thermal energy is kinetic energy in the form of random kinetic energy of molecules in the object possessing that energy.
