            "answer_text": "Biochemistry was a prerequisite for medical school when I was an undergraduate applying for admission. Having said that, there is no choice. That is the answer. Environmental science as a basis for medical practice isnt sufficiently useful to put it on your priority list. I did major in biology, receiving my bachelor of science from Colorado State University\u2019s College of Natural Sciences. While there, I was interested in a field of study known as wildlife biology and I did attend a 5 week-long session held at a campus in the remote back country, called Pingree Park. It was designed as an immersive process in learning natural resources management. Believe it or not, there was more future as a doctor than in a career as a wildlife biologist. I was interested in the evolutionary aspects of biology and wanted field exposure to animal behaviors and understanding ecology. Would today\u2019s emphasis become the protection of the environment, and it's applications to renewable energy? The stewardship of non-renewable resources like water, forests and recreational access are all tendencies for future trends in environmental study. But as far as medical school, not too much. While back country medicine, epidemiology and toxicology might all have some loose association with environmental topics, these are electives to be studied at the postgraduate level, after medical school.

            "answer_text": "It depends on your goals. I hail from a top ten medical school and I made the emphatic decision to study philosophy as an undergraduate. I have never regretted that. I just took my first set of boards (USMLE Step 1) and would it have been easier if I spent four years in a classroom learning and reproducing these pathways repeatedly? Slightly. But I took (and excelled in) biochem and all other required science classes in college and at that level, all of them involved taking in and regurgitating information I forgot a few weeks later. That is not the most interesting thing your brain can do. If you have passion for the environment, and you feel a degree in environmental studies will permit you to make an impact on the world around you, I would take you at my medical school over someone who knows the rate limiting step of glycolysis. If, on the other hand, you have a passion for the scientific method and see yourself as a physician researcher who does drug development, biochem may make sense. Just know that it\u2019s perfectly possible to major in a non-science field and thrive in medical school. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on you as a person with school. If you think being a biochem major will hurt you because it does run into some challenging classes. As far as what will help to get in all they care about is a nice portfolio meaning GPA and then Major GPA and MCAT score. All the classes you take in premed you take again in medical school so it'll definitely put you ahead in medical school if you do biochemistry in your premed years. ",

Environmental science allows you to focus on core areas but it is more of a generalist degree - not a bad thing but not great if you are focusing on a specific career. Indeed with environmental science if you want to take it into an actual career you will need to do a masters or specialise. ",
