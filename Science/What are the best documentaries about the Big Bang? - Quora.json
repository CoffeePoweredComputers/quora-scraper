I know it is still our best guess (look at what's happening now and rewind the tape to see how it started).  If you are still interested in what I'm saying, inflation is what did it in for me.  For it all to work, we needed a very short period of time where everything we've proven to this point is ignored for a key couple of milliseconds...very convienent Same type of argument for intelligent design. I did enjoy Hawkin's summation though...(Paraphrase...no time to look it up) There had to be a \"god\" to create the universe with all of its wonders...but he did such a good job with the laws of physics and nature, he's got nothing left to due...must be completely bored!
