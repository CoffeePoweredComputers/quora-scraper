            "answer_text": "You are confusing a couple of things, perhaps intentionally.  Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be dissipated. Turning electricity into light and heat dissipates it. This is entropy.  Turning energy stores laid down by biological and geological processes over millions of years -- burning coal for example -- is dissipating energy, increasing entropy significantly. Because it takes millions of years to create the energy stores, they can't be replenished in any meaningful timeframe. This process also has very significant negative impacts on the environment including pollution of sir and water and global warming. The combination makes this unsustainable, not any destruction of energy.  When we say that energy is sustainable, we aren't saying that the energy is sustained, but that we are not significantly increasing entropy while also not creating significant negative externalities. Renewable energy sources tap processes in the atmosphere and biosphere which turn sunlight into energy flows every day, or tap the sunlight directly. They have very few negative environmental impacts.  So your question is either indicative of a lack of understanding of what you were saying, or a troll with what you think is a gotcha. If the former, I trust you now understand the difference. If the latter, I trust you are suitably chastened. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about what happens when light travels from the Sun to the Earth. The energy is not being created or destroyed. It is just moving from the Sun to the Earth. And when it hits the ground, it's absorbed by atoms and molecules, which start moving around more rapidly---the light energy is converted into heat. Again, energy is not being created or destroyed; it is conserved as it changes from one form to another. What's the problem? ",
