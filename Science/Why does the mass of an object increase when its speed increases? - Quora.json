            "answer_text": "The actual mass DOES NOT increase with speed. What increases it the RELATIVISTIC mass which is not the actual mass. The relativistic mass is instead a convenient mathematical construct that allows you to apply classic newtonian physics formulas to objects that move at very fast speeds (close enough to the speed of light) from your frame of reference. It is true that as an object goes faster and faster and approach the speed of light you need more and more energy to achieve the same acceleration \u2026 AS IF it weighs more and more but the actual weight is not increasing here. Instead this change in the amount of energy that you need to increase its speed just another of those quirky effects of getting that object closer to the speed of light including time dilatation and space contraction. Note that the an observer in within the object that is accelerating to the speed of light won\u2019t ever feel a difference (that is the core of the relativity theory) and in fact from his point of view the amount of energy expend from within his frame of reference (eg. is a rocket properled vehicle) is exacty the same\u2026. but since his clock is ticking slower that your clock from your prespective the engergy he is expending per second is much lower and his acceleration is actually dicreasing\u2026 which is compatible with your impression that more energy is required to keep the same acceleration. It all works out in the end without any change in actual mass. As a separate note some of the other answer that state that the actual mass actually change the use the E=mc^2 as proving such statement \u2026 if E increase also des m\u2026. but this is formula give you an equivalence between E and m \u2026 ie if you were to transform all that E into m or viceversa (if you actually able to do that). It does not give you a correlation between the two nor an increase or decrease of those two like some answer implied If you have a USD bank account and you put 100$ in it you clould transform it in a GBP account with 80 Sterling Pounds. That is not the same as you have 2 bank accounts one in USD another in GBP and if you put 100$ in the USD all in a sudden 80 Pounds appear in the other one. Got it? ",

            "answer_text": "Does mass increase with speed? Einstein showed that the effective or relativistic mass increased with speed in direct proportion to its Lorentz factor and its energy. \u201cMass\u201d has recently been defined to include only the rest mass. This is the \u201cmass\u201d in the rest frame, which by definition has a velocity of zero. In this frame, the Lorentz factor is one, and the relativistic mass equals the rest mass. Special relativity deals only with predicting what would be measured between uniformly moving reference frames. What is measured is precisely what is predicted by the Lorentz transformation. The flaws with special relativity are in the ways scientists interpret those predicted measurements. You repeatedly read that the moving particles \u201cexperience\u201d length contraction and time dilation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Time and space are perfectly normal in all moving rest frames. Length contraction and time dilation are what we would measure. They change with our velocity relative to it. The moving particle \u201cexperiences\u201d none of it. Miss-interpretation of special relativity leads to false conclusions. For example: (1) Einstein\u2019s special relativity predicted that the mass that would be measured increases proportionally to the Lorentz factor. That measured mass is the \u201crelativistic mass.\u201d It is the mass that should be used in previous equations of physics that depend on the mass property. These include Newton\u2019s second principle, the equation for momentum, Newton\u2019s equation of gravitation, Einstein\u2019s famous mass-energy equivalence equation, and the general relativity field equations. If you don\u2019t know this, your predictions for high-speed physics will be wrong, not because special relativity is wrong, but because you don\u2019t know how to apply it. (2) Because physicists think that particles can \u201cexperience\u201d time dilation and that superluminal particles would \u201cexperience\u201d time going backward, they have concluded that they would, \u201cbreak causality.\u201d For the correct answer to this, please see the link, questions, and answers below that immediately follow: Is it true that the \"Correct Physical Interpretation of Einstein's Special Relativity Theory\" does not break causality over the speed of light? Is it true that the \"Correct Physical Interpretation of Einstein's Special Relativity Theory\" does not break causality over the speed of light? Yes! I published this idea first on Quora under, \"How does traveling faster than light 'break' causality?\" on January 19, 2018, Nine days later on January 19, 2018, the same interpretation was published on Relativity and Cosmology: Mamaev A.V., candidate of engineering sciences, associated professor, independent Scientific Researcher, Moscow, Russia, \"Correct Physical Interpretation of Einstein\u2019s Special Relativity Theory.\" Here is my original answer: How to kiss goodbye to the violation of causality argument, at speeds greater than the speed of light in a vacuum, in local reference frames, where special relativity applies, with a new interpretation of Einstein's special theory of relativity. Consider a meter stick traveling at near the speed of light, parallel to its velocity. Its Lorentz factor calculates exactly what an observer would measure, and that is exactly what the observer does measure. Now turn the meter stick perpendicular. Instantly the meter stick measures exactly one (1) meter. An astute observer, thoroughly educated in special relativity, should think: \"I know that the length of the meter stick is one (1) meter. But as it is turned parallel, it appears to shrink. This must be a distorted illusion caused by that strange invariance of the speed of light in a vacuum. How can I calculate its real length from my distorted parallel measurement? When the meter stick is not perpendicular, I must multiply the parallel component of its length measurement, by its Lorentz factor, to calculate its correct length; before calculating its real diagonal length from the Pythagorean theorem.\" Thus what is measured is distorted, and what is seen is an illusion. The same applies to time. The observed measurements must be multiplied by their Lorentz factor, to calculate their real values of length and time. Suppose that the meter stick is traveling at the speed of light. The measured parallel length is zero. He knows that it is not likely to really be zero as he measures, but he can't calculate what it is, because the Lorentz factor is \u00b1 infinity (\u00b1\u221e). It is at a singularity. The velocity of light photons really do have many wavelengths, but our astute observer can't measure any of their real wavelengths in the direction they travel directly. He can only calculate their wavelengths from their frequency and speed, in the time dimension. Now suppose something could travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. He's back in business. He knows from the Lorentz factor that the length is going to be negative-imaginary. He measures its absolute value and applies the negative-imaginary square root of minus one [\u2013\u221a(\u20131)], that he knows must be there, multiplies by the negative-imaginary Lorentz factor, and bingo the negative imaginaries all go away and the calculated length is a positive-real one (1) meter. Our astute observer should know, when observing events in moving reference frames, that simultaneous events will not appear simultaneous to him, until after he has applied their Lorentz transformation, in reverse, to his measurements, to remove his distorted illusion, and calculate the real-time and distance between the events. The Lorentz transformation is a two-way transformation. Ii can calculate the distorted measurements, and it can convert them back to their true values. To conclude that a bullet killed the victim before the trigger was pulled, without correcting for its Lorentz transformation in reverse, would be ridiculous for our astute observer. When the measurements are thus corrected for their distorted illusion, there is no violation of causality. Q.E.D. This is a new way of interpreting Einstein's special theory of relativity. The predictions of the Lorentz transformation are not real as promoted by Einstein. They are the result of measurements distorted, like a wavy mirror at an amusement park, by the invariance of the speed of light.  ",
