            "answer_text": "If the container has a piston or some other means of maintaining constant pressure, then it will expand as the pressure does work on the piston, until some of the added energy has ... To a good approximation most gases follow the Ideal Gas equation PV=nRT Increasing the temperature means the PV product must increase. ",

            "answer_text": "Provided that there is no constraint on the volume then a free gas will expand and become diluted ad infinitum. If heat is applied then the gas will expand faster. And if there is a volume constraint then the effect of heat is to increase pressure in accordance with Charles\u2019s Law. ",
