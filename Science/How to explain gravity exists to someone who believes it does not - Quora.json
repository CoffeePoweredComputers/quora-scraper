            "answer_text": "It depends on what their reasons are and what they believe the alternative to gravity is. Well, first of all, we must acknowledge the fact that everything on the surface of Earth has a weight. Weight, by definition, is a force, F = MA. Calculating weight(W = mg)is the act same as calculating force, the notation is just different and there\u2019s the use of a constant. This is in accordance to Newton\u2019s second law. So, where exactly is this force coming from ? What\u2019s causing it ? Something must be. What you can point them to is experiments that also demonstrate the fact that mass attracts mass, an example being the cavendish experiment. There\u2019s also experiments you can perform with really sensitive scales where you can test the same thing by hanging a mass from the scale then placing a mass under that object at a very close proximity. If the scale is sensitive enough you should see that a small amount of weight is added. This expected weight can be calculated with the law of gravity, F = G(M1(M2)) / r ^ 2. I\u2019m assuming the people you\u2019re referring to are flat Earthers. If they believe buoyancy is what causes things to fall then their are some very easy ways to demonstrate that this simply isn\u2019t the. One of these demonstrations is the fact that to calculate the buoyant force on Earth you need the gravitational constant. The equation is F = pgV, where p is the fluid density, g is acceleration do to gravity and V is the volume of displaced fluid. On top of that, the buoyant force is not a downward force, it\u2019s an upward force. The buoyant force is working against gravity, and for the buoyant force to exist their must be some force or acceleration mimicking a force in a particular direction. If you\u2019ve ever seen buoyancy experiments in free fall, you\u2019ll see that their is no buoyancy for exactly the same reason I just mentioned. There\u2019s also a simple experiment you can do in a car. If you have a balloon in a car and accelerate forward the balloon will move to the front of the car rather than backwards. All the air is being pushed forward, and do to buoyancy the air floats forward just as it would float up into the atmosphere. ",

            "answer_text": "All these complicated ''splain it to 'em' answers are by people who must have talked to a believer. Belief is a drug. Reasoning with a believer in the throes of some Belief as ridiculous as 'no gravity, man' is exactly like arguing life choices with a person high on heroin. You first must sober the person up and somehow get them to look at themselves from an altitude. A church member needs to stop going to church for a while to see clearly. Some Catholics go to mass everyday to stay high. The only other option is for the addicted person to have a rock bottom moment like the a spouse leaving (Christians have verses for that), or bankruptcy, after giving all their money to whoever God's anointed is now, or when the kool-aid is getting passed out. The cure for Belief is the same as any drug, but Belief is not only not illegal, it is mandatory in some places like Tehran and Saudi Arabia and West Virginia and Mississippi. Belief feels good. It makes the believer feel special. The Christian word is sanctified. It allows otherwise downtrodden proletarians to be alphas after they die. Belief poisons everything. A wife believes her abusive husband loves her. A guy believes he can drive on hard E for days. A nation believes that thermonuclear exchanges can be controlled. A president believes that he can never be wrong. A person believes that gravity doesn't exist and decides to jump. ",
