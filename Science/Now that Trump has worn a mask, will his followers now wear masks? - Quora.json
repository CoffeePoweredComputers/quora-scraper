Prepared to develop the virus in the event the chief also caught the illness, and ready to throw down their lives for him, they don\u2019t know what do do. Maybe Mike Pence knows. He\u2019s in charge of the Coronavirus. Trump is already moving on to the next crisis which is to make sure he gets reelected and he doesn\u2019t have to face the SDNY prosecutors. ",

Of course, in order to get them fully on board with it, he\u2019d have to make a bunch of derogatory comments about irresponsible \u201cleftists\u201d refusing to wear masks. It would be a flaming lie, of course, but that\u2019s never stopped Trump, if it\u2019s likely to get him something that he wants. ",
