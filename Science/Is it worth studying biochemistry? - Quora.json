            "answer_text": "Is biochemistry worth studying? The glib answer of course, is that anything is worth doing if it\u2019s worth it to you. But a more personal answer would be this: I think you need to ask yourself why you want to do it. For a job? It\u2019s hard to think about the future and wonder if you could find a job in the biochemistry industry. Not to mention requiring further study. I don\u2019t just mean a Masters or a PhD (for research). I mean there\u2019s all sorts - law conversion to do Intellectual Property, a course in journalism to become a scientific journalist, public health communications\u2026 the list goes on. To solve a problem? What do you care about? Healthcare? Research? The world is a puzzle to be solved. Things that we were not able to do yesterday, we will be able to do tomorrow. How many leaps and bounds technology has made that we are able to sequence an entire genome in a matter of minutes, when the first time took 13 years? Have you got patience? If you want to be a researcher, just know that there will be a lot of repetitive work with plenty of tweaking, with the knowledge that in about 5 to 10 years you might be able to see that your work has some practical applications. Of course there are lots of branches of research that don\u2019t take so long - but in general, it will take a while. But Denise, you\u2019re not in the industry right now. Does that mean it wasn\u2019t worth it? No - not at all. I learned a lot of skills that I can make use of in any industry - chiefly analytical and writing skills. I still think like a scientist. I still like reading about science. Maybe not as much as before because of personal issues.. but you know, nothing is ever wasted. Some day, I would like to come back to it. Circumstances do not currently permit it, you know how long it takes to change course sometimes. But what about biochemistry versus other sciences? Uh, I am not sure I can help you there. I\u2019m a biochemistry person. I\u2019m not really that into the other sciences, as interesting as they seem, I just like biochemistry more. \u2014\u2014 Sometimes though, you just have to finish. It\u2019s only after you look back that you can say for yourself whether it was worth it for you.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you've ever wondered how Life functions at the molecular level, how living Cells convert Matter to Energy and Energy to Matter, how the food that you eat transforms into your blood, bones and flesh, how do lifeless Chemicals, governed by the laws of Physics, give rise to the multitude of life forms you see around you and how beautifully enigmatic Life on Earth is, then it's definitely worth it. And once you begin, there's no end to the wonder and excitement that shall make every fibre of your being feel unbearably alive. It forces you to introspect and leaves you in awe. For me, it's equivalent to a Philosophical/Spiritual experience. P.S. At times the extent of information that you have to remember and recall is enormously huge and can literally leave you in tears. But in the end, if you get the \u201clogic and principles\u201d of the subject, you'll begin enjoying it, putting it all together, piece by piece, until you end up with the larger picture ~  One of my favourite charts of all times: The Major Metabolic Pathways in a Cell. (Voet & Voet) If this doesn't give you goosebumps, then I don't know what does. ",
