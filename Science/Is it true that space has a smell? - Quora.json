            "answer_text": "Not exactly. Scientists figure out what chemicals a particular place has and determine what it would smell or  taste like based on what foods contain that chemical in abundance. For example, the center of the milky way contains Ethyl Formate, C3H6O2 , the dominant flavor in raspberries as well as an important one in rum. So the center of the Galaxy smells like raspberries and tastes like rum. ",

            "answer_text": "Smell is more a neurological process where sensors in noses detect the compound that gives rise to odor. In humans, olfaction occurs when odorant molecules bind to specific sites on the olfactory receptors. So in space if presence of any molecule is found..and those molecule comes in contact of the olfactors receptors..odor or smell of that molecules is processed inside the brain...So answer of the question of smells in space depends upon how much empty the space is ? and how much can be detected by  my nose?
