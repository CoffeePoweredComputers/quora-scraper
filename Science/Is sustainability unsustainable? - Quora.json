            "answer_text": "I\u00b4ll take it as a philosophical question and respond in those terms: There\u00b4s the theory that the universe will one day stop expanding, will start contracting, a new big bang will occur, and contraction/expansion will start all over again. \u2026almost as if the universe is breathing. Only that each breath takes a quadrillion of years (or at least a very big number of years). If we zoom in a bit, closer to our galaxy, someday the sun will start to shrink and become a supernova, eating up planet earth. Let\u00b4s zoom further in\u2026 Before that supernova happens, it\u00b4s fairly likely that a big meteor, a supervolcano, an acceleration in global warming, a nuclear war and/or a pandemic outbreak, will cause some major shifts on the planet as we currently know it. Supposedly the sixth mass extinction is already underway caused above all by human activity. My point is that, eventually, all things get destroyed and start anew. So with that said, what is and what is not sustainable/unsustainable and in what timeframe? At the end, all I know is that I\u00b4ve been pushing for sustainable development for the last +20 years because I simply don\u00b4t like seeing images of drowning polar bears, hungering children, bleached corals, flooded cities, etc. Many of these tragedies are a direct consequence of human activity or are reinforced by human activity. And, they create suffering among many species that simply should not be taking place in that shape and form.  ",

Strategic, regenerative approaches to sustainability in the 21st century are a whole new ball game of business innovation, opportunities and profits.
