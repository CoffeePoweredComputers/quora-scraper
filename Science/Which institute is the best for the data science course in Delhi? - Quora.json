            "answer_text": "Data Science courses are in abundance now, so much that it definitely confuses one about which course to select. Even though there are so many courses only few of them are really helpful and worth it, like the Data science course of Learnbay, Simplilearn and Intellipaat are really helpful to learn the field. So many things matters while in the process of choosing a course, especially if you are choosing online mode of study you really need to be careful in identifying the right course. Rather than just suggesting you the course I would want to brief details on them. Learnbay (recommended for professionals) Mode of training: Online mode with LED live sessions between students and trainer. Course structure: Programming Languages: Python and RStatistics and Math: Probability, Descriptive and Inferential statistics, Hypothesis testing, Data processing.Machine Learning algorithms: Supervised and Unsupervised learning, logistic and Linear regression, Decision trees, Tensorflow, Deep Learning and NLP, Time series, etc.Database related tools: SQL and MongoDBOther tools: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerBI, Big Data and Apache Spark Analytics.Projects: In online mode of training the projects will be carried out by trainers virtually, I personally believe this method of carrying out projects will not justify the core purpose of working in projects. Learnbay stands out to be different by its unique \u2018blended program\u2019 which is a blend of online training and practical project training. In the program, the expert trainers and students will gather in a destined venue to work on projects. The aim of this program is to provide online learning students the opportunity of practically work on projects and have effective experience. Certification: IBM certified Price: Rs.65,000  Learnbay is indeed providing a quality course for a very reachable price, but if you want to have more options of courses then I suggest you to check out the course of Simplilearn, Intellipaat and Imarticus. If you have other courses in your list please include these courses in that list and thoroughly inquire about them. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "You may find number of answers which will give you a list of institutes in Delhi for Data Science but instead of answering this question by providing a list I will first tell you that on what parameters you should decide that which institute you should go for training and then probably I will give you the list of some of the best institute for Data Science not only in Delhi but across India. Many a times in our life we face a situation where we have to make a selection out of few options, but we find ourselves in such a situation where we are unable to make decision. So in that situation I go to the basics and I make a list of all my requirements, and whichever selection fits best into my list of requirements I go with that. We have number os institutes for Data science in market which project themselves as the best institute for Data Science, but if I have to select one of them then I would make sure they should fit best for below requirements:- Why you should do this course and profile review?:- It is very important to get the answer for this question. You should be very clear with your goal before taking this course. If you are coming from non-technical background or if you feel that you may face technical challenges while doing this course so you may go for free profile review here. Book your slot here and get your profile reviewed by Industry Expert. I hope after the profile review your thoughts will be clear whether you should do this course or not?Classroom or Online:- With the spread of live online session in edu-sector, this concern doesn\u2019t seems to be big deciding factor. But, still there are few students who feel comfortable in classroom session. With the spread of Corona virus across the globe most of the institute has shutdown their classroom sessions and almost all of them will move their classes online in upcoming months. So I would like to suggest those students to make yourself comfortable with online classes if you don\u2019t want to make any delay. Yes, but once things will get normalised then you may go for classroom session. For working professional I would like to suggest to go for Virtual Live Online Classes so that you can spend most of your time in home study whereas Freshers may go for classroom sessions as they will have enough time after classes to practice and also you may need guidance every now and then.Weekdays or Weekend Classes:- I would like to recommend to go for weekend classes for Working professional so that you can manage the time between your work and classes. You need to be very focussed during the classes and have to give 100% as you will have very limited time. So it is good to go for weekend classes so that if you will be attending the session on weekend with relaxed mind and if you get extra time at weekdays then you may spend that time in home study. For Freshers I would like to recommend to go for Weekdays classes as you will have enough time and need to be in constant touch of the classes and trainer.Class Timing and Course Duration:- Total course duration of Data Science course is going to be somewhere between 4\u20136 months. So whatever decision you make whether classroom or online, Weekdays or weekends, you are going to spend at least 4\u20136 months. If you are doing weekdays classes then most of the institute will provide this classes on morning from 8\u201310 AM and if you are doing it on weekends then probably you will 2\u20133 timings to select. Make a wise decision based on your availability and convenience as you are going to get occupied with it for at least 4 months.Course Content:- Course content for almost all institutes is same, but yes I will give you few topics and sub topics which you may look for in any good content. Every good course content should have:Python ProgrammingPython Basics & Environment SetupPython Programming OverviewString, Decision & Loop ControlPython Data TypesFunction & ModulesFile I/O, Exception Handling & Regular ExpressionData Analysis using Numpy and PandasData Visualisation using Python: Matplotlib and seabornCase Studies and assignmentsStatistics for Data ScienceFundamentals of Math & ProbabilityDescriptive StatisticsInferential StatisticsHypothesis TestingData Processing & Exploratory Data AnalysisMachine Learning AlgorithmsIntroduction to Machine learningSupervised learningLinear RegressionLogistics regressionDecision TreeUnsupervised LearningNatural Language ProcessingIntroduction to Time Series ForecastingARIMA & Multivariate Time Series AnalysisAssignments, Case Studies and ProjectsTensorflow & Deep LearningIntroduction to Deep Learning & Tensor FlowIntroduction to Tensor FlowUnderstanding Neural Networks with Tensor FlowConvolutional Neural NetworkNatural Language ProcessingIntroduction to NLP & Text AnalysisText Pre Processing TechniquesDistance Algorithms used in Text AnalyticsInformation Retrieval SystemsProjects & Case StudiesSQL & MongoDBRDBMS & SQL OperationsNoSQL DatabaseProgramming with SQLMongoDB OverviewBasics & CRUD OperationIntroduction to MongoDBTableaue and PowerBIIntroduction to TableaueVisual AnalyticsDashboard and StoriesMappingGetting Started with Power BIProgramming with Power BIBig Data & Spark AnalyticsIntroduction to RProgramming with RManipulating DataVisualisation DataCourse Fee:- I think most of the candidates look for a proper answer for this as no one wants to loose their money unnecessarily. I would recommend that you should not spend more than 1Lacs for this course. For more detail on fee you may click here.Keeping all these points in mind I would like to recommend you few institutes like Learnbay, Upgrad, Simplilearn & Edureka. All these institutes are equally good and fits best for all my above mentioned points except fee part. Out of these only Learnbay is there which meets all the above criteria. So I would personally like to recommend you Learnbay. Thanks!!! ",
