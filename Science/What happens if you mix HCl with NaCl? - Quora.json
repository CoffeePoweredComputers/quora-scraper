            "answer_text": "HCl dissociates to H+ & Cl- ions. NaCl dissociates to Na+ & Cl- ions. Notice that Cl- is common. This mixture (assuming in water) forms what is called a buffer solution. By varying the amount/quantity (concentration) of HCl and/or NaCl, the chemical equilibrium in the solution could be moved towards formation/dissociation of HCl or NaCl (at the expense of each other). The special property/characteristic of Buffer Soln is that they resists change in pH (acidity/basicity); by moving the same equilibrium. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing. You get a mixture of sodium, chloride, and hydrogen ions, but there is no net reaction, because both of the positively charged ions are complemented by chloride ions. If you heat the mixture, the HCl will evaporate out and leave the NaCl behind. Hope this helps you\u2026.:-) ",
