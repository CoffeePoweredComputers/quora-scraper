            "answer_text": "For sound (material) waves, transverse means individual particles of the material move essentially perpendicular to the direction of the wave, and longitudinal means individual particles of the material move essentially in the direction of the direction of the wave. In periodic waves the individual particle essentially oscillate about their rest position. In solids there can be both transverse and longitudinal components to the motion. in an frictionless fluid there is no transverse component because there is no transverse restoring force: longitudinal waves only. In real fluids there is at least a small frictional force in the transverse direction. This is usually negligible, but you can get what looks like a very heavily damped transverse wave going in honey. Not really a wave. Sufficiently strong waves in a real fluid induce a net flow in the direction of the wave. ",

            "answer_text": "There are four classifications of acoustic [sound] waves: Transverse Acoustic (TA). These waves have velocities in a lower velocity branch of lattice vibrations.Transverse Optical (TO). These waves have frequencies in a high-velocity branch of lattice vibrations.Longitudinal Acoustic (LA). These waves have velocities in a lower velocity branch of lattice vibrations.Longitudinal Optical (LO). These waves have velocities in a high-velocity branch. In the case of fluids, this branch has a very narrow velocity range or a single velocity.One often hears and sometimes reads that sound waves are longitudinal. This is the case of acoustic waves in fluids. However, acoustic waves may propagate in solids as well as liquids, gases, and plasmas. Fluids support longitudinal waves exclusively. However, solids support both transverse and longitudinal waves. ",
