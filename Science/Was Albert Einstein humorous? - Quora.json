            "answer_text": "Yes. Einstein had a great sense of humor. His first speech at Princeton was on General Relativity, his theory of gravity. He started with \u201cI suppose you think that if I know so much about gravity, why can\u2019t I get my hair to lie down?\u201d. Another time he had written a number of equations on the blackboard, and a graduate student said he thought their might be a mistake in one of the equations. Einstein looked at the equation, rubbed his jaw for a second and said \u201c You\u2019re right. Oh well I\u2019m no Einstein\u201d. A journalist reported that he interviewed Einstein at his home in Princeton. He said that he knew quite a bit about Einstein\u2019s theories and personal history. What was a surprise was Einstein\u2019s playfulness and and the amount of incredibly cheerful laughter. He also took time for such things as showing the journalist a mechanical toy made by a young neighbor child and given to him as a birthday present. Very few physicists are willing to be photographed by the media when sticking their tongue out. ",

            "answer_text": " To see Einstein\u2019s true wisdom and value you must study the man. I group his wisdom and value into 6 interesting categories. I will use these 6 categories to highlight Einstein\u2019s true wisdom: His Sense of Humor He often stated that his secret to creativity was knowing how to hide his sources. The difference between stupidity and genius he felt was that genius had its limits ... and liked to say that only 2 things were infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and he wasn\u2019t sure about the former. Finally, he was a very observant person and noted that as he got more and more famous he got, the more and more stupid he also became. That he said was a very common phenomenon. More - Remarkable Lessons Albert Einstein Taught Me about Life His Personality While having a strong will, Einstein was very humble and attributed his talent to his passionate curiosity and imagination. He felt both were more important than knowledge. His view of was that the true sign of intelligence was not knowledge but imagination and believed that the only source of knowledge was experience. Views on Life A focus on simplicity was one of his main tenets and though his skill in physics was renown, he believed everything that can be counted did not necessarily count and that everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted. He believed in being a giver\u2026 only a life lived for others was a life worthwhile. Einstein was often frustrated with the state of his times and felt that the world would require a substantially new manner of thinking to survive. He felt that the world was dangerous not because evil people but because of people who recognize the evil, yet do nothing about it. His characterization of the age was that world leaders had developed a perfection of means yet had a significant confusion of ends. Views on Creativity His thought was felt that imagination was more valuable than logic \u2026 logic could get you from A to B, but imagination could take you everywhere. He was an early believer in trying many new things and not fearing mistakes \u2026 felt that someone who never made a mistake never tried new things. His view was any intelligent fool could make things bigger and more complex, but the genius and courage were in heading in the opposite direction. Problem Solving Thinking Einstein believed that if he was given 20 hours to solve a problem, he would spend 18 hours on understanding the problem and 2 hours on the solution. That is one of my favorite lessons from this thinker. He didn\u2019t think he was that smart, it\u2019s just that he had the skill of persistence to stay with problems longer than most people. Maintained a strong belief on the necessity of eliminating biases to be able to look for what is and not for what they should be. Always stated that problems required a new level of consciousness beyond the one that created the problem \u2026 he was a big proponent of change. Education Views Einstein was not a proponent of the education systems of his day. He used to say that one\u2019s education was what was left after one had forgotten what one learned had learned in school. He also felt that it was a miracle that any curiosity was able to survive formal education. Mike Schoultz is a digital marketing and customer service expert.
