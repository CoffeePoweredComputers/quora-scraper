            "answer_text": "The answer is \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d. We observe that the Universe exhibits the principle of conservation of energy everywhere we look, including looking back toward its very early period, which we can see by looking at very distant objects and infer by measuring the relative proportions of chemical elements in the Universe, the pattern of variation in the CMB, etc. According to Noether\u2019s theorem, the conservation of energy is mathematically equivalent to the laws of physics being time-invariant. In other words, if the laws of physics are the same tomorrow as they are today, the total amount of energy in the Universe (or in any closed system that is part of the Universe) must also be the same tomorrow as it was today. As you note, the conservation rule clearly cannot have applied at the very beginning. Presumably the laws of physics were different before the beginning of our Universe than they were after it began, possibly by being nonexistent beforehand. Exactly what happened at that point we don\u2019t know, and we may never know. But in principle, that difference leaves room for the creation of all the energy in the Universe at the time that it came into existence. If the Universe ever comes to a definite end (instead of everything just becoming colder and more spread out as time goes on forever, which appears to be the most likely possibility) then the laws of physics might change at that point too. Possibly by becoming nonexistent. This would certainly allow for all of the energy in the Universe to vanish. But we will certainly never know what would happen if such a future endpoint ever occurs, because if we were even still around to see it we would vanish as well before we could observe what happened.

            "answer_text": "From a layman to layman \u263a The first part of your question, not answerable as it makes little sense. You are simply saying that it's there so why not say so ? Who says energy can not be destroyed ? A mathematician, a physicist ? We only know that which we can calculate and quantify. Just as in the \u201cBig Bang\" (a phrase i personally hate and would rather people used \u2018staff's , or, \u2018beginning \u2018) math and physics brakes down and proofs become null and void . So it is now that anti-matter has entered the equation. As you know matter,energy ,energy,matter, etc. So here we go +matter plus -matter equals 0 matter. I think. They say that, on estimate, the total amount of matter in the universe is less now than just after its creation due to destruction of matter and anti-matter collisions. Not being a scientist, and if someone could verify this, I think this would show that energy can be destroyed, remember even negative energy is still energy. Oh, by the way. Your statement does not prove energy can be created. It does, however, show you used a lot on your machine when asking the question.  ",
