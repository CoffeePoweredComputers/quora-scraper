            "answer_text": "It has it's ups and downs. The biggest positive is that we have a really tight knit community in the department. For instance me and my friends who are CS majors have a close rapport with our professors and feel comfortable joking with them in their office during office hours and having more candid conversations than students at larger departments have. Also we have a Computer Science department lab that we constantly hang out in, and I think I am on a first name basis with nearly every single CS major in the program.  One of my only gripes is that due to the size, our electives are offered on rotating basis  so if you miss a cool CS elective that you wanted to take you have to wait 2 years to see it come back into rotation instead of 1. They just simply don't have enough profs. and students to run every elective every semester.  One of the coolest things is our TechTrek program though, run out of the business school, which offers monthly visits to meet with BC alums at tech companies in the Boston area. So I've been to Google, TripAdvisor, and Amazon's Boston offices and a ton of startups. So the business school really helps support tech culture and offers great opportunities to learn about entrepreneurship and technology businesses.  All in all I think the department is big enough to make of it what you will. We have about 8 or 9 profs. in the department at the time of writing this and if you're driven enough to learn everything they have to teach you ... well then you have more to learn than you can in 4 years! Its a department where the driven rise to the occasion and take hold of the  opportunities the department has to offer, but its doesn't put many opportunities in front of you as much as as school with a larger CS department might. For example we NEVER have big name tech recruiters come to campus for our job fairs like they do at schools with more well known for tech (always a little jealous to hear my friends at CMU, Yale, and others, getting face-time with Facebook/Google/Microsoft/Palantir recruiters on campus :D ). For reference the most excellent CS majors I know have left the department to work at Apple, or Palantir, or Hubspot; get offers from Google and other great companies; and have gotten in to CS PhD/Masters programs at MIT. But we don't have the good fortune of saying that type of success is \"average\" or expected for the department; it's for the few who have admirably made the most of their time here. ",

The Information Systems Department offers a program in Information Systems. Consult their listing under the Carroll School of Management for a program description. For further information, contact the Computer Science Department at St. Mary\u2019s Hall, Second Floor South, 617-552-3975. BACHELOR OF ARTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE The curriculum for the bachelor of arts degree in Computer Science is based on current recommendations of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for liberal arts institutions. The program is designed both to provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer science, and to provide practical, hands-on experience with computing systems, as the current technology job market dictates. Bachelor of arts students complete a 34-credit computer science component, supplemented by a mathematics component rooted in calculus. For most students, the program requires completion of 14 three-credit courses along with one one-credit lab. Computer Science Component The 34 credits required for completion of the bachelor of arts major are grouped into two categories, seven required core courses (totaling 22 credits) and four electives (totaling at least 12 credits). The seven required core courses are the following: CSCI1101 Computer Science I or CSCI1103 Computer Science I HonorsCSCI1102 Computer Science IICSCI2243 Logic and ComputationCSCI2244 Randomness and ComputationCSCI2271 Computer SystemsCSCI2272 Computer Organization and LabCSCI3383 AlgorithmsAll these courses are three credits with the exception of CSCI2272, which is 4 credits. The remaining twelve credits will typically be earned from four courses with at least nine of the credits earned from courses at the CSCI3000 level. The remaining three credits may be earned through any CSCI courses numbered CSCI2000 or above. Logic and Computation and Randomness and Computation (CSCI2243 and CSCI2244) provide students with mathematical fundamentals necessary for Computer Science. It is especially important that these be completed no later than the end of junior year, since this material is prerequisite for the required course Algorithms (CSCI3383). CSCI2243 and CSCI2244 are required prerequisites for many 3000-level CSCI electives. Mathematics Component One semester of calculus at the level of Calculus II or higher is required for completion of the bachelor of arts major. Students will ordinarily complete the calculus requirement with any one of the following courses: MATH1101, MATH1103, MATH1105, or MATH2202. Realistically, most students will need to complete a prerequisite calculus course (e.g., MATH1100 before MATH1101, or MATH1102 before MATH1103), so this calculus requirement is usually satisfied by enrolling in a two-semester sequence. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE The curriculum for the bachelor of science major in Computer Science is based on requirements specified by the Computer Science Accreditation Board (CSAB). The program is designed to provide an extensive background in computer science and is well suited for students considering graduate study or students planning to pursue careers in science or engineering. Bachelor of science students must complete a 38-credit computer science component, supplemented by a mathematics component and a natural science component. Computer Science Component The bachelor of science major in Computer Science requires a minimum of 38 credits in computer science. The computer science credits are grouped into two categories, eight required CS courses (totaling 26 credits) and four elective courses (totaling at least 12 credits). The eight required core courses are: CSCI1101 Computer Science I or CSCI1103 Computer Science I HonorsCSCI1102 Computer Science IICSCI2243 Logic and ComputationCSCI2244 Randomness and ComputationCSCI2271 Computer SystemsCSCI2272 Computer Organization and LabCSCI3372 Computer Architecture and LabCSCI3383 AlgorithmsAll these courses are three credits with the exception of CSCI2272 and CSCI3372, which are 4 credits. Of the twelve credits of electives, at least nine must be from courses numbered CSCI3000 or above. The remaining three credits must be earned from one course in the social and ethical issues cluster: CSCI2260\u20132267. Logic and Computation and Randomness and Computation (CSCI2243 and CSCI2244) provide students with mathematical fundamentals necessary for Computer Science. It is especially important that these be completed no later than the end of junior year, since this material is prerequisite for the required course Algorithms (CSCI3383). CSCI2243 and CSCI2244 are required prerequisites for many 3000-level CSCI electives. Mathematics Component At least 12 credits of mathematics are required for completion of the bachelor of science major: MATH1103 Calculus II (Math/Science Majors) or MATH1105 Calculus II\u2013AP (Math/Science Majors)MATH2202 Multivariable CalculusClass of 2018, 2019, and 2020: Two MATH electives from among MATH2210 Linear Algebra, MATH2216 Introduction to Abstract Mathematics, or any MATH course 3000 or higher;Class of 2021: MATH2210 Linear Algebra and any MATH course 3000 or higher.Since many students will need to complete MATH1102 before taking MATH1103, this calculus requirement will often be met by enrolling in a two-semester sequence. Science Component Students are required to complete a two-semester sequence in a laboratory science for science majors, and one additional non-overlapping science elective of at least three credits. Non-overlapping AP and IB credit can be used to meet the requirement of the additional three-credit science elective. Students may complete the lab science requirement in several ways. Eligible introductory sequences are: Biology (BIOL2000/2010/2040 or BIOL2000/3030/2040)Chemistry (CHEM1109/1111/1113, CHEM1110/1112/1114 or CHEM1117/1119/1121, CHEM1118/1120/1122)Physics (PHYS2200/2050/2110 and PHYS2201/2051/2111)Earth and Environmental SciencesOption 1: EESC1132/1133 followed by EESC2220/2221 or EESC2250/2251 or EESC2264/2265 or EESC2285/2286Option 2: Two of EECS2210/2211, EESC2202/2212, EESC2203/2213, EESC2204/2214, EESC2205/2215, EESC2206/2216, EESC2207/2217, EESC2208/2218 followed by EESC2220/2221DEPARTMENTAL HONORS Junior and Senior Computer Science majors with at least a 3.3 GPA in CSCI courses are eligible to join the Departmental Honors Program. In order to graduate with the Departmental Honors designation, eligible students must maintain at least a 3.3 GPA in CSCI courses and complete a senior thesis. Thesis requirements are to have a thesis proposal approved by a faculty advisor and by the Honors Committee by the end of their junior year. They must complete two sections of CSCI4961 Honors Thesis during their senior year with grades of B+ or higher. They must submit a written honors thesis by the last day of class in the second semester of their senior year, and they must make an oral presentation of their thesis at the end of their senior year. Students participating in the Honors Program are required to take both sections of CSCI4961 Honors Thesis. One section of CSCI4961 Honors Thesis may count as a CSCI elective. THE MINOR PROGRAM The minor program in Computer Science is designed to provide an introduction to computer science, primarily for mathematics and science majors. It is also suitable for students with a strong secondary interest in computer science and good analytical skills. Eighteen credits are required for completion of the minor which are completed with the following courses: CSCI1101 Computer Science ICSCI1102 Computer Science IIOne of CSCI2271 Computer Systems, CSCI2272 Computer Organization (with Lab) or any 3000-level electiveOne elective course numbered 2000 or aboveTwo elective courses numbered 3000 or aboveAll these courses are three credits with the exception of CSCI2272, which is 4 credits. INTERDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATION IN BIOINFORMATICS Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of study combining aspects of Biology, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Undergraduates enrolled in degree programs in any one of these three disciplines can obtain the designation of a Concentration in Bioinformatics by completing the following courses: Core Requirements BIOL4200 Introduction to Bioinformatics NOTE: Students have the option to substitute a semester of undergraduate research (e.g., in the labs of Prof. Clote) in place of BIOL4200. If this option is used, no other course may be substituted by research.BIOL5240 Computational Foundations of BioinformaticsMATH2226 Probability for Bioinformatics (students may also substitute MATH4426 Probability or BIOL2300 Biostatistics or BIOL2310 Biostatistics Honors)Elective Requirements Any one additional biology course at the level of BIOL2200 or above. BIOL2200 is recommended. Students with high school AP Biology may take BIOL3040 Cell Biology, BIOL3050 Genetics, BIOL3150 Intro to Genomics, BIOL4140 Microbiology, or BIOL4400 Molecular Biology instead.Any three computer science courses at the level of CSCI1101 or above. (CSCI1101 or CSCI1103) and CSCI1102 are recommended. Upper-level courses well-suited to the concentration include CSCI1127 Introduction to Scientific Computation, CSCI3345 Machine Learning, and CSCI3383 Algorithms.One elective course may be substituted by a semester of research in bioinformatics (e.g., in the labs of Prof. Clote). Students wishing to pursue this option should see the Biology Department for course approval.Courses that count towards a student's primary major can be used to simultaneously count towards the bioinformatics core or elective requirements as well. For example, the basic requirements for the biology major will automatically fulfill the required elective course requirement at the level of BIOL2000 or above, and the BIOL4200, BIOL5240, and BIOL5610 courses can double-count to fulfill biology electives. Computer science majors will naturally fulfill the three CSCI course requirements in their primary coursework. Computer science students taking the B.S. option will also naturally fulfill the Probability requirement through MATH4426. Example Course Choices for a Biology Major A biology major wishing to complete the bioinformatics concentration would typically choose BIOL4200 and BIOL5240 as electives within the standard biology major. Beyond this, the student would be required to take four additional courses to complete the Bioinformatics Concentration. Typically, these courses would be CSCI1101, CSCI1102, MATH2226, and any additional CSCI course at a level above CSCI1101. This additional course could also be substituted by a semester of bioinformatics research within a lab. Example Course Choices for a Computer Science Major A computer science major wishing to complete the bioinformatics minor would naturally complete the three CSCI courses as part of their major requirements. Beyond this, the student would be required to take five additional courses. These would be BIOL4200, BIOL5240, a probability/statistics course, and one biology elective. Typically, this elective would be BIOL2000, though students with high school AP Biology might take BIOL3040 or BIOL3050 instead. This elective could also be substituted by a semester of bioinformatics research in a lab. COMPUTER SCIENCE CONCENTRATION FOR CARROLL SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT STUDENTS The concentration in Computer Science emphasizes technical and theoretical issues in computing. Graduates are prepared to enter technical computer software development positions as well as positions in information technology management. The Computer Science concentration consists of 15 credits beyond CSCI1021, including three required courses and six credits of elective courses. The three required courses are: CSCI1101 Computer Science I or CSCI1103 Computer Science I HonorsCSCI1102 Computer Science IIand one of: CSCI2271 Computer Systemsor CSCI2272 Computer Organization and LabThe six elective credits must consist of: Three credits at the level of CSCI2000 or higherThree credits at the level of CSCI3000 or higherStudents are encouraged to take additional Computer Science courses. INFORMATION FOR FIRST YEAR MAJORS AND NON-MAJORS The Computer Science majors are for students who enjoy using computers and who wish to gain a deeper understanding of computing technology. Both majors are designed to provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer science. At the same time, they provide practical, hands-on experience, as the current technological job market dictates. Students are prepared for a variety of careers such as software development, network administration, technical support, and systems analysis. In addition, knowledge of computing technology is becoming increasingly important for people entering business, law, and the health care fields. First Year Computer Science Majors First year students considering majoring in Computer Science should plan to complete the program's calculus requirement (MATH1101 or higher) during their first year. Most will enroll in MATH1100 in fall semester and continue with MATH1101 in spring semester. Students who either carry advanced mathematics placement or who have completed a year of calculus in high school, should enroll directly in MATH1101 (or a more advanced course) in the fall semester. First year students wishing to double major in Computer Science and Mathematics should take the calculus sequence recommended for the Mathematics major. Freshmen with some prior programming experience or strong technical skills are encouraged to take CSCI1101 Computer Science I or CSCI1103 Computer Science I Honors or CSCI1102 Computer Science II in their first semester. Those students who have had no programming experience may consider beginning with an introductory computer course (e.g., CSCI1074) in their first year. First year students who have achieved a score of 4 or higher on the Computer Science A.P. Examination or students entering with significant programming backgrounds, should speak with the Computer Science Chairperson or Undergraduate Program Director about proper course placement (e.g., directly taking CSCI1102). First Year Non-Majors The department offers six introductory 3-credit courses in computer science: CSCI1021, CSCI1074, CSCI1101, CSCI1127, CSCI1154, CSCI1157, and CSCI2227. CSCI1021 is designed to teach students about the role of information systems in management. Students learn to use technology as a tool for problem solving by developing increasingly sophisticated models in Excel. The other module provides an introduction to management viewed through the lens of technology. Students examine the role of technology in organizational competitiveness and across a variety of functional areas of the firm (e.g., marketing, finance, operations). CSCI1154 is an introduction to programming and web-based applications. Students begin by learning basic web page creation with HTML and server side scripting with PHP. We cover assignments, conditionals, loops and arrays. Next we investigate XML followed by, database design, and database access techniques. Sample projects might include movie rentals, shopping-cart based sales, and student registration systems. The course is currently taught using HTML5, MySQL, and JavaScript, and Wordpress. No prior programming experience is required. CSCI1074 is a survey of Computer Science for students who know little about computing. How do computer hardware and software really work? How is information (text, music, images, numbers) represented in computer files, CDs, digital cameras, and iPods; how do computers manipulate this digitally encoded information; and how is it all sent around the Internet? Students will learn the answers to these questions through weekly hands-on computer exercises. CSCI1075 is a gentle introduction to computer programming for non-majors. Students will learn about computers and computer software by working with a small personal robot. Students will learn the Python programming language, and write Python programs to control their robot's behavior, explore its environment, and perform various tasks. As we get our robots to do more and more, we learn how software is designed and written to solve real problems. CSCI1101 and CSCI1103 are the introductory programming courses. One of these is required of all Computer Science majors and minors and is a prerequisite for all advanced computer science courses. Therefore, students who wish to take more than one course in computer science will need to take either CSCI1101 or CSCI1103 at some point. The skills needed to write computer programs come easily to some people and less easily to others. Students who have little or no programming experience and are apprehensive about their ability should consider enrolling in CSCI1074 before enrolling in CSCI1101 or CSCI1103. CSCI1157 is an introduction to programming with an orientation to management applications. This course is taught using the Visual Basic programming language and is required for Information Systems concentrators in the Carroll School of Management. CSCI2227 is an introduction to programming with an orientation to scientific applications, using MATLAB as the programming language. It is the first course in the minor in Scientific Computation. TRANSFER CREDITS AND PLACEMENT FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES The Computer Science Department will accept transfer credits from other schools with documentation (for example, syllabi) sufficient for us to determine course equivalence. Before taking an external course, check BC's academic policies. AP, IB, and GCE scores are used to make placement decisions, but not for course credit. Specifically, students who score a 5 on the Computer Science A exam, or a 4 or 5 on the Computer Science AB exam, or who have significant programming experience should consult with the Chairperson of the Department or Undergraduate Program Director about starting the Computer Science course sequence with CSCI1102. COURSE AVAILABILITY Most introductory courses (e.g., CSCI1021, CSCI1101, CSCI1102, and CSCI1157) are available every semester. CSCI1074 and CSCI1075 are offered periodically. All courses that are required for the major are offered at least once each academic year with the exception of CSCI3327, Computer Architecture which is offered only in alternate years. Most advanced electives are offered only in alternate years; hence, student schedules should be designed carefully. COURSE CREDIT INFORMATION All Computer Science courses are prefixed by the letters CSCI and are registered as courses in the Morrissey College of Arts College of Arts and Sciences. However, because the department serves both the Morrissey College of Arts College of Arts and Sciences and the Carroll School of Management, some courses are considered to be primarily management-oriented. These courses (CSCI1157, CSCI2257, and CSCI2258) are cross-listed with the Operations Management Department in the Carroll School of Management. ",
