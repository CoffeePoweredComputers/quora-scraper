            "answer_text": "There is a quote from the Psalms 128:2 of the Torah that states: 'Who is rich?  The one who is happy with his lot.  You will eat the fruit of labour of your hand, and you shall be blessed and secure'. And the truth is, although everyone will have a personal perspective and answer to your question, it cannot really be answered with certainty.   If you feel that you want to enjoy all the finer things in life, running around with the best car, living in a mansion with your yacht parked at the end of the path that leads to the river bank so be it.  But I believe to live your life thus, without knowledge and wanting to learn and partake of the intricacies of life would be a great travesty.  And how would you know you are going to keep your wealth? On the other hand it seems to me you can have both.  It depends on your interpretation of what 'rich' would mean in your life.  But turning back to the quote 'rich' does not necessarily have to mean to have the biggest and best possessions in life.  Rich can mean to be very happy with what you have, in which case you can have both wealth and knowledge in great abundance. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say wealth over knowledge. Wealthy people will surround themselves w/ those that have more knowledge than themselves in order to benefit and learn. Whereas knowledgeable people may know a lot, but having a high IQ etc doesn't do a lot for many besides a high level of arrogance/ ego. I've always done well in school, but I do not attribute intelligence in the top factors that determine success. Most of my wealthy clients I deal with may have intelligence but it was their drive, focus, confidence and attitude that attributed the most to their gaining a high level of wealth. So between the two, I vote wealth every time.  It's easier to acquire knowledge for the wealthy than for those with knowledge to acquire wealth.  ",
