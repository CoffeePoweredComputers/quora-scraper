            "answer_text": "First of all, as everybody has already stated, I have to join them in saying that Gravity exists. Otherwise, we would not be here talking about it. I think that your question arises from a common misunderstanding, generated, in my opinion, by the low-quality content of many science popularization books and documentaries. (Not so) suprisingly, such a misundersting is also diffused among physics students and researchers, as I had opportunity to see. The misundersting goes roughly as follows: \u201cAt high school we learned that gravity is a force, that is to say, something that, when exerted on a body, changes its state of motion. But now, from General Relativity, we know that it is not a force. Gravity acts as a force only apparently: the motion of a body in presence of a gravitational field can be described as a \u2018free\u2019 motion -- a least-path trajectory -- on a curved space-time\u201d. That is essentially it. What General Relativity has done is the replacement: Force <-> Curved Space-time, which is described by an object, called the metric. How is determined the metric on which all bodies move? By the bodies themselves. Hence, we are describing interactions, forces between bodies. So, please remember this: according to the physical definition of force, gravity is a force. P.S.: In his post, David Levitt wrote that gravity is a \u201cfictitious\u201d force. In fact, things are more complicated than this. This was somehow one of the starting point of Einstein\u2019s formulation of general relativity: a homogeneous gravitation field is equivalent to an accelerated frame of reference. This is true already in Newtonian mechanics, and is called the \u201cequivalence principle\u201d, namely the equality between the \u201cinertial\u201d and \u201cgravitational mass\u201d (the two masses appearing in the two sides of Newton\u2019s gravitational law are the same). This equivalence is experimentally proved up to one part over ten thousand of billions. The insight of Einstein was that even the most general gravitational field, is locally equivalent to an accelerating frame of reference. So, one can make the field \u201cdisappear\u201d at every space-time point merely by making a change of coordinates. ",

            "answer_text": "Einstein did not prove that gravity does not exist. Einstein provided a modern, field theoretical explanation for the phenomenon of gravity. In this explanation, the gravitational force (which very much exists) is mediated by a geometric property of spacetime itself, the metric field. In turn, the metric field becomes physically real, as it carries energy and momentum between gravitating bodies, but also in the form of free gravitational waves in empty space. And because gravitation is universal, this metric is the only metric \u201csensed\u201d by material objects regardless of their composition, and consequently, the \u201ccurved\u201d spacetime geometry determined by this metric is the only geometry that there is. In short, we can identify the phenomenon of gravity and the geometry of spacetime as being manifestations of the same thing. But do not let hyperbole and breathless popularizations lead you to believe that gravity does not exist. If anyone tries to convince you of this, just tell them to drop a brick on their own feet and then ask if they felt anything. After all, if there is no gravitational force accelerating that brick, they shouldn\u2019t be feeling any pain\u2026 ",
