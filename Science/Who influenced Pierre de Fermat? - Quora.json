            "answer_text": "Diophantus obviously because so much of Pierre\u2019s work plays around with those equation forms, looking for answers and, perhaps more interestingly, non-answers. I\u2019m not exactly sure how he became focused on what can\u2019t happen, but it certainly is reflected in his general approach, and I think it reflects his essential \u2018Frenchness\u2019. To explain, the way he conceived of equations as having solutions or not, and defining those circumstances, is very much like the reflexive in French in which the concept of an object exists both independently of you and independently of itself. This allows the classic French discussions of what your ideal is versus my version, and arguments about which better reflects the context, need, etc. Relabel those as \u2018solutions\u2019 and the best solutions as those which are integers. I love that Pierre worked in probability because that also fits the French mind so well. I don\u2019t mean anything restrictive by saying \u2018mind\u2019; I mean a strength of French mathematics is the way the language\u2019s representation of reality is reflected in it. ",
