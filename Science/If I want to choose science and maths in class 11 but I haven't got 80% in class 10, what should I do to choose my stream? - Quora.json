            "answer_text": "If you haven't got 80% in 10th, means you didnt studied hard enough. You might get science, as science stream criteria differ in schools, some school demand atleast 85% whereas some schools are fine with 75% too. If your school give science at 80%, that you haven't got, it is better to give up on science stream, as science is not a joke. But in case you are extremely sincere then it depends on your percentage. If it is atleast 75%, there might be some hope, though it varies as per school and teachers. If it is less than that, yours is a lost case. ",
