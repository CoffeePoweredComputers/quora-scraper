            "answer_text": "The air we breathe in is about 20-percent oxygen, the rest being nitrogen and a few minor components such as carbon dioxide and rare gases such as helium. For a normal healthy person the air that we breathe out is about 15-percent oxygen. This means that about 5% of the oxygen we breathe in is actually CONSUMED. A normal breathing rate is between 12 and 20 breaths a minute depending on activity level, age, stress, etc. And the amount we breathe in also depends on how DEEPLY we are breathing, our body mass index and lung capacity. It also depends on whether we are correctly using our diaphragm or we have bad breathing habits such as over-breathing, hyperventilation and mouth breathing. So clearly there is a lot of variabilty in the actual number, Taking all these things into account, there is therefore a broad range from about 400 to 700 liters consumed per day, or 14 to 24 cubic feet per day. These volumes will be higher if you are up a mountain where the density of air is less. The most efficient breathing rate is down at about 6 breaths a minute, where our lungs and heart are working closely together - called heart rate variability. At this rate you consume less oxygen, put less load on your heart and reduce your stress level. Here is a video that shows you how to do this. It takes practice but is well worth it.
