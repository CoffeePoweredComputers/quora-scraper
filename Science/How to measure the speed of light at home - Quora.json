            "answer_text": "Materials Used in this Experiment: Long chocolate bar \u2013 $2.00, $3.50 in NYCMicrowave Oven: $100Plate: Clean, preferably. (Microwave safe if you like your microwave)Calculator: Not a must (but see the section titled Time for experiment\u009d)Ruler: $0.11 if you buy by the thousands.Personal, intimate knowledge of the speed of light: PricelessTime for experiment: About 10 minutes (with a calculator.15 without one. Could be a lot more if you forgot your fifth grade math). Accuracy: There will be some inaccuracy in your result (my own calculations had a percent error of 6.3%). The size of this error is important, because it can help us understand what external factors played a role in our experiment.If you stop to consider your results, why you got them, and what they mean, it\u2019ll help you understand how light works. Since this experiment is done at home (which is not conducive to precise measurements, unless you live in a physics lab, in which case I am willing to relocate for a domestic partnership) there are several external conditions that could distort the measurements and lead to errors.This is by no means a complete list, but here are some external factors that I thought of: Uncertainty about the exact position of the plate inside the microwave oven. I had no way of knowing how high, or low, to put the chocolate inside the microwave so the waves would hit said chocolate at the x-axis\u009d and produce a relatively useful waveform on the chocolate. However, the microwave is relatively small, and I tried to align the plate with the wave generator (or what looked like one).There is air in the microwave oven. This type of experiments is best done in a vacuum, to eliminate any interference from \u201cexternal\u201d\u009d sources like resistance, humidity, etc. The electromagnetic (light) waves themselves might not be affected, but the chocolate certainly is.My measurement was relatively generous, on the broad side. If the chocolate had melted at two distinct points, I could have taken a more accurate reading. On top of that, my measuring devices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ruler and two imperfect eyes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were of limited accuracy.Real labs with real scientists have very accurate measuring devices which decrease the percent error.To try and eliminate such mistakes from affecting real experiments, real scientists never stop after only one experiment. The tests are repeated over and over again, and sometimes even over again, again, and all results(failures and successesses(whatever)) are recorded and analyzed. My experiment was only a demonstration, but if I\u2019d have done it a few more times, and taken an average of the distance between entry/exit points of the wave, my accuracy level would probably rise. Despite all this, I have to say: measuring the speed of light in non-lab conditions, using a bunch of Hershey\u2019s Kisses and a plastic ruler, and getting only a 6.3% percent error, well, that ain\u2019t too shabby. Practical Applications: There are many applications to knowing the speed of light, and mentioning all of them would be a crazy, crazy task even for me. However, for the sake of consistency, here are a few interesting scientific applications that use the speed of light: GPS Systems can pinpoint signal location on earth with calculations based on the speed of light.The GPS device (in your hand, for instance) receives a locator beam from multiple satellites at various locations in orbit. At any given time, GPS satellites are located over different parts of the Earth, and they all send out a signal synchronized to each other according to an atomic Empower your Mobile Workforce other words, they all broadcast at exactly the same time.But because the satellites are at different distances from you, your GPS unit will receive these synchronous signals at different times.Why?Because the signals, despite being broadcast at the same moment and traveling at the same speed (of light!) arrive at your location in a staggered manner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sooner from closer satellites, later for farther ones.Calculating the relative delays of the signals lets your GPS unit figure out where you are to an exceptional degree of accuracy.Communication in Space: The speed of light affects communication in general (since light itself, as we said, is an electromagnetic wave, just like radio waves but at a different frequency) but the most noticeable effect is on communication in space. When Houston ground control (as in, \u201cHouston.. we have a problem!\u201d\u009d) communicated with Apollo 8, the first Apollo mission to orbit the moon, they had to wait about 3 seconds until their messages reached the astronauts.Distances in Space: Because distances in space are so vast and the speed of light is constant in a vacuum and thus the same number always, distances to far solar systems, planets and other stellar objects are often referred to in \u201clight years.\u201d In colonel general, the units of \u201cparsec\u201d\u009d (\u201cparallax second\u201d\u009d) and kilometers are used, but to convey the sheer size of those distances, they are expressed in terms of the speed of light.This method of measurement is defined as the distance a light beam travels in a certain amount of time. For example, expressing the distance to Alpha Centauri system as 4.3 light years (meaning light from there takes 4.3 years to reach the Earth) is much more comfortable than trying to say, write, type or remember it as a distance of 4.06802721 * 10^13 km.Isn\u2019t light brilliant?- I know, I didn\u2019t laugh either. Remember: True science is about experimentation and observation. If you use your brain to do some thinking, the world is at your feet. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming that you're having a microwave at home, you could measure the speed of light. Open the microwave and remove the rotating disc along with the washer. Take a flat microwave safe plate and shred a generous amount of cheese on the plate so that it has attained some height and width. You could use chocolate too but cheese works the best. Put the plate with the shredded cheese in the oven and turn on the microwave for a min or 30s until you can see slight melting taking place. Take the plate out and you will be able to see wavy patterns of cheese..or just bands of molten and partially molten cheese. Using a ruler measure the distance from the centre of one molten band to the next molten band and convert it into metres. Check the backside of the oven and you may see a sticker with oven specs. In that sticker they'll mention the frequency of the microwave else you could refer the catalogue, note it down. Convert the unit of that frequency into Hertz and multiply that with the measured distance and the value will be closer to the speed of light. Tah Dah..!!! You have now measured the speed of light at home. ",

            "answer_text": "It might just be possible if you can afford a very fast oscilloscope, a very fast pulsed laser and two fast phototubes: set up two mirrors as far apart as you can and align them as well as possible to get a \u201cbarbershop effect\u201d of images receding into the apparent distance. Then shine a CW laser (carefully!) into one side so that its reflections move gradually across the mirror; get as many reflections as you can without any overlap. This ought to give a net path length long enough to see (in the oscilloscope) a significant delay between the first phototube (which detects the light scattered from the aperture of the laser) and the second, which detects the pulse as it misses the mirror on the other edge. Not cheap. You might be able to chop a cheap laser with a Pockel cell and/or substitute avalanche photodiodes for the phototubes, but you still need a fast \u2018scope. ",
