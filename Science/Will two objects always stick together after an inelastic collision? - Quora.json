            "answer_text": "Any collision where the final and initial kinetic energies are unequal is said to be inelastic. [1] The two objects need not stick together for the collision to be inelastic. The collision of a tennis ball with the ground is inelastic: the ball loses velocity as it bounces back, and the earth gains a very small amount of kinetic energy (far too small to offset the loss). The case where the two objects stick together is said to be \u201cperfectly\u201d inelastic, because it dissipates the maximum amount of kinetic energy (that is, the final kinetic energy is as small as possible). [1] A collision in which the final kinetic energy exceeds the initial kinetic energy is also considered inelastic. Such collisions of macroscopic objects are uncommon, but are far more common among particles. ",

How firmly they are \u201cstuck\u201d together doesn\u2019t really matter, because they\u2019re not trying to move apart. ",
