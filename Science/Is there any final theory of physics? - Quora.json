            "answer_text": "Is there any final theory of physics? Not that I know of. But I think it\u2019s on the way. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called, but I think it\u2019s loosely based on William Kingdon Clifford\u2019s 1870 space theory of matter. Clifford said this: \u201cI hold in fact: (1) That small portions of space are in fact of a nature analogous to little hills on a surface which is on the average flat; namely, that the ordinary laws of geometry are not valid in them.(2) That this property of being curved or distorted is continually being passed on from one portion of space to another after the manner of a wave.(3) That this variation of the curvature of space is what really happens in that phenomenon which we call the motion of matter, whether ponderable or etherial.(4) That in the physical world nothing else takes place but this variation, subject (possibly) to the law of continuity\u201d. It\u2019s related to what Maxwell said when he was talking about displacement current in 1861: \u201clight consists of transverse undulations in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena\u201d. So maybe it should be called something simple like electromagnetic geometry. ",

Einstein, Stephen Hawking and others failed to find this theory. Why \u201cComplete Unified Theory\u201d not come to picture of all scientists ? The answer is given here.     ",
