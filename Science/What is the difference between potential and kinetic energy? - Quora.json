            "answer_text": "Great answers, so far. Let's think about energy, a bit.  Energy is the ability to do work. Energy is a force exerted over a distance.Energy is released when you oxidize (burn) stuff. Energy can be stored --- charging a battery, pumping water up a hill, or lifting a baseball over your head!   Energy can be transferred from one body to another: think of the mostly elastic collision of two billiard balls.  Energy can be converted from one form to another:     falling water --> spinning turbines --> electricity There are many units of Energy.Here are a few that are top of mind.  calories Calories (or kilocalories)Newton*Metres Foot * Pounds JoulesWatt*SecondskWatt*Hours BTUs  Energy is NOT Power - but they are closely related. Power captures how quickly you are generating/delivering/consuming energy. ++++++++++++++++++++++++ So what is kinetic energy ? It is energy embodied in the motion of a mass. The formula for kinetic energy is E = 1/2 m*v^2. In S.I units, this is kg * metres^2/sec^2. These units are readily convertible to any of the units in the previous list.  Potential energy is stored energy. An obvious example of potential energy is steam. Steam stores an incredible amount of energy per liquid mass. And when steam is allowed to condense, it releases that energy. Another,  less obvious example of potential energy is a baseball- held six feet off the ground. If you drop it, it will convert its potential energy (which is expressed as m * g * h) to kinetic energy as it falls. Both of these are forms of energy. They have the same basic units- though may be calculated entirely different ways. I hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Potential energy is when an object will move in the future and kinetic energy is when something is moving now. Because motion is easy to see, we understand kinetic energy fairly easily. Potential is a bit tougher. Let\u2019s look at a couple examples. Think of a beach ball floating in a river. Suddenly the river goes over a waterfall. When the ball is at the top of the falls, with open air and falling water below it, it has potential energy. It will begin falling at any second. How much potential energy it has depends on how far it could possibly fall. This is gravitational potential energy Another example is the pull thingie that launches the ball in an old style pinball machine. We pull the knob back and it compresses a spring. That compressed spring has elastic potential energy. As soon as we release the knob, the spring will expand and shoot the ball up into the machine, but as long as we hold that knob, we have potential energy. One way to tell a potential energy, is that it will depend on distance. For gravitational potential energy, that\u2019s the distance that an object could fall. For elastic potential energy, it\u2019s the distance that a spring is compressed (or stretched). Kinetic energy, since it\u2019s movement energy, depends on velocity. ",
