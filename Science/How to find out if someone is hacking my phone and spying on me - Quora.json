            "answer_text": "How to tell if your phone has been hacked ? There are Options Out There: 1. Spy Apps - Ways to know if your phone is hacked Before specifically discussing how to know if your phone is hacked, it makes sense to get into the different ways that this is even possible There are several different applications out there, known as spy apps, they give a person the ability to see virtually everything you do on your phone, including: Reading your text messagesHearing your phone callsKnowing your exact location.And more...This is why it is essential that you understand what you need to do. Spy apps are available in all of the different app stores, which makes it extremely easy for them to get on your phone There are ways to protect yourself: 1You should never let someone physically have possession of your phone.2The primary way for a person to get a spy app onto your phone is through them installing the program on your device.3Keep your phone with you at all times and choose a code that makes it difficult for people to get into your phone.It is also important that you regularly go through the applications on your phone. While some of these can be hidden, most are visible either through the processes or by viewing the application list itself. It is a good idea if you have an android device that you get of mobile security app that will detect malicious programs like this.If you have an iPhone, don\u2019t allow it to be jailbroken. This will help you to find this as well. 2. Phishing Using Messages Another major way that people are able to try to get into your phone is by using phishing programs. This is done by sending you some kind of message that automatically downloads a malicious app onto your phone so that they are able to determine what you are doing on your phone, view your information, and gain access to things you clearly don\u2019t want them to know. To stop this from occurring: It is always a good idea to recognize, and to never open attachments from people you don\u2019t know.If you are receiving something from someone that you know and don\u2019t expect something from them, check with them first before opening the message.Sometimes people have their accounts hacked and so it pays to check and make sure with them first. 3. SS7 Phone Vulnerabilities It was discovered about two years ago that there is a vulnerability in mobile networks throughout the world, referred to as SS7 That allows hackers to be able to look at your: Phone calls ( call logs, contact list, and recording calls)Read your text messagesTrack GPS locations without you knowingAnd some additional kinds of information and all they need is your mobile phone number.This may not seem like a big deal if you are a person who hasn\u2019t given your phone number out to a large number of people, but there are those who may try to access into your phone by trying to bypass this protocol.  4. Open Wi-Fi Networks and Charging Stations There are those who have gone to the extra measure to protect their phone, and they dare people saying there is no way that someone can hack my phone. The truth is that some of the most innocuous situations can open the door to hacking occurring. You actually are putting yourself in this kind of situation by connecting into strange Wi-Fi networks or even using a charging station at a home or business you are potentially opening the door for someone to gain access into your phone. All you\u2019re trying to do is get on the Internet or to charge her phone and before you know it somebody\u2019s got your information. This means that you should never charge your phone or use the Internet connectivity in a location unless you are absolutely sure that you can trust them. This is an important factor for everyone, because it does not take much for someone to be able to use an application once your phone is plugged into their system to be able to get your information.  5. And If I Am Hacked So what do you do if you want to know how to unhack your phone? You may look at this and say that you\u2019re sure that someone has gotten into your phone, so what do you do now? First, shut off all applications that look suspicious to you and run some kind of application that removes malicious software from your phoneThis may require a little expense on your part, but it will help to eliminate any kind of virus.You may also want to consult a professional that handles virus or malicious software removal, because this is a device you simply can\u2019t afford for others to be able to access.Thank you :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, if someone is tracking your mobile device, there are some warning signs which you can notice of. For example, you may need to pay attention to following cases: Your phone battery is draining fast.Obviously, if your phone has been spied, there must be a service running in the background to upload data, which means your phone is still working even if when you don't use it and leads to more battery consuming. You need to check which app or service consume the battery on your device. Luckily, now most of Android and iOS devices allow you to check detailed battery usage with build-in settings. Unknown app or service installed on your mobile device.If someone wants to track your smartphone, it's very likely that he/she needs to install some apps or services on your device. So if you find an app you don't recognize on your device, you can uninstall it. However, there are some apps are able to run on your device (especially Android devices) with stealthy mode, you may not find the app icon on the screen. In this case, please go to Settings > Apps > Installed Apps to find if there is a suspicious app. Your device gets hot when you are not using it.As we mentioned above, if a tracking app or service installed on your device, it needs to run in the background which resulted that your device is getting hot. There are some noises while talking.Basically, if your device was hacked by an app or service, it might record your calls and voices, so there are some noises while you were talking on the phone. If your device has no hardware issues but you found noises while talking, please check if your device has been tracking by others. Your Apple ID get locked often (iOS device).Apple was always focus on security of your device and data, as it improves the security level with the latest iOS version. Not only the Two-Factor Authentication, but also if you Apple ID logged in other place or entered the wrong passcode for times, it will prompt you to change your password or directly lock your Apple ID. So if you found your Apple ID gets locked often, pay attention to it. To stop others from spying your device, you can uninstall unknown apps, change device passcode and etc. And factory resetting is an ultimate option to prevent your device from being tracked without any doubt, but you should be noted that it will erase all your data as well, so I recommend you to use a backup tool like Syncios Manager to backup your device before doing this. For iOS devices, go to Settings>>General>>Reset>>Reset all settings and contents; And for Android device, go to Settings>>System>>Reset options>>Factory reset. Hope it helps. Reference. ",

If the person you see or hear is responding to what you say or do, then they are spying on you. Just as simple, when not actively using your phone, having it powered off with the microphone and camera covered, the battery pulled, and the entire device in an RF-field containment soundproof and lightproof bag ensures that someone is not using it to spy on you. For all other situations, one would need to perform a forensic investigation of your phone to determine hardware and software vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise. ",
