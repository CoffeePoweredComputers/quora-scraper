            "answer_text": "Scientific methodologies help us to learn about some features of the universe. They do not direct us to take particular actions, but when application of scientific methodologies produces new knowledge, that new knowledge can help in decision making. This help in not in the form of telling us what we ought to do or must do, because that starts with our individual moralities. E.g., we might be strongly inclined to reduce harm in factories. Scientific studies can help us understand the factors that are most likely to relate to such harm. Knowing this can inform our actions to reduce harm in factories, but for someone who doesn\u2019t care about such harm, the information doesn\u2019t matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, sort of. Those are matters of personal choice. The lessons of science, what is discovered by using the method, can inform those choices. For example, climate science tells us that increasing CO2 will increase average temperature, and botany tells us that increased average temperature will threaten plant survivals and impact crops. The decision on whether to take action to avoid (or perhaps accelerate) those pressures is a matter for society, not science. Other scientific data may point to eventual disaster for our species if we do not moderate our behaviour or our population growth, but it is the application of knowlege that will save us, not the acquisition of knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Does the scientific method inform us of what we ought to do? To paraphrase: Does the process of observation and experiment tell us what our duty is ? You use \u201cought\u201d, which is a word used in philosophy more than science. Perhaps you should ask the philosophers that question. My opinion is that observation and experiment can tell us a lot about the world and ourselves. But only rarely can it direct our actions in a satisfying way. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it does not. It may sometimes inform us of the consequences of what we do, but it is up to us to assign values to those consequences. Science says nothing about values, only about the way the world actually works. \u201cOught\u201d is an entirely value driven word, and science is an entirely fact driven study. ",
