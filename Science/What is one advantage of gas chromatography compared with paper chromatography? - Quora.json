            "answer_text": "Gas chromatography is a quite exact quantitative instrumental means of analysis, where the paper version is far slower and more of a qualitative analysis. The paper variety goes back beyond the 50s development of the first GC devices and was useful for learning the main types of constituents in a liquid mixture. The big advantage of GC is that it can be made quite exact and the instrumentation does most of the work. It is of course able to perform far more than just analyses of gases and it has become a very sophisticated and sensitive means of establishing the composition of a very wide variety of compounds. With proper selection of column types, it can also be used to establish the molecular type of compounds involved in an unknown sample. Combined wtih simple mass spectrometry, it has become a very valuable tool for the analytical chemist. ",

            "answer_text": "In a fair comparison we shall think of separating (by gas and paper chromatography) a mixture that is fully compatible with both techniques. Gas chromatography has orders of magnitude higher resolution power. This means that GC can separate two molecules that are very similar, with just a tiny difference somewhere in the molecule and, at the same time, it can differentiate dozens or even hundreds of other molecules. You can hardly get the same from PC. May be you can optimize your conditions so that the two similar molecules are separated, but this will always cause lots of other molecules to be poorly or not separated at all. If you like more than one advantage I can add that: GC is very suitable for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. PC instead is practically just qualitative. Quantitation is still possible, but it is cumbersome, time consuming and in general less affordable than with GC.GC can easily be automated. You add an auto-sampler to your GC, load dozens of samples, start the sequence and go home. Next morning you come back to find all your analytical results ready. Though possible in theory, there is no commercial device that allows for automated PC.GC can easily detect traces of molecules in the order of ppb (parts per billion) in a sample. In practice, PC can hardly give results even with samples that are one thousand times more concentrated. With GC your problem is sometimes that of diluting your sample to perform an analysis. This is way easier, and introduces less errors, than concentrating a sample to be analyzed by PC.GC detectors offer much wider choice than PC. In addition to a couple of almost \u201cuniversal\u201d detectors that \u201csee\u201d any kind of molecule, a gas chromatograph is easily fitted with highly specific detectors that only detect specific classes of molecules (e.g. halogenated molecules) with superior detection limits. This allows a tremendous advantage when analyzing certain molecules.",
