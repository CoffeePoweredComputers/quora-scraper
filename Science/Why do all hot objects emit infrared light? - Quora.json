            "answer_text": "Well... do all hot objects really emit infrared light? Let's start with the concept of an ideal blackbody: an object that absorbs all light 100% at all frequencies. According to Kirchoff's law of radiation, it means that the object also emits light with maximum efficiency at all wavelengths. How much light? Well, that is actually determined by Planck's law of blackbody radiation, which provides a curve, parameterized by the object's temperature, that tells you how much radiation it would emit at various wavelengths. Right there though, this should also tell you that another ideal body, a perfect whitebody, which reflects all light with 100% efficiency, will not emit any light at all even when it is hot! The same goes for objects that are perfectly transparent. But these are all idealized cases. Real objects are between these two extremes; but some emit, e.g., infrared radiation more efficiently than others. But okay, here is the underlying question: why do hot objects emit light (electromagnetic radiation) at all? Or (really the same question, as per Kirchoff's law above) why do they absorb light? And the reason is that everyday objects are made of particles that carry electric charge and interact with the electromagnetic field. If we could somehow make an object from particles (e.g., neutrinos) that do not interact with light at all, the resulting object would not emit any light at all, no matter how hot. And it would be completely transparent to all light. And here is another thing... objects emit not just light when they are hot. There is another long range force with which the atoms of all objects interact: gravitation. So take a hot object like the Sun. The Sun is almost like a perfect blackbody, emitting electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths, centered around visible light (no surprise that our eyes evolved to see in these wavelengths.) In total, the Sun radiates light at a power of something like 400 quintillion (18 more zeroes) megawatts. Now here is the interesting thing: The Sun is also believed to emit thermal gravitational radiation. But because the interaction between matter particles and gravity is so much weaker, the emitted radiation is a lot less powerful. In total, the Sun radiates gravitational radiation at a measly 79 megawatts. ",

            "answer_text": "Objects maintain the heat through the vibrations of their atoms or molecules. Because of the vibrations, the electrons on the atoms or molecules move with acceleration. Moving of a charged particle with acceleration produces electromagnetic waves. Thus, an object which has a temperature of greater than zero Kelvin, radiates electromagnetic waves. A blackbody is a theoretical object that absorbs all the electromagnetic waves that fall onto it (that is why it is black) and its radiation in a specific wavelength is related with only its temperature. In other words, if we know the temperature of it, we know how it radiates and it will help us to understand the answer of the question. Radiation of a blackbody (which has a specific temperature) is calculated with using Planck\u2019s Black Body Radiation Formula and it is a curve just like the curves in the graph below.  The first important point about the curves is the object radiates in all wavelengths but their radiation decreases when the wavelength goes to zero and goes to infinity. The peak values of the curves are in the infrared region. Radiation in the infrared region can be called as infrared light. The second important point is the hotter object has more radiation in all wavelengths. Another important point is the finding of the peak points of the curves. Its location is calculated with using Wien\u2019s Displacement Law: [math]\\lambda \\approx \\frac{3000}{T}[/math] where [math]\\lambda[/math] is in micrometers and [math]T[/math] is in Kelvin. The region for infrared light in the electromagnetic spectrum is defined between 100 and 0.7 micrometers. So, using the formula, you can see that for an object which has temperature between 30 and 4000 Kelvin, it radiates in all the wavelengths but its radiation focuses in the infrared region and while it is becoming hotter, it radiates more in all wavelengths.
