            "answer_text": "I assume that since you asked on Quora, you would like the real answer and not the one they teach in school. This is a very good question, because a flat specular mirror reflects all colors of light, and a roughened up metal such as sand-blasted aluminum reflects all colors of light and the reflection is diffuse, so why doesn\u2019t it look white? So, reflecting all colors is not enough to make \u201cwhite\u201d and a rough surface is not enough to make \u201cwhite\u201d so what actually is white? Most people completely misunderstand white. They have been taught that there are specular reflections (from polished metals such as a mirror or from polished dielectrics such as glass) and diffuse reflections from other objects with rough surfaces such as white paper.  Specular reflection from Mirror  \u201cDiffuse reflection\u201d from a white-painted wall The second part is completely wrong. True diffuse reflections occur from the back side of aluminum foil (the side that is not polished) or from sand-blasted metals. Yet, for some reason, we do not recognize them as \u201cwhite.\u201d   Actual diffuse reflections. Foil is only partly roughened, radiator is more roughened. The angular characteristics of reflections from a rough surface are not what we call \u201cwhite\u201d even though it reflects all colors of visible light the same as white does. Objects that we think of as white are not reflecting much at all. \u201cDiffuse reflection\u201d is a gross simplification based on imperfect understanding or invented to make it easier to teach in grade school.  Incorrect explanation of specular and diffuse reflection. This figure implies that the diffuse reflection of most objects occurs at the surface. The diffuse \u201creflection\u201d for most objects is actually subsurface. In actual white objects, light is actually refracting (and reflecting) through extremely large numbers of small prisms or droplets of dielectric materials. Good examples are (1) a cloud of water droplets (2) a bowl of sugar crystals (3) a layer of snow. [Look carefully and all that is there in a \u201cwhite\u201d material is a lot of clear transparent refracting surfaces.] Most of the light is refracted around randomly and eventually some of it after several refractions and reflections comes back in your direction. The same is true in a glass of milk, in white paint, and in white paper.  More accurate depiction of white diffuse \u201csurfaces\u201d but the refraction part is not shown, only secondary reflections from within the volume of the material. Note that the \u201cvolume\u201d can be only a few thousandths of an inch thick as in the case of paint. I tried drawing all the refractions and reflections but the diagram got too crowded with light \u201crays\u201d to understand. This is why white paper looks fundamentally different from the rough surface of aluminum foil\u2019s back side. \u201cWhite\u201d is not the result of light reflecting from a rough surface. That is a myth that absolutely must be dispelled when accurately modeling how light \u201creflects\u201d from different objects. If you don\u2019t realize what\u2019s really going on, you end up modeling white objects that look like roughened aluminum foil and colored objects that look like colored foil. White only slightly darkens at shallow angles, a rough reflective surface darkens dramatically at shallow angles.  Typical model used for white objects. It gives the wrong answer. This model actually applies to sand-blasted metal, but not white objects Most objects that we actually see in daily life are not rough \u201csurfaces.\u201d Light actually penetrates into the volume of the object. Human skin is a prime example. It was so misunderstood that early CGI movies made it look like plastic. [Note: In the comments, this statement about CGI is refuted. Apparently some CGI professionals were well aware of subsurface scatter, unlike an animator on Shrek who was interviewed during the making of Shrek the Third.] Skin actually has more depth and volume to it. We find the appearance of subsurface scatter pleasing. Almost all paints (except metal paints) involve much more volume scattering than reflection from a rough surface. Many paints form a glossy dielectric surface over a volumetrically scattering body. This gives two different types of \u201creflections\u201d from the same object, which we call a diffuse component and a specular component. The top dielectric layer provides a Fresnel reflection from its surface that can be very smooth (high gloss) or less smooth (semi-gloss, satin, eggshell) or almost non-existent (flat.) The large fraction of the light transmitted into the lower layers of the paint experiences volume scattering due to particles of different refractive index being suspended in a clear paint base. The reflection from the top layer will generally be full spectrum while the diffuse reflection from the volume will be affected by the dyes or pigments added to the paint (it will be colored). The top layer reflection will also be polarized according to the Fresnel reflection equations, while the volume scattered light will be mostly random polarization. (Note that even air bubbles in a clear liquid will appear as white.)  Schematic diagram of two types of white paint. We actually spend a lot of time developing paints that have more than usual volumetric scattering because it \u201cadds depth\u201d to the appearance of the object. Think of \u201cpearl\u201d or \u201cmetal flake\u201d or \u201copalescent\u201d paints on cars. (I am ignoring the diffraction properties here to avoid getting too technical for people who don\u2019t think interference is very relevant to this discussion.) To really get to your question of why a white object looks completely different from a mirror, you have to understand (and look) a little deeper than the simple idea of \u201creflection\u201d from a rough surface. Most of what we see can not be explained as reflections from rough surfaces, because that is not what actually happens unless you live in a tin foil world.  A rough surface has masking and shadowing because the peaks and valleys get in the way of the reflections particularly at shallow angles.  Shadowing and masking. Note the directions of the arrows. This is why rough metal surfaces behave so differently from what we call white objects. Rough diffuse surfaces get much darker at shallow angles of incidence than white objects, because white objects do not reflect light from a surface, but actually diffuse light through a volume (even if that volume is only a thousandth of an inch thick). Shadowing and masking play an insignificant role for volume scattering materials.  White painted radiator looks different from a simple rough surface reflection of metallic radiator shown above.

            "answer_text": "I found the following on the internet from a portion of a response from MIT to a similar question. White surfaces are composed of molecules or atoms that don\u2019t absorb any of the visible colors of light; our eyes perceive this reflected combination as the color white. But doesn\u2019t a mirror also reflect all the colors of light? Why doesn\u2019t the surface of a mirror appear white, rather than reflecting images into our eyes? The answer, rests in part on the penetration by light. A mirror is essentially a plate of glass coated with a thin film of metal, such as silver. At the atomic scale, metals are a crystal network of atoms whose outermost electrons dissociate and wander with high mobility through the network. These mobile \u201cconduction\u201d electrons are the source of electrical conductivity in metals, and when light attempts to penetrate a metal, they \u201cvibrate in such a way\u201d that an opposing electrical field is created, canceling the electric field of light and prohibiting any of its colors from entering beyond a few atomic layers. When that occurs, the light has been effectively reflected from the surface of the metal. In addition, the smoothness of a mirror\u2019s glass and metal coating ensure that this surface reflection is specular, says Livingston. As a result, rays of light bounce \u201clike tennis balls,\u201d, always maintaining an angle of reflection to the mirror\u2019s surface, that matches in value the rays\u2019 angle of incidence. Rays of light originating from a person\u2019s ear, nose, and eyebrow, will \u201creflect with the same angle\u201d off a smooth mirror surface and maintain their relative orientation, thus preserving the image that our eyes will perceive. White surfaces can reflect a considerable amount of light, but without the mobile electrons to oppose the electric field of light, white surfaces allow light to penetrate up to several wavelengths. This allows them to experience multiple reflections from crystal grains and other irregularities within the structure of the surface. Some multiple-reflected light can reemerge from the material surface, but without the same orientation, as that which reflects off a mirror. Surface roughness, Livingston says, also contributes \u201cdiffuse reflection,\u201d causing the rays of light from different parts of a potential image to \u201cbounce back at different angles.\u201d Multiple and diffuse reflections scatter the reflecting rays, and all information about the image is lost. White paint or a piece of paper are classic examples of light scattering, he notes, as are clouds, the foam in your glass of beer, and snow. These latter examples are turbulent or irregular structures, containing \u201clots of air,\u201d which causes \u201clight [to] reflect off internal and external surfaces\u201d and scatters the rays of an image. It is striking to consider, Livingston adds, how a still pool of water may serve as a poor mirror. Yet, when the same water crystallizes into irregularly packed snow flakes, multiple and diffuse light reflection results in a white surface. ",
