            "answer_text": "Not an expert on BBT but what I understand is that the initial state has some vague hand waving argument, was as dense as a singularity, whatever that may mean. Space time, for reasons unknown, began expanding faster than C, while the singularity like universe began collapsing at C or less, so the universe expands and in spite of obtaining lots and lots of energy from the expanding space time, looses energy from expansion, and cools. Descriptions of this using physics we sort of understand seem to match up with a little bit of data. First, we do not know how this stuff got into it\u2019s initial state. Second, we do not know how the expansion of space-time started, slowed, or even why it is there at all. Third, gravity, quantum, chemistry, astrophysics, etc., et al., is oddly describable using relatively simple maths, and surprisingly within a narrow range of parameters necessary to get from the BB to us. Why this is so is describable as (chance like selection AKA rolling 1E35 craps in a row, no breaks.) vs (it was done on purpose, ie., God). Note that this is not an argument for the existence of God, but that if there is a creator God, the current BBT does not \u201crequire\u201d Him but does have a place for him. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t - and you\u2019re deluding yourself if you think that you do. The usual argument used by creationists is that the big bang model says that the universe popped into existence from nothing, but that, of course, is a bald faced lie. That is, in fact the exact opposite of what the big bang model says. What the big bang model says - and literally 100% of the evidence supports - is that 13.77 billion years ago, everything we see in the visible universe was in the same spot at the same time, and that therefore the early universe was almost infinitely dense and hot. Nothingness, obviously, has no density at all, nor temperature. Nothingness, by definition, can\u2019t have any properties at all. That said, it was nothing at all like a volcano. More like what happens when water changes phases from liquid, to gas. ",
