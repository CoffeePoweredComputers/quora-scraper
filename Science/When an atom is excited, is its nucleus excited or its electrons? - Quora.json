            "answer_text": "Typically what this means is that the electrons are temporarily occupying higher energy orbitals. That is to say that their orbits are further away from the nucleus. This means there\u2019s a greater distance between two particles of opposite charge. Which means more stored energy. It\u2019s tempting to say \u201cokay, well then it\u2019s the electrons that are excited\u201d. But as Newton so succinctly put it in his 3rd law of motion, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Notably here he was talking about orbits! He was saying that while the orbiting body of smaller mass is moved by the orbiting body of greater mass, so to is the greater mass body moved by the smaller mass - and in fact, to an exactly equal degree! It\u2019s just that the heavier one has more mass so it accelerates more slowly. Nonetheless - it\u2019s inertia changes by the same amount. So you see it may be more proper to say that both the electron and the nucleus are excited. Or you could just say the whole atom is. Or that the orbital interaction between the two is. It may be simpler just to understand what is happening physically here - that one or more electrons have jumped to a higher orbital. ",

            "answer_text": "An astounding result occurs when copper metal is held within a really hot flame. The colour of the flame begins to change colour to a bright green! What causes the colour change of the flame? The reason for the unique colour is easy to understand if you learn a few facts about an interesting concept known as excited states. Before excited states can be defined, some basic concepts from atomic structure require some explanation.Atoms, the simplest whole unit of matter, consist of a positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom that is made of subatomic particles, positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged subatomic particles called electrons. The electrons do not just move around randomly, but they occupy specific regions known as energy shells. Within the energy shells, the electrons can be found within cloud-like regions called orbitals. The electrons that are found in the outermost occupied orbitals of an atom, known as valence electrons, do not always remain in the same orbital or energy level, as they are able to absorb energy from heat or light. When a valence electron absorbs energy, it enters what is known as an excited state. The excited state can commonly take the form of the electron jumping from its original energy level or orbital, also known as theground state, to an empty orbital of a higher energy shell that is further away from the nucleus. The excited electron does not stay in the excited state permanently, however, and eventually falls back to the ground state. When the electron falls from the excited state, it loses energy in the form of light, a process called emission. The excitation of electrons followed by the emission of green light explains the green flame from the previous example heated of copper ",
