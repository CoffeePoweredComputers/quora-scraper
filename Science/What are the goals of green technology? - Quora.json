            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t a specific set of rules. Sustainability, meaning things that can be done without depleting natural resources, clean, meaning not poisoning people, animals, plants or places where anything living might be desired in the future. You asked about \u201ctechnology\u201d which either includes or excludes a huge area of sustainable agriculture and forest management, depending on whether you mean the equipment itself, or just knowledge about the living things and what they require. I\u2019m tempted to say that green technology is a direction, not a place. But often, where you want to go isn\u2019t as important as where you are starting the journey from. We all know that fossil fuels are responsible for a large share of climate change, but many of us forgot that fossil fuels are also responsible for killing a million people worldwide every year, and sending 100 million people to doctors\u2019 offices. That was easier to forget when there was no economic alternative. But now that solving climate change is cheaper than not solving it, we need to remind ourselves that this several months of clear skies due to the virus and lockdowns is not just pretty. It is also critical to the health of a lot of people. Green technology ultimately means all technology where unsustainable impacts can be identified, and alternatives are available. Not all possible green technology will be adopted, and we will have some disagreements on which alternative is greener. I do expect that once we are on the path to ending fossil fuels the world\u2019s perspective on environmental protection will shift because all the new jobs and economic growth will give people a more rational sense of how it all fits together.

            "answer_text": "As an incomplete technology, it searches for expensive solutions and actially goes against nature in doing so. Getting something for nothing is not natures way! Batteries do not solve this problem. Neither do any other technologies underestimating the immense power of oceans at times that destroy their generators. Neither do weather systems that control both solar and wind power..Only stored carbon energy in forms that release and change chemical organic material can we control this energy. The argument that it pollutes is due to increased uncontrolled populations centred around these power sources. Those that push these incomplete technologies are lacking truth and should be shamed. Tesla had the right answer in technology but environmental \u201csolutions\u201d can only reduce stored carbon based energy at high duplication costs. No one in their right minds can fully depend on supporting our planetary population with green technology! Nature does not work that way\u2026 ",

A tall order. That explains why Tesla, the leading developer of these concepts, spends as much time developing grid-scale batteries as it does developing solar energy collection techniques\u2014and electric vehicles that can use energy from whatever source derived.
