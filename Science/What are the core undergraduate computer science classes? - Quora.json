            "answer_text": "This question is bound to bring out all kinds of interesting bias; for all the discussions I've managed to participate in and survey, the question of what computer science exactly amounts to doesn't bring out any wonderful consensus even among computer scientists. That includes myself, so I will stop at stating an opinion. I've tried to sort it on a scale in order of descending math and ascending electronics (arguably, comp.sci. lives somewhere in the intersection): Because of its role as the science of computation: algorithms and data structures. This continues into the study of mathematical logic, computability, and the theory of complexity. Because of its role as the science of calculators: calculus and analytic geometry, leading into numerical methods, integration and finite differences in time. Because of its role as the science of computers: computer construction (component-wise), networking (internet-wise), computer architecture (processor level), and interconnection networks (architecturally speaking, Not Small Internets, really). Because of its role as the science of generally applied software execution devices: programming langauges, compilers, operating systems, embedded systems, digital design, electric circuits. I think this is (more than) a basis which can go far, and quite a study if all 4 points are taken to their ultimate conclusion in open questions and research work. I'm open to criticism that I've left out the methods of software engineering, usability, verification, systems engineering, and all sorts of other useful stuff. I'd counter that I've also left out my own field of performance modeling, as it is, in a sense, a matter of applied statistics more than core computer science. A core undergrad curriculum can't cover all this still. Given, say, 8 classes, I would slice the topmost elements from these lists into algorithms and data structuresmathematical logiccalculus and analytic geometrycomputer constructionnetworkingprogramming languagesoperating systemsdigital designand expand as appropriate. Without application areas, computer science sort of descends into mathematics and philosophy, but putting in my favorite application areas isn't going to answer what the undegrad core is. So there you have my proposed list of unavoidables, biased as it maybe. ",
