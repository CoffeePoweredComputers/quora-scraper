            "answer_text": "Extremely rarely. Almost all neutron stars that have ever formed are still here. Most neutron stars have lasted for billions of years. The exceptions are those younger than that. Nearly all black holes result from core collapse in stars too big to form neutron stars. They are often called failed supernovas, because the core bounce fails to produce an explosion. The outgoing shock stalls and then reverses, so that nearly all of the star falls into the newly formed black hole. Larger black holes form from mergers of smaller ones, as LIGO and other gravitational wave observatories have seen. It is possible for a neutron star in a binary system with a supergiant companion to accrete matter from the other star, and go over the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkhov limit, at which point it will collapse into a black hole.It is possible for two neutron stars in a binary system to merge and form a black hole. LIGO and VIRGO have observed such an event in gravitational waves. It is not certain whether the result was a very large neutron star or a very small black hole, but we expect to find others with clearer results.It is possible for a neutron star to fall into a supergiant star, and migrate to its center, forming a Thorne-Zhitkov object. There is then a very thin layer in which matter fuses, turns to neutrons, and accretes to the body of the neutron star over millions of years. The accreting matter releases enough energy to hold up the rest of the star during that time. At some point, the neutron star can collapse to a black hole, and the remainder of the star surrounding it will form a very large accretion disk before most of it gradually falls in and some is thrown out in polar jets.It is possible for some other object such as a white dwarf to run into a neutron star, and provide enough matter to push it over the limit. Or maybe not. Maybe the white dwarf would go supernova at that point.",

            "answer_text": "A supernova results in either a neutron star (between 1.4 and 3 solar masses), a quark star(about 3 solar masses), or a black hole(greater than 3 solar masses), which is the remaining collapsed core of the star. During a supernova, most of the stellar mass is blown off into space, forming elements heavier than iron which cannot be generated through stellar nucleosynthesis, because beyond iron, the star requires more energy to fuse the atoms than it gets back. During the supernova collapse, the atoms in the core break up into electrons, protons and neutrons. In the case that the supernova results in a neutron star core, the electrons and protons in the core are merged to become neutrons, so the newly born 20-km-diameter neutron star containing between 1.4 and 3 solar masses is like a giant atomic nucleus containing only neutrons.If the neutron star's mass is then increased, neutrons become degenerate, breaking up into their constituent quarks, thus the star becomes a quark star; a further increase in mass results in a black hole. When you talk about a black hole with a stable mass (at least 3 solar masses), it is good to consider that they come in 4 flavors: rotating-charged, rotating-uncharged, non-rotating-charged, non-rotating-uncharged. What we would see visually during the transformation would be a hard radiation flash. This is because during the collapse, the particles on/near the surface have time to emit hard radiation as they break up before going into the event horizon; so this could be one of the causes of gamma ray bursts (GRBs).We know that atoms break up into protons, neutrons, electrons under pressure. Under more pressure, protons and electrons combine into neutrons. Under even more pressure, neutrons break down into quarks. Under still more pressure, perhaps quarks break down into still smaller particles. (Not really proved, but theories suggest they break down into smaller articles) Ultimately the smallest particle is a string: open or closed loop, and has a Planck length, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than a quark. if a string is magnified so it is 1 millimeter in length, then a proton would have a diameter that would fit snugly between the Sun and Epsilon Eridani, 10.5 light years away; that's how big a proton is compared to a string, so you can imagine there are perhaps quite a few intermediate things between quarks and strings. A string is pure energy and Einstein said mass is just a form of energy, so the collapse into a black hole really breaks down the structure of energy that gives the appearance of mass/matter/baryonic particles, and leaves the mass in its most simple form, open or closed strings, that is, pure energy bound by gravity. We know that black holes (which are not really holes or singularities, as they do have mass, radius, rotation, charge and hence density, which varies with radius) can evaporate, giving up their entire mass in the form of radiation, thus proving they are actually energy. Evaporation of a black hole occurs if its mass is below the minimum mass of a stable black hole, which is 3 solar masses; the Schwarzschild radius equation even tells you what the radius of a black hole is given its mass, and vice versa. Coming back to the question , a simple way for a neutron star to become more massive in order to be able to turn into a black hole is to be part of a binary system, where it is close enough to another star that the neutron star and its binary pair orbit each other, and the neutron star siphons off gas from the other star, thus gaining mass. Something like this -  So you could transform anything you want, such as your pencil, into a black hole if you wanted to, and could compress it into the required size for it to become a black hole; it is just that it would immediately transform itself (evaporate) completely into a flash of hard radiation, because a pencil is less than the stable black hole mass (3 solar masses).

            "answer_text": "When a giant star dies, it may shrink into a black hole, or collapse into a dense Neutron Star . But there are other, more bizarre possibilities. Here are examples of some of the stars that have been discovered that make black holes very boring. Before we begin with strange stars, we may have to look at the stars we already know. Regular stars are very large objects of luminous plasma, mostly composed of hydrogen and also contain other elements in different quantities. The size of the stars varies slightly, from small red pygmies to large blue giants, to medium-sized yellow balls like the sun, but inside the stars look very similar. When these stars reach the end of its life it gets one of two things, the middle and small stars enter a short phase of expansion, then turn into a white dwarf, the pale crust of the original star may remain for countless times. But if the star is massively large, it will explode into a larger supernova, then collapse on itself into a neutron star, which can later turn into a black hole. Our friend (Neutron Star) In order to understand the stars that we will talk about now, we must first know a little about the neutron star. The name of these stars suits them more than people think, most of these stars consist of neutrons, although some other particles are also present. The current model suggests an outer layer of ordinary atoms surrounded by free electrons. When we dig deeper into the star, we find nuclei containing protons and neutrons, which usually contain neutrons far more than protons. And when we get deeper, we find a mixture of free neutrons, nuclei, free electrons, and in the center of the star ... Well, we really do not know this part yet. The essential thing is that the neutron star is formed when the force of gravity is strong enough to fill an article with a star material in a ball just twenty miles (32 km). In this enormous density the material begins to develop a new dissolution, and this is the neutron material that we see in the neutron star. When the density is so intense that the neutron material does not bear it, the star collapses completely to form a singularity of a black hole. This was fairly simple. But what if there were other types of stars or compact stars that could be formed in a period between the neutron star and the black hole? In any case, until a compact star turns into a black hole, its mass must be 10 times the mass of the sun (or 10 solar masses), but the Neutron Star is the certainty of any merged star of between 1.5 and 3 solar masses. Now, what about all the stellar remains that are between 3 to 10 solar masses? Here strange things start to appear. Let's start the strangeness: Quark Stars the reason why Neutron Star are able to withstand massive gravitational forces due to massive density is a quantum factor known as degeneracy pressure. Simply put, in this case the material reaches so great a density that the only thing that keeps the molecules of the element separate is that the laws of quantum mechanics prevent the molecules from occupying the same quantum state. Because neutrons are much smaller than atoms, they can be trapped in a very narrow space in the neutron star. On the contrary, it is impossible to do this even with the most matrices. But what if the Neutron Star reached a point where it was impossible to squeeze more? Here neutrons may begin to disintegrate their constituent parts, known as Quarks this is just a theory. Neutrons originally consist of three quarks; one is up and two are down. Some of these lower quarks may later turn into heavier quarks, and the final output of the quark mixture is known as the strange matter, which takes its name from these particles. So, if this virtual star has only upper and lower quarks, it is a \"Quark Star.\" If strange quarks are mixed with it, it is a \"Strange Star.\" But are any of these stars actually exist? The problem from a hypothetical point of view is that we do not know the equations governing the method of neutron decay and quark decomposition, so we can not know the truth for sure. So far, we know that there are two neutron-starred stars that closely resemble the stars of the quark, the neutron star closest to Earth RX J1856.5-3754, which is about 150 light-years away. It is only 7 miles (11 km) long and very small compared to the model.The standard of neutron star formation, is too small to be interpreted as a neutron star. And the other neutron star 3C58, which has a very high cooling rate, and also this rate is outside the range of temperatures that the neutron star is supposed to be able to afford. These two stars were placed as primary candidates to be quark stars, although most scientists are not willing to accept the presence of such objects because of the apparent irregularity of these two stars only. We come back to the problem again and one of the reasons is lack of knowledge; we have not yet known the limits that determine what the neutron star to be, so we do not know definitively whether these stars stars non-neutron or not. Based on current information, it is very logical to allow some extreme neutron stars instead of inventing a whole new type to accommodate these extremes. However, there are few signs that give the possibility of having quark stars. If Neutron Star actually collapse into Quark Star, such an event will not pass unnoticed, in fact it will probably bring the most intense explosions in the universe, and an explosion like this might produce about (10 powers of 47)rounds of energy. In fact, there are some ideas that the greatest gamma radiation observed was due to these stellar transformations. The collapse of a Neutron Star to a Quark Star is known as Quark-Nova. There are a number of recent supernova explosions that are likely to be volcanic eruptions. For example, in the SN 2006gy, a 150-solar star exploded 238 light-years away and produced about (10 powers of 45) joules of energy. It is possible that this explosion was not for the star itself, but for the resulting neutron star that was in the phase of sudden transformation into a Quark Star. There is also the supernova SN1987A, which was unusually bright, and no neutron star left behind, although all current models suggest that it should have one. One of the theoretical possibilities is that the star center collapsed into a Quark Star, but this is just one theory. These are also examples of the supernovae SN2005gj and SN2005ap, which were so bright that astronomers suggested that they could actually be Quarks. Eventually the black holes reached a turning point in their supporting evidence and were easily accepted, as well as the stars could be the Quark one day. There is also a part of the practical addition to the acceptance of such objects, namely that the presence of asteroid stars can explain some of the missing dark matter. Let us delve deeper: The Brion Stars We can also take the idea of decomposition a step further and wonder what happens to the material when it is so tightly chunky that particles can not remain separate from each other. There are two possibilities for this. The first and most acceptable is that gravity swallows everything and breaks the particles into an infinite density, which is a Black Hole. But there is another more unusual idea. Neutrons are composite particles made up of quarks ... What if quarks were originally composite particles made up of other elementary particles? If this is true, then a sufficiently dense star from a Quark Star to a Prion Star, consisting of sub-sub-subatomic prions, can be produced. It is suggested that prions are point-like objects that are the basic component of all other objects, and the different structures of the prions will give you any kind of particles and will explain all the values and properties of the large objects. This is an elegant theory, but it is opposed to the standard form of physics directly, which in turn has done an excellent job of explaining the nature of the universe, but leaving some blanks to discover later. And now with something very different: the Bozonian Stars Up to this point, all the stars we have discussed are made up of primions - at least in their infancy - the family of particles to which electrons, protons, neutrons and quarks belong. But what if the other group of particles, bosons, could be stars? Most known bosons carry the forces of the universe, such as the electromagnetic force that carries photons, or the powerful force that carries the gluons. However, it is very convincing to have a type of boson that can form its own substance. For the boson to be able to be stable and a small mass, none of the current bosons are compatible with this rule, but they are among the theoretical possibilities. If this type of boson exists, it will be enough to be a Bozonian Star. If there are any Bozonian Stars somewhere, the most likely place to hide is the center of the galaxies. In particular, we may find Bozonian Stars in galaxies that have active galactic nuclei, which are much more luminous Hungarian centers than can be expected, and can contain Bozonian Stars at their center. What's left now? Little remains in fact. We looked for some potential destinies for giant stars that did not involve turning them into Black Holes, but all these possibilities assume at least that black holes exist. There is some cosmic science that opposes the presence of black holes, and says that there are other more strange bodies waiting to be replaced. Gravastars, fuzzballs and magnetospheric Eternally Collapsing Objects .) Finally, if I will have a chance to live another life I will choose to be a star. See how the stars die \u2764\ufe0f    And here they born \u2764\ufe0f    Notes: (Supernova) is a type of explosive star and an expression of several massive star explosions in which the star extrudes its space at the end of its life, leading to a spherical cloud around the star (too bright) of the plasma , The energy of the blast bursts into space and turns into invisible objects in a matter of weeks or months. The center of the star collapses toward the center, either white dwarf or turns into a neutron star, depending on the mass of the star. A solar mass may turn into a black hole without exploding in a larger supernova. Degeneracy pressure: When framions, such as protons, electrons or neutrons, become very dense under the influence of gravity - for example, in a star - resulting in gravitational pressure, this pressure from the very dense material is called \"decomposition pressure\". The reason for the emergence of this pressure lies in the principle of the exclusion of Pauli, which prevents the Fermionin to occupy the same place and the same quantum state. Quark is an elementary particle and one of the main components of matter in the theory of the standard model of particle physics (the other component of this theory is the Liptons) have a mass but zero dimensions, which are observed when a collision between the proton and electron. The quarks have six types and are called: the upper, the lower, the charm, the strange, the top, and the bottom. Active Galactic Nuclus: A region in the center of galaxies that has an extraordinary luminosity in the electromagnetic spectrum that extends from radio waves through infrared, visible light and ultraviolet rays to X-rays and gamma rays.

            "answer_text": "Neutron stars can be thought of as a collection of giant synchrotrons: circular particle accelerators which radiate light. In the case of a type of neutron star called a pulsar, the electrons and protons within the star circulate asymmetrically and send out pulses of light out into space. At least, this is the story that we tell ourselves about the pulsed light which Jocelyn Bell discovered emerging from outer space. The process of a neutron star turning into a black hole would involve the speed with which the charged particles circulate around the star increasing until the particles are moving at the speed of light. For this to happen, the size of the star has to shrink without energy loss or you have to add mass to the star. But how does this picture mesh with descriptions of gravity and inertia as the result of a collective, coherent oscillation or (equivalently) an accelerating expansion of space? If the protons and electrons are all moving radially in and out in a breathing motion, radiating light waves which add up to create the gravitational field around the star, then an increase in gravitational field would correspond to a faster radial oscillation. Stronger gravity would also cause faster rotation and a smaller radius. A movement towards a smaller radius gives an inward kick to the radial oscillation which would increase the energy of the oscillation and thereby increase the strength of the gravitational field, and so on until the whole thing collapses in on itself. I didn\u2019t mention synchroton radiation tangential to the circulating motion. That would be an important mechanism for removing energy from the system and the degree to which this happens seems to be open to debate. It is a nice story and one can also tell it in terms of electron degeneracy pressure and Ehrenfest\u2019s paradox. After writing this description, I wonder if it is not a plain-language echo of the idea that Hawking radiation has a backreaction effect which increases the energy density at the event horizon and causes black holes to evaporate before they have a chance to form. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1525v1.pdf With this perspective, when a red giant bubble pops you either end up with a droplet of jiggling liquid (a neutron star or white dwarf) or nothing. You don\u2019t end up with a singularity which persists for an eternity. Just food for thought.  National Schools' Observatory ",

            "answer_text": "Stars are held up - and are stable due to the balance between gravity and internal pressures generated due to the fusion reaction. Towards the end of their life, smaller stars collapse into white dwarf stars, where they are held up by the electron degeneracy pressure. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons with the same spin can occupy the same energy state in the same volume. After the lowest energy level is filled, the other electrons are forced into higher and higher energy states with the result, they travel at progressively higher speeds. These high speed electrons create a pressure known as 'degenerate electron pressure' which is capable of supporting a star! Spin and the Pauli Exclusion Principle While white dwarfs are supported against gravitational collapse, there is an upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf at 1.40 solar masses, known as the Chandrasekhar Limit named after Subramaniam Chandrasekhar (1910-1995) the famous Indian born American astrophysicist who derived it. The limit arises due to the physics of electron degeneracy. As the mass of a white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, gravity attempts to squeeze the star into a smaller volume, forcing electrons to occupy higher energy states and attain faster velocities. At this limit, the pressure exerted by the electrons travelling at close to the speed of light is not sufficient to support the star, and so the white dwarf collapses into a much denser state - a neutron star. Neutron stars are very small - typically with a radius of only about 10 kilometres, but super dense \u2013 they produce gravitational fields comparable to that of black holes. Neutron Stars: Definition & Facts According to latest research, neutron stars have an upper limit to their mass, at 2.16 solar masses beyond which they too collapse to become quark stars . According to theory, when a neutron star is put under sufficient pressure either from its own gravity or the initial pressure that created it, the neutrons break down into quarks - forming what is known as quark matter. However, this is only a hypothesis. Afterall, neutrons are made of quarks, therefore it is theorized that the degeneracy pressure keeping the quarks apart within the neutrons might break down in much the same way, creating an ultra-dense phase of degenerate matter based on densely packed quarks. However, scientists are not yet certain whether or not it actually happens in reality. Finally, if the mass exceeds 2.16 solar masses, the star literally disappears - becoming a singularity. In other words, a black hole. Neutron star upper limit found ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways that a neutron star can turn into a black hole, but in both cases the mass of the neutron star must be very close to what is needed to become a black hole. The first way is for the neutron star to accrete more matter.  This could come from another star in a close orbit or from random bits of matter that it runs into over a long period of time. The second way works for a neutron star that already has enough mass to form a black hole but doesn't due to a very rapid rotation.  The rapid rotation reduces the effects of the gravitational field that would otherwise cause an unstoppable implosion.  However, neutron stars lose rotational energy over time, and as the rate of rotation decreases, the chance of forming a black hole increases. ",

As a result, what we now have is a Quark star. Under even more temperature and pressure, these quarks disintegrate into smaller blocks of matter, which have only been theorised to exist, yet to be confirmed. At this point, the quark star collapses into a black hole. Some physicists say that black holes are probably made of strings, of Planck length. These strings are many orders smaller than the size of a quark. They say this, because theoretically, planck length is the smallest permissible length in the Universe. It stands to reason that strings must therefore come together to form something bigger. Putting 1 and 1 together, some say that since black hole cores are of unknown material, but smaller than a quark, they are made of strings. ",

The only way it can later become heavy enough, is something else adding (usually a lot of) mass to it. This does happen. A recent LIGO observation was the final stage of two neutron stars orbiting each other. For billions of years they\u2019d been shedding energy by gravitational radiation, and getting closer and closer . Eventually they merged, and the combined mass almost immediately collapsed. More commonly a neutron star may be orbiting close to an ordinary star. As that star ages it will get larger, and the neutron star will accumulate mass from the other star\u2019s atmosphere. Again, this may add enough mass to result in a collapse. Presumably there exist isolated neutron stars only ever so slightly below the mass threshold for collapsing, which might be pushed over the edge by billions of years of accumulation of interstellar gas and dust. They\u2019ll be rare and probably un-observable. Such a collapse won\u2019t create much in the way of either light ot gravity waves. ",

But a spoonful of neutron star's matter will have equal weight as of Himalayas. But if star's mass is way too much, then the collapse doesn't stop until it becomes a small dense point whose volume is negligible but density is about infinity . Thats why they are having so much of gravity. A neutron star isn't as strong as a black hole but is easily detected. Thanks for reading. ",

The thing is, a neutron star *became* a neutron star instead of a black hole, because it wasn\u2019t massive enough to crush itself down that far \u2014 but if it soaks up enough additional matter from a nearby star, a few planets, a nebula, bumps into another neutron star [or whatever else is around, as long as it adds weight], then it can become massive enough for its own gravity to squash it even further. Sorry, I don\u2019t know how much material it would take to reach that threshold. ",
