When there is no justice for our own self, when we judge our own self to be bad, unworthy, ugly, unfit, we condemn the core of our reality to then become wholly unjust wherever we look. Condemning my self, I can then spend my entire life looking externally for salvation and justice, always to come up empty handed. ",
