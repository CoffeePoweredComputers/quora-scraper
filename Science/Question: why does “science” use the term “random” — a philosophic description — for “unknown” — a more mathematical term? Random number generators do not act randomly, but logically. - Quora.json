            "answer_text": "Science uses the word \u201crandom\u201d to mean different things\u2026 and not just in the philosophical sense. You will be familiar with the way words can have more than one use? That is just how language works. This is the answer to the question:\u201d \u201cbecause words don\u2019t work the way the question assumes they do.\u201d However, that does not get you very far\u2026 I\u2019ll explain: Something being random is not the same as something being \u201cunknown\u201d\u2026 and that is not the use of the term in philosophy either. Chance versus Randomness The question mentions random-number generators \u2026 which generate \u201cpseudo-random\u201d numbers, not random numbers \u2026 so the term \u201crandom number generator\u201d is a misnomer. It is used because everyone understands that the object of such systems is to approximate as closely as needed, a random process. It need only have very low predicability for the period of the simulation. There are, however, random-number generators that do not behave logically \u2026 because they use natural processes rather than computer logic. For instance, a meteorological station measuring wind-speed in a gusty area is staggeringly random, if the number is the lowest digit of the speed most recently recorded when accessed. You are defied to find the pattern. In scientific theories, \u201crandom\u201d processes are a mathematical idealization. We accept that we cannot get to absolute random like we cannot get to infinity, or any absolute value or quality. That does not stop the concepts being useful for making models. ",

            "answer_text": "In a mathematical context, \u201crandom\u201d is not a philosophical term, and it has a much stricter meaning than simply \u201cunknown.\u201d It\u2019s a probabilistic term, and it means that all numbers are equally likely, and that the probability of any number at any time does not depend on what numbers turned up before. Of course a programmed \u201crandom number generator\u201d is not truly random, but every number has almost the same probability, and the probability distribution at any time depends significantly only on occurrences in the remote past. That makes it useful for experimental models.
