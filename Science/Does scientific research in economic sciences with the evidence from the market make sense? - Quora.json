            "answer_text": "Observations and principles are necessary for economics to be relevant just as it is for any science. The italicized description is copied from the American Institute of Economic Research. There are many similar economic research organizations as such. Performance and areas of specialization will vary. However this should give you an idea of what they do. \u201cAIER sponsors the work of leading economists and academics as Senior Fellows and Research Fellows. These experts are able to draw on the Library of American Finance\u2014housed at AIER\u2019s headquarters\u2014and collectively produce hundreds of economic reports, scholarly papers, mainstream articles, and published books every year. AIER Fellows likewise contribute to the following projects: Business Conditions Monthly, the Harwood Economic Review, the Sound Money Project, the Everyday Price Index, and the Journal of Private Enterprise. Collectively these publications have thousands of citations and hundreds of thousands of subscribers, and are regularly quoted in the pages of the Wall Street Journal and Investors Business Daily. The research arm of AIER is an invaluable resource not just for economists, but also for industry professionals and policymakers alike.\u201d So, data or evidence from the market is fundamental to economic reaserch, as is the presumption of making rational human choices. It's important to recognize \u201cchoices\u201d do not have to be rational for the application of economic principles to be applicable. Let me give you an example. Some time ago I wrote an OR computer model to evaluate location analysis. I did this for a very large corp. And they wanted to determine where to locate their HQ and distribution centers. While meeting with their IT dept; who provided some input data, I heard upper management had already decided on a location. So I thought I'll ask them about that bias. Here's their response. \u201cWe are going to locate \u201cthere\u201d, regardless of your model's results.\u201d I said, \u201cthen why bother\". The reply was, \u201cwe want to know what it is going to cost us for not making the recommended decision.\u201d The results were different, and I went ahead and charted costs for all the considered locations. Businesses don't always make the best economic decisions, research can fall short due to management's perceptions; right or wrong. Markets are only as good as the rules they play by. Black markets operate and are extremely damaging. They are not all the same and saying markets work is a very weak argument. Most can be made to improve and not all work very well. I like the finger-on-the-scale metaphor when I hear about market equilibrium. Thanks for asking\u2026 ",
