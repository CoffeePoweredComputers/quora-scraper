            "answer_text": "From the topics, I think this question isn't about harmonics in general but about spherical harmonics, which are mathematical functions used in physics, especially in calculating electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and quantum mechanical wave functions. Some problems naturally have spherical symmetry, like the field around an atom.  Such problems are easier to solve (eventually!) if you describe them in spherical coordinates.  Instead of the usual rectangular 3D coordinates (x,y,z), spherical coordinates are r, the radial distance from the origin, or coordinate center;phi, the angle between r and the z axis;  andtheta, the angle between the x axis and the projection of r onto the (x,y) plane.  This image shows the relations between the two sets of coordinates.  Spherical harmonics are functions that are periodic in theta and phi.  That means, they will be continuous when an angle goes from 359 degrees to 360(=0) to 1 degree.  We need that periodicity to describe fields and wave functions which are continuous. This image shows the s, p, d, and f atomic orbitals that are described by the lowest frequency spherical harmonics.    A full description of the math can be found in the Wikipedia article, Spherical harmonics Briefly, the spherical harmonics used in mathematical physics are solutions, Y, to Laplace's equation, a particular partial differential equation in spherical coordinates.     where    is an associated Legendre polynomial, found by solving an associated 2D partial differential equation, the general Legendre equation. Periodicity in theta and phi is achieved by restricting the values of  l and m to integers.  This gives quantization of atomic energy levels. The first few associated Legendre polynomials are  ",
