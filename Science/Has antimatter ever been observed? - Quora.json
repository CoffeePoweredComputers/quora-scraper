            "answer_text": "Not only been observed, it has been and is being created artificially too. The Large Hadron Collider is currently capable of producing about a million positrons (anti electrons) per minute. And they have also produced and stored anti hydrogen for about fifteen minutes. But the problem is it's extremely expensive and difficult to produce and equally difficult to store, as it annihilates on contact with normal matter. So they cannot mass produce it yet. ",

            "answer_text": "The Positron - Wikipedia was discovered in 1929, soon after the proposal of the Dirac equation - Wikipedia. Actually, positrons had been seen in some earlier experiments. However, before the Dirac equation, no one understood what they were seeing, and the observations were not reported. The first humanly made Antiproton - Wikipedias were created in 1955, at a machine called the Bevatron - Wikipedia, which was specifically designed to do that. ",
