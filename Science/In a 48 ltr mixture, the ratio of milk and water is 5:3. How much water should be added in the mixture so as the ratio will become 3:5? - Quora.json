            "answer_text": "Hello guys The volume of the mixture is 48 L. The initial mixture ratio is 5 : 3 Let the common multiple be x , The initial volume of milk is 5x L and the initial volume of water is 3x L [math]\\therefore 5x + 3x = 48[/math] [math]\u2192 8x = 48 \\implies \\boxed{x = 6}[/math] Let the volume of water added to the mixture is k L Now the volume of water is (3x + k)L , and the volume of milk is still 5x L The ratio of volume of milk to that of water is 3:5 [math]\\frac{5x}{3x+k} = \\frac{3}{5}[/math] [math]25x = 9x + 3k[/math] [math]16x = 3k [/math] [math]k = \\frac{16x}{3}[/math] As ,[math] k = \\frac{16\\times 6}{3}[/math] [math]\\boxed{k = 32 L} [/math] Therefore the volume of water , required to add to the mixture , for the desired change is 32L Hope this answer helps you , Have a good day ahead \u2026 ",
