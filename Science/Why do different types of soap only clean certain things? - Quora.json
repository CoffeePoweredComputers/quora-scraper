            "answer_text": "When my great-great-greatgrandmother was an 8 or 9 year old, her father decided to move westward from east of the Mississippi River, to Nebraska. In every house or shanty her father rented or bought, she was the assigned floor cleaner, This she did with ashes, animal fat, and lye. Just before the civil war broke out and the \u201ccopperheads\u201d seceded from the Union, that combination of ingredients is all that most folk had. So eventually someone saw an opportunity to sell soap. Then another inventor saw that most soap kinda made Madame's hands red raw. So hand soap was born. To keep Madame\u2019s soft and clean, too! Then dishes needed to be washed, separately, of course. So Dish soap was pitched. Then dirty clothes needed a separate soap, so that Madame didn't need to go to the stream to wash the family's dirty clothes anymore. Now we have laundry detergent, hand soap, dish soap, dishwasher soap, foot soap, soap to wash the car, shampoo, too. Every kind of soap imaginable. Mouth soap? I'm sure there used to some, because I got my mouth washed out with soap on a regular basis. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s useful to understand that the word \u2018soap\u2019 is used today to describe more than one kind of product. Soap, originally, was made from animal fat and lye. Today it\u2019s made from oils as well as fats, but, soap, genuine soap, is always a solid product. Usually sold in bars but they did sell it grated into fine flakes to use for laundry. The flakes dissolved much faster. Then detergents were invented. They are all synthetic, but they work the same way soap does. They are chemically different things that work in the same way to emulsify oils so it can be washed off and help to suspend dirt particles in water so it can be washed away. Synthetic detergents are used in all kinds of products; cleaning products, for the floor or countertops, laundry powders and then laundry liquids, dish washing liquid, hand washing liquid ( which is usually called liquid hand soap ), shampoo and then body washes. But all those products are based on the same thing, which is synthetic detergent. But we have a habit of calling some of them soap; liquid hand \u2018soap\u2019, dish \u2018soap\u2019, and so on. They differ in how concentrated they are and what other ingredients are added to them to make them work better for a given purpose, like washing hair, or washing hands. When it comes to floor cleaning products, or those to clean the bathtub, they have ingredients which are a lot harsher than anything made to use on human skin but they still use the same basic detergents. Bar soap has variations too; there are facial bars, made to be gentler, or laundry stain bars, and bars made to help with acne, or with pumice to help scrub off embedded dirt. You can use any of them to wash your hands but you wouldn\u2019t want to use pumice soap on your face. A lot of the \u2018differences\u2019 that you see today when it comes to detergents or soap is mostly about advertising and marketing. In other words, you can use liquid hand soap to wash the dishes, because there\u2019s little difference between them, excepting perhaps for scent that\u2019s added. You could wash your entire body with shampoo and it\u2019ll be just fine. In fact, you could wash yourself with Dawn dish liquid and you\u2019d be just fine. You can use it for bubble bath if you want to. You could also wash your body with bar soap, like everyone did before body wash came along. I admit, soap can dry your skin and for some, that\u2019s a problem, so just get Dove soap, which is a lot milder than regular bar soap and doesn\u2019t dry your skin. It\u2019s got moisturizers in it like the ones in body wash. No plastic bottle to throw out or recycle either. Soap uses a lot less packaging and hardly any plastic packaging. It\u2019s not so much that \u2018different types of soap only clean certain things as it is that the manufacturers like it if we buy as many products as possible. So they make a lot of things to choose from, hoping we won\u2019t notice how similar many of them are. ",
