            "answer_text": "NEWS ALERT! COVID-19 was unknown to humanity outside the People\u2019s Republic of China until December of 2019.COVID-19 is extremely challenging and complex for medical professionals to treat and control.COVID-19 is a contagious virus, and human beings can be infected with COVID-19.President Trump is a human being who is physiologically, biologically and immunologically similar to all other human beings, so he, like everybody else, can be infected with COVID-19.The truth is that nobody knows with absolute certainty how/when President Trump became infected, and who infected him, with COVID-19. The truth is that, at the moment of President Trump's infection, he could have been obeying all the recommended guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. The only way to guarantee avoidance of COVID-19 infection is complete quarantine and isolation, until the use of a 100% effective vaccine, which currently is non-existent. President Trump is not willing to completely isolate and quarantine himself, and neither are the vast majority of people wherever they are on the political spectrum. By insulting President Trump for becoming infected with COVID-19, Obama indirectly insulted hundreds of thousands of people who have become infected with COVID-19, as though becoming sick is shameful.

            "answer_text": "cheap shot , Obama lost his charisma somewhere along the way \u2026 staying in a basement as a president , does not project any strength in American leadership and American power \u2026 Cowering never won a debate , nor did a president ever succeed who cowered to his enemies \u2026 add to that Biden selling out our country to China and Russia , our two major enemies , and yet somehow the leftist press and social media , think more about their control of the media , than the health and wealth of our country \u2026. Biden an activist traitor , and big tech and big news outlets , think they could control America , and they will if Biden wins \u2026. If trump wins , they will have to answer to our electorate , why should they enjoy special treatment as editors of content , they will have to protect their business by not selling our politics to evil entities ..
