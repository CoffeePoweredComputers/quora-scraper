            "answer_text": " An RNA virus is a virus that has RNA as its genetic material. This nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA but may be double-stranded RNA.    RNA-dependent RNA replication is a special process reserved exclusively for RNA viruses but not cellular RNAs. Almost all RNA viruses (except retroviruses) undergo RNA-dependent RNA replication by a virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which specifically replicates the viral RNA genome. ] Satellite viral RNAs do not encode their own polymerase but rely on the RdRP from the coexisting helper virus for their replication. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids present an exception which still confounds the conventional thinking. None of them encode an RdRP, and yet they can undergo robust RNA replication autonomously once inside the cells. It is intuitive that they have to replicate their RNA genome using a cellular enzyme. However, unlike plants and lower animal species, which encode RdRPs that are putatively involved in gene silencing , no mammalian cells have been shown to encode any RdRP or its equivalent. Nevertheless, the RNA interference phenomena suggest the possibility that RNA-templated RNA amplification may also take place in the mammalian cells . Thus, viroids and HDV present both a challenge and an opportunity for understanding a potentially physiological flow of genetic information from RNA to RNA in the mammalian cells. Viroids and HDV differ in that viroids do not encode any protein, whereas HDV encodes a protein (hepatitis delta antigen [HDAg]) which is intimately involved in RNA replication. In addition, HDV RNA not only has to replicate itself but also needs to transcribe a subgenomic mRNA species that encodes HDAg. The transcription of the HDAg-encoding mRNA has all of the hallmarks of the conventional mRNA transcription in the cells except for the nature of the template (DNA versus RNA). Therefore, HDV represents a hybrid of the conventional DNA-dependent transcription and the unique RNA-dependent RNA synthesis in the absence of an RdRP.    ",
