So it requires less energy but when compared to carbon requires more energy as it have more Nuclear charge as compared to carbon. Oxygen\u2014\u2192 1S2, 2S2, 2P4O+ \u2014\u2014\u2192 1S2, 2S2, 2P3O2+(Second ionisation)\u2014\u2192 1S2, 2S2, 2P2 (Second ionziation of O will be much greater as we are removing electrons from half filled orbital i.e., 2P which is more stable.) As a result it has the most second ionization enthalpy.
