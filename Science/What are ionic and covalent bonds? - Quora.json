            "answer_text": "For many diatomic molecules, the character of bonding is not purely ionic or purely covalent. Bonds of various diatomic molecules can be compared as having more or less ionic/covalent on a relative scale. This has been asked elsewhere on Quora: How do I know if the bond is ionic or covalent? and among fairly good answers, I would direct you to Srinath Karmakar's answer to What is fajan's rule in chemistry? However, Linus Pauling also proposed an equation to evaluate the % of ionic (versus covalent) character, which uses the difference in electronegativity between the elements. You may find it more straightforward. Fajan\u2019s rules and Pauling\u2019s equation are both explained at CHEM1902 Polarizability. In solids, where metallic elements (with low electronegativity to moderate electronegativity) might be bonding with non-metals of moderate electronegativity, the bonding may also have some metallic character.  This triangular van Arkel\u2019s diagram is sometimes used to represent the gradational character of bonding between these three bond types. Since several compounds are plotted, you can use those along the ionic-to-covalent side and test your understanding of Fajan\u2019s rules and check if the difference in electronegativity is a good rule of thumb (Source: A new approach to chemistry education at pre-university level : Nature Chemistry). (And if your instructor states that there is a sharp boundary between ionic and covalent, you should be diplomatic\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "When atoms combine to create compounds, they form bond between themselves. They do this by either donating and receiving electrons or by sharing electrons between themselves. I'll be looking at the two asked by the question but first, why do they combine?  Atoms consist of protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and Electrons have charge while Neutrons don't. Protons are positively charged and while electrons are negatively charged. The absolute magnitude of the charges is equal, so an atom by itself is neutrally charged. The electrons surround the nucleus of an atom. The nucleus is in the centre of the atom and the electrons whizz around the atom in spaces called orbitals. Orbitals are spaces where you can find an electron. Now, atoms love to be stable. Each orbital needs to be fully filled to be stable in chemical terms. That magic number happens to be 8. So, for an atom to be stable, its orbital needs to achieve the octet formation. (This isn't a law but rather a hard-and-fast rule in chemical reactions.) Now, to achieve that formation atoms do many things. They might give, take or share.  Ionic bond is the bond formed when an electrostatic attraction occurs between two ions of opposite charges. In simple terms, the bond formed when the positive charge attracts the negative. An ion is an atom which gains a charge when it loses or takes electrons. Most metals prefer donating electrons, hence they form cations. Cations are positively charged ions. They give their electrons so they can achieve the octet formation. Most nonmetals (except noble gases) receive electrons, hence they form anions. Anions are negatively charged ions. The most common example of an ionic bond is between a metal cation and a nonmetal anion. Here, a metal cation (like [math]Na^+[/math]) bonds with a nonmetal anion (like [math]Cl^-[/math]. Here is a neat image of how ionic bond works.   A Covalent bond is the bond formed when atoms share electron pairs between themselves. They do this because the orbitals overlap over each other. When they do this, it enables both the atoms to attain the full configuration which means it will be stable. There are no charges involved. An example covalently bonded compound is [math]CH_4[/math]. Covalent bond mostly occurs between nonmetals because it takes too much energy for them to donate electrons, unlike metals. Since neither party is willing to give up, they decide to share.
