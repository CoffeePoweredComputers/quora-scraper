            "answer_text": "Firstly, you need to know that you are weak in science and maths because you have never tried learning it. Just because everyone says that science and maths are difficult subject, you have also started assuming that they are difficult and you won\u2019t be able to do it. Now from the question you have asked I think you can take Biology, Commerce, Arts or Humanities. But if you really want my advice, I think you should stick to science. Please let me explain. You need to realise that maths and science are not alien subjects that only few students in the world are able to understand it. The only difference is maths and science demands time. That\u2019s all. Just because all the students want to run away from studies, when it comes to giving time to maths and science they start giving excuses like the subject is too difficult or I am just weak at this subject. I think everyone should study science and maths till their 12th class because these two subjects force you to devote time to studies, they help in increasing your sitting power, they force you to use your mind, they for you to think critically but the most important reason is that maths and science till 12th is the basic maths and science which you are going to use in your daily life throughout your life. So why not study it and understand it. You need to know science and maths gives you the freedom to choose a different field even after your 12th. Let me give you my example- I did science and maths till 12th. I tell you it was not easy for me. After my 12th I just knew that I didn\u2019t wanted to be an engineer and so I studies business studies. But it was in my college that I realised that maths is even used in commerce or any other field. My knowledge in maths from 11th and 12th actually gave me an upper hand in my business studies course. I am not saying that doing maths and science in your 11th and 12th will be easy. It is going to be a bit difficult and that\u2019s why not everyone is able to do it. But I can promise you that you will have an option to change your field after 12th but the knowledge you will get in your 11th and 12th, will be useful to you throughout your life. Stay Awesome, Stay Amazing ",
