            "answer_text": "First, the Pope has no authority to legalize anything outside of Vatican City. His religious edicts may be observed by Catholics worldwide, but they have no legal standing. Plus, the Vatican decriminalized homosexuality in 2008, so it's already legal. I assume, then, that you are referring to his recent statement regarding Civil Unions. The reality is that the world is progressing toward gay equality, including marriage equality, and the Vatican knows it. It's an excellent practical example of what Martin Luther King, Jr (quoting Theodore Parker) said: \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d In other words, equality is inevitable. Just as it was/is with gender and racial equality. Sexism and racism still exist, especially among less developed nations, but the trend is clear. And so it is with sexual orientation. Here are two indicators that shook the Vatican into reality. First, polls showed that the majority of US Catholics actually supported marriage equality when America was still debating the issue. Now that we've had gay marriage for a few years with no ill effects on society, Catholic support is likely even higher. More striking is the case of Ireland. With the possible exception of Italy, no country is more identified with Catholicism. There is even a term, \u201cIrish Catholic\u201d and religion was a source of bloody conflict with Protestant Northern Ireland. Yet Ireland became the first (and I believe still the only) country to achieve marriage equality through a POPULAR vote (Australia had a vote/poll to guide legislators, but it was non-binding). Every other nation legalized gay marriage through the courts, where excluding gays was deemed unconstitutional. But the Irish people themselves voted for it. True democracy at work. Indeed, during the debate, I was confused by the gay equality logo (a yellow equal sign) popping all over the social media of straight Irish males. The result shook the Vatican to its core, and American homophobes weren't too happy either because it shot down their frequent complaint of \u201cactivist judges.\u201d The Irish people themselves wanted marriage equality, period. I'm not a big supporter of cultural imperialism, but if it means the West bringing equality to developing nations, go for it. I'm against forcing our beliefs \u2014 as Christian explorers did to indigenous people and Islamic terrorists are doing now \u2014 but cultural and financial pressures are fine. For example, the World Bank and Scandinavia led the charge to withhold financial aid to Uganda after its passage of harsh anti-laws. Money talks. Sweden suspends some aid to Uganda over anti-gay law Similarly, I'm all for pressuring the Catholic Church to make cultural change. In the West, the church is not only losing influence but also members. Young men are entering the clergy is at critically low levels. The Vatican has tried to compensate by focusing on less developed nations, most notably in Africa. That continent is a hotbed of homophobia, whose cardinals and archbishops have even privately discussed a schism against Pope Francis over his progressive views on homosexuality. But Africa cannot sustain the church, and Asia isn't interested, being dominated by Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Pope Francis is a compassionate and progressive man. He is also a practical man. He knows that the church's relevance and survival depend on reflecting the times. Today's youths is the future of the church, and GenZ is overwhelmingly pro-gay. Recognizing civil unions is an easy way to modernize the church without breaking Catholic tenets. Catholic teachings condemn sexual behaviors, most notably between two men (the Bible is silent about lesbians), but civil unions say nothing about sex. It is simply a legal agreement that ensures equal treatment for gay couples. Indeed, one can even argue that the stability of legal recognition discourages promiscuity. That has practical implications for society, e.g. sexually transmitted diseases. How can anyone, including Catholics, be against that? So while I'm an atheist, I see no reason why any catholic would leave the church based on the Pope's recognition of civil unions. It's a smart move to ensure the church's relevance without violating Catholic beliefs. If anything, Catholics should feel revitalized and a sense of hope. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cLegalizing\u201d homosexuality usually refers to federal or state laws, and civil or criminal codes - over which, outside the tiny Vatican City State, the pope has no authority. In the context of the Church, homosexuality is already \u201clegalized\u201d - being homosexual is neither a crime nor a sin in the eyes of the Church. It is your orientation, it is how you are. Like all fallen humans, you have temptations to sin. But a homosexual person is not in any way \u201cillegal\u201d in the eyes of the Church. Like everyone else, there are moral laws that apply, of course. \u201cBeing who you are\u201d is no excuse for any manner of sin - not for a homosexual person, nor for a heterosexual person. This often seems difficult for people to understand, that the Church is accepting of the person without accepting all of our actions. So, if you want a Church that demonizes homosexuality or thinks that homosexuality itself is sinful, the Catholic Church is not for you. ",
