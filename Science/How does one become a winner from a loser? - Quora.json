            "answer_text": "I could not ride bicycle with confidence unlike other children. I used to fall or unbalance my bicycle every now and then. Most children in the society made fun of me. I told my father. He smiled and said- Failure are an opportunity to stick your roots deep in ground, while easy success makes you over confident and vulnerable to smallest of problems. Best you can do now is wake up early in morning and practise cycling for an hour daily. If you improve, well and good, if you don't, chances of which are low, at least you tried with dedication. Finally I started practising in May and by mid-June I could beat any other guy in cycling.  Though I don't believe in the words like \u201closer\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d but in order to improve ourself, we need only two steps- Realization that \u201cI need to improve\u201d.Working with dedication towards our goal without caring about the results. Try with so much dedication that even if you fail, you know it was destined to happen and you gave your destiny a good fight! ",

New things will come from this so pay attention and start sorting the good from the bad and keep moving forward with only the good things. Soon you will have the resources and strength you need to undo what has burdened you in the past. I have seen dozens of people turn their lives around by doing this. ",
