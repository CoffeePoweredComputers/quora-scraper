            "answer_text": "Why isn't all motion relative? It is all relative. It\u2019s possible to determine you\u2019re not in an inertial frame of reference just by examining your frame of reference. But since you can\u2019t distinguish between gravitation and acceleration via any test done inside the frame of reference, you still need to look outside to see if you\u2019re in motion relative to anything. And even if you *are* in motion and it\u2019s acceleration and not gravity you feel, you\u2019re still in motion relative to *something*. ",

            "answer_text": "Because some forms of motion can be determined without needing to have a reference frame. This happens when any choice of reference frame cancels itself out when the details of the particular kind of motion is calculated. The standard example would be acceleration in Newtonian mechanics.
