            "answer_text": "The short answer: there are an INFINITE number of stars in the Universe Let me explain. This may seem like a simple straight forward question. But there are a few subtleties here that need clarification. Often when people ask this, they are referring to stars within our Galaxy, the Milky Way. The canonical answer to this version of the question is around 200 Billion Stars (2e11). This answer is surprisingly uncertain (by more than a factor 2), and it depends on exactly how you define a \u201cstar\u201d. If you want to include Brown Dwarfs that are planet-sized and are not much warmer than \u201croom temperature\u201d, then you need to significantly increase this number. If we want the question at hand to include stars beyond the Milky Way, then people generally talk about the \u201cObservable Universe\u201d. In other words: how many stars we would see, if we somehow had a telescope with an unlimited collecting area and resolving power, which could somehow see through interstellar gas and dust clouds. For this version of the question, the answer hinges on the age of the Universe. Or to be more precise, how long ago the first stars were formed. This was a very tough number for Astronomers to pin down, but we now know that it was roughly 13 billion years ago. Since with every light-year further we look, we are looking 1 year back in time, the furthest stars we could possibly see are roughly 13 billion light-years away (note: there are several inaccuracies in this statement that I\u2019m purposely glossing over). Within this bubble of radius 13 billion light-years there are roughly 1 billion trillion stars (that\u2019s 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 1e21). Here again, the problem of how exactly we define a star is even worse than before, since the very earliest stars were very different from \u201cmodern\u201d stars (see Reionization for more details). Finally, I\u2019d like to read the question as: \u201chow many stars are in existence right now?\u201d. In this version, you need to include stars that exist, but are so far away that their light has not reached us yet. In fact, due to our Universe\u2019s accelerating expansion, the light of almost all stars will NEVER REACH US. That means that no matter how powerful our telescopes are, we will NEVER be able to see these stars. How many stars are there like this? INFINITY. Which is my final answer. Now the skeptical among you will correctly question how I could possibly make such a strong statement about something that we can never see. And to this I will answer that this is simply a result of Occam's razor. That is, since our cosmological observations so far have shown that the Universe is consistent with being flat and infinite, and that at the largest scales the Universe is essentially uniform. Then having a finite number of stars would mean that we are somehow in a \u201cspecial place\u201d in the Universe - an \u201coasis\u201d of stars. Or perhaps there\u2019s a \u201cbrick wall\u201d at some point, beyond which there are no more stars. Both these options seem rather unlikely to me. It is much more likely, in my opinion, that the Universe goes on and on forever in all directions, with roughly the same structure forever. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever looked up into the night sky and wondered just how many stars there are in space? This question has fascinated scientists as well as philosophers, musicians and dreamers throughout the ages. Look into the sky on a clear night, out of the glare of streetlights, and you will see a few thousand individual stars with your naked eyes. With even a modest amateur telescope, millions more will come into view. It has been said that counting the stars in the Universe is like trying to count the number of sand grains on a beach on Earth. We might do that by measuring the surface area of the beach and determining the average depth of the sand layer.  Telescopes may not be able to view all the stars in a galaxy, however. A 2008 estimate by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (which catalogs all the observable objects in a third of the sky) found about 48 million stars, roughly half of what astronomers expected to see. A star like our own sun may not even show up in such a catalog. So, many astronomers estimate the number of stars in a galaxy based on its mass \u2014 which has its own difficulties, since dark matter and galactic rotation must be filtered out before making an estimate. The simplest answer may be to estimate the number of stars in a typical galaxy, and then multiply that by the estimated number of galaxies in the universe. But even that is tricky, as some galaxies shine better invisible or some in infrared, for example. There also are estimation hurdles that must be overcome. In October 2016, an article in Science (based on deep-field images from the Hubble Space Telescope) suggested that there are about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, or about 10 times more galaxies than previously suggested. In an email with Live Science, lead author Christopher Conselice, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, said there were about 100 million stars in the average galaxy A 1995 exposure of a small spot in Ursa Major revealed about 3,000 faint galaxies. In 2003-4, using upgraded instruments, scientists looked at a smaller spot in the constellation Fornax and found 10,000 galaxies. An even more detailed investigation in Fornax in 2012, with even better instruments, showed about 5,500 galaxies. Kornreich used a very rough estimate of 10 trillion galaxies in the universe. Multiplying that by the Milky Way's estimated 100 billion stars results in a large number indeed: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a \"1\" with 24 zeros after it (1 septillion in the American numbering system; 1 quadrillion in the European system). Kornreich emphasized that number is likely a gross underestimation, as more detailed looks at the universe will show even more galaxies. ",
