            "answer_text": "Criminology is the scientific study of the causes and prevention of criminal behavior, studying crime as a social phenomenon. The scope of criminology includes perspectives on making laws, breaking laws, and societal reactions to laws being broken. Criminology studies crime and deviance, often within the context of other social issues, such as education, racism, poverty, and gender. As such, study within this social science is broad. For example, the ASC identifies the following criminology divisions: Division on Corrections and SentencingDivision on Critical CriminologyDivision of Developmental and Life-Course CriminologyDivision of Experimental CriminologyDivision of International CriminologyDivision on People of Color and CrimeDivision of PolicingDivision of VictimologyDivision of Women and CrimeThe ASC is also currently implementing a new division, the Division on Terrorism and Bias Crimes. Criminology encompasses the sociological, psychological, and biological components of crime. It is a social science that embraces sociology, the scientific study of social behavior. However, the practice of criminology includes many fields of study, such as: StatisticsBiologyAnthropologyPsychologyPsychiatryEconomicsCriminal justiceWho are Criminologists? Criminologists study and evaluate the nature of crimes and the offenders of those crimes. They seek to define criminal behavior and the social and interpersonal decisions related to criminalized deviant behavior. Their work includes: Researching Research is a major component of a criminologist\u2019s job. These social scientists conduct extensive research on crimes, the lives of criminals, and aspects of why crimes occur. Because of the wide scope of crime, research in criminology may focus on any number of issues that affect criminal behavior, such as: EducationRace/ethnicitySocio-economic statusBehaviorSocial statusEnvironmental factorsResearch in criminology often includes profiling criminals to find similarities in\u2014and motivations for\u2014criminal behavior. Criminologists study data about crimes, arrests, and convictions, with a major focus on finding patterns among criminals and trends in crime. The ultimate goal of criminologists is to find ways to predict, deter, and prevent future crimes and criminal behavior. Theorizing The research of criminologists lends itself to the development of theories about why people commit crimes. Once research is complete, criminologists compile all related statistics and data and search for patterns and trends in criminal behavior. Their exhaustive examination of the research leads to the development of theories, which allows them and others to gain a better understanding of crime and the individuals who perpetrate it. The act of theorizing by criminologists may lead to everything from changes in law enforcement tactics to law reform. Compiling Information The collection of information and the compilation of reports allow criminologists to disseminate their research findings to others. The American Society of Criminology notes that the reports of criminologists are often published in criminology journals and related publications. Criminologists often rely on the past work of other criminologists to build upon their own research. Thanks to the published research of criminologists, real-life problems can be addressed: crime prevention programs initiated, policies reformed, and laws modified or adopted. Criminology Specializations: Jobs in Criminology A wide variety of specializations exists within criminology. For example, criminologists may focus their practice on certain types of crime, such as: Armed robberyMurderProstitutionRapeSerial crimesCriminologists may also focus their work on different aspects of the criminal system, such as: Crime scene investigationCrime preventionCriminal litigationRehabilitationCorrectionsCriminologists may also apply their knowledge and training to a variety of subspecialties, such as: Victims\u2019 rightsJuvenile justice systemWhite collar crimeDNA evidenceGovernment policy initiativesCommunity-based initiatives",

            "answer_text": "Criminology is the study of the making of laws, the breaking of laws, and the reaction to the breaking (commonly called \"Criminal Justice\"), a definition coined by a \"founding father\" of criminology, Edwin Sutherland, in 1929. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and in many European countries, criminology is considered a sub-discipline of sociology, mainly due to the fact that many of the pioneering researchers connected to criminology were aligned with sociology (Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Karl Marx, etc.). In other countries, however, criminology may be studied in disciplines other than sociology, such as in law schools (Eastern Europe, Russia), medical schools (Italy), schools of public administration (Japan), and even in schools of social work (Ethiopia). Many students considering criminology are disappointed to find out that criminology is not the study of \"the criminal mind\" or individual motivations toward criminal behavior, which is the provenance of psychology and psychiatry. Rather, criminology focuses upon populations large and small (from families and gangs to entire societies and nations) to explain the broader nature of crime and criminal behavior using a wide array of theories (explanations). Indeed, of all of the disciplines of sociology, criminology probably has more theories associated with it than any other area. Accordingly, there is no one theory that attempts to explain all crime, even the so-called \"general\" theories of crime. Since criminology deals with populations, rather than individuals, it makes copious and exhaustive use of a wide variety of statistical analytical techniques. Employment of criminologists generally involve research and teaching and acting as advisors to public and private executives concerning the prevention and reduction of crime, as well as the analysis of crime trends and crime conducive conditions.

            "answer_text": "CRIMINOLOGY is the study of why people commit crimes, how acts are deemed as legal and illegal, and why some people commit crimes and their motivation to commit crimes. Like sociology and psychology, you look at many different theories\u2026 Classical theory, Biological theories, Marxism, Feminist theory, Labelling theory, Strain theory and several other theories. We study why certain acts are considered criminal, why crime occurs and why some people commit crimes and others do not, though they both may be similar in many ways such as their socio-economic status, where they grew-up, family environments etc. Geographical factors are also studied as are issues of recidivism and rehabilitation. Criminological Theories, Introduction to Psychology, Fundamentals of Law and Cultural Diversity along with Ethics, Research Techniques, Criminal Justice, Sentencing and Abnormal Psychology are all classes involved. There are more units obviously, but that's just an example of the classes you need to study and pass. I hope this has enlightened you suitably? Criminology is extremely interesting and is a good gateway to working in law enforcement, Corrections, Border security, Legal positions and community services. Cheers ",

Most of us look at the TV shows and movies where a specific expert is contracted to advise on a specific crime or a well known criminal. This in the real world is what criminology is about. These criminologists have a background in the psychology, history,sociology, and even biology of crime and much more. It is a field that requires extensive study at colleges and universities. Criminologists perform research, teach, and consult law enforcement actvities. When consulted they look in particular for behaviorial patterns in criminals but use other skills as well. They are a Godsend to law enforcement, but great TV shows, fiction and non-fiction books are the result of these very smart and essential people in our midst! Most of us have favorite crime shows as well as books. Myself, it is these Crime shows that intrigue me the most! ",

            "answer_text": "There have been many answers which explain what criminology is as a subject of study. Yet I am being requested to answer this question. So, I am guessing that your question actually relates to the criminal nature of people. We do have an inborn nature which determines the direction of our lives regarding occupation and character. However, we also have the inner voice of conscience which we can listen to and override any criminal tendencies we might have. The nature of criminals is generally commonly understood as a simple issue. This is not true, because all criminals are not necessarily evil in nature nor can one specify a particular characteristic to them. One only needs to think about the legendary Robin Hood. He represents different characters according to the beneficiaries of his crimes and his victims. So on this one example you can judge that nature is not an easy thing to define. It depends on many factors. i hope this is what you were looking for. If not it\u2019s something to think about anyway. ",
