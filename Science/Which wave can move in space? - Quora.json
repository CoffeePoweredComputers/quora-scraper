            "answer_text": "Space is a vacuum, and thus it is devoid of any matter. Thus waves that can move in space have to be able to travel without a medium. Light waves, radio waves, X rays, and other electromagnetic waves can definitely move in space. That's why light from the sun can travel through the solar system to reach Earth. This picture shows the types of electromagnetic waves.  However, sound waves cannot move in space. That is why in an actual scenario, if something explodes in space, no sound would be heard, contrary to scenes in many movies(they aren't scientifically accurate sometimes). Unlike electromagnetic waves such as light waves, sound waves need a medium to travel from one point to another. Hence sound waves cannot travel in a vacuum such as space. ",
