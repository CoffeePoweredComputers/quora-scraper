            "answer_text": "Let us try to get some intuition about motion. What actually is motion? Motion is the change of distance with respect to time. But how do you know if you are really changing distance. Consider yourself riding on a horse in a very dark night. Also assume you cannot see anything except your horse. Since you are riding you might feel that you are in motion. However you cannot be sure that you are actually in motion. Because the only reference frame is your horse and you are at rest from the point of view of the horse. Similarly the horse is also at rest with respect to you. Hence you develop a intuition that you are at rest with respect to a frame which is moving with the same velocity as you are moving. After sometime it becomes dawn and you are able to see everything around you. Now I am sure you can tell if you are in motion or not. You see the trees around you which are continuously moving backward with respect to you. Now you think if it is really you who is moving or the trees. There I am who is resting under a tree who see you galloping on your horse. Now try to see all these aspects from my point of view. I see the trees at rest while you are moving. So what went wrong when you are seeing trees moving but i see them at rest. Think about it. This is all relative motion. ",

            "answer_text": "When we talk about the velocity of something we first determine a reference point and then according to this reference point we say the velocity of the object. For example, you are in a bus and it goes with the velocity of 50 m/s to the east, then a truck passes you with a velocity of 60m/s to the east. When the truck is next to the bus you feel that as you go backward to the west or when the two cars have same velocity when you look another car you feel you do not move. On the contrary, consider the below examples, if you look at the stationary objects at the ground when you travel, then you feel yourself travel with the velocity of the car. All these are the result of relative motion. Velocity of the moving objects with respect to other moving or stationary object is called \u201crelative velocity\u201d and this motion is called \u201crelative motion\u201d. Reference point is too important in physics. We do all calculations according to the reference points. For instance, we observe the plane flying in the air, velocity of that plane with respect to us is the sum of the velocities of plane and the wind. However, the same plane has different velocity with respect to the flying other plane. To sum up, we determine the directions and quantities of velocity of the objects with respect to a chosen reference point. ",

You and your friend riding cycles with same speed and direction parallel to each other observes each other to be at rest with repect to your frame whereas a person on road observes you both cycling at some speed. Whereas your friend riding antiparallel to you observes you to be cycling opposite to his direction with twice the velocity. Thats relativity. Well as per Einstein : Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That's relativity. Albert Einstein ;) ",

No reference point, just flying. Absolute motion. A bird flying at 10 mph in level flight away from me. Relative motion. Relative motion, but which one: You are walking along a sidewalk somewhere on the equator. On the surface of a world that is spinning at 1,040 miles per hour. On a planet that is traveling through space around the sun at 66,000 miles per hour. And the sun is traveling around the center of the Milky Way at about 486,000 miles per hour. And the Milky Way is traveling toward the Andromeda galaxy at about 250,000 miles per hour. So how fast are you walking? That\u2019s why relative motion is a useful concept. ",

Thus, the motion is not calculated with reference to the earth, but is the velocity of the object in reference to the other moving object as if it were in a static state. * For example, a person sitting in an airplane is at zero velocity relative to the airplane, but is moving at the same velocity as the airplane with respect to the ground. Relative motion is a concept, and its calculation occurs with relative velocity, relative speed, or relative acceleration (which is the change in velocity divided by the change in time). Thank you!

            "answer_text": "Relative motion is the calculation of the motion of an object with regard to some other moving object. Thus, the motion is not calculated with reference to the earth, but is the velocity of the object in reference to the other moving object as if it were in a static state. For example, a person sitting in an airplane is at zero velocity relative to the airplane, but is moving at the same velocity as the airplane with respect to the ground. Relative motion is a concept, and its calculation occurs with relative velocity, relative speed, or relative acceleration (which is the change in velocity divided by the change in time).  ",

If the bus is traveling at 10 m/s, relative to ground, then your speed relative to gound is 1 + 10 = 11 m/s. These are considerations about relative motions. ",
