            "answer_text": "By \u201cmost abundant\u201d I\u2019m going to use the percentage of the total mass and not the number individual atoms In your day to day life on the Earth\u2019s crust the most abundant element is oxygen (~46 %). This is due to oxygen being a very common rock forming element together with silicon (28 %). Other common elements are aluminium (8.2%), iron (5.6%), calcium (4.2%), sodium (2.5%), magnesium (2.4%), potassium, (2.0%). Making aluminium the most common metal in the crust. We have oxygen in a confident lead thus far. The crust only makes up a tiny portion of the entire Earth. Beneath the crust we find the mantle. The most abundant element in the mantle is also oxygen at about 44.8 % further extending its lead. Magnesium surprises the crowd at this stage and makes it up to second place making up 23 % of the mantle leaving silicon at just behind at 22 %. The mantle makes up about 84 % of the Earth\u2019s volume making this stage significant. At this stage it seems that we have leading group of oxygen, silicon and magnesium with oxygen in the lead. Seems like this will be an easy victory for oxygen. But wait. What is this? A last second sprint by iron and it\u2019s gaining on the leading group fast. The closer we get to the core the more dense the Earth gets. Close to Earth\u2019s center roughly 88 % is thought to be iron. This is going to be a close one people! Iron and oxygen on giving it their all on the final stretch. Oxygen has a lead but is exhausted and iron is gaining rapidly. They approach the finish line, they are neck and neck and the favourite oxygen has been dethroned and iron is the winner at 32.1 % just ahead of oxygen at 30.1 %. How can this newcomer defeat oxygen, we must wait with celebration until iron has gone through the doping control (we are not sure what is inside the earth but it is theorized that it contains a large amount of iron). Oh here comes the bronze medal fight between magnesium and silicon. I am not sure who won that. We just got the result from the photo finish, silicon is ahead at 15.1 % and magnesium just missed the medal at 13.9%. ",

It could be any matter, from the most simple (basic particles!) to the most complex compound (the Earth itself!), and everything in between. Does the most abundant means the one taking up the highest fraction of the mass, or the one that is the most numerous? In both cases, simple neutrons win! But that is a bit trivial. Let\u2019s assume you meant substance, as in a type of atom or molecule, and most abundant by absolute quantity of mass by weight, not in mere absolute number. The Earth is split in Iron Core, Iron Nickel-Core, Mantle (rich in magnesium and iron), and Crust. Earht crust is quite thin compared to mantle and core. Core is 3400 km thick and Mantle above it is 2890 km thick. In % of radius, this means Core is 54% of the width of the Earth, this it is 0.66 / 4.19 = 15.75% of the total volume (excluding the relatively thin crust), with mantle being 84.25%. Core has is 9.9 to 13.1 water density, while Mantle is 3.4 to 5.6, both with higher densities as you go downward. So this means the most abundant mass is the Mantle. Basically, molten rock. ",

(Anomalies in the composition of Titan's atmosphere have led some to suggest that Titan might even harbor life forms).  But here on Earth, nitrogen is a fairly inert gas at room temperature and is the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen glows a lovely violet colour when exposed to electrical radiation (right, image courtesy of Jurii/Wikipedia) a characteristic that makes nitrogen lasers easily identifiable from their purple glow. Like carbon, nitrogen is another element that is an indispensable component of all living things, since it is part of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. I couldn't find a cartoon to entertain you kids at the back of the classroom, who are too cool to admit that learning is fun, but this video is still fun: To review, we've learned a little about these elements: Carbon: C, atomic number 6Boron: B, atomic number 5Beryllium: Be, atomic number 4Lithium: Li, atomic number 3Helium: He, atomic number 2Hydrogen: H, atomic number 1 This lovely Chinese mystery bird is classified into an Old World group of birds that is (in my opinion) a taxonomic garbage can Mystery Bird photographed at Hong Kong, China.
