            "answer_text": "Which one is the medical expert? Fauci, just in case there is any confusion. Just because someone gets the virus does not make them an expert. It means they didn't believe it was real and got close to someone who was infected, with no mask or social distancing as a precaution. The expert (Fauci) has said from the beginning mask wearing and social distancing is the first line of defense. Fauci told everyone it is contagious and you could die from it. Then Trump shut him down and brought in someone who would say what Trump wants them to say. A medical expert is a better bet on who to listen to in a health crisis. ",

Who is a world respected ediomologist, which multiple high level degrees and doctorates, a multitude of published papers in prestigious medical journals, and a long history of public service and leadership on public health organizations and institutions? And who is a lying sack of shit, a two bit con artist, a grifter with a string of bankruptcies and fraudulent and failed businesses, who cheats on his taxes, has suspicious backers, wears lifts to appear taller, has the worlds weirdest combover, is a petulant narcissist and has told 10,000 lies in four years?
