Growing price competitiveness Gas, fossil fuels and other energy alternatives- each with their unique advantages- collectively pose a threat to power plant operators and end users: volatility and insecurity of price. The price of gas fluctuates across regions and, for fossil fuels, in a cyclical fashion. Long-term certainty Renewables have been heavily encouraged by policy measures and financial support, with the explicit aim of driving costs down through early deployment. But the necessity for this is disappearing as we speak for solar and wind (and it has been for hydro for a while now), bringing to the fore solid competitors to fossil fuels or nuclear power, especially when long-term price evolutions are part of the deals. Energy security The majority of oil & gas sources are concentrated in certain regions, many of which are getting more technically challenging and more expensive to reach, whereas renewable energy is domestic. It provides security of supply, helping a nation reduce its dependence on imported sources. It plays a significant role in addressing our energy needs by replacing foreign energy imports with clean and reliable home-grown electricity with the added bonus of fantastic local economic opportunities. While renewable energy systems are better for the environment and produce fewer emissions than conventional energy sources, many of these sources still face difficulties in being deployed at a large scale including, but not limited to, technological barriers, high start-up capital costs, and intermittency challenges.

            "answer_text": "WHAT IS GREEN ENERGY? There is no pure stand alone green energy and certainly not wind and solar. The manufacture of these ugly blotches on the land use more CO2 emissions than the save according to some research. Hydro power is water and gravity but the dam is cement and is massive. In fact there is a case that carbon based energy is fundamentally green energy. WHAT IS THE BEST ENERGY TO STOP ENERGY POVERTY? The market forces chose natural gas and coal for sure. WILL WIND AND SOLAR REPLACE FOSSIL FUELS? Not a chance because of their intermittency when the wind does not blow and sun does not shine. Fareed Zaharia demolished any hope this renewable being effective for grid electricity. WHY ARE COAL OR NATURAL GAS THE MOST POPULAR ENERGY TODAY?  Wednesday, March 22, 2017 Using Natural Gas to Reduce Energy Poverty  This post originally appeared at Scientific American. Life without access to energy is simply miserable. The most mundane task, such as heating water to cook rice, can require an entire day\u2019s labor to gather both water and firewood. That labor can be physically exhausting, in some cases immediately dangerous, and often with unfortunate health outcomes. With over one billion people around the world faced with such simple barriers to improving their lives, reducing energy poverty can serve as a shared goal that transcends political, cultural, and regional barriers. Accessing energy is the single most important factor in improving the lives of individuals and increasing the economic opportunities available in their communities. Access to lighting transforms education from outdoors during the day, to indoors and anytime! A simple refrigerator can transform a fruit stand to a grocery store. Reliable electricity allows businesses to stay open and ultimately provides the cornerstone that allows industries to form.  There is a dominant school of thought that energy access can be achieved around the world with only carbon-free sources. This paradigm envisions effectively \u201cleapfrogging\u201d traditional development patterns, skipping industrialization, and transforming economies with green energy and a service economy. While compelling in theory, this vision lacks several critical factors: the need to manufacture the goods that will build the economy, the scalability of energy sources, and the affordability of that energy. The developing world will gain access to energy.This transformation is currently underway and its progress is inevitable. The urgency is created by individuals\u2019 current, difficult conditions and the availability of abundant, affordable energy, particularly coal. All new energy demand will come from the developing world. Without a thoughtful conversation about the projected doubling of world energy demand, energy consumption will continue as it is currently underway, in two parallel paths. One path prioritizes carbon-free sources, and sets goals and policies that incentivize those. The other path responds to the supply and demand inherent in a world economy and is resulting in the massive development of coal-fired electricity generation. The reality of energy development can be summarized in the example of India\u2019s projected energy development. By 2022, India is planning 100 GW of new solar and a relatively tiny 50 MW of new coal. However, a simple calculation of the likely emissions of these two new sources of energy conducted by a colleague at Stanford indicates that if all this new electricity generation came from natural gas, the result would be 20 percent fewer emissions. This is a conversation worth having.  Although not a carbon-free source, natural gas has a transformative role to play in the energizing of developing nations. Abundantly available around the world, and more transportable than ever, a world natural gas market is creating a more stable, affordable supply. As an electricity generation fuel, it is both a baseload alternative to coal and a backup for renewable generation. In this capacity, natural gas provides carbon and non-carbon air emissions benefits. When used as a transportation fuel, natural gas provides significant air quality benefit to traditional fuels and can be equally affordable. When deployed as a cooking fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), provides dramatic health benefits and could reduce the unnecessary 4 million annual deaths attributed to cooking over inefficient, biomass fuels. As an economic cornerstone, natural gas can empower industrial development as a chemical feedstock, fertilizer component, direct energy source, and electricity provider. Trying to boost energy development without fossil fuels creates a critical conundrum.Natural gas cannot improve individual, community, and country outcomes without planning. Natural gas is expensive to develop and requires the appropriate scale to create affordable results for consumers. To realize the benefits of natural gas, we must be willing to acknowledge the possibilities and tradeoffs of this relatively better fossil energy source.  Which isn\u2019t to recommend that natural gas be given a blank check. Appropriate development of natural gas requires thoughtfully navigating its development challenges to ensure it is produced responsibly, priced appropriately, and delivered reliably. Thoughtful planning must address market conditions, import-versus-export balances, appropriate regulatory and taxation schemes, and appropriate infrastructure planning. Natural gas has a vital role to play in allowing many developing countries, particularly those in Asia and East Africa, to reach their potential. Whether one\u2019s primary motivating goal is addressing climate change, creating the conditions for economic prosperity, or raising the world\u2019s most vulnerable out of crippling poverty, a conversation about natural gas is worth having. It\u2019s time to leave behind the antiquated notions of vilifying fossil fuels and instead having a thoughtful, meaningful conversation about real needs and realistic solutions.

Natural gas and LPG are good alternatives to and wind and solar because they are much more reliable and cheaper. The environmental problem of energy poverty is urgent affecting the lives of millions. A priority is for families suffering from cookstove pollution from burning wood, brush, dung and other biomass. It is foolhardy and immoral for rich nations to deny poor nations the major benefits of fossil fuel energy to save lives. Recent studies show this is the most devastating environmental problem today. See the landmark Global Burden of Disease study showing 3.5 million annual deaths from respiratory disease from outside fires.Cooking on traditional cookstoves is a far greater risk factor than poor water and sanitation, lead or radon pollution, or smog (ozone) and outdoor soot, according to the study. Cookstove Smoke is \u201cLargest Environmental Threat,\u201d Global Health Study Finds To remedy this crisis we must consider natural gas as an intermediate solution with its advantages over both coal and renewables.Using Natural Gas to Reduce Energy Poverty  Fossil Fuel Is \u201cGreen Energy\u201d Written by Carl Brehmer on December 4, 2016  INTRODUCTION - EVERYONE ACCEPTS SUMMER IS BETTER THAN WINTER AND 2 DEGREES WARMER IS NOT MUCH CHANGE BECAUSE OF REGIONAL AND NATURAL CLIMATE VARIATION. THEREFORE, TRYING TO MAKE THE CLIMATE COLDER BY REDUCING LEVELS OF LIFE GIVING CO2 SEEMS FOOLHARDY! We have today one of the most astonishing examples of a regression in scientific education. It used to be common knowledge and taught in schools at all levels that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a vital, airborne plant food, but it is currently being condemned as being a \u201cpollutant\u201d because many people have come to believe, due to a massive disinformation campaign, that higher levels of this plant food would be harmful to the biosphere. So pervasive, so effective is this ongoing disinformation campaign that it is now considered by many to be a moral imperative for humanity to abandon the use of its primary source of energy\u2014burning hydrocarbons\u2014because doing so produces CO2. Let me say that again. So pervasive, so effective has been the campaign that has demonized CO2\u2014the gas that feeds the biosphere\u2014that it is now generally accepted that humanity has a moral obligation to limit its production of it, even if doing so would cause a profound regression in global economic development! They say that they have \u201cscience\u201d on their side but do they? Let\u2019s review what science \u201cknows\u201d and what it doesn\u2019t. Science knows that plants using the energy present in sunlight through a process called photosynthesis combine carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to form carbohydrates (CH2O) and expel free oxygen (O2)\u2014the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe. What does the word \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d mean? Carbo \u2013 refers to carbon Hydrate \u2013 refers to water The chemical formula is well known and is often taught in elementary or middle school. CO2 + H2O + photons \u2192 [CH2O] + O2  This is a chart of what science knows about historic, optimal and current levels of atmospheric CO2 in parts per million. The dark green line at 4,000 ppm is where the CO2 level have been in the Earth\u2019s distant past when plant growth was much more robust and dense forests covered much of the Earth\u2019s surface. The light green line at 1200 ppm is where the CO2 level needs to be for optimal plant growth. The bottom yellow line at 400 ppm is the current atmospheric concentration of CO2. True scientific knowledge is based on empirical experimentation and extensive scientific experimentation has demonstrated that ~1200 ppm is the optimal CO2 level for robust plant growth. So well-established is this knowledge that owners of greenhouses spend a lot of money pumping CO2 into their greenhouses to achieve CO2 concentrations in excess of 1000 ppm in order to augment the rate at which they can grow their produce. Never the less for some odd reason many people have come to believe that it is a moral imperative to keep CO2 levels from returning to that level. Not being satisfied with just stopping the return of CO2 levels to that would be optimal for robust global plant growth, these same people even insist that humanity should develop CO2 sequester methods to decrease the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere! Let me repeat that. There are people in this world who, even though CO2 levels are ~300% lower than optimal levels for robust plant growth, insist that humanity should develop methods of artificially reducing the atmospheric concentration of this vital airborne plant food. \u201cUnless we are able to rapidly turn that around and return [CO2 levels] to below 350 ppm this century, we risk triggering tipping points and irreversible impacts that could send climate change spinning truly beyond our control.\u201d 350.org: A global campaign to confront the climate crisis This is in spite of the fact that we have already seen an expansion in global biomass just from the increase in the CO2 levels that occurred during the 20th century.  This image, produced by Boston University/R. Myneni, shows in color the percent change in leaf area over the last 35 years because of the increase in the atmosphere\u2019s CO2 concentration from ~350 ppm to ~400 ppm over that period\u2014the darker the green the higher the percentage of foliage. These people want to reverse this \u201cgreening\u201d of the planet because they say that they care about the biosphere!!?? Why, you should rightly ask, do these people, who fashion themselves as being environmentalists, want to inhibit the Earth\u2019s ability to grow plants at an optimal level? What do they have against robust plant growth? They operate on the premise of two beliefs, two unproven (some say disproven) scientific hypotheses: 1) the first belief is in a scientific hypothesis called \u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d that postulates that a doubling of atmospheric levels of CO2 will cause a 2-4 \u00b0C increase in the average global temperature; 2) the second belief is the strange notion that a 2-4 \u00b0C increase in the average global temperature would be a bad thing. Based on these two beliefs they say that in order to save the biosphere we have to prevent CO2 from returning to levels that would be optimal for robust plant growth!!?? Let\u2019s look at the first of these two beliefs\u2014\u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d\u2014again keeping in mind that CO2 levels will have to double twice from pre-industrial levels (quadruple) in order for atmospheric levels to return to the optimal level for robust plant growth. It is an axiom in science that a hypothesis cannot be used to prove itself. That is, just because a scientific hypothesis exists does not mean that it is true. The \u201cscientific method\u201d requires that a hypothesis be verified by testing it in the real world. Ergo, the hypothesis that a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels (from 280 ppm to 560 ppm) will cause an increase of 2-4 \u00b0C in the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d cannot be tested empirically until it actually happens, which at CO2\u2019s current rate of increase will not occur for another 80 years. Scientists living at that time can then retake the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d and see what it is. (This, of course, depends upon whether or not you accept the validity of the concept of \u201caverage global temperature\u201d, which has been debated.) Since we will then only have one data point\u2014one doubling of CO2 levels\u2014that reading will be meaningless, not only because you cannot draw a valid scientific conclusion based on only one data point, but because there are many natural forces that combine to determine what the surface level air temperature will be over time. To say that changes in surface level air temperature over time are exclusively the doing of changing CO2 levels is scientific malpractice. Beyond that, valid science requires that an experiment be repeated for verification. Thus CO2 levels will have to double again to 1120 ppm, which by the way is the optimal level for robust plant growth, before another temperature reading can be taken in order to test empirically a second time the effect of doubling the concentration of CO2 on the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d. CO2\u2019s current rate of increase is ~2 ppm/year. At that rate the concentration of atmospheric CO2 for optimal plant growth will not occur until after the passing of 7 centuries! Let me state the obvious, no one living today can know the actual effect of doubling the atmospheric concentration of CO2 in the real world (as opposed to flawed computer models) because 1) everyone living today will be long dead 700 years from now and 2) there is no way to separate the effect of CO2 levels on the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d from all of the other many forces that effect the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d over time. Thus the \u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d hypothesis will never progress beyond a belief, a mathematical hypothetical. The fact that many people believe that this particular hypothesis is valid is not empirical evidence that it. Since \u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d is an untestable hypothesis it is what we call pseudoscience. Know this. If anyone writes or says that they know that increasing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 causes \u201cglobal warming\u201d, be aware that they are speaking from ignorance\u2014they are \u201cblowing smoke\u201d. That being said, as mentioned many people believe that CO2 causes \u201cglobal warming\u201d. The difference between knowing and believing is the difference between science and religion. The IPCC even tacitly admits this because it has classified the various assertions present in its last Assessment Report on a \u201cconfidence scale\u201d. Two of the synonyms for \u201cconfidence\u201d are \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cbelief\u201d. Their \u201cconfidence scale\u201d therefore is simply an expression in how firm their \u201cfaith\u201d is in their assertions. The degree of \u201cfaith\u201d that a scientist has in his own theories has never been considered scientific evidence. In fact, so pervasive is the tendency of scientists to be over confident in the truth of their own assertions that the scientific method requires hypotheses be repeatable and repeated by independent investigators. If these independent investigators do not get the same result as the originator of the hypothesis then the hypothesis is falsified, even if the originator refuses to abandon it. This is the current situation that exists with regard to the assertions made by the IPCC about CO2 causing \u201cglobal warming\u201d. Independent investigators have tested their assertions and found them to be wanting. Never the Less the IPCC continues to cling desperately to their beliefs. To continue, let\u2019s talk about the mistaken notion that the average global temperature is currently optimal and that a warmer Earth would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.  This is a chart of the Earth\u2019s historical \u201caverage global temperature\u201d. Over the course of the past 600 million years the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d has never been warmer than 22 \u00b0C nor cooler than 12 \u00b0C even though CO2 oxide levels have been as high as 7,000 ppm during the Cambrian Period within the Paleozoic Age. As you can see the current \u201caverage global temperature\u201d at 15 \u00b0C is near the bottom of this range, because technically we are still in an Ice Age. During this same 600-million-year period there have been five major extinction events none of which correlate with the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d. Some occurred when the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d was down around 12 \u00b0C and others occurred when the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d was up around 22 \u00b0C. The claims therefore that an increase in the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d will necessarily result in a sixth mass extinction are completely unfounded. Beyond that, there is a complete lack of historical evidence that a warmer planet will in any way threaten the health of the biosphere seeing as how historically some of the most robust ecosystems have flourished during periods when the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d was at its maximum of 22 \u00b0C. In conclusion, CO2 is good for the Earth\u2019s biosphere and so is a warmer Earth. Not only is the optimal level of CO2 for robust plant growth 200-300% higher than what it is today, life thrives in the summer and in the lower latitudes because of the extra warmth present then and there, while almost everything goes dormant or dies during the winter and at the poles. Thus if the UN were to succeed in its two misguided goals of 1) lowering CO2 levels and 2) cooling the planet, that would be deadly. MY PUBLISHED COMMENY JAMES MATKIN December 20, 2016 at 7:22 pm | # Wonderful analysis showing the planet is starved of CO2 at only 400ppm. We need more not less. This article offers a most valuable insight to counter the broad misunderstanding by the public of the alarmist unproven theory about the heat forcing of CO2. The alarmists are driven by politics and a distorted environmental religion with very weak science as they confuse the emissions of fossil fuels thinking they are pollution. . The alarmists are very much in majority because they have misled the public to believe the issue is about fossil fuel pollution. NOT TRUE, WHILE CARBON MONOXIDE in auto exhauts IS A DANGEROUS POLLUTANT, CO2 IS NOT A POLLUTANT and the global warming debate has nothing to do with pollution. It is the staff of life and essentil plant food. The average person is confused about what the current global warming debate is about \u2013 greenhouse gases. None of which has anything to do with air pollution.

In simple terms, CO2 is plant food. The green world we see around us would disappear if not for atmospheric CO2. These plants largely evolved at a time when the atmospheric CO2 concentration was many times what it is today. Indeed, numerous studies indicate the present biosphere is being invigorated by the human-induced rise of CO2. In and of itself, therefore, the increasing concentration of CO2 does not pose a toxic risk to the planet.\" - John R. Christy, Ph.D. Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alabama \"Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but a naturally occurring, beneficial trace gas in the atmosphere. For the past few million years, the Earth has existed in a state of relative carbon dioxide starvation compared with earlier periods. There is no empirical evidence that levels double or even triple those of today will be harmful, climatically or otherwise. As a vital element in plant photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is the basis of the planetary food chain - literally the staff of life. Its increase in the atmosphere leads mainly to the greening of the planet. To label carbon dioxide a \"pollutant\" is an abuse of language, logic and science.\" - Robert M. Carter, Ph.D. Professor Emeritus of Environmental and Earth Sciences, James Cook University \"Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. On the contrary, it makes crops and forests grow faster. Economic analysis has demonstrated that more CO2 and a warmer climate will raise GNP and therefore average income. It's axiomatic that bureaucracies always want to expand their scope of operations. This is especially true of EPA, which is primarily a regulatory agency. As air and water pollution disappear as prime issues, as acid rain and stratospheric-ozone depletion fade from public view, climate change seems like the best growth area for regulators. It has the additional glamour of being international and therefore appeals to those who favor world governance over national sovereignty. Therefore, labeling carbon dioxide, the product of fossil-fuel burning, as a pollutant has a high priority for EPA as a first step in that direction.\" - S.

            "answer_text": "In some ways. But of you call \u201cgood\u201d low cost, green energy is typically not good. Reducing pollution is almost always good and green energy typically is a method of producing electricity or heat with less pollution. There is no practical green method of baking limestone to make cement. Cement kilns are a major contributor to greenhouse gasses. Ditto steel and aluminum. To comment on Keith Burgess\u2019 answer: The only practical way to stop polluting the air is Nuclear. Coal mining health related issues and mine accidents have killed hundreds of thousands of people over the past 500 years. Nuclear power has only killed a handful. I would be happy to have a waste repository in my back yard. I would not be happy to have a coal fly ash pile in my back yard. Fly ash is radioactive too\u2026 Furthermore, radioactivity is not always harmful. Google \u201cRadiation Hormesis\u201d.. ",

It is no good if the product, eg a wind generator uses the burning of coal in its production. Nuclear power is NOT green power, nuclear power is an accident waiting to happen, it produces C02 carbons in its construction process, & it produces radio active waste which we can not safely dispose of!!!Keith.

Solar is only about 1/100th as efficient as advanced meltdown proof molten salt nuclear. And that is only 1/10th as eff as fusion, which in itself is still just a thermal source. Even better would be b11 fusion (or something like that) which is directly converted into electricity, like a super duper solar cell from the fusion of elements with low atomic numbers. Above all else is that impossibility, that of finding antimatter. There\u2019s no use in making it (for a large energy source) as that would require even more energy. Just like hydrogen. ",
