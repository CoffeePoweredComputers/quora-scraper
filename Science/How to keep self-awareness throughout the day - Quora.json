            "answer_text": "With the world so full of distractions, keeping yourself aware of your being will help you guide yourself through this cutthroat world. A strong sense of self awareness can be developed if you have the keen desire to look inside. A keen desire to know yourself in your current state. A keen desire to know your soul. Now, I am not an expert on it or anything, but I have tried quite hard to be self aware of everything happening around me, and everything happening inside me. And I ended up researching a lot on this subject, naturally. Being aware what\u2019s happening inside you is the key. Ok, I won\u2019t go ranting about that anymore, since, judging by your question, I can safely guess that you already know it. The first thing that came up in my mind when I looked this question was _______________________________________________________________________ (1) Meditation  Yup. And most people know it. It is in these moments of meditation that we are truly self aware. Mindful meditation. It tunes our mind to become more self aware. Its like training your mind, just like you train your body. And similarity doesn\u2019t end here. If both of these aren\u2019t done on a regular basis, their effect won\u2019t be pronounced. The effects aren\u2019t immediate. I felt a certain kind of peace the first time I did it seriously. True bliss. Didn\u2019t last long, of course. Regularity is the key here. Fit it in your routine. Find a comfy spot, don\u2019t be stiff. Focus on your breathing. Thoughts are bound to come, watch them and gently refocus on your breath. Don\u2019t try to alter your breathing patterns. (2) Self Reflect  Oh this is easy. Take out your pen and paper. Just write about yourself. Your goals, priorities etc. Puke your thoughts on the paper (um.. sorry). Plan yourself out. Important step to consider here is being brutally honest. Unmask yourself. The worst thing you can do to yourself is lying to yourself. Face it. Jot down your strengths and weaknesses. Do it everyday. Sparing yourself just 15 min everyday for this will help you. Its a part of getting to know yourself better. Tell you what, maintain a journal. (3) Read books  Preferably fiction. In these covid times, I finished harry potter. Believe me, it did made me self aware. There\u2019s something about these books. Maybe its the way they present the emotional state of the protagonist in every situation. I was going to say avoid tv as much as you can. But I don\u2019t think I myself stand upto it, cuz i myself end up watching quite a lot of anime everyday, but its declining steadily, I am observing. ________________________________________________________________ Alright, thats it. You will find much more content on the internet related to it. You will notice, that when you are self aware, you dont get affected by the external world. Its like snatching away the power of thoughts, most of which are lies. That was the main reason I wanted to be self aware. Self awareness 24x7 is a feat. Hope you achieve it. ~AyKay Accept and improve (catchy, isnt it? my first answer with a tag line) Source of all images :: GOOGLE ",

            "answer_text": "Keep practicing being \u2018mindful\u2019 in the present moment as many times as you can throughout the day. If you are doing mental or physical work, focus fully on each task, when you are eating food focus on the taste and nourishment you are getting from each mouthful, chew slowly, or when drinking coffee or tea etc.sip slowly and enjoy the taste, eventually it will become an ingrained habit, you won\u2019t need to think about doing it! If you are engaged in business or lead a fast moving personal life, you will tend to let these things and moments pass you by! But as you grow in awareness, you will realise that it\u2019s these ordinary everyday things that are a valuable part of your daily existence! It will help you enjoy every moment of your life to the fullest! Good luck! ",
