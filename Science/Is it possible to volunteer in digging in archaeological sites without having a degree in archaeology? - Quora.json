            "answer_text": "It all depends on the site. I don\u2019t know of any sites that only take people who already have their degrees; most are designed to give training to students. Some sites are strictly field schools, designed for students in archaeology or related fields (e.g. ancient history, conservation). There is usually course credit, and \u201cvolunteering\u201d is accordingly expensive. Some sites have a limit on the number of workers and give priority to students, but will take non-student volunteers if they have vacancies. Some sites will take non-students but restrict them to work where they can\u2019t do much damage, such as washing pottery. Some sites will take anyone who turns up. I\u2019ve dug in Bulgaria and Romania on sites where the supervisors are professional archaeologists but the diggers are a mix of students and \u201colder\u201d volunteers, some of them with backgrounds in archaeology but others with just a keen interest and willingness to learn. Most digging is carefully supervised, and the students aren\u2019t necessarily any more skilled than the other volunteers. If you\u2019re interested, you can look on line - most dig programs make it clear what the requirements are. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, In my area, Portland State University\u2019s Archaeology Department has teamed up with a unit of the U.S. National Parks Service to organize summertime \u201cdigs\u201d in the vicinity of Fort Vancouver. Under the direction of professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and rangers, people of all ages take part in the excavation of tribal villages, camps inhabited by trappers and traders, and barracks of military personnel. Artifacts of all descriptions have been preserved as a result of this effort. Interestingly, former privies yield the greatest number of bottles, utensils, and other household items. Summer volunteers have thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and some young participants have decided to study Archaeology as a result. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",
