            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. Consider a conducting wire being used in any electrical circuit, initially unenergised (switched off). All its free electrons are in random motion within the body of the conductor. They move at high Fermi Speeds of the order of 10^6 m/s and bump into kernels and into each other, without actually exhibiting any net drift in any direction, i.e., across any cross section of that conductor, the net no. of electrons crossing through is zero (that is in layman's terms) the no. of e- crossing left equals no. of e- crossing right.  But if we put the same conductor within an externally generated electric field (circuit switched on), then the electrons experience a net force in the direction opposite to that of the field. As a result, a velocity componenet in the said direction is introduced, in addition to the Fermi Speed. This componenet is called drift velocity, and is of the order of 10^-4 m/s. It is this drift velocity that causes net drift of electrons in the conductor over time.   While the electricity (electromagnetic waves) generated in the conductor as a result of this drift is of the order of 10^8 m/s (speed of light).As you can clearly see, there is an enormous difference between the drift velocity of electrons, and actual velocity of electric currents.                                                           *** Coming to your hypothesis that a battery-powered torch, an individual electron is unlikely to make its way from the battery through the circuit and back to the battery before the battery runs out:Lets assume the net external circuitory between the two terminals of the battery is 1m. Then assuming drift velocity to be 10^-4 m/s, and using time =distance/speedwe obtain time = 10^4 seconds. = 3 hours.Hence, it will take 3 hours of operation of that torch for an electron to makes its way from one terminal of the battery to the other. Mind you this is a conservative estimate.                                                         *** Coming to your last question, I dont think any device, howsoever modern, will bypass Ohm's Law (unless of course it is operating under special conditions such as breakdown, or diffusion), or the speed of light. I think this must hold true in all cases of conductors. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is true. In a conductor (though the exact speed depends upon the properties of the conductor) the electrons drift around a speed of the DRIFT VELOCITY.  Now you can find the exact formula for drift velocity on Wikipedia (Drift velocity) but to give you an idea it is roughly around 1m/hr.  YES. A meter per hour! so how does the actual \"current\" travel so fast? Well if you have ever been to a game of any kind and seen the audience perform the Mexican Wave you will understand:- UK - London 2012 - Olympic Park - Mexican Wave You see how the the Mexican Wave 'travels' but the people actually don't move its the same with electricity the electrons tend to only slowly drift its like the bumping of one electron into the other is what makes the current seem so fast. This concept is analogous to water waves/ a water ripple where we see the wave move but water molecules are not displaced. ",
