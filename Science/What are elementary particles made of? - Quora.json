            "answer_text": "If they are elementary particle then they are not made up of anything or until now we do not know of their substructure. But I suppose by elementary particle you mean proton, electron and neutron Well lets start it from the beginning, First we discovered that everything is made up of atom and thought atom as basic unit of matterThen we found that atom is made up of three particles called electron, proton and neutron and called them elementary particle but then we discovered some other particles like kaons pions etc which made us think that may be these particles are made up of more basic particle then we performed experiments and yes it was true, proton and neutron are made up of \"QUARKS\". These quarks are of six type or in more specific way they are of six flavours.We found that electron is elementary and discovered some other elementary particles also which are now base for standard model of particles.These elementary particles are shown in following image  Until now we do not know whether these particles are sub structured or not.This is all we know with the help of experiments. But there is a theory called String theory which states that all of these particles are sub structured and are made up of vibrating strings of energy. It is not proved experimentally that whether this theory is correct or not. I can not explain it further here because this subject is very vast and can not be explained in a single answer, but google is always there to help you out ",

            "answer_text": "Even though I was myself momentarily tempted to tell you that your question was nonsense, after reading the other answers, and thinking much more carefully (and less egotistically), I have decided instead, that what you\u2019ve asked is actually brilliant. I want to do a couple of things with my entry. First, is to upvote the various answers which correctly point out that what scientists THOUGHT the \u201celementary particles\u201d were, has changed a number of times since the idea of \u201celementary particles\u201d was originated long ago. Therefore, it\u2019s only logical that a fresh student, coming upon the many references which still exist from the past, might be confused by how it appears that The Authority has said \u201cThis Is THE Elementary Particle,\u201d only to follow that up soon after, by the discovery of a text saying \u201cTHE Elementary Particle is made up of This-tons and That-tons and So-ons.\u201d Next, I think we should all stop and look more carefully at the exact word used in the question: ELEMENTARY. That word refers, intentionally or not, to Elements. And we have a very specific definition of what Elements are. They are defined as things like Iron, Oxygen, Gold, and so on. You can find a chart of all the known ones rather easily these days. And so, for any of us who ARE tempted to make fun, and say the question is silly, we should turn our pointing fingers about and realize that in a very real way, the correct answer to the question as asked, is that Elementary Particles, that is Particles which can be identified AS ELEMENTS, are indeed made up of specific protons, electrons and neutrons. Which brings me to the final note, which needs to underlie all the rest of it. That is, the fundamental nature of attempting to think, and to communicate thoughts, using what we generally call LANGUAGE. Language, even when augmented by sound effects and images, is still beset by limitations, which sometimes even accidentally shape what we think of as possible or true. It\u2019s important for anyone who is serious about knowing about the world, to recognize that language will ALWAYS suffer from limitations, and that we need to allow for those limitations in how we search for knowledge, and how we try to express it, and ESPECIALLY how certain we are, that we have IDENTIFIED IT to begin with.
