            "answer_text": "The carbon\u2013fluorine bond is a polar covalent bond between carbon and fluorine that is a component of all organofluorine compounds. It is the fourth strongest single bond in organic chemistry\u2014behind the B-F single bond, Si-F single bond and the H-F single bond, and relatively short\u2014due to its partial ionic character. The bond also strengthens and shortens as more fluorines are added to the same carbon on a chemical compound. As such, fluoroalkanes like tetrafluoromethane (carbon tetrafluoride) are some of the most unreactive organic compounds. ",
