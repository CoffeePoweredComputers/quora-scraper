            "answer_text": "While Jews don\u2019t consider the color (of Moses\u2019 skin) to be relevant, it seems reasonable that his skin would have been a similar pigment to that of his parents. Considering that the Hebrews lived in a desert climate their skin would have probably been some hue of brown, although this is speculative. The snake that Moses saw is described in Jewish sources as being the first snake, i.e., the snake from the Garden of Eden. This helps explain why Moses, who was in a full prophecy with God at the time that he saw it, expressed fear. In other words, the snake that he saw was not just an animal, but the very embodiment of evil itself. The Torah says that God\u2019s first prophecy to Moses occurred at the foot of Mount Horeb, which according to Jewish tradition is Mount Sinai. An interesting footnote: according to Jewish tradition God spoke to Moses using the voice of his father, Amram. Because prophecy was a potentially alarming and overwhelming experience for the fragile human mind, God used this method several times during the initial stages of prophecy, such as with Eli. ",

            "answer_text": "White/Middle Eastern. He was of Jewish ethnicity, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Levi. Numbers 26:59 and Amram's wife was named Jochebed. She was also a daughter of Levi, born to Levi in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam. This is in contrast to darker black skin. When color is mentioned in the Bible they often use Ethiopians as an example who typically have very dark skin. For example, the following verse would make no sense if the people speaking it and listening to it had the same color: Jeremiah 13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Neither are you able to do good--you who are accustomed to doing evil. It\u2019s worth mentioning that you can search the entire Bible for the words \u201crace, ethnicity, color, appearance, etc.\u201d and you won\u2019t find anything. This is because color and physical appearance is irrelevant. It is a distinction without meaning. It makes no more of a difference than your taste in music or TV shows or favorite color or preferred clothing style. There is only one race\u2014the human race\u2014homo sapien. It\u2019s a shame that people continue to be deceived by Satan to continue to emphasize \u201crace\u201d and use it to create castes of hierarchy so people can more easily sin against one another. The snake that Moses fashioned was a bronze snake on a pole. It represented healing by faith in God\u2019s provision and Word. Numbers 21:9 So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he would live. The first time Moses spoke to God was when He appeared to him in the burning bush at a mountain in Horeb. Exodus 3:1 Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. Exodus 3:2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was not consumed. Exodus 3:6 Then He said, \"I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" At this, Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. ",
