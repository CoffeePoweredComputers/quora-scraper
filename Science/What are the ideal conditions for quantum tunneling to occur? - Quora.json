            "answer_text": "It all depends on what you consider to be \u201cideal\u201d. I\u2019m guessing you mean highest probability of occurring, although this would be far from ideal for many applications. Highest probability of quantum tunneling occurring would require a barrier with narrowest width and with peak energy barely greater than energy of a quantum particle. However, this \u201cideal\u201d limit would be a barrier with NO width and with peak energy NOT greater than energy of a quantum particle. Hence, this limit is NOT tunneling. In other words, there is no fine line between highest probability of occurring and not tunneling, and so such an \u201cideal\u201d does not exist.Therefore, your question is meaningless, unless you can provide a different definition of what you consider to be \u201cideal\u201d.

            "answer_text": "There simply needs to be a finite (not infinitely high) potential energy barrier that a classical object cannot penetrate, and a quantum object whose initial wave function lying on one side of that barrier. As time proceeds, the wave function will spread and slowly \u201cleak\u201d to the other side of the barrier. The appearance of this \u201cleakage\u201d implies that there is a non-zero probability of detecting the quantum object on the other side of the barrier. ",
