            "answer_text": "Laws of physics are not complete yet. Every law of physics is correct but can improve and modify with advance understanding. But that doesn't mean that law in present is wrong. Laws in physics correct but may not be complete. Physicist try to find or understand unified theory. We don't now the mechanism of many physics law. Present physics laws are not applicable at singularity. Singularity exist at black hole and at start of Bing bang. So present physics laws are not applicable on this two said conditions. Laws are their for singularity too but we don't know. Like law of Gravitation was present before Newton understand and wrote that. So now we can say that our physical law required 2D to 4D world to implement. Our physical laws are suitable for other than singularity or 1D world. ",
