            "answer_text": "Their is so many natural and non natural activities which destroy or correct word is depletion of ozone layer.  Chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere are broken down by UV radiation, releasing chlorine atoms. These wayward atoms destroy ozone molecules, by pulling away an oxygen atom. Stratospheric ozone is destroyed by the chlorine contained in certain chemicals (other substances also \"eat\" ozone, but chlorine is the most important). Many of these chemicals, called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), were widely used until 1980 in spray cans, plastic foams, refrigerants, and firefighting equipment. CFCs remain intact in the lower atmosphere and eventually drift into the stratosphere (the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is now about four times the natural level). There, they are broken down by UV radiation. Millions of tons of chlorine atoms have been released, each one able to destroy thousands of ozone molecules before it sinks down to the troposphere. Governments have banned the use of CFCs, but it will take several decades to halt damage to the ozone layer. ",

            "answer_text": "Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been identified as themain cause of the destructionto the ozone layer, but there are also compounds containing bromine, other halogen compounds and also nitrogen oxides which cause damage. The chlorine attacks the ozone, one chlorine atom can help to destroy 100,000 ozone molecules. Nonessential products that destroy ozone layer include all aerosol products, pressurized dispensers, and foam products containing, or manufactured with, chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where their chlorinecomponents destroy ozone. CFCs are thought to be a major cause of the ozone hole over Antarctica.
