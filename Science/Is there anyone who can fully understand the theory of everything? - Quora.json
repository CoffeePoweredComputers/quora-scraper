            "answer_text": "Is there anyone who can fully understand the theory of everything? The following words are an alternative. According to V\u00e1zquez-Reyna (2008), matter has the following fundamental properties: First. It is indestructible, and exists in infinite quantity, for which nothing has not existed, does not exist, and will never exist, and conservation laws are generated. The universal order comes from the immutable character of the properties of the primal components of matter. Second. Matter is impenetrable at very short distances. It is and has its own space. At large distances the spaces of atoms (elementary particles) are penetrable, being fields and overlapping generating ordinary space, which is, as they say, property of matter, and it cannot be empty, since it is matter itself. Third. Matter is composed of atoms (elementary particles). The atomic components of Matter possess energy or inertia, are heterogeneous with each other, and the character of heterogeneity is energetic or inertial, that is why movement and opposition to it are generated, the tendency to rest, universal, and the universal diversity. Quarter. By virtue of their energy or inertia, the atoms (elementary particles) of matter with energy and the atoms of matter with inertia are contradictory among them, they apply forces outside of themselves and therefore they become ponderable. These atoms are components of the atoms, so called, of the chemical elements. Fifth. The atoms (elementary particles) are associated with each other by their energy, or by their inertia, that is to say, those of the same essence are integrated among themselves, and by their association, of those that move, those of the dynamic essence, generate the universal movement, life, the universal process of evolutionary integration and universal diversity, and those of the static essence, which oppose life, generate gravity and inertness and try to stop progress by tending to rest, without truce. Sixth. The existence and way of being of matter do not depend on any person observing it, that is, it exists by itself and is, and therefore has objective character. Seventh. It is knowable by itself being an integrated person. And, it reiterates, it generates the knowledge of itself, by itself. Eighth. Its properties are immanent, that is, they constitute it, and they were not created. Ninth. Life is property of dynamic matter. This property manifests itself as organic life when a dynamic entity reaches a certain level of evolutionary integration, that of algae, for example, in which the phenomenon of individuation appears for the first time in the history of the process of evolutionary integration. And much later, in due time, consciousness appears in the individuals who reached the last level of evolutionary integration, achieved to date. ",

            "answer_text": "I have realized that the ones in the best position to understand the Theory of Everything are the Hindu Yogi, because they have a full-spectrum awareness of all the levels of spirituality of a human being, of which the physical level, which is the focus of physics, is only a portion. Since \u201ceverything\u201d must include the higher frequencies of this holographic reality, any purported \u201ctheory of everything\u201d cannot be genuine or complete if it ignores their existence. At the same time, the detail and precision with which modern physicists have probed the physical realm is a good example of how the scientific method should be applied in extension to the finer grade realms of reality. Just for the sake of giving you a concrete answer, I name Gennady Solnechnyy of Bryansk, Russia as one who is aware of and actively studying the fullness of our universe, including these esoteric realms. I will nominate his \u201ctheory of the holographic universe\u201d as a bona fide \u201cTheory of Everything.\u201d ",
