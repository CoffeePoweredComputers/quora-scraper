Of course, whether you agree with me all depends upon how you define the word colour, which turns out to be not as simple as one might first imagine. Regarding colourless, I don\u2019t know. If we took something like a small glass of water where the water is totally transparent. Most people would say that the water is colourless. Does it have a colour? Probably not. ",

It may not be so long before this will be a fact, because there is so much being learned about the brain, and how it commands the rest of our being, including sight. For instance, it has just recently become a reality for color blind to \u201csee\u201d colors with invented equipment, and even, in a few cases, for truly \u201cblind\u201d to see, despite the trauma to their eyes.
