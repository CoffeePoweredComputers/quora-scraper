            "answer_text": "In systems involving heat transfer, a condenser is a device or unit used to condense a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state, by cooling it. In so doing, the latent heat is given up by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment. Applications: Air cooled \u2013 If the condenser is located on the outside of the unit, the air-cooled condenser can provide the easiest arrangement. These types of condensers eject heat to the outdoors and are simple to install.Most common uses for this condenser are domestic refrigerators, upright freezers and in residential packaged air conditioning units. A great feature of the air-cooled condenser is they are very easy to clean. Since dirt can cause serious issues with the condensers performance, it is highly recommended that these be kept clear of dirt. Water cooled \u2013 Although a little more pricey to install, these condensers are the more efficient type. Commonly used for swimming pools and condensers piped for city water flow, these condensers require regular service and maintenance.They also require a cooling tower to conserve water. To prevent corrosion and the forming of algae, water cooled condensers require a constant supply of makeup water along with water treatment. Depending on the application you can choose from the tube in tube, shell and coil or shell and tube condensers. All are essentially made to produce the same outcome, but each in a different way. Evaporative \u2013 While these remain the least popular choice, they are used when either water supply is inadequate to operate water-cooled condenser or condensation temperature is lower that can be achieved by an air-cooled condenser. Evaporative condensers can be used inside or outside of a building and under typical conditions, operate at a low condensing temperature.Typically these are used in large commercial air-conditioning units. Although effective, they are not necessarily the most efficient. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically a heat exchanging device whose primary function is to change the phase of gas to liquid by extracting heat from it( high temperature fluid) this is called condenser. For example in steam power plant condenser is required to change the phase of steam ( high temperature fluid) into liquid water because liquid can handled easily and cheaply compared to high temperature gas. Hope you understand properly ",
