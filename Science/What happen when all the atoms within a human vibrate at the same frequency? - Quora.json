            "answer_text": "What happen when all the atoms within a human vibrate at the same frequency? They don't, but if they did the resonance effect would be very traumatic including, at the very least, death. Especially if there were something driving the resonant frequency. If we ignore the high frequency thermal vibration of atoms (which can't actually be stopped even at temperatures of Absolute zero), I guess you could say that a human being on a swing has atoms all oscillating at the same frequency. What happens? Not much of any great significance except for a bit of fun and, if you recall your childhood, perhaps some joy or, possibly, fear. Of course, if you believe in \"woo\" which misuses and even abuses terms like \"frequency\" and \"energy\", then getting all your atoms to \"vibrate at the same frequency\" means Nirvana is just around the corner :-)  ",

            "answer_text": "This happens all the time in NMR, apply a big magnetic field and RF to produce selective atomic spin alignment, then resonant absorption and consequently photon emission. Obviously not all atoms or molecules resonate at the same frequency, but suppose we mainly deal with water.   Well we are mostly made of water, then you are cooking something. Start with the frequency of a microwave oven at 2.45 GHz for cooking food containing water, but this is not the resonance frequency of water! Water has several modes of resonance, is a molecule, but with 22.235 GHz you have resonance in one of the three possible modes for water. Then microwave use low frequency for a reason, penetration depth, then if you try to use 22.235 GHz you wont get to deep. ",
