            "answer_text": "Humans suck. Like, why do we only have two sets of teeth? That blows. Why can\u2019t we be more like sharks? Sharks have never run out of teeth\u2026 when one breaks off\u2026 another takes it place! Sharks are awesome. And why can\u2019t we biosynthesis vitamin C? Literally EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL (except guinea pigs and monkeys) can biosynthesis their own vitamin C. Let that sink in\u2026 99.9999999% of all living things can biosynthesis their own vitamin C. But not humans. Humans are too stupid. And wtf is up with wisdom teeth? 85% of people get their wisdom teeth removed at some stage in their life. They say that wisdom teeth were used to grind up leaves and nuts for out evolutionary ancestors\u2026 but oh wait you don\u2019t believe in evolution do you? :) And why do our immune systems suck so much? One of my friends is allergic to dairy: her immune system is too incompetent to realise that dairy is, in fact, perfectly harmless. GAHH! And skin cancer! Don\u2019t even get me started on skin cancer\u2026 our sole provider of light, warmth, and energy; the sun, is also emits cancer-inducing UV rays. Tusk tusk. Why can\u2019t our skin just be UV-resistant? Cockroaches are. Cockroaches can also withstand small atomic bombs! You\u2019d think that our marvellous man in the sky could as least give us some body armour\u2026 sheesh. (ok technically cockroaches can\u2019t withstand nuclear bombs but you get my point) And why are our filtration systems so terrible? 97.5% of earths water is saltwater\u2026 and we can\u2019t drink it. But sea lions can\u2026 so why can\u2019t we? Of course, sea lions are capable of excreting highly salty urine, but in my opinion, an intelligent designer would grant humans that ability too. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: If you don\u2019t believe in Intelligent Design, how would you have made humans better? There\u2019s a serious overhaul required on a few things.  Reproduction. WTF is up with periods? Who would think it a good idea to bleed once a month? I would most definitely question previous market testing methods. I don\u2019t know of any female who delights in getting their period with the associated bloating, bleeding, leaking and PMS (unless there\u2019s a pregnancy scare). \u201cOn demand fertilisation\u201d would be the ideal upgrade \u2013 with an opt out altogether option.Feelings. They can be very inconvenient. I demand an opt out altogether option for this too. Or at least a \u2018suspend\u2019 button or function.Willpower. Lets consider a dial, where I could just turn it on and off as needed. Need will power for something? Spin the dial up! We should consider something similar for enthusiasm.Eyes \u2013 we got stiffed. Eagles got a great gig and octopuses did too. Ours are weak and can\u2019t see in the dark for crap.Breakable bones - Some sort of carbon-fibre for bones? I\u2019ve broken several. It wasn\u2019t fun. I want all the bells and whistles. Give me something tough.Limb replacement. Some creatures can replace lost limbs. Let\u2019s make amputation a thing of the past! Let\u2019s just regrow that sh*t.Aging. The built in obsoletion has to go. Very few people would opt for a model that ages so quickly. Let\u2019s fix that up. I don\u2019t want to get nailed by the tough stuff when I get older. No more white hair and wrinkles. No more dull or broken teeth. No more dicky hearts and arthritis. Just an off switch maybe. **The off switch should only be accessible to the owner of the body!Better upgrade potential. Computing companies are always releasing patches to fix issues and upgrade features or provide better protection. We need something like this. I get that we have vaccines but what about the other issues? When people start \u2018dabbing\u2019 or using words like \u2018fam\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m just confused. If you just supplied me a patch or an update, I could understand what the hell they were on about.Boring design. What if I want to go with natural blue fluorescent hair? (PS - I don\u2019t) Right now, I\u2019d have to dye it. Give me the option to upgrade or change out my eyes, hair and skin. I could go completely green on St Patrick\u2019s day.Mute function. Give me the ability to mute people. Enough said.Reset button. Most player games were you can model your own character have a reset button. If you f*ck it up completely, you can just reset back to factory. If we are going to piss around with the stuff above, I strongly recommend that we install one of these as well.No \u2013 I have absolutely no idea how we\u2019d go about doing this. I\u2019m only here to give ideas and I heard there was a buffet lunch included. But seriously. If you sort this stuff out for everybody, I most definitely want to know. I\u2019ll even willingly subscribe to your email newsletter if that\u2019s what it takes. Sign me right the hell up! ",
