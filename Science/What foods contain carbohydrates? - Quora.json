            "answer_text": "This classification is inspired by the excellent work of Jason and Mira Calton authors of the book Rich Food, Poor Food, and many others. I have separated carbohydrates into three categories that are based on nutrient density plus avoiding possible toxins or antinutrients. However, please remember to LISTEN TO YOUR BODY and see how you feel after eating these foods.  Rich Carbs:   Highlights: nutrient dense, low calorie (good for fat loss), rich in fiber. Vegetables: Artichoke, Asparagus, Beet Greens, Arugula, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli, Cabbage, Carrots, Cauliflower, Cilantro, Collards, Cucumber, Eggplant, Endive, Green Onions, Parsley, Peppers, Radish, Rutabaga, Sea Vegetables, Spinach, Swiss Chard, Tomatoes, Yellow Squash, Zucchini, Onions, Kale, Mushrooms, Lettuce, Beets. Fruits: Berries (Raspberries, Blueberries, Blackberries, Strawberries), Cherries, Oranges, Kiwis, Green Apple, Lemon, Lime, Pears, Grapefruit, Guava. Middle-Class Carbs: Highlights: according to individuality, adds variety, good for highly active people. Vegetables: Pumpkin, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Yams, Winter Squash, Rice (preferable wild or white), Quinoa, Oats, Buckwheat, Lentils, Beans, Chickpeas, Corn (make sure to be non-gmo). Fruits: Apricot, Cantaloupe, Melon, Grapes, Banana, Honeydew, Mango, Peach, Passion Fruit, Pineapple, Apples, Papaya, Figs. Poor Carbs: Highlights: AVOID THEM AT ALL COST! Poor Carbs: Canned Fruits, Dried Fruits, Wheat Products, Bread, Pasta, Noodles, Cakes, Pies, Cupcakes, Breakfast Cereals, Pancakes, Waffles, Pita, Couscous, Rye, Bulgur, Triticale, Kamut, Barley, Gluten Free Foods made from other Starches, Candies, Ice Cream (processed), Donuts, Bagels, Croissant, Pizza. Those are the REAL problem when the topic carbohydrate comes to your mind. P.S. All the Poor Carbs I have just mentioned are coming from regular/ commercial sources. Obviously that you can make your own bread with super high quality ingredients and turn it into a healthy food. ",

            "answer_text": "Carbohydrates are found in almost all living things and play a critical role in the proper functioning of the immune system, fertilization, blood clotting, and human development. However, excessive consumption of carbohydrates can lead to obesity, type II diabetes, heart failure and cancer. Unhealthy high carbohydrate foods include pancakes, soft pretzels, bread products, milkshakes, ice-cream, cereal bars, cake, pies, and muffins. Now let me give you a list of foods that are very high in carbs AND are extremely healthy. 1. Quinoa  Quinoa is a seed that has become incredibly popular in the natural health community. Cooked quinoa is 21.3% carbs, making it a high-carb food. However, it is also a good source of protein and fibre. 2. Oats  Oats arguably the healthiest whole-grain food on the planet. They are a great source of many vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Raw oats contain 66% carbs, nearly 11% of which is fibre. Oats are also a relatively good source of protein, containing more than most grains. 3. Banana\u2019s  (I\u2019m pretty sure you know what a banana looks like. Just in case you don\u2019t know it\u2019s the long yellow thing above.) Banana\u2019s are made up of about 23% carbs, either in the form of starches or sugars. Unripe, green bananas are higher in starches, which transform into natural sugars as the bananas ripen, turning yellow in the process. Bananas are high in potassium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. ",
