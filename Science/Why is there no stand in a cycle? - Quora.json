            "answer_text": "If you are cycling on a MTB with a kickstand attached, cycling on rough terrain could be dangerous.  The stand could drop down to its parking position during a bump. The stand can easily get itself hooked to obstacles along the way like roots or rocks causing you to have an accident. This can cause serious injury not only to you but also to the person cycling behind or beside you should he fall right on your protruding stand. You can easily buy one to install if there is none supplied with the bicycle. There are stands which are adjustable in length for 20\u2033 to 700C bicycles.  Or the cheaper old school models either with or without locks.  Note that if you use a kickstand, you do need a flat surface to stand your bicycle on. So, that may defeat the purpose of getting one if places you plan to cycle to are uneven or gets soft or muddy during rainy days. However, if you like tinkering with your bike or adding stuff to it, it is easier to do so if it is standing properly with a kickstand. Most road bike users would not want a stand installed to reduce weight. ",
