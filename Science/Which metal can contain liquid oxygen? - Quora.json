            "answer_text": "Liquid oxygen has a pale blue color and is strongly paramagnetic: it can be suspended between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet.[1] Liquid oxygen has a density of 1.141 g/cm^3, slightly denser than liquid water, and is cryogenic with a freezing point of 54.36 K (\u2212218.79 \u00b0C; \u2212361.82 \u00b0F) and a boiling point of 90.19 K (\u2212182.96 \u00b0C; \u2212297.33 \u00b0F) at 101.325 kPa (760 mmHg). Liquid oxygen has an expansion ratio of 1:861 under 1 standard atmosphere (100 kPa) and 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F),[2][3] Oxygen tank - Wikipedia  Liquid oxygen in a beaker with a blue color. Liquid oxygen in a cryogenic storage dewar (vacuum-insulated flask) is used in aerospace, submarine and gas industries. Oxygen storage - Wikipedia A vacuum flask (also known as a Dewar flask, Dewar bottle or thermos) is an insulating storage vessel that greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than the flask's surroundings. Vacuum flasks are usually made of metal, borosilicate glass, foam or plastic and have their opening stoppered with cork or polyethylene plastic.  Vacuum flask - Wikipedia Oxygen tanks containing pressures up to 200 bar (3000 psi) are used for industrial processes including the manufacture of steel and monel, welding and cutting, medical breathing gas, diving and as emergency backup in aircraft. A small steel tank of 16 liters water capacity with a working pressure of 139 bar (2015 psi) holds about 2150 liters of gas and weighs 28 kilograms (62 lb) empty.[5] 2150 liters of oxygen weighs about 3 kilograms (6.6 lb)  Industrial compressed gas cylinders used for oxy-fuel welding and cutting of steel. A gas cylinder or tank is a pressure vessel used to store gases at above atmospheric pressure. High-pressure gas cylinders are also called bottles. Oxygen is rarely held at pressures higher than 200 bar / 3000 psi, due to the risks of fire triggered by high temperatures caused by adiabatic heating when the gas changes pressure when moving from one vessel to another.

            "answer_text": "For liquid oxygen they are generally made of stainless steel but some of the liquid oxygen processing equipment is made of aluminum. In principle you can make a tank from aluminum but because it is a high pressure gas stainless is the preferred material. ",
