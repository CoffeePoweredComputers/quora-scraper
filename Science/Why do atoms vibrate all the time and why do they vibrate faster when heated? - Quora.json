            "answer_text": "Thermal energy induces molecular motion aka oscillations of the EM fields surrounding the atomic nuclei. At zero degrees Kelvin (hypothetically) all oscillations cease. The frequency of oscillation is a function of EM structure; it\u2019s the amplitude of oscillation that varies with magnitude of thermal energy being processed. ",

            "answer_text": "The forces that bind atoms together have a small component of \u201cspringiness\u201d, which allows them to vibrate like spring oscillators. Heat is simply a measure of that vibrational energy, so adding heat (aka raising the temperature) increases the amount of vibration. ",
