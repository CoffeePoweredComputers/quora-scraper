            "answer_text": "To do *anything*, you only need two things: A strong enough desire and a deep enough pocket. If you wanted to live on the moon, could afford to make the journey and set-up camp, you can do it. Setting up camp. That's where the other posted answers start to come into play. You are going to need to replicate earth-like conditions on the moon, just like the international space station has replicated them in low earth orbit. You are going to need a temperature controlled space that is under some [air] pressure (to keep your insides from boiling out of you), suitable atmosphere to breath, some source of power to run all of that, food and water, a way to eliminate waste products, and a means of protecting yourself from cosmic radiation. Unless your environment is self-sustaining, you're going to need regular supply runs to keep you going. There is nothing on that list that we do not know how to do -- there is fundamentally nothing that needs to be 'invented'. You just need to get all that stuff from the earth to the moon and get it set up. Someone will no doubt say that we'll need to invent a super heavy lift rocket to launch it all into space, but I say \"nay nay\". If you want to build it all here and set the pre-assembled stuff to the moon then you may be right, but we can launch a few tons to the outer planets every day of the week, so we have the technology to put tons of stuff onto the moon. We know the stuff we need to get there, so figure out how many rockets it's going to take and start loading them up. (Remember, we have uber-deep pockets so money is no object!) Put a few into low earth orbit that get joined together to make the trans-lunar vehicle, launch the supplies to it, drop in a guy (or gal) with a hammer and a wrench, and send them off to build their moon camp. Send me a post card once they get there. ",

            "answer_text": "What are the requirements to live on the moon? We know pretty much what is needed to live in harsh and isolated environments, including the South Pole Research Station in the six-month Antarctic winter, and the ISS in low Earth orbit, with regular resupply and a routine way to get there and back. The other answers given here have covered those requirements. So we could build a moon base on the same basis, assuming that we can afford either to lift all of the materials, equipment, and people to build it to the moon, or bootstrap a manufacturing process using materials on the Moon. We have been unwilling to fund any humans going to the Moon for decades. What we do not know is how to build a self-sustaining community with all of the resources needed to produce everything it uses, capable of maintaining human health for long periods in low gravity. Nearly all of the elements needed are available on or very near the surface, including rare-earth elements. The major exceptions are carbon and nitrogen. It is possible that they could be found spread out thinly in craters made by carbonaceous chondrites or comets containing water and amino acids. That does not mean that mining them would be practical. We certainly do not have the technology to go and get a comet and land it on the Moon. The colony or research station or whatever would need to import its solar cells and other semiconductor products. They are made on Earth in billion-dollar fabs that depend on supply chains of thousands of other companies for equipment and supplies. A detailed plan would have to consider vast multitudes of details like these. It would also have to answer the question Why? ",
