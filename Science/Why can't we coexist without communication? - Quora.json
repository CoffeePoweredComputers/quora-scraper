            "answer_text": "Because one person cannot know everything. This is one evolutionary reason why communication came about. That is, you know something that I do not and therefore you could tell me information that could help me in the present or future. Another reason for communication as postulated by some evolutionary biologists is that communication was evolved to deceive or to change the nervous system of another body. Whatever the reason for it coming about, it is now used for a wide varitety of reasons with humans. We use it to allot people the correct time to pick us up at the train station.We use it to communicate gratitude towards others for their help.We use it to warn others of danger.We use it to let others know we\u2019ve been hurt and to hurt others(unfortunately)We use it to explain a concept we have in our minds by articulating arguementsSo you see, there are many practical uses to communication. Whatever it\u2019s evolutionary reasons for existing, we can say we have hijacked it for more diverse and important ends. If we tried to coexist without communicating, there would be no need to build societies because we would never know what each person was on about. If there were no signals going from me to you telling you I want you to do this or that, it would be impossible for you to infer what I want. Because there is at least an infinite amount of things you may want me to do. We have to limit that set and therefore communication & negotiations come about. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to be brief, but a thorough answer could be a book. Imagine you are living in a caveman society thousands of years ago. There was no language, so communication had to depend on gestures and sign language. Perhaps the single word vocabulary of this cave society was \u201cUgh\u201d. Coexistence depended on who had the greatest physical strength. The second most influential person was the one having more muscle that the rest of the tribe, save the number one leader. Everyone had a place in the pecking order. To keep peace each person kept to his or her place. This wasn\u2019t the most friendly of societies. The weaker person would sometimes get disgruntled by the citizens who were juggling for a higher spot on the ladder of authority. The cave society was one that was based on the survival of the fittest. As you can imagine, it was the weaker people who stood in line, and would eat last. Of course this social structure worked as long as fairness was observed. Fairness did not always occur in the caveman society any more than fairness occurs in our \u201ccivilized\u201d society. Now, our communication tools have advanced to include millions of dictionaries and books on library shelves throughout the world. Disagreements could still be settled in the manner of the caveman, or with the option of using a more sophisticated setting such as a courtroom where lawyers and judges and juries gather to settle a dispute. Can you imagine what it would be like if all those present would be limited to a single word vocabulary of \u201cUgh\u201d? ",
