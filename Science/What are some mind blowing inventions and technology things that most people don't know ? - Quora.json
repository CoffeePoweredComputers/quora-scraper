            "answer_text": "As of September 2016: 1. Genome Editing with CRISPR-Cas9  Every so often, a tool comes along that completely changes how scientists do their work. CRISPR-Cas9 is one of those tools. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, it\u2019s basically a new technique that allows scientists to make specific changes to specific genes in living cells. Such a thing was possible in the past, but the methods were slow and cumbersome, so they weren\u2019t widely adopted, and therefore didn\u2019t have much of an impact on the world. 2. Philips GrowWise - Growing the future  Pretty soon, the world is going to reach a tipping point. We\u2019ll have too many people living on the planet, and not enough arable land to raise crops to feed all the hungry mouths. Agriculture will need to adapt in order to keep pace, and one of the most promising ways it\u2019s doing that is by moving indoors. Indoor farms carry a number of big advantages. They don\u2019t require the use of herbicides or pesticides; they can be built in urban areas to eliminate shipping costs; and they can even grow plants faster and more efficiently than traditional farms. 3. Introducing Project Loon  It\u2019s easy to take for granted here in the developed world, but there\u2019s currently about 4 billion people on this planet who don\u2019t have access to the Internet. That\u2019s well over half the globe. Bringing those remaining people online will undoubtedly have an enormous impact on the world \u2014 but making that happen is easier said than done. Internet access requires infrastructure that\u2019s difficult to build in developing countries, so it can take years to bring it to underdeveloped parts of the world. Thankfully, Google has developed a clever workaround. Instead of spending millions to install fiber optic lines underground, the search giant is bringing cheap wireless Internet to remote regions of the world via a network of high-altitude balloons. 4. ORBCOMM-2 Full Launch Webcast  In case you missed it, 2015 was the year that we figured out how to land rockets. Aerospace companies have been trying to do this for decades, but 2015 was the year that a few of them finally managed to do it. Jeff Bezos and his Blue Origin team brought one back down from suborbital heights, and shortly thereafter Elon Musk and SpaceX brought one back down from near Earth orbit. This is no small accomplishment. From this moment onward, the cost of getting stuff into space will get lower and lower, which will have an enormous impact on just about every person on the planet. Cheaper access to space means more satellites, better telecommunications networks, more accurate weather prediction, and much more. In a few years time, there\u2019s no telling what we\u2019ll build up there \u2014 space stations, telescopes for exploration, maybe even space-based solar arrays that beam unlimited electricity back down to Earth. The sky is no longer the limit. 5. Artificial neural networks are already here, but they\u2019re poised to get even bigger, badder, and more sophisticated in the next couple years. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, ANNs are basically simulated brains that are run on traditional computers. It\u2019s important to note that in these simulated brains, we can give the software \u201cneurons\u201d basically any programming we want. We can try to set up their rules so their behaviour mirrors that of a human brain, and we can also use them to solve problems in ways that nobody has ever dreamt of before.  6. Bitcoin has left an indelible mark on the modern world, but the technology it\u2019s built on might actually end up having a bigger impact. The Blockchain, as it\u2019s called, is a decentralised, widely distributed public database used to record Bitcoin transactions. It started off as the public ledger for a digital currency, but lately it\u2019s begun to branch out and find applications outside of Bitcoin. Programmers are now using it to build things like distributed cloud storage solutions that are impervious to outages, self-executing contracts, and alternatives to our ridiculously complicated patent system.  In the future, the Blockchain could even be used to build a tamper-proof electronic voting system that\u2019s immune to political corruption. And this is just the beginning. There\u2019s already a large number of startups out there using the technology in new (and potentially game-changing) ways, and they\u2019ll only become more abundant in 2016. 7. 2015 was a monumental year for drones. It was arguably the year that the UAVs transitioned from a fringe hobbyist affair and became a full-fledged mainstream phenomenon. Drones are everywhere now, but for all the popularity they\u2019ve gained of the past 12 months, the tech is still very young in the grand scheme of things. We\u2019re really just beginning to scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible with autonomous UAVs.  In 2016, drones will become practically ubiquitous. Film-making, surveillance, land management, agriculture, and package delivery are all being impacted by them. The FAA is expected to roll out formal regulations for commercial drone use sometime in 2016, and as soon as that happens, it\u2019ll be off to the races. A number of different companies (including Amazon) are already developing drone-based delivery solutions, so shortly after the government lays down some rules, the shipping industry will likely experience a major tectonic shift. 8. Solar roadways  Indiegogo, a company based in San Francisco, has developed a technology to convert roads into solar power houses. 9. Solar plane  A solar-powered plane has made its debut flight in Switzerland in June 2014. Aeroplanes running on solar energy would reduce our dependence on petroleum and help check pollution. 10. Driverless car  Google has released a car in May 2014 that has no steering wheel, pedals or brakes, and the only manual control would be an emergency \u2018stop\u2019 button. Chris Urmson, director of Google\u2019s self-driving car project, said it was \u201cAn important step toward improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people\u201d 11. Sports car running on cooking oil  Makers Trident, a British manufacturing company, has launched a sports model Iceni that not only exceeds speeds of 200 km/hr but can travel more than 3000 kilometres on a single tank of cooking oil! 12. Bio-plastic from banana peels that can replace petroleum-based plastics  Elif Belgin, a teenage girl from Turkey, has invented the above, and won the \u2018Best Science in Action\u2019 Award at the Google Science Fair internationally in 2013. Banana peels are a waste and this can help utilise the same, reducing our dependence on petroleum and would also be biodegradable, thus being less harmful ecologically. 13. X-Men style shoes that enable one to walk on the ceiling  It has been done by way of electromagnetism by Colin Furze, a British scientist. Walking on the ceiling is no longer unimaginable! 14. Technology from toilets One Washington-based company, Janicki Industries, designed a power plant that could feed off the waste from a small city to produce 150 megawatts of electricity, enough to power thousands of homes. The University of the West of England, Bristol, has showcased a urine-powered fuel cell to charge mobile phones overnight. ",
