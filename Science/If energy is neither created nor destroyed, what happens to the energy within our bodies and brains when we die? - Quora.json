            "answer_text": "When you die, your matter and energy return back to the planet Earth from whence they came. Your heat energy radiates away into your surroundings. Some of your stored chemical energy may stay with your body if it\u2019s buried, but if your body is cremated, most of your chemical energy is converted to heat and radiates into Earth. Either way, both your energy and your matter (the atoms of which you are made) will continue to exist for billions of years after you die. If you\u2019re trying to ask about \u201clife after death\u201d, there is none. Death is death. Dead is dead. Your consciousness and memory are metaphenomena of the activity of your brain, and cease to exist when your brain stops functioning. This is why dead, brain-dead, and comatose persons cannot have conversations with you, and why rocks don\u2019t talk. If this contradicts what your religious preacher tells you (and it probably does), then your religious preacher is full of shit. Religions exist for the purpose of taking your money and placating you; there is no literal truth to them; there is no afterlife, no Heaven, and no Hell; when you die, your consciousness, memory, and personality simply cease to exist, and you become just a memory in the minds of the people who surround you. So make your legacy a good one, so that people don\u2019t say after you die, \u201cThat John Smith guy was a real asshole!\u201d, but rather, \u201cJohn Smith was a brilliant and caring fellow!\u201d. Your deeds determine your legacy, so be the kind of hero you want other people to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Going to break this question down to three levels: 1. Body (matter):    As aptly described by other answers here (especially Suraj Manjesh's) our body retains bulk (if not all) of our energy in the form of Chemical energy (bonds, matter, mass).This is then converted by the ceaseless action of nature (and increasing entropy) to other forms. Whether that is oxidation (redox), decomposition (burial) or combustion, which then release the energy to other forms (and 'vessels').  2. Thoughts and memories:    These are a result of electric signals passed through an intricate web of neurons. As long as these signals (indeed an outcome of utilizing chemical energy) pass, we think/ reminisce, but once we die and hence lose the ability to pass said signals, the web of neurons become nothing but a subset of point 1 and follows the same laws. 3. The Soul ? : Now to the controversial part. The soul's existence hasn't been established conclusively. So how can we even debate about what happens to something we aren't even sure exists! Hopefully in the future, someone might be able to edit this point. I'd like to believe there is a Soul that unites itself with pure energy, but that might just be my wishful thinking. No proofs so I suggest no answers here! In no way am I an expert in this field and these are my opinions. Constructive feedback is warmly welcomed, as always. ",
