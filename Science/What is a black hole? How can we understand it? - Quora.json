            "answer_text": "This answer could go on forever! Black holes are the most massive single-structures in the universe as we know today.  Most of the information that we have on black holes come from theories that are based on astrophysics and observation.  Black holes are mind-bogglingly massive celestial bodies where the gravitational forces are so immense that nothing - not matter nor radiation nor waves - can escape them.  Everything is \"sucked\" (attracted) to the core.  The \"core\" of the black hole is known as the singularity.   There are a few ways for black holes to form.  Some of them formed along with galaxies and are known as \"primordial black holes\" and are generally supermassive black holes.  This is still subject to some hypothetical physics.   The most common black holes are generally smaller.  The most likely way for them to have formed is when two or three stars are in a relationship.  This is known as a binary or trinary star system.  There is usually one star - the larger of the set - that will slowly take away matter from the others due to its superior gravitational forces.  This causes the main star to become more and more massive.  As time goes, the main star becomes more and more massive, denser and denser and eventually, the outward forces caused by nuclear fusion can no longer sustain the weight of the star.  The star's center becomes unstable and it collapses upon itself.  At this point, the star becomes a black hole and at the axis of rotation, an ultra-strong gamma-ray burst occurs.  This energy is so intense that no planet or star standing in the burst's ray could endure.  The black hole now behaves differently than the original star.  It will continue to engulf the matter from its partnered star(s) and as time goes, it will do so more and more quickly.   The three-dimensional anatomy of a black hole is very interesting.  At the core of the black hole, an infinitely-dense core known as a Singularity is also the \"power source\" of the black hole.  All matter is attracted to this site.  There is an axis of rotation upon which the entire structure rotates.  During its inception formation, this is the site through which the gamma radiation is ejected.  This is an infinitesimally-brief period -- typically lasting 2 - 50 seconds depending on how it was formed and how large the black hole is.   Outward from the singularity, there is an inner and outer event horizon.  The event horizon is the point of no return basically.  Once matter reaches this point, it is destined to fall into the singularity.  The outer event horizon funnels energy and matter to the inner event horizon.  outward from the outer event horizon is the ergosphere.  The ergosphere is the outermost part of the black hole - so to speak.  It is believed that in this region, higher-energy particles can escape.  The last item to discuss is the accretion disc.  This is a disc that rotates around the entire structure and is similar to the rings you would see rotating around a large gas giant like Saturn - however on an immensely-larger scale.   Again, nothing escapes a black hole.  When a smaller star (like our sun) dies, generally it swells as the nuclear fusion reactions go out of control driving the star outward.  Then at some point, the star's core becomes unstable when fusion results in iron.  At this point, the star collapses on itself and produces a short gamma burst and the star becomes a super-dense white dwarf.  However, you can see and observe the star.  Unlike the super-dense white dwarf (or neutron star with larger stars than our sun), the black hole's singularity is so massive and so attractive that light - though it exists in large quantities - cannot escape.  Thus, there is nothing observable by the eye or instruments which measure and detect light, radiation and other waves.  Instead, we can \"observe\" black holes because of their effect with matter.  So we can observe rogue planets and other matter.  Generally when a rogue planet is not in any active orbit around something more massive than itself, its trajectory is linear.  However, if the object approximates the black hole, you will notice a change in its trajectory.  Assuming that it is far enough away from the black hole, it will simply change its course of direction.  If, however, its trajectory brings it close enough to the black hole, it will either become matter that rotates around the black holes accretion disk or it will become trapped inside the event horizon and eventually the singularity.   I'm not an astrophysicist so some of my answer may be generally correct or altogether incorrect.  However, this is the best of my understanding.  I find black holes to be very intriguing.   ",

            "answer_text": "A black hole is currently \"understood\" as a place in the universe where our understanding of the laws of physics breaks down and is no longer true, which makes the question of \"understanding\" them rather difficult.  I think it can be somewhat achieved, though, by looking at the stages a star goes through before it reaches the TOV limit (the final mass limit for a cold neutron star) and collapses to form a \"black hole\". So, first you have a happy star, chugging away converting hydrogen into massive nuclear explosions to sustain its core (using fusion).  This goes on for a couple of billion years before the star runs out of hydrogen to burn - for fuel, it then turns to heaver particles with more energy in the nucleus, like helium etc., slowly moving it's way up the periodic table in weight as it burns up all of the lighter elements.  This causes the surface of the star to expand because the heavier, more energetic particles give off more powerful nuclear explosions at the core.  This is all fine and dandy until it reaches Fe (Iron) - Iron has too much energy in it's nucleus to be used as a fuel source for nuclear fission, and the explosions quickly become too violent and unstable in the core, causing the star to explode - this is called a supernovae. For most main sequence stars, it stops here - these aren't the stars you're asking about though.  The ones you're asking about are the super-giants, 15 to 30+ solar masses while healthy, and their deaths get very interesting.  What happens first is a rather remarkable thing; there is so much matter that is exploding out of the star (30 suns worth to be exact) that the gravity exerted by all of this mass is unfathomably huge - so great, in fact, that it stops the supernovae in its tracks, while it is still expanding, and forces it to begin compressing again.  There is one huge, important difference this time however - there are now no explosions at the core of all of this rapidly compressing matter to stop it from shrinking once it reaches it's original size, so it keeps on compressing and getting smaller and smaller. Now we encounter the final vanguard against black holes - the degeneracy pressures.  These are forces that arise as a result of something we call the \"Pauli exclusion principle\", or the principle that \"two fermions with the same half-integer spin cannot occupy the same quantum space at the same time\" - this means that you can't have two or more electrons in the same spot at the same time (or 2+ protons in the same spot, or 2+ neutrons in the same spot).  The reason that this becomes relevant to us is because the star-matter will continue compressing and smashing together with nothing to stop it until it is just a sea of free-floating electrons and protons - this is called a White Dwarf.  The reason that some would-be black holes stop collapsing here is because of the Proton/Electron Degeneracy Pressures, meaning that the protons/electrons couldn't compress any further due to gravity without two being in the same space, violating the Pauli exclusion principle, so there is actually a force (or pressure) that arises to stop this from happening.  This \"degenerate force\" is unimaginably strong and can stop all but the most massive stars from becoming a black hole, however there is one even greater force in the universe that stops an even more massive body from collapsing - namely, Neutron Degeneracy Pressure and Neutron Stars. If a white dwarf has so much mass that the gravity force is overcoming even the proton/electron degenerate pressure, something interesting happens - all of the protons and electrons suddenly fuse and become neutrons (which are more massive particles), causing the star to shrink even more, however the degenerate pressure from neutrons is so much greater than the degenerate pressure from electrons/protons that it can almost always stop the collapse here. When it still isn't enough to stop gravity at this point, we get a black hole - the surface of a neutron star will suddenly \"disappear\" to our eyes and instruments because the neutrons compressed so much that they created a spherical region in space where gravity is so strong that it overpowers light.  Because information is light for all intents and purposes, we physically cannot extract any information about this region of space, nor will anything inside a black hole ever be able to communicate with something outside of that same black hole.  This is probably the best I can do to answer your question my friend. ",
