            "answer_text": "ALLOY : An alloy is a combination of metals or of metal and another element . Alloys are defined by metallic bonding character .An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements or a mixture of metallic phases . Alloys are usually produced by melting the mixture of ingredients . In the present era the most important is steel any element added to steel other than carbon ans steel is considered as an alloying element . The principal alloying elements for steel are chromium, nickel, manganese, molybdenum, silicon, tungsten, vanadium, and boron. They all are meant for different functional property of the steel .  The above is a common alloy known as brass which is corrosion resistant and is commonly used for making decorative items like lamps . COMPOUND : Metallic compounds are frequently rather complex mixtures (those treated commercially are for the most part sulfides, oxides, carbonates, arsenides, or silicates), and they are not often types that permit extraction of the metal by simple, economical processes. Consequently, before extractive metallurgy can effect the separation of metallic elements from the other constituents of a compound, it must often convert the compound into a type that can be more readily treated. Common practice is to convert metallic sulfides to oxides, sulfates, or chlorides; oxides to sulfates or chlorides; and carbonates to oxides. The processes that accomplish all this can be categorized as either pyro-metallurgy or hydro-metallurgy.  These are a few examples of chemical compounds . These are non-homogeneous they are made of different elements . ",

            "answer_text": "An alloy is when elements are added to a matrix of another element to achieve a desired effect.  In theses pictures you see: the original atomic matrix(red), alloying elements replacing original atoms(blue), and alloying elements entering the matrix between the original atoms(green). See how it is less of a combination of atoms and more of an addition or replacement of atoms? An alloy is essentially the same material with extra qualities. In a compound, the atoms of two elements are combined to form a new material. Take for example water:  it is a compound of hydrogen(red) and oxygen(white). See how they are bonded together? A compound is materials combined to form a new material with different qualities altogether. ",
