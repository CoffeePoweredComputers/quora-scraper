            "answer_text": "Oh, what fun! Please point me at that island right now! Under normal circumstances I am never without my day bag: I even carry it with me when we go shopping or visiting friends. It contains a variety of objects that will serve me very well in just such a scenario, including boxes of matches sealed in plastic bags; a magnifying glass; ski rope and string; multi-tool; two pocket knives and a spike; binoculars; cellular telephone in waterproof plastic bag; modified wind-up torch with recharging facility; slingshot; fishing line and hooks; small rip-stop nylon tarp and a rudimentary first aid kit. I have lived in the bush for a while and know how to make traps and snares, including for catching fish; can build all manner of shelters and know how to purify even the filthiest of water. First filter it through grass stalks laid horizontally over a container (coconut shell, large, folded leaf or clay pot - assuming you know how to make one) to remove the larger particles. Then make a bundle of grass, tie it tightly together, stand or hang it vertically over your container and slowly pour your water over the top end. It will drip out the bottom with most of the smaller particles removed. If you want clear water, you may consider filling a few half coconut shells with beach sand, standing them one on top of the other in a sort of column with an empty half-shell to crown it. Pour your water into the empty half-shell and wait as it travels downward into the lowermost half-shell, which should also be empty. Then heat up your water next to the fire, let it cool and Bob\u2019s your uncle. If you make a strong, dense shelter and place your fire at the entrance-way, you won\u2019t be much plagued by flying insects. Sprinkle the ash from your fires on the floor of your shelter and around the outside. Nothing likes ash, so you will be free of creeping insects - and snakes will also stay out. I\u2019ve watched \u201cNaked and afraid\u201d and am struck by the ignorance of the supposed \u201csurvival experts\u201d, especially in areas where there are large, dangerous predators. To lessen the chances of them entering your camp, the guys should walk around the perimeter and urinate at crotch height on the foliage. This establishes a \u201cterritory\u201d. Females must not do this, as it could attract male \u201csuitors\u201d to the camp or act as a catalyst to a confrontation with a competing female. Keep some long sticks nearby, to which bundles of grass can be bound, to act as defence if attacked at night. Place the grass end into the fire and when it catches, run at the animal, making much noise and leading with the burning end of the stick. No predator wants a mouthful of fire and no animal wants to be burned anywhere else. Make a great show of bravado: even the mighty elephant shies away from the innocuous egg-eating snake  because of the ferocity it displays! Unless you have a profound knowledge of the vegetation types on the island, stay away from the fruits and other edible-looking plants: they may be toxic or cause an allergy or other unwanted reaction. Only people who have been bitten by certain species of ticks are allergic to red meat: nobody is congenitally allergic to it Alpha-Gal Allergy, though there are people who are allergic to eggs, fish, shellfish and all kinds of plant matter, including nuts. I won\u2019t survive on such and island: I\u2019ll thrive - because it will not cause me any hardship at all. I\u2019ll regard it as a long-deserved holiday - and even if I were left there for a few years, I\u2019d absolutely be in my element. Now, if my wife were there with me, we\u2019d probably have to be dragged off, kicking and screaming, by would-be \u201crescuers\u201d - if they could find and capture us, that is. ",

            "answer_text": "I would take my Tracking Knife which has several uses including a ferro rod that will make fire starting easier. Second, I would take a combo Ax with a saw built into the handle. This will allow me to build shelter and other such things that I would need to survive. If I had the option to have a few other things. I would have my Leatherman multi tool. For obvious reasons. Paracord. This will allow me to not have to worry about making my own rope from vines or from other sources. Not to mention that I can also make fishing line and so forth. However if I really needed to just grab and go, I would take one of my GOOD bags. I have a few depending on what situation comes up, not to mention time. For example if I had say? 15 minutes before I had to leave I could dump out two of my bags and consolidate the equipment for the situation. If I needed to just go I would grab my main bag and go from there. Now you're asking what does one have that I wouldn't have in the other's? Well first thing would be if I was going to a fallback position where I know certain supplies are, including food, water and shelter. However if I had to \u201cRun & Gun\" I would grab a different pack, and so forth. ",
