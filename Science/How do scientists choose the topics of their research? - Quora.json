            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an established scientist by any stretch of the definition (heck, I\u2019m not even a scientist according to the popular interpretation of the term), but I can tell you how I chose my master\u2019s and PhD subjects. The short answer is that I fell upon them \u201cby chance\u201d so to speak. For my master\u2019s, I wanted to to something related to machine learning and artificial intelligence and I figured the Internet of Things (IoT) was a good way to do it and also my background in mechanical engineering could be useful. I had previously interned in a research lab in Japan where, among other things, I worked on predictive maintenance for wind turbines and so predictive maintenance came into focus. As I surveyed the literature and tinkered with IoT software such as GE\u2019s Predix, PTC\u2019s Thingworx and IBM\u2019s Watson IoT. The AI features of these softwares felt diluted and dumbed down to a point where it was just \u201cone more feature\u201d so I decided to dig into the predictive maintenance literature. I identified research gaps and focused my attention on one of them and went on to do the work and get my Master\u2019s of Applied Sciences in software engineering. While I was doing my master\u2019s, I used various machine learning algorithms and I realized that tuning their architectures and parameters was more art than science. I naively wanted to take an optimization algorithm that had never been used before to tune convolutional neural networks, get my PhD and vamoose. As I was doing my literature review, I found that something wasn\u2019t right with the type of optimization algorithm I was using. More specifically, many of the papers being published on the subject were based on objectively bad methodology. After a while, it became so apparent that I couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore and shifted my focus to that instead. Fast forward a year or so and I have 4 research articles in the pipeline, one of which is published already (link: A critical analysis of the bat algorithm). If after completing my PhD I end up in some kind of academic position (I\u2019m a software engineer doing mostly programming as of right now), I will use that knowledge and apply it to real-world problems that belong to all sorts of disciplines, because optimization is a widely applicable field. So, to answer your question directly, I think that scientists/researchers chose their topics of research sometimes by \u201cchance\u201d or by being led to them by an advisor during their formative years and then branch out to related topics (sometimes loosely related, but that\u2019s fine too) during their professional careers afterward. Sure, there might be the occasional scientist that works on things totally unrelated to his or her early academic work, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true in general. Given the large amount of knowledge that you need to push the boundaries of a field nowadays, I believe that scientists largely stay in their lanes for practical reasons. Curiosity and enthusiasm might be infinite, but time is not. (see Buridan's ass - Wikipedia) ",

            "answer_text": "Based on my previous experience in doing my research, your topics need to have a clear reason why you want it. After that, you need to clear the hypothesis for the answer from your research. If these two factors already fulfilled, you should know your topics then. Don\u2019t mind the result of your research because sometimes your hypothesis might not true. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the scientist. Some are enthralled with a subject from childhood. For instance, E. O. Wilson said that he got interested in bugs at the same age as lots of kids, but never grew out of it. Einstein started thinking about riding on a beam of light when he was a teenager. Others find something fascinating in college or grad school. Others just sort of fall into a topic. ",
