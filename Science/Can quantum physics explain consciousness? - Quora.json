            "answer_text": "At present, nothing explains subjective experience (\u201cconsciousness\u201d). But it\u2019s pretty easy to argue that the unknown explanation must involve basic-level, fundamental physics of some sort. Whether that physics would be \u201cquantum physics\u201d remains to be seen. Here\u2019s the really short version of the argument. One possibility is that subjective experience is identical to certain brain states (biological or functional), the way water is identical to H2O. This idea has been widely considered by philosophers. It is universally agreed that if it is true, then the relationship of the subjective to the physical is a set of \u201cbrute facts\u201d which permit no further analysis, especially no evolutionary analysis. We accept a small number of brute facts in physics, and every physicist is at work trying to reduce that number to a bare minimum. But one brute fact for every type of experience (each taste, each color, every sort of feeling \u2026)? That seems very unlikely. And the brute facts about pleasure and suffering being identical to their corresponding brain states would make a creationist blush. Oh, and many philosophers believe the whole idea is simply false. (Spoiler alert: it is.) The next possibility is that subjective experience is a strongly emergent property of certain brain states. This means that the brain states produce subjectivity the way certain arrangements of matter produce liquidity or solidity, with the key difference (the \u201cstrong\u201d part) being that, unlike the latter cases, there is no way of deducing or explaining subjectivity, beginning from the corresponding brain states. (If you could, that would mean they were ultimately identical, just like chemistry is ultimately identical to physics. And that\u2019s the answer we just dismissed). Now, we would then have to ask the question, why do brain states have this unique ability to produce subjective experience via strong emergence? Well, we think we understand the basic material nature of brain states completely. They reduce (are ultimately identical to) basic-level physics! So, if subjectivity is a strongly emergent property of brain biology, then the explanation for that is passed down to basic-level physics, where there must be something we\u2019re unaware of. And if subjectivity is a strongly emergent property of brain functional states, then the same thing is true, except this is much more promising. Since the brain\u2019s function is to process information, then the something we\u2019re unaware of about basic-level physics could well be a fundamental theory of information, which a lot of physicists are currently chasing (though not with an eye to explaining subjectivity). Finally, it\u2019s possible that subjective experience (or the potential for it) is a fundamental property of all matter. Again, this is a basic-level, fundamental physics solution. Edit: a year and a half later I wrote another answer, quite shorter answer, before questions were merged. Here it is: I believe you\u2019re asking whether the solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness [1] is likely to involve QM. As I\u2019m fond of repeating continually, it\u2019s quite easy to demonstrate that the solution must involve new basic-level physics. It cannot be just a product of ordinary brain activity as we understand it. Here (for the first time on Quora!) is a modification of a famous argument to that effect, from David Chalmer\u2019s The Conscious Mind. My additions are in bold italics [2]. In our world, there are conscious experiences.Given our present knowledge of physics, there is a logically possible world physically identical to ours, in which the positive facts about consciousness do not hold.Therefore, facts about consciousness are further facts about the world, over and above the physical facts as we presently understand them.However, I think it is likely that the missing physical facts about consciousness are deeper than QM and will help make sense of it. Eric M. Van's answer to How long do you think it will be until a single interpretation of quantum mechanics beats the others (because of scientific evidence, not popular opinion)? [1] How and why do we have subjective experience of the top-level information processing in the brain, when that subjective experience doesn\u2019t seem to add anything to our behavior? [2] The additions reflect the increasing recognition that we always redefine \u201cthe physical\u201d to include whatever it takes to explain the observed world. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost nothing. If you\u2019re referring to the observer effect, then it says absolutely nothing about consciousness. When one makes an \u201cobservation\u201d of quantum phenomena, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re intently staring at it - it means that they\u2019re using a particle detector which physically interacts with the quantum particle in question. It has nothing to do with a conscious human observing the particle - it\u2019s merely a physical interaction between particles that collapses the wave function. That being said, I see a lot of answers on here about how quantum physics has nothing to do with consciousness, which isn\u2019t entirely true. If we don\u2019t frame this question in reference to the observer effect, then quantum physics actually makes a very interesting (but also useless) prediction about human decision making and free will. In a hypothetical universe identical to ours, but instead governed only by classical mechanics, human decisions would be fixed and unalterable. That means that you could predict someone\u2019s \u201cfate\u201d, if you had all the information currently present in that universe. This is because the particles in that universe would evolve only according to classical mechanics, and would thus interact in a perfectly predictable way. In our actual universe, which is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, nothing is fixed, and nothing is predictable with absolute certainty. In fact, there is even a minuscule probability that if you jumped in the air outside right now, you could jump high enough to escape (ie. quantum tunnel through) Earth\u2019s gravitational pull and leave the atmosphere - the probability is somewhere around the order of 10^(-10^54), by my calculations. Therefore, we can assert that human decision making is not fixed or predictable either. Does this give us any actionable information on human consciousness? Not really, it just says that rather than our fate being fixed, our fate is completely arbitrary - we still wouldn\u2019t have free will either way - but in the philosophical debate on free will vs. determinism, it shows that both are scientifically inaccurate (there really should be an option for randomism).

            "answer_text": "Actually, that approach is backwards. Imagine trying to use quantum physics to explain chemistry. The fact is that when atoms interact, a process, new rules arise. Imagine trying to use physics and chemistry to explain how a cell works. Cells work at a process level, not a physical or chemical level. Imagine using cells to try and explain how tissues work. Tissues survive and thrive when cells cooperate, and fail when cells fail to cooperate successfully. Imagine using tissues to explain how limbs and organs work. Limbs and organs can only emerge when tissues cooperate. Imagine using limbs and organs to explain how limbs coordinate and how organ systems work. Organ systems only work when multiple organs in an individual body cooperate with each other. Imagine using limb coordination and organ systems to explain how the body works. The body only works when every layer actively cooperates. Nothing about cells, in isolation can explain the body. Imagine using nervous tissue and brain components to explain how the brain works. Imagine using sensory organs to explain how feelings work. Imagine using information about how the body works, to explain how families work. In each of those cases, there is a small, often only a single layer jump UPWARDS in the hierarchy. Let\u2019s imagine two or more layer jumps. Imagine using quantum physics to explain how a cell works. Imagine using our knowledge of cells to explain how limbs and organs work. Imagine using knowledge about cells to explain how the respiratory system works. Imagine using knowledge about limbs and organs to explain how families work. Consciousness pervades the hierarchy of life. Cells are conscious of their internal and external environments, and make life decisions based on that consciousness. Tissues are conscious of their internal and their external environments. They use that knowledge to make life decisions. Limbs and organs are conscious of their limb and organ environments - which have nothing to do with cellular environments or tissue environments. Limbs and organs function in their environment, which includes the bodily systems they are part of. Any multi cellular organism has body consciousness - more or less, and they use that consciousness to survive, to succeed and to reproduce. If that consciousness fails. Animals with brains have a higher level of consciousness, which often includes consciousness of their families and their communities. Humans, and a few animals have \u2018self consciousness\u2019. Awareness of themselves, and use that level of consciousness to survive and thrive. Attempting to go down the hierarchy, to quantum physics, to explain how something near the top of the hierarchy, something that also pervades the hierarchy throughout, is a failure to understand, and a failure to understand the nature of the hierarchy. We can use examples from quantum physics, to find relationships that help us understand consciousness. We can use examples from quantum physics to build models that help us to understand consciousness. But to suppose there is a direct link between the two is speculation, without any possibility of being actually demonstrated or proven by a scientific analysis. to your health, tracy ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. Here\u2019s what I wrote in my book \u201cFields of Color\u201d in a section called \u201cThe Gaps\u201d: Finally, we come to the grand-daddy of mysteries. How dare physicists talk about \u201ctheories of everything\u201d when they can\u2019t explain what goes on behind their very noses! As humans, we can identify galaxies light years away, we can study particles smaller than an atom. But we still haven\u2019t unlocked the mystery of the three pounds of matter that sits between our ears. - B. Obama (remarks by the president on the BRAIN Initiative, April 2, 2013) But please understand, by consciousness I don\u2019t mean simple information processing, such as can be done by any computer. I mean the sense of awareness, the sensations and feelings that our minds experience every day \u2013 from the color red to the beauty of a Mozart sonata or the pain of a toothache. Such sensations are known as qualia. Most physicists don\u2019t want to be bothered with the question, and it is left to philosophers like Charlie Chaplin to worry about it: Billions of years it\u2019s taken to evolve human consciousness\u2026 The miracle of all existence\u2026 More important than anything in the whole universe. What can the stars do? Nothing but sit on their axis! And the sun, shoot\u00ading flames 280,000 miles high. So what? Wasting all its natural resources. Can the sun think? Is it conscious? \u2014 C. Chaplin (film \u201cLimelight\u201d, 1952) I see consciousness as a more pressing problem than the question of why the field constants have the values they do. My concern began when I was thinking about pain. Pain surely cannot be explained by fields or particles or relativity, or even quantum field theory, nor can pleasurable sensa\u00adtions, like the enjoyment of music or the intense pleasure of an orgasm. Then one day we had a visitor - a young computer hot shot. As we were sitting down for dinner, I asked him \"Do you think a computer can ever expe\u00adrience a sexual orgasm?\" Well this young fellow began to tell me how you could create an orgasm by putting 0's and 1's into the right memory banks. Of course this was nonsense, so I told him he had flunked the test and couldn't have any dinner. I didn\u2019t really; we fed him, but it gave me the idea to write a book I was going to give it the title \u201cDo Robots Have Orgasms?\u201d (the illustration shows the cover designed by my nephew Roger L. Brooks), but I eventually abandoned the project because I figured that a book that boiled down to one word (\u201cno\u201d) wouldn't sell. However, I had already written or sketched chapters with proposed explanations, and while working on the Quantum Mechanics chapter, I realized that all the quantum mechanical ex\u00adplanations ignored QFT. That\u2019s when I realized that QFT is ignored almost everywhere, as if it never existed. Or if it is mentioned, it is not the \u201cfields only\u201d version created by Julius Schwinger. And that\u2019s why I wrote the book that I wrote. Is there any prospect that the consciousness mystery will ever be solved? Ambrose Bierce didn\u2019t think so. To quote from his Devil\u2019s Dictionary: Mind, n. A mysterious form of matter secreted by the brain. Its chief activity consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing but itself to know itself with. \u2013 Ambrose Bierce You can read the entire final chapter free here.

            "answer_text": "Conventional answer: No. Neither quantum nor classical physics explain the existence, diversity, phenomenal binding and causal efficacy of consciousness. The Hard Problem is an unfathomable mystery.(cf. New mysterianism - Wikipedia) Non-materialist physicalist answer: Yes. Quantum mechanics (i.e. QFT or its extension) is formally complete. The superposition principle of QM never breaks down. You consist of quadrillions of \"cat states\" (cf. Quantum superposition - Wikipedia). Only the universal validity of the superposition principle allows your CNS to run phenomenally bound world-simulations featuring classical-looking cats and determinate pointer-readings (cf. Correspondence principle - Wikipedia). Decohered classical neurons can\u2019t phenomenally simulate a classical world. You\u2019d just be Jamesian \u201cmind-dust\u201d (cf. Classics in the History of Psychology -- James (1890) Chapter 6). But coherent quantum minds can simulate classical worlds - and they've been doing so for over 540 million years. Quantum physics explains why you\u2019re not a micro-experiential zombie. (cf. China brain - Wikipedia) This possibility is counterintuitive. After all, back-of-an-envelope calculation suggests that thermally-induced decoherence \"destroys\" (i.e. scrambles the phase angles of components of) neuronal superpositions inside your skull within femtoseconds or less (cf. Maximilian Schlosshauer, Minimal no-collapse quantum mechanics). There exists no Divine Moviemaker to sculpt coherent superpositions of distributed neuronal feature-processors into the well-behaved macroscopic world-simulation that you're undergoing right now. Intuitively, neuronal superpositions are just vanishingly short-lived psychotic \"noise\". Maybe so. Yet recall Paley's Divine Watchmaker. Just as the workings of the evolutionary processes of natural selection are analogous to a Blind Watchmaker (cf. The Blind Watchmaker - Wikipedia), the far more powerful and unrelenting selection pressure of quantum Darwinism (cf. \u201cQuantum Darwinism as a Darwinian Process\u201d) in your CNS is akin to a Blind Moviemaker. A shame about the script. What about \u201cmangled\u201d frames? Well, they are real too on pain of violating unitarity. Evolution is wasteful. Note that despite unfamiliar terminology, the selection mechanism of Zurek's quantum Darwinism that explains the emergence of mind-independent classicality from quantum reality isn't the name of a speculative modification of the unitary Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics (cf. Quantum Darwinism - Wikipedia). Rather, it\u2019s just an extension of the decoherence program in post-Everett QM. Whether quantum Darwinism playing out inside our heads can also explain phenomenally bound conscious mind will be known only when molecular matter-wave interferometry independently deciphers the non-classical signature. (cf. Toward quantum superposition of living organisms) Noise or a perfect structural match?(cf. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Neurons)I can guess; but intuitions are cheap. ",

            "answer_text": "Not quantum physics, but quantum metaphysics/mysticism does have \u201cexplanations.\u201d At the micro level \u201cphysics\u201d is thrown out the window. The laws are very different and strange. At the quantum metaphysics/mysticism dimension, the \u201ctime reversals,\u201d and centrifuge coil of light surrounding us that \u201cwarps\u201d timespace, running rings around us in a fourth dimension ends up, for us, having to use some crude anthropomorphic grasp for mind boggling profound implications. For example, in an en masse\u2019 view, so called \u201cconsciousness\u201d is a different aspect of the same. That is, what we define as \u201cconsciousness\u201d may be a \u201ccheap imitation\u201d of something that is so dumb that it outsmarts us, like computer storage and retrieval. CONSCIOUSNESS = AWARENESS OF \u2018IT,\u2019 Whatever \u2018IT\u2019 IS. That means the universe does not have to \u201cthink\u201d at least how we think. \u201cIn Einstein\u2019s vision, the universe is like an organism in which each part is the manifestation of the whole\u201d (Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind p 76). It is us that is made in the same image, not the other way around. Each individual is a \u201cmirror image\u201d a \u201ccopy\u201d impressed with a \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201cparts.\u201d Everyone is composed of sub particles, atoms and molecules, chemical dna, bacteria, organs and so on (multiplicity) and simultaneously act as a person (unity). The same pattern is impressed upon the social structure, if we can see it. Alvin Toffler in Foreword to Nobel Prize recipient Ilya Prigogine, and Isabelle Stengers book, Order Out of Chaos, says, \u201cImagine a situation in which a chemical or other reaction produces an enzyme whose presence then encourages further production of the same enzyme. This is an example of what computer scientists would call a positive-feedback loop. In chemistry it is called \u2018auto-catalysis.\u2019 Such situations are rare in inorganic chemistry. But in recent decades the molecular biologists have found that such loops (along with inhibitory or \"negative\" feedback and more complicated \"cross-catalytic\" processes) are the very stuff of life itself. Such processes help explain how we go from little lumps of DNA to complex living organisms. More generally, therefore, in far-from-equilibrium conditions we find that very small perturbations or fluctuations can become amplified into gigantic, structure-breaking waves. And this sheds light on all sorts of \"qualitative\" or \"revolutionary\" change processes. When one combines the new insights gained from studying far-from-equilibrium states and nonlinear processes, along with these complicated feedback systems, a whole new approach is opened that makes it possible to relate the so-called hard sciences to the softer sciences of life-and perhaps even to social processes as well\u201d (Order Out Of Chaos p vii). Mathematician physicist and theoretical physicist Professor Wolfgang Pauli, during his initiation into philo linguistic symbolism occurring in his dreams has a dream illustration, his \u201ccountries mandala\u201d that acts similar to an individual \u201cI.\u201d The \u201cunconscious\u201d acts as if oscillating back into the physical consciousness.  Ironically analogous to his own Pauli Exclusion principle, where electrons appear simultaneously as if jumped into another level, he uses the same four functions of the psyche\u2019 that the psychiatrist Dr. Carl Jung used in therapy for the individual. It is as if the individual \u201cI\u201d jumps into another spectral coherent orbit or level to emerge as a sort of Ultra Human with a collective \u201cI.\u201d Pauli preferred to use the term \u201cu-field\u201d when around physicists rather than the psychological terminology. He said, \u201cAll sorts ideas crossed my mind on hearing this: Among physicists I sometimes use the term \u2018U-field\u2019 for the unconscious ...\u201d (Atom and Archetype p 144). Paleontologist theologian Pere\u2019 Pierre Tielhard de Chardin admitted, \u201cNo doubt it is true, scientifically speaking, that no distinct centre of superhuman consciousness has yet appeared on earth ( at least in the living world ) for which it may be claimed or predicted that one day it will exercise a centralizing function, in relation to the associated human thought, similar to the role of the individual \u2018I\u2019 in relation to the cells of the brain\u201d (The Future of Man p 174). Tielhard\u2019s vision of a thinking earth and noosphere, thinking sphere that embraces a thinking planet and expands beyond the galaxies can be compared with Professor Pauli\u2019s dream vision. Depth Psychologist Dr. Ira Progoff suggested that we compare Tielhards\u2019 noosphere with the work of Pauli and Jung\u2019s collective unconscious and synchronicity (Jung, Synchronicity and Human Destiny pp 7\u201310). Tielhard expands and persists with his vision that likewise expands past the consciousness of an individual \u201cI.\u201d He says, \u201c\u2026what I have called its 'Brain'. As in the case of all the organisms preceding it, but on an immense scale, humanity is in process of 'cerebralising' itself. And our proper biological course, in making use of what we call our leisure, is to devote it to a new kind of work on a higher plane: that is to say, to a general and con\u00adcerted effort of vision. The Noosphere, in short, is a stupendous thinking machine.\u201d (The Future of Man p 180). Mythologist Joseph Campbell, during one of his interviews with Bill Moyers, suggested that we \u201clook past the physical and see the world as a poem.\u201d  The sonnet above, composed between 1981\u20131983, is thematic of the \u201cthinking earth.\u201d The physical reality has been transformed into poetics. In order to comprehend such a mind boggling and outside the capability of physics and quantum physics to \u201cexplain\u201d one must be able to view the world as one humongous picture with all areas of knowledge and discipline being pieces to the puzzle so that with the love of wisdom can at least catch glimpses of an operation that acts as if the same as consciousness. We\u2019d have to shed our conception that the only SPACE in town is the electro magnetic coordinate system. Most third dimension inhabitants believe that the \u2018past\u2019 vanished, the \u2018future\u2019 is a not yet existent occurrence for a very narrow perspective of \u2018the present.\u2019 Two days prior to his death, Einstein said, \u201cPast, present and future, as persistent as they are, is an illusion.\u201d The problem with a physical mentality is that it is a mental con game that seems to dismiss and exclude any methodology that would seem disturbing or ruining their conception of reality. A \u201cuniversal clock\u201d may operate mostly undetected right under and over the heads, nose and eyes, eluding thresholds of awareness. That does not mean to suggest we should give up our reliable and trustworthy clocks. It\u2019s just that science requires a \u201cresolution\u201d when studying micro and macro and infinite \u2018points\u2019 like monads are not part of \u2018measured time.\u2019 The existence of \u2018unmeasured time\u2019 does not help physical scientists because there is no way to measure length, breadth and width and calculate distance and where some object will be at some time in the future. Professor of Higher Mathematics, Ferdinand Gonseth suggests, \u201c...have taken a further step, not only towards the objectivation of the measurement of time, but also towards the objectivation of time itself When will this procedure of extension have reached its term? Principally never. In practice one must observe moderation. In a Situation of well-defined knowledge, it is useless to increase indefinitely the possibilities of control and of synchronicity. \"But what gives us the right, we might ask, to stop the process of extension at this point? If one does not admit the existence of an objective and universal time, is it not a fault of method to assume that the controls of synchronicity which have been erected would guarantee those which were not yet erected? Is it admissible to exclude as impossible the ease of an instrument still \"unpublished\" which could not be easily fitted into the group of clocks presently in use? We have already answered this question indirectly. It is not necessary t o construct all possible clocks; it suffices to establish the temporal law of the phenomena. As long as this temporal law does not vary with regard to the moment when the phenomenon begins (this Variation certainly could not be attributed to any momentary influence or to any more or less concealed evolution of the system which is the seat of this phenomenon), we have no reason whatever to abandon the hypothesis of a universal time, and every phenomenon whose law does not vary in the course of time confirms this hypothesis. What more can we ask of a natural law?\u201d (Time and Method P 216). Professor Wolfgang Pauli had assisted Gonseth. It may be no wonder that Pauli\u2019s \u201cworld clock\u201d became manifest in his dream language. Writer Arthur Koestler refers to astronomer Firsof. \u201c,,, the eminent astronomer, V. A. Firsoff suggested that \u2018mind was a universal entity or interaction of the same order as electricity or gravitation, and that there must exist a modulus of transformation, analogous to Einstein\u2019s famously equality E=mc squared, whereby \u2018mind stuff\u2019 could be equated with other entities of the physical world.\u201d (Arthur Koestler, The Roots of Coincidence, p 63); Professor Pauli himself, as he collaborated with Dr. Carl Jung for a \u201cunified vision\u201d (physics/psychology) about \u201ccomplimentary opposites\u201d in one letter sent, \"\u2019Self\u2019 It is clear that \"nucleus\" means the same as the individual center. But what does \"radioactivity\" mean in psychologi\u00adcal terms? On the one hand it seems to indicate a gradual transformation of the center, and on the other hand an effect radiating outwards (rays!)\u201d (Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters 1932\u20131958 p 12). Niels Bohr considered the two areas of discipline in the same way. \u201cBohr was convinced that complimentary was relevant not only to physics but also to psychology and to life itself\u201d (Deciphering the Cosmic Number p 102). Einstein had praised Pauli. \u201cNo one studying this mature, grandly conceived work could believe that the author is a man of 21. One wonders what to admire most, the psychological understanding for the development of ideas, the sureness of mathematical deduction, the profound physical insight, the capacity for lucid systematic presentation, the complete treatment of the subject matter, or the sureness of critical appraisal\u201d (Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind p 15), (Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters 1932\u20131938 p xiii). Einstein had been a frequent guest at the Jung mansion for dinners. Dr. Progoff pointed out, \u201cIt is interesting in this regard to note that the recent opening of Einstein\u2019s private papers has disclosed that dreams and images played a very important role in Einstein\u2019s creative life. Those luncheon conversations may have been more fruitful that Jung realized, especially since we now know that Einstein possessed a keen sensitivity to the deep levels of the psyche. It may, at some later tie, be very fruitful to study the relationship between Jung and Einstein more closely, particularly in view of Einstein\u2019s interest in Hindu/Buddhist thought and his later description of the archetypal qualities of the relativity concept. \u201cWhile Jung may have had an important psychological effect on Einstein, the theory of Relativity became the base and starting point for his own thinking about Synchronicity. At several points he seems to have been consciously seeking to develop a concept that would be the equivalent of the relativity theory with the added dimension of the psyche\u201d (Ira Progoff, Jung, Synchronicity and Human Destiny, p 152). \u201cLater in his life, Jung traced his idea of synchronicity to the influence of Albert Einstein, who held a professorship in Zurich in 1909-10 and again in 1912-1913. Jung wrote, \u2018Professor Einstein was my guest on several occasions at dinner\u2026 These were very early days when Einstein was developing his first theory of relativity, [and] it was he who first started me off thinking about a possible relativity of time as well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than thirty years later, this stimulus led to my relation with the physicist Professor W. Pauli and to my thesis of psychic synchronicity\u2019\u201d (Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle pp vi-vii). So far, whether it be the universe, the earth, social structures, an individual the pattern is the same. But what about lower life? Ants, termites, bee colonies for example. If we try to swat a bee, the individual does not have to know what happened. A swarm may step up to the plate to do something about it. Mold cells, without brains, at a certain stage emerge as slime mold exhibiting as if intelligent behavior and as if patterns similar to the neural pathways with memory. PENROSE! Sir Roger Penrose pointed at the a paradox that the universe after expansion becomes both BIG simultaneously is the SMALL. The same idea as modern and old thinking regarding the microcosm/macrocosm. One of Jung\u2019s definition of \u201cPSYCHE = The greatest intensity in the least amount of space\u201d was noted by both Depth Psychologist, Dr. Marie-Louise in Psyche and Matter and Professor Roderick Main\u2019s Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal. The stuff of the \u201cmind\u201d permeates everything the microcosm has almost all of the data of the macrocosm. They are mirror images. The mind and matter are different aspects of the same. David Hume envisioned the same idea. \u201cNow if we survey the universe, so far as it falls under our knowl\u00adedge, it bears a great resemblance to an animal or organized body, and seems actuated with a like principle of life and motion. A continual cir\u00adculation of matter in it produces no disorder: a continual waste in every part is incessantly repaired; the closest sympathy is perceived through\u00adout the entire system: and each part or member, in performing its proper offices, operates both to its own preservation and to that of the whole. The world, therefore, I infer, is an animal, and the Deity is the soul of the world, actuating it, and actuated by it\u201d ( Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion). James Jean \u201cToday there is a wide measure of agreement, which on the physical side of science approaches almost to unanimity, that the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into the realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as a creator and governor of the realm of matter...\u201d ( The Mysterious Universe p. 137, 1937 ed.) It is as if the \u201cgears of our consciousness\u201d operate in the same way but at a different scale. The problem is that humans usually place themselves as the only observer and thereby imposes restrictions upon nature to answer the questions devised by man. Bertrand Russell reminded us, \u201cIt is natural to suppose that the observer is a human being or at least the mind but he is just as likely to be a photographic plate or clock. That is to say the odd results as to the difference between one \u2018point of view\u2019 and another are concerned with the \u2018point of view\u2019 in a sense applicable physical instruments just as much as to speak to people with perceptions\u201d (The ABC of Relativity p 138).

This interpretation requires that much of our thinking actually occurs in parallel worlds whenever a choice must be confronted. Earman wrote a book about this. This would exclude the probabilistic \u2018wavefunction collapse\u201d interpretation and the deterministic \u2018pilot wave interpretation\u2019 of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve always liked Elisabeth Anscomb\u2019s view of determinism: just because the rules of a game are determined does not mean that the game is G. E. M. Anscombe Quote. This seems to leave room for free-will in some interpretations (although not in Anscombe\u2019s) Battle of the two Elizabeths: are free will and physical determinism compatible? If you really want to break this all down into the philosophical nuts and bolts, you need to read Hume and Descartes. Nevertheless, our intuition tells us that free-will seems to result from consciousness, and consciousness can be defined as the brain telling itself what it is doing. That materialist standpoint is something I tried to describe here: Kirsten Hacker's answer to Can we call consciousness a state of matter, like solid, liquid, etc.? ",

It is impossible to look at consciousness from the outside; it is the one thing we can never \u201cget behind\u201d to see how it works. You have to use consciousness to look at consciousness. It is not physical, so there is nothing to measure. Here is an example of the problem:  We begin with a cup and we all know what a cup is. None of this matter has been destroyed, it all still exists in a different form, but this particular cup has completely ceased to exist. At what point exactly did this stop being a cup? The cup is not made of cup, it is made of a material that we have fashioned into a cup, but it could have been made into something else. We can all agree what a cup is, but we can make the size of a few atoms or the size of the universe and it is still a cup. We can have an infinite number of them or none at all. There is no physics that can explain this because we\u2019re faced with the problem of only being able to use cups to explain what a cup is. It all becomes circular. The only way around this is to use consciousness to explain quantum physics. It doesn\u2019t work the other way around. ",

            "answer_text": "It is important to note that consciousness cannot be explained WITHOUT quantum physics. Many physicists and neurobiologists (with the exception of Hameroff and Penrose, for example) assume that QM is not relevant to consciousness, because the brain is warm and wet, and quantum superpositions can\u2019t generally last long in such environments. The \u201cdecoherence\u201d time of such superpositions is generally calculated to be on the pico- or nanosecond scale, which is much faster than the \u201crefresh\u201d rate of human consciousness. HOWEVER, even if this is true, this does NOT imply that quantum physics is irrelevant to consciousness. Here\u2019s an example. A person is using a Geiger counter to measure the radioactivity of a sample. When he hears a \u201cclick,\u201d it is because a decay, which is a quantum event, was amplified to the point of creating an audible sound, which the person then consciously hears. In other words, when he hears the click, his conscious state becomes correlated to a QM event, and that conscious state is measurably distinct from one that is NOT correlated to that QM event. I explain this concept further, and also show why consciousness is not algorithmic, in this 1.5-hour explanation on YouTube. A quick summary (17 minutes) is here. So while we can\u2019t yet say whether quantum physics causes consciousness, since we don\u2019t yet know the cause of consciousness, we can say with some certainty that consciousness DEPENDS to some degree on quantum physics. Hope this is helpful. ",

Although John Hagelin (featured in the new age film What the Bleep Do We Know) has promoted pseudoscientific connections with consciousness, based on his religion of transcendental meditation.

He also argues that meditation can reduce crime. He has a paper he wrote called \u201cIs Consciousness the Unified Field?\u201d, which supposedly has over 200 citations, but it was never actually published in a real physics journal, just in a fake journal he and other people who practice his religion created.

There are more who believe quantum mechanics itself may have some connection with consciousness, although the people who believe that are still considered somewhat fringe and the connections they argue for are far more subtle than what Hagelin says.

Would you hire a city planner? Or would you hire a chemist to examine the properties of brake fluid under a microscope? Because after all, cars stop because of brake fluid, there is no denying that! Since traffic jams wouldn\u2019t happen without brake fluid, obviously we should learn all we can about it, right? Yes, brake fluid is at the bottom level of the causal chain of events that leads to a traffic jam. But you will never learn anything important about traffic jams by studying brake fluid, because a traffic jam is an emergent phenomenon that takes place many layers of organization above the stopping of a single car.

While we can\u2019t explain the aha moment of \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d we have explained a whole lot about how the physical brain creates the \u201cmind\u201d. Scientists have been able to explain how the brain can accept and store information from our five senses and access this information to develop thoughts that can be expressed externally if desired. This is done by physical stuff - neurons, neurotransmitters and chemicals like dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. I realize I am going about this in a roundabout way but the point I\u2019m trying to make is that the fact that you can think, walk, talk and store memories is because of physical processes that are occurring on the same macro level of matter that we interact with all the time. There is a hierarchy to this \u201cmatter\u201d that we see, feel or measure with instruments and this \u201cmatter\u201d is many levels above the quantum world of elementary particles like photons and electrons. All of stuff above is just groundwork for the answer to your question. By the time the randomness or uncertainty that exists in the quantum world has risen to our level of complex molecules reacting in chemical and physical interactions instead of quantum fluctuations - here it is - quantum decoherence has already transformed the gadzillions of wave functions (with their superposition of possible observable values) into a bunch of what appears at our macro level to be \"classically\" observable stuff. That includes the stuff in your brain that allows you to think and do other things. Which means that there isn\u2019t any quantum uncertainty going on in your brain that would be influencing the development of consciousness or as some think, the basis of free will. ",

Hence neuroscientists are increasingly turning to Panpsychism to explain it. Materialism tries to explain consciousness in terms of objective facts describing the dynamics and behaviour of matter, however this says nothing about what matter actually is. Panpsychism posits that the fundamental constituents of matter are \u2018quanta of experience\u2019 (qualia). Materialism draws from an entirely classical view of consciousness. Panpsychism does not limit itself this way, but it is still difficult to accept there could be quantum information processing going on in the very warm and noisy environment of the brain, since quantum states usually have to be cooled to near -273 degrees and kept causally isolated to prevent decoherence. Since it is difficult if not impossible to explain consciousness classically, then Nature must have found a way to preserve such states long enough to do useful computing with. Penrose/Hameroff have an extensive/detailed model for how this might work (Orch OR with quantum cellular automata on microtubules inside each neuron linked by gap junctions). It is a controversial theory and not widely accepted precisely because of the decoherence issue, however, neuroscience may have no choice but to accept it if it cannot explain consciousness with classical physics alone. Here is a recent article from a reputable source that may begin to address the decoherence issue in warm environments; It's a Quantum World Record: 15 Trillion Smokin' Hot Atoms Entangled. Therefore in answer to the question, one concludes consciousness will require both classical and quantum physics to explain it. ",

It is a mistake in word usage and meaning.

All the QM fuss is about how the machine that detects / measures the quantum scale energetic transaction cannot be separated from the transaction itself, and often the effect of the machine on detection / measurement cannot be extricated from the outcome, or mathematically corrected for the intervention which renders the detection / measurement dubious if not downright useless.

            "answer_text": "I am one of the few neuroscientists or physicists who think that a quantum theory of consciousness is well-motivated and plausible. Below I briefly sketch why I think that. To be fair, you should first know that most experts in neuroscience and physics who have considered this question would say what Steve Zara said: \u201cThe brain is a vast collection of neural networks which operate through electrical and chemical interactions. There is no place in that for any quantum-mechanical strangeness.\u201d Temperature objection: Many scientists believe that it is implausible that a macroscopic quantum state could survive in a warm brain. This opinion is typically based on calculations in simple models that assume thermodynamic equilibrium in brain tissue (Tegmark 2000). But an older simple model (Frohlich) demonstrates how energy flow through a system (i.e. steady-state metabolism, not at thermal equilibrium) of molecular dipoles can organize it into stable coherent states even at high temperatures. So in my opinion a quantum substrate for consciousness in the brain is not ruled out. But why would one consider such an \u201cexotic\u201d hypothesis when current understanding of neural dynamics seems to account for a wide range of behavioral and cognitive phenomena? It is very popular to deride theoretical arguments, but here is a simple argument that motivates the idea that consciousness requires a quantum physical description. Our states of consciousness are intrinsically unified; they are irreducible wholes. But there are no irreducible wholes in classical physics. Really. Quantum physics on the other hand describes the dynamics of irreducible wholes, because that\u2019s what quantum states are. Thus the quantum brain or quantum consciousness or quantum mind approach has the potential to solve the \u201cphenomenal binding problem\u201d at a fundamental level. This should not be dismissed lightly because synchrony in a classical brain model (a la Singer) cannot do this (I said why above), despite protests you may hear from well educated people. One can also note that despite impressive successes classical neural network theory has not yet managed to account for the full range of human cognitive abilities, even if we recklessly decide to neglect consciousness. Yes (classical) computers can beat us at face recognition and Go now, but current models simply do not capture the flexibility of our \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Quantum computation in a brain could give it significant advantages over a classical brain (e.g. Quantum Associative Memory). Quantum physics is not \u201cexotic\u201d or \u201cstrange\u201d to Nature; it is Nature. A variety of \u201ccircumstantial\u201d experimental evidence is consistent with the possibility I am arguing for, that a macroscopic quantum state in the brain underlies our consciousness and mind. For example, Context effects produced by question orders reveal quantum nature of human judgments. From the biophysical side, ultraweak light radiation emitted by all living tissue (\u201cbiophotons\u201d) has been shown by Popp et al to exhibit a non-equilibrium distribution demonstrating the existence of an underlying coherent state. Such leakage of coherent light radiation is predicted by certain quantum models of memory and consciousness (Del Giudice, Vitiello). Aside from the temperature objection addressed above, another common objection to the hypothesis that a quantum process underlies consciousness, is the assertion that \u201cthere is no place\u201d for quantum effects in the brain. This attitude stems from familiarity with the deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations which govern neural dynamics like Newton\u2019s Laws in physics. If these equations determine everything neurons do, how could there be a role for some additional quantum ghost? But synaptic transmission among neurons in the central nervous system is extremely \u201cnoisy\u201d or random or \u201cunreliable.\u201d In other words, synaptic transmission in the brain is probabilistic, and the transmission probabilities vary with time. We do not necessarily know every factor that can affect synaptic transmission probability at each synapse from moment to moment. This apparent randomness represents a \u201cplace\u201d where a hypothetical quantum state could interact with the well-known neural machinery to guide adaptive behavior. As a concrete example, the theory of Hameroff and Penrose posits a collective quantum state in brain microtubules. The microtubule state could condition the state of the photon field inside microtubules, which in turn could modulate synaptic transmission probabilities via liquid-crystal actin molecules that reside near the synaptic junction (the microtubules tend to be \u201caimed\u201d down neuronal axons toward the synapse). This is analogous to how liquid-crystal gates function in optical computers. This is one specific example to demonstrate that the brain\u2019s neural networks are not completely determined classical machines even in the mainstream description, so one can reasonably consider how a hypothetical additional factor\u2014the quantum conscious process\u2014might interact with the known neural machinery. In summary, classical neuroscience has not been able to account for consciousness so far, and the quantum consciousness hypothesis is not ruled out. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't use QM to explain consciousness untill you understand QM. I knew I understood QM, at least in a general way, when I realized that Probability was completely mathematical as opposed to being a function of observational uncertainty, i.e. local realism. When I looked at mathematics as essentially comprised of logic bits, X/not-X, I understood how quantum matter/antimatter entanglement worked. You cannot have X without not-X. So on the level of local realism, you cannot create a matter particle without at the same time creating an antimatter particle. Looking back I realized that X/not-X are logically entangled just as particle pairs are and that the local realism of particle/antiparticle entanglement was based on the logical entanglement of X/not-X. To understand quantum spin entanglement I had to dig a little deeper into the common origin of Logic and Probability. What I realized is that both Logic and Probability are based on Possibility. Possibility has every possible freedom, the foremost of which is that its somethingness aspect and its nothingness aspects have the freedom to in a limited way disassociate. One basic way this dissociation is observed is as the '/' in X/not-X which separation gives rise to Logic. A more extreme form of dissociation is seen as the collapse of the probability function and the manifestation of local realism. Local realism occurs because more extreme dissociation is also expansion i.e. Time and Space. Finally, one of the important possible ways (or freedoms) by which the aspects of Possibility can disassociate is by opposite spin, i.e. quantum spin entanglement. How you and I know this to be true is because we are essentially Possibility so this is all of our shared history. We know it not because we observe it locally but apriori. On the apriori level QM and Consciousness are self explanatory. ",

Further wave function is non-physical and it is a mathematical construct. Only on observation or measurement it collapsed and take a localised position out of possible state , the position of which we can't determine before observation. We may relate the quantum field to God ,an infinite,eternal omnipresent existence -universal consciousness\u201d and it is formless and beyond our mind to grasp. In the same manner quantum mechanics regards the quantum field as providing wave function with the potentiality to manifest in any possible localised state of existence. We may relate this to the unmanifested state of reality that contains the infinite and various possible states of Brahman (God) across the space and time. In this manner Brahman behaves as the quantum wave function where as Atman (self) represents the ripples or excitation of the quantum field and everything that exists in the universe represents the collapsed measurement of the wave function in localised reality (manifested realities of Brahman-universal consciousness) Please note this is merely a non -physical representation of the infinite in the microscopic realm. Reality-universal consciousness is inconceivable as it is beyond our limited ,conditioned mind.. ",

When the subjects of consciousness, self awareness, the mind and free will are discussed philosophically we do run into serious paradoxes. It is tempting to bring quantum arguments into these discussions claiming that it is all because quantum states have random and non-intuitive behavior but there is no scientific evidence to support this. The reality is that consciousness is related to brain function, mostly to the thalamus region and the cortex and everything we currently know about brain activity is based on nerve synapses (ends of axons) which are classical electric pulses that have no quantum nature because at the strength of these electric pulses all quantum effects are already observed and therefore lost any quantum coherence. That doesn\u2019t exclude the possibility that quantum effect are involved in nerve activity but at the current state of science there is no basis for this assumption. ",

Consciousness relies on quantum mechanics because quantum mechanics is the foundation of all mechanics - it describes the behaviour of all particles that make up our bodies. If what you mean is - does consciousness rely on strange aspects of quantum mechanics such as entanglement - then the answer is no. This is because the brain is warm and wet, and so a very bad environment for large-scale quantum entanglement to exist. The brain also operates very slowly. If we scale up the time that a typical quantum entanglement exists to a second, then a thought would take tens of thousands of years. It\u2019s not just that consciousness doesn\u2019t involve quantum mechanics, it\u2019s also that there is nothing about consciousness that quantum mechanics would help to explain. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently consciousness is not understood. Not even close. It is one of the least understood subjects we humans cogitate on. Quantum mechanics is another. Neither the old quantum mechanics nor the new quantum mechanics (QFT) explains consciousness. Well, let me qualify that. Since we don\u2019t understand consciousness, how would we even know if QM explained it? We wouldn\u2019t. But from my own perspective (a minority view, I\u2019m quite sure), quantum mechanics as we have it today, circa 2017, doesn\u2019t even explain quantum mechanics. Doesn\u2019t even try. Doesn\u2019t even care to. So there\u2019s that. The equations allow predictions; they do not promote understanding. True quantum mechanics lies hidden somewhere beyond the differential equations. A whole new landscape to explore. ",

            "answer_text": "That would be like having a quantum theory of how car engines work. There is a quantum theory for how atoms bond into molecules: good old quantum mechanics, QM. Now, everything is made of atoms, including conscious brains, but to build a theory of how brains work, QM is way too low-level, and has nothing useful to say. It\u2019s better to look at information processing in and between neurons. An information theory would be the same whether or not the building blocks are described by QM or something else. To understand car engines, you need to know zero QM. You just need mechanics. A bit of thermodynamics helps. Or take a computer made of transistors. To understand how to write a python program for your computer, you don\u2019t need to know anything about transistors. So even though you need QM to understand transistors, there\u2019s no \u201cquantum theory for programming in python.\u201d The only folks who speak of \u201cquantum consciousness\u201d are spiritualists trying to impress. I\u2019ve read quite a lot, and never come across one who seems to understand QM. They borrow words, say something vague, sell their books\u2026 ",

Just click on a text and download the pdf file. Note that these are my lay texts, not my grad texts.

So before in an 'only mathematical thinking\u2019 manner consciousness is dismissed, I suggest they 'pause\u2019 the math and study consiousness for a period - Especially Leibniz, then, take a deep breath, open their mind and regard the double slit experiment as though 'viewing anew', and ask if anything you learned on your journey 'changed\u2019 your 'overly mathematically bound psyche?\u2019 Yes.

Below is a section from a research published on SciVenue that in my opinion answers the question: \u201cThe statement that quantum theory may provide with new findings on the molecular level is indeed, a rather interesting one. It is definitely worth a try to attempt to research the nature of consciousness via the microscopic aspects. The brain consists of thousands of neurons that could hold some answers. It is also an organ that scientists do not know much about. There are many findings that remain unknown when it comes to the brain. However, unlike consciousness, people are aware that the brain is a real tangible thing and it is much easier to study it and come to certain conclusions. This is not the case with consciousness. Therefore, it would be beneficial to apply the principle of quantum theory to the brain in order to research it. Quantum mechanics could provide with answers to the unknown parts of the brain, which, in turn, could provide with some clues on what consciousness is. Maybe, after the brain is studied on a microscopic level in more detail, it will provide researchers closer to find answers to the question why.\u201d Source ",

There is, however, consensus that consciousness is \u201ccomputationally bound elemental qualities like redness and greenness.\u201d You can see this emerging expert consensus in the camp now being called \u201cRepresentational Qualia Theory\u201d. The only disagreement is the nature of qualia. Some people, like Hameroff are predicting that it is \u201cquantum\u201d. The leading consensus is predicting it is not quantum, just \u201cfunctional\u201d. My bet is on simple \u201cMolecular Materialism\u201d. Quantum theories provide no insights as to how to bridge the \u201cExplanatory Gap\u201d, the only real hard problem. Thanks to the work of these experts, building consensus around the best theories,\u201cRepresentational Qualia Theory\u201d has emerged as a falsifiable way to bridge this \u201cExplanatory Gap\u201d and discover things like which physics it is that do have a redness quality. Experimentalists just need to stop being \u201cqualia blind.\u201d We will be monitoring this consensus around the best theories as experimentalist stop being qualia blind, so they can do the described experiments and falsify all but THE ONE true theory of qualia, forcing all the experts to abandon false theories into one scientific consensus camp.

The quantum one would happen before measurements on the atoms that make synapses take place. In other words, before the collapse of the wave function. After the collapse, the classical structure would take place. This is an interesting idea and goes in tandem with Roger Penrose view (as expressed in Shadows of The Mind and The Emperor\u2019s New Mind) that somehow our brain manages to keep all it\u2019s cells in quantum superposition to make its calculations. I think this idea a little \u201ctoo much\u201d. But Loewenstein\u2019s idea may be a middle ground that could be tested and someday somehow turned into some kind of technology. ",

Quantum mechanics is only an approximation to the truth that the universe is dynamic electromagnetic, and that its sole purpose is to survive eternity. For this, it has several tools and universal laws: The first is that energy can not be created or destroyed. That the anti energy, in addition to having the same role, can not be annulled with energy. Similarly antimatter can not be canceled or neutralized with matter. The only thing that matters for the universe is that nothing stops, that everything moves: it must survive eternity or it will collapse. Armando Molina Bariloche ",

All that we know of cosmology comes from reverse engineering the past from what we know about a given present. But that project doesn\u2019t know how to deal with the fact that we know about our present in the first place. How reverse engineer the fact that we know? There isn\u2019t a science of knowing, but that we know is just as much a fact as the facts making up our existence, to paraphrase Daniel Robinson the late philosopher.

One are the classical physics laws of nature, intensively used at our human scale. The other set of laws of nature would be the one used by the quantum realm and the consciousness realm, both being the same one. ",
