            "answer_text": "Dark matter and Dark energy are both hypothetical entities that are required to explain a few known cosmological phenomena, but they do not have a known solid physical basis yet. There are definitely few theories that attempt to explain them, but none very good so far. There are several observational pieces of evidence that point to the existence of dark matter (For more details see Jay Wacker's answer to What is dark matter?). I have tried to explain the motivation for dark matter and dark energy below, with some attempts to explain them. DARK MATTER MOTIVATION - It is a well known phenomenon that distant masses seem to be heavier than what they \u2018appear\u2019 to be. For instance, the outer arms of galaxies rotate faster than they are expected to, if we were to account for just the visible mass. Gravitational lensing effects are seen to be more prominent than is explained by the visible masses under observation. It seems that there are extra masses out there that participate in gravitational interaction but since they very negligibly interact through the other known forces (such as electromagnetic or nuclear forces), we are unable to detect them easily. They do not emit light and hence can only be indirectly observed through their gravitational influence on neighboring bodies. This unknown form of matter is what is dubbed as \u2018dark matter\u2019. There are a large number of observational pieces of evidence pointing to the existence of dark matter. See Jay Wacker's answer to What is dark matter? CANDIDATES - WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) are hypothetical particles constituting the dark matter. It is possible to reverse calculate the properties of a WIMP (such as its mass and cross-section of interactions) based on what can agree with observations. There is no known stable particle that can be a WIMP, but supersymmetry does predict a particle with properties close enough. There are several attempts underway to directly or indirectly detect WIMPs. Of late, few results from the LHC have cast doubts towards the existence of simple WIMP models [1]. Other possible candidates for the dark matter are MACHOs and Axions. MACHOs are Massive astrophysical compact halo objects which are basically masses composed of normal baryonic matter that emit no light and drift through the universe without being associated with any planetary system. These can potentially explain a bit of the extra gravitational interactions seen but have been found to be theoretically inadequate to explain all that amount of of extra gravitation. Even if MACHOs exist, other forms of dark matter seem to be in order. Axion is an elementary particle postulated in QCD (Quantum chromodynamics) to resolve what is known as the strong CP problem[2], an unsolved problem in physics. By virtue of its low interactions with baryonic matter, this particle seems to be a viable candidate for dark matter, though how it fits with the Big Bang model itself is poorly understood. Dark matter is believed to likely be clumpy and slow-moving (cold). Theoretically, one can postulate neutrinos (a known existing particle) and sterile neutrinos (hypothetical particle) as candidates for dark matter, but these tend to be fast moving and that does not align well with our known evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe (as to how large structures such as superclusters formed from smaller ones). If you think our understanding of dark matter is poor, I welcome you to dark energy. DARK ENERGY MOTIVATION - Distance measurements show that the universe has expanded more in the last half of its life. Yes, it is not just that the universe is expanding, but the expansion seems to have accelerated in later phases. Also, the known amount of matter and dark matter is not adequate to explain the practical flatness of the universe. The universe seems to be observationally flat and there is no known global curvature. With the known amount of matter, it should have had a detectable curvature. In addition, the theory of large-scale structure suggests that all of matter and dark matter are only able to account for around 30% of the density of the universe. All of these together seem to point to a possibility that there is some form of energy that pervades the universe causing it to expand, making it flatter and helping form large-scale structures like superclusters. CANDIDATES - In his famous general relativity equation that depicted how mass-energy curves spacetime, Einstein had included a parameter known as the cosmological constant that could help a relativistic model of the universe stay static. When the Hubble expansion was discovered, it became evident that the universe is actually expanding. Einstein had hence considered the inclusion of a constant a big blunder. However now, cosmological constant provides one of the most viable models of expansion of space. The lambda-CDM model is one of the better-understood cosmological model we have so far that explains most known phenomena about the big bang, by providing a standard parametrization of the Big Bang. The \u2018lambda\u2019 refers to the cosmological constant (dark energy) and CDM stands for \u2018cold dark matter\u2019. Also referred to as the standard model of cosmology, it now includes a cosmological constant whose value is around [math]10^{-122}[/math] in terms of Planck units. A quick visualization of the Big Bang events predicted by the \u039bCDM can be seen below.  (Image Credit: NASA/WMAP Science Team. Licensed under Commons) The cosmological constant is thought to be simply the cost of space itself. Vacuum has an implicit energy associated with it, which results in \u2018negative pressure\u2019 causing an expansion of the space itself. The major challenge here is that the cosmological constant is smaller than the vacuum energy predicted by quantum theory by a factor of [math]10^{-120}[/math], what is known as the \u201cworst theoretical prediction in the history of physics\u201d. There have been attempts to employ the anthropic principle[3] to fine tune the constant, but such theories exist without any solid basis. In other words, the physical foundation for vacuum energy is very poorly understood. Despite its many open questions, the cosmological constant provides the simplest and most elegant explanation for dark energy, as it is invariant in space and time. Alternately, one may hypothesize fields that vary in time and space (known as quintessence) that can account for dark energy. In order for it to not clump together like matter, the field must be very light. It generally predicts a slightly slower expansion than predicted by the cosmological constant. There is no evidence for quintessence, but it is not yet ruled out as a theoretical possibility. In conclusion - Using the \u039bCDM model, our best calculations predict that the total energy of the universe is composed of 4.9% of standard baryonic matter, 26.8% of dark matter and the rest 68.3% is made of dark energy. As I have described above, there are few theoretical candidates for dark matter and dark energy. The physical basis and experimental backing for these entities are poor. There are also alternative theories that do not involve dark matter and dark energy so as to be able to explain the above described phenomena such as modified laws of gravity, however these are least understood. As more findings evolve, we may be able to explain these phenomena better.

            "answer_text": "There's observational evidence to support a phenomenon that appears to violate what we know about physics, like with dark energy. This is why both dark matter and dark energy are referred to as hypothetical entities. Both phenomena appear to violate what we know about gravity, each in their own way. Other ideas such as branes, cosmic strings, multi-verses and some others are simply just suppositions, and are not hypothetical entities, because there's no real evidence to support their existence. However, what's referred to as dark matter and dark energy (supposedly making up the majority of the universe) could also be used to demonstrate that the current Big Bang Theory, and some other accepted paradigms could be wrong. Concerning the God Theory (technically not really a theory), this is a bit tougher to talk about for several reasons. Firstly, there are various types of intelligent design suppositions. Secondly, defining 'God' itself is difficult. Thirdly, like with dark matter and dark energy, we can't see this supposed creator, but according to intelligent design proponents, we can see God's effects (so to speak) via the way the universe operates. There's evidence for the existence of an afterlife in my opinion, perhaps more so than a god itself, but most people either don't look at it, don't care to look at it or are not even aware of its existence.  The problem with the latter is the butterfly effect, along with psi and survival challenging science's accepted paradigms on various fronts. God, psi and survival are deemed to be supernatural entities while dark energy and dark matter are coined as being hypothetical entities. However, I think there's more evidence for at least some idiosyncrasies correlated with intelligent design suppositions than there is for many atheistic hypotheses. Either way, paradigms in science are always changing, and more scientists are challenging the current paradigm. Appealing to ignorance can work both ways, which is why science needs to be open-ended.

            "answer_text": "NASA Finds Direct Proof of Dark Matter First of all we must understand what is dark matter It is believed that this mysterious type of matter that no one can see makes 27% of the content of the Universe while visible matter (you, me, all stars and galaxies) accounts for only 5%.  Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss astronomer, was the first to suspect the existence of dark matter in 1933. He was trying to measure the mass of a galactic cluster (a group of several galaxies) using two different methods. He tried to infer this mass from the speed of the galaxies. Just like kids on a merry-go-round have to hold on to avoid being ejected, galaxies are held together in a spinning galactic cluster by the gravitational force provided by the matter it contains. If there were not enough matter to create this force, the galaxies would simply scatter. He then compared his result with the mass evaluated from the light the galaxies shed. He realized that there was way more matter in the cluster than what was visible. This matter of an unknown type generated a gravitational field without emitting light. Hence its name, dark matter. In galaxy clusters, the normal matter, like the atoms that make up the stars, planets, and everything on Earth, is primarily in the form of hot gas and stars. The mass of the hot gas between the galaxies is far greater than the mass of the stars in all of the galaxies. This normal matter is bound in the cluster by the gravity of an even greater mass of dark matter. Without dark matter, which is invisible and can only be detected through its gravity, the fast-moving galaxies and the hot gas would quickly fly apart. The discovery, using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes, gives direct evidence for the existence of dark matter. The team was granted more than 100 hours on the Chandra telescope to observe the galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. The cluster is also known as the bullet cluster, because it contains a spectacular bullet-shaped cloud of hundred-million-degree gas. The X-ray image shows the bullet shape is due to a wind produced by the high-speed collision of a smaller cluster with a larger one. In addition to the Chandra observation, the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and the Magellan optical telescopes were used to determine the location of the mass in the clusters. This was done by measuring the effect of gravitational lensing, where gravity from the clusters distorts light from background galaxies as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. The hot gas in this collision was slowed by a drag force, similar to air resistance. In contrast, the dark matter was not slowed by the impact, because it does not interact directly with itself or the gas except through gravity. This produced the separation of the dark and normal matter seen in the data. If hot gas was the most massive component in the clusters, as proposed by alternative gravity theories, such a separation would not have been seen. Instead, dark matter is required. These results are being published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. http://chandra.nasa.gov ",

            "answer_text": "There is quite a bit of observational evidence! Modern cosmology could be said to begin in 1915 after Albert Einstein had published his theory of relativity[1]. In the 1920s, different scientists including Friedman, Robertson, Walker and Lemaitre[2] applied Einstein\u2019s theory to outer space and came up with several possible solutions to the state of the universe. Their conclusions were that it was static, contracting or expanding. In 1929, Edwin Hubble in Pasadena at the Mt. Wilson Observatory observed red shift of distant galaxies which proved that the universe was actually expanding[3]. In the early days of our universe, it was densely packed with particles that were hot and interacted frequently with each other[4]. This was at the time shortly after the Big Bang. Since then the universe has expanded and cooled. Today we know all atomic matter any out up to 4.9% of the universe[5]. Dark matter therefore makes up the bulk of mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters. This is known due to recorded observational evidence of: 1. Rotation curves 2. Lensing 3. The Bullet cluster. In 1933, Fritz Zwicky observed a cluster of galaxies called the Coma Cluster. Gravity is the force holding orbiting galaxies together, so the faster two galaxies orbit each other, the stronger the gravitational attraction needs to be in order for them to stay together. As mass of the galaxies increases the effect of the gravitational attraction between these two bodies will also increase. Zwicky calculated the mass of galaxies based on their orbital speed, however he found they did not contain enough visible mass to provide enough gravity to hold them together. Because of this observation he proposed \u2018Dark matter\u2019, as an explanation for galaxies that were moving too quickly too stay in the cluster. \u2018Dark matter\u2019 was an unknown and unseen matter, which sped up the rotation of galaxies. Zwicky\u2019s work began the dark matter problem[6]. His observations however had too many uncertainties in them to make any solid claims. He hugely overestimated the amount of invisible material[7]. However the term he used to dub the material has stuck. Later in the 1970s, Vera Rubin made a similar conclusion from observations that were much more accurate than Zwicky\u2019s. At that time, scientists believed that objects near the edge of a galaxy would orbit more slowly because of a weaker gravitational attraction. However, she found that the the outermost stars in a galaxy were moving much more quickly than expected. Because of this high velocity, there must have been a lot of mass that was unaccounted for therefore she concluded that there must be dark matter in the galaxies to account for the higher velocities[8]. More observations have only confirmed Rubin\u2019s work.  A second piece of evidence for dark matter that has been observed is gravitational lensing. Albert Einstein believed that space wasn\u2019t just emptiness between stars- it was an actual thin sheet with matter and energy embedded in it. It acts like a fabric with everything stuck to it. In reality, gravity is actually just bending of the fabric of space. For example, a marble passing a bowling ball sitting on a mattress will have a curve in its motion around the large mass. In the same way, light also bends around space that is distorted by gravity. The more massive an object is, the more gravity it has. It will have more warped space and therefore light is bent to a greater extent too. This effect is called gravitational lensing. Einstein\u2019s equations tell us the amount of bending depends on the mass of the clusters. Therefore we can measure the mass of a cluster by the distortion of mass behind it. A third piece of observed evidence for dark matter is the Bullet Cluster[9]. The Bullet Cluster is a collision between two galaxy clusters. The atomic matter stuck together after the collision exists now as together a ball of gas that emits x-ray radiation and therefore scientists have been able to locate the position on the cluster. Because dark matter has no electromagnetic interactions and as it doesn\u2019t have strong interactions between its nuclei overall it is effectively collision-less so the dark matter in the bullet cluster keeps moving. The presence of dark matter in the Bullet Cluster was found by gravitational lensing of objects behind this structure[10]. Overall, the cluster provides a clear distinction between the way ordinary matter behaves and how dark matter behaves. The importance of dark matter can also be highlighted by computer simulations. Without dark matter we would not be able to exist:  Closer to the start of the universe, most of matter was uniformly distributed. Some regions would have extra mass and overtime these places would pull in more mass by gravity. These regions would continue to grow and overtime become a galaxy. A neighbouring region that was less dense would overtime become emptier. In the slides above, the dark matter (represented in white) overtime clumps together[11]. The last cube predicts was the largest structures of our universe should look like. At the intersection if the long filaments of structure, galaxies would be found. This galaxy formation only works because of dark matter. In the early universe, particles such as photons would pull out any clustering of matter and destroy the cluster. Dark matter on the other hand, was able to collapse to make structures in which atoms could then associate with, forming galaxies we know today[12]. As more evidence is found of the existence of dark matter, scientists are investigating what it actually is. A theory was that MACHOS (Massive Compact Halo Objects) were responsible for dark matter. Objects such as stellar remnants, faint stars and black holes were thought to be responsible for all the missing mass. However these cannot explain all the dark matter in galaxies[13]. There may be some small contribution to the dark matter mass, but it is not the dominating factor. A leading current theory is that WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) are responsible for dark matter. They are considered a strong candidate in the search for what dark matter is. This is because they are their own antiparticles and because of this would have annihilated amongst themselves in the early universe. This would have left behind the correct number of particles based on predictions, which explains the dark matter[14]. Another reason is that they are predicted by theories proposed for completely different reasons such as super symmetry[15] which is the extension of the standard model of particles. From all the data scientists have collected, we know that now in the universe, about 4.9% is composed of normal atomic matter and little of the remaining amount is understood.  [16] Dark matter is only a small portion of the universe compared to dark energy. Astronomers looked for special type 1A supernovas when investigating the expansion of the universe to search for evidence of dark energy. Type 1A supernovas are white dwarfs that increase in mass until the pressure can no longer sustain its own gravity. It then collapses and undergoes thermo-nuclear fusion and explodes[17]. These types of supernovae occur when the mass of the white dwarf is larger than the mass of our sun, which is the point where pressure over comes gravity and therefore a standard luminosity can be known for these objects. The distance of these objects can be found using the brightness they appear in a telescope. These can be compared with the supernova red shifts and the speed of expansion of the universe can be found this way. However the supernovae were fainter that expected so the predictions based on red shifts were underestimates of the distances to the exploding stars[18]. The supernovae were further than expected and therefore the expansion of the universe was accelerating. At the end of the last century, scientists eventually came to the agreement that dark energy causes the universe to accelerate outwards rather than the expected deceleration and causes distant galaxies to move away from us faster expansion. It\u2019s really a great time to be alive because of large advances in science that are allowing some of the most fundamental questions in cosmology and astronomy are being successfully addressed by experiments. Hopefully a much more complete understanding of the universe will come in a few decades! Perhaps we should get used to the idea that the universe isn't going to give up its secrets so easily (:  [1] Taylor Redd, Nola (2016) Space.com: \u2018Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity\u2019 Available: http://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html [2] Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (2016): \u2018Einstein Online- Dictionary\u2019 Available: http://www.einstein-online.info/dictionary/friedmann-lemaitre-robertson-walker-universe [3] Hubble Space Telescope: \u2018Edwin Powell Hubble - The man who discovered the cosmos\u2019 Available: https://www.spacetelescope.org/about/history/the_man_behind_the_name/ [4] LaRocco, Chris & Rothstein, Blair University of Michigan: \u2018The Big Bang\u2019 Available: http://umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.html [5] Nasa: \u2018Universe 101- Our Universe\u2019 Available : http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_matter.html [6] Edgall, Mark (July 2012) Decoded Science: \u2018The remarkable discoveries of Fritz Zwicky\u2019 Available: http://www.decodedscience.org/the-remarkable-discoveries-fritz-zwicky/15456 [7] Straumann, Norbert (March 2013) SPS: \u2018Fritz Zwicky: An Extraordinary Astrophysicist\u2019 Available : http://www.sps.ch/en/articles/history-of-physics/fritz-zwicky-an-extraordinary-astrophysicist-6/ [8] Annenberg Learner: \u2018Initial Evidence of Dark Matter\u2019 Available: https://www.learner.org/courses/physics/unit/text.html?unit=10&secNum=2 [9] Pearson: \u2018Dark matter, dark energy and the fate of the universe\u2019 Available: https://www.pearsonhighered.com/bennettecp7einfo/assets/pdf/bennett-ch18.pdf [10] Wikipedia: \u2018Bullet Cluster\u2019 Available: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster [11] Cosmological physics: \u2018Formation of the large-scale structure in the Universe: filaments\u2019 Available [online]: http://cosmicweb.uchicago.edu/filaments.html [12] CALTECH: \u2018Dark matter and structure formation\u2019 Available: https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept09/Einasto/Einasto5.html [13] Astro Wiki: \u2018Dark matter\u2019 Available: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/cosmology/darkmatter.html [14] CALTECH: \u2018WIMPS and MACHOS\u2019 Available : http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay20/eaa-wimps-machos.pdf [15] Cooper, Keith (September 2011) Astronomy Now: \u2018Black holes punching through stars may solve dark matter\u2019 Available [online]: http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1109/22bh/ [16] Astronomical Society of the Pacific: Image available: https://www.astrosociety.org/education/astronomy-resource-guides/cosmology-the-origin-evolution-ultimate-fate-of-the-universe/ [17] HETDEX: \u2018Exploding stars\u2019 (2015) Available: http://hetdex.org/dark_energy/how_find_it/supernovae.php [18] Physics today: \u2018Supernovae, dark energy and the accelerating universe\u2019 (April 2003) Available: http://www-supernova.lbl.gov/PhysicsTodayArticle.pdf ",

Newtonian gravitation, and General Relativity require it to be matter, other theories (MOND, Teves) try and explain it with just more arbitrary constants and more abstruse math. Dark Matter is largely our ignorance, and not necessarily exotic matter that needs explanation. As for Dark Energy, this applies to General Relativity, since Newtonian gravity cannot extend to all of displayed history. And it can be formulated as Dark Energy, a Cosmological Constant, or both. And it is not \u201canti-gravity\u201d, not \u201cvacuum energy\u201d, cannot be any sort of \u201cstuff\u201d, but is more likely a \u201claw of physics\u201d. SOMETHING is required to slow the rate of expansion to less than the \u201cnatural\u201d rate of the original Friedmann equations (GR), yet be flexible enough to describe the WHOLE history of the Universe displayed. The entire evidence is \u201cin support of observation\u201d and \u201capplication of standard gravitational model\u201d. So either the model is flawed, the observations are flawed, or there is something to this. We have challenged the theory / model, and it does not have weaknesses at sub-expansion scales, so\u2026 Dark Matter *is* something. Dark Energy, in lieu of knowing HOW it is the value it is right now, in terms of other physical constraints, figure there is some\u201dthing\u201d there too. ",

The Einstein Field equations are [math]G_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = 8 \\pi T_{\\mu\\nu} [/math], which (by the way) actually encompasses 10 coupled differential equations for the universe. G is the \"curvature term\", which makes paths curve relative to each other. T is the stress-energy tensor, which represents the locations of all the mass and energy in the universe.Lambda ([math]\\Lambda[/math]) is the cosmological constant. It might be written on either side of the equation (as curvature or as mass).... Dark energy is the statement that the constant seems to be non-zero (Einstein assumed otherwise when he first introduced the equations) It can be lumped in with the Einstein tensor (where it is called the Cosmological Constant) - which amounts to saying that the universe is more curved than one would expect from its mass and energy (the stress tensor T) alone.  If you lump it in instead with the stress-energy tensor, it's called \"Dark Energy\" and it amounts to saying that \"there's extra energy at every point in space than we expect from the energy we can see alone\" - a zero-point energy, as it were -  which causes curvature and expansion of the universe that we can't explain.It seems to account for 73% of all energy in the universe, so it's pretty significant, mostly because the universe is mostly empty space, so it adds up. We don't know much about it on a local scale; it's visible on cosmological scales though. Dark matter is different entirely. It comes from the observation that galaxies should not be able to rotate at the speed they seem to rotate at based on their visible mass alone (and this is a huge effect - approximately 84% of the mass required for our observations seems to be invisible). It's 23% of the mass-energy total in the universe. If dark energy is 73% and dark matter is 23%, then there's only 4% left for the visible mass and energy in the universe, which is amazing.Dark matter is thought to possibly be a type of particle which doesn't interact all with photons - a WIMP, a weakly-interacting massive particle, which literally means \"it interacts via the Weak Force and has mass\", but does not interact with the Electromagnetic force.

            "answer_text": "The biggest prof that I can detect is everything seems connected. For instance gravity can reach across vast distances of nothingness to effect another body. How can matter magically reach across nothing with nothing and effect another object. And do this information exchange they say instantly. To me this can only be done because everything is floating in a medium that is infinitly everywhere. I believe this medium is infinitly connected to itself. Yet is without any form so It will be nearly infinitly light and movable with little resistance accept over vast distances. When a body pulls on this medium its moves the entire medium in existance at that moment to that particle hince pulling every others particle in existance who then it range of influence towards it. The largest objects wine the tug of war. I believe the fabric of space is in a constant upheavals of death and birth. And only exists as a permanent medium threw the steadiness of is birth. So once a object begins to pull on this medium it begins movement of existing medium at that moment towards it. In space once movement even if in essence it is a temporary existance the over all medium still moves in that direction. While newly born medium can now be pulled in other new direction. Second prof is Bose instien condensate is the stuff particles are made up of. Once you break apart a particle with lasers you get Bose instien condensate. I believe this is the fabric of space And dark energy all in one and the same thing. I believe dark matter is like static on a tv screen. Picture the circumfrance of a circle as one tv static. The fabric in the circle disconnects from the rest of the medium and shrinks into itself as a point of gravitational flow into the center of the circle. A small singularity. New fabric regenerates to re fill the circle. The flow as begun to this new tiny singularity. And now it is a new singularity in the medium of dark energy.the new singularity is tiny and verry week but permanent. The medium is dying and re born constantly and has no permanent form. Existing and not existing simaltaniously. The medium I believe is born from a imbalence in space ( the existance of nothing) itself that creats a force everywhere space is. The fabric of space, the medium, Bose instien condensate, eather, time, dark energy are all the same thing. It's all born from a imperfection inherent in space. Without this imperfection nothing could exist. Nothing This is how I believe something can be born from nothing. Perfection is completely impossible. I say everything is perfectly imperfect. And is good. And god created light and it was good Also read the verry first parts of the bible it repeatedly says god let it happen. Not he made it happen. I believe then fabric of space was there he just set it in motion. Even when the bible say god nade a star first before the earth it says he let it happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Alex's answer is pretty good on all fronts, but I'd like to share one piece of pretty good evidence for why dark matter (or something like dark matter) existed. Watch the following video, and I will explain.   This is a model of what is called the Bullet Cluster. The blue is dark matter, and the red is hot gas (gas, in astrophysics, is mainly just matter that isn't condensed... you can basically think of it as collection of matter that's not strictly a star or black hole, and on larger scales you can treat huge collections of stars and even clusters as a gas in some way because remember, gas just means a very low density collection of particles). Now remember that dark matter only interacts gravitationally. In other words, no electromagnetic forces, which means no friction, drag, or any fluid or aero-like phenomenon. You can see that the red gas shocks--that is, they DO interact via E&M forces because it's normal matter. The thing to look at now is the plumes after they've shocked and passed through each other. The gas was always going to collide, shock, and slow each other down, but the shape of the cloud is what gives evidence of dark matter halos inside the clusters. The gas interacts gravitationally with the dark matter halos as they pass through. There are more details that make it even more convincing, but they're pretty technical and I'm not sure if I could explain them very well (relative to how useful it would be to actually understand anyway). So far, there isn't much that any alternative theory to dark matter can do with this particular problem. Personally, I find it quite convincing. As far as I know, there isn't a whole lot of direct evidence for dark energy, although some might point to the fact that the universe is expanding as proof, linking it to the lambda term in the Einstein field equations.

            "answer_text": "What Is Dark Matter? Dark matter\u2014stuff that neither emits nor absorbs light\u2014holds the universe together. Its nature is a mystery. There is strong evidence that the bulk of it is not the ordinary matter of which we and the stars are made. The working hypothesis is that it is composed of elementary particles left over from the earliest moments of creation. The leading candidates for dark matter are new particles whose existence is predicted by theories that attempt to unify the forces and particles of nature. Showing that one (or several) of these particles compose the dark matter not only would answer a key question in cosmology but also would shed new light on the fundamental forces and particles of nature. Clues to the nature of the dark matter will come from astronomical observations of its distribution in the universe as well as from study of the evolution of structure in the universe. There are also important opportunities to detect the dark matter particles holding our galaxy together, either directly or indirectly, by detecting the particles into which they annihilate. Accelerators may also be able to produce the dark matter particle. What Is the Nature of Dark Energy? Two independent lines of evidence indicate the presence of a new form of energy pervading the universe that accounts for two-thirds of the critical density and is causing the expansion of the universe to speed up rather than slow down. This is an extraordinary result, so extraordinary that the first order of business is establishing further evidence for accelerated expansion and the existence of dark energy. Assuming that it exists, this mysterious dark energy exhibits a hitherto unseen feature of gravity (it can sometimes be repulsive), and understanding its nature could lead to progress in our understanding of space, time, and matter. Explanations put forth for the dark energy range from the energy of the quantum vacuum to the influence of unseen space-time dimensions. Sciencemagazine was not exaggerating when in 1998 it chose as the scientific breakthrough of the year the discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating. Dark energy by its very nature is extremely diffuse, and its effect can be felt only on the largest scales, where it influences the expansion of the universe and the growth of structure within it. Getting at the nature of dark energy will necessarily involve telescopes rather than accelerators, and key opportunities exist to use supernovae, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies to probe both the expansion and the formation of structure.

            "answer_text": "Yes. There is zero things that can be connected to any supernatural being, like in none what so ever. There is nothing that points to a creator, designer or anything like that. Not because we don't want to see it, not because we decide to overlook anything supernatural and frankly there are so many scientists that keeping it a secret is impossible. It is because it isn't there, not at all. There is not even a hint at it. Though you can easily get locked in some debate about something minuscule detail, the overall picture is very well understood and there is no debate on the issue. Like just for fun, if you designed humans, would you use the waste disposal system also as a pleasure and breeding system ? Would you not have given us vision in the dark ? We are so badly designed that it really doesn't matter where you look, even a basic 9th grader would design a much better human. Dark matter is observable though you can't see it, just like gravity. Remember that dark matter is just a name, they could have called it Matter X, the unknown matter, mysterious matter or even green matter, they could have skipped adding the \"matter\" in it. It is just a name, like Charlie. I am not a physicist, but I have great interest in science, have watched many documentaries on this subject, read books, talked to people and as far as I know there is no physicist that doesn't think there is dark matter, as far as I know, it is like gravity, it is there, we can't see it, but we can clearly see the effects and observe it. Just throw a pen up in the air and when it lands again, you have just witnessed gravity. How you test for dark matter is quite a lot harder. ",

            "answer_text": "Dark energy has not been around long enough for a decent explanation that satisfies theoretical physicists to be made, let alone one which will satisfy the average person. My best stab is as follows:The universe is expanding. Every single point is moving away from every other point over time. To understand how that can be so, imagine the surface of a partially inflated balloon, which we now mark with dots using a pen. If we inflate the balloon more, the distance between all the dots increases. The dots only know about things on the surface of the balloon, so to an individual dot, it just looks like all the nearby dots are rushing away, and the more distant dots are rushing away even faster. In the real universe, these dots are galaxies.Now, you might expect that at some point the balloon will be fully inflated, and that as that point is approached, the expansion will slow down (in the real universe, gravity ought to be slowing down the expansion). Imagine your surprise if you discovered that the more the balloon was inflated, the faster its rate of inflation got. Weird huh? You\u2019d have to have a think about it, and conclude that the balloon-skin has some strange property that you\u2019ve never seen before. Perhaps as it stretches, that starts some kind of chemical reaction that heats the air inside the balloon and slackens the balloon skin? Or maybe it\u2019s something else - perhaps there\u2019s a limited supply of air in the room, and as you pump it into the balloon the external pressure drops? Whatever it is, it\u2019s not something you included in your simple model of how a balloon works. All you have is your measurement that the expansion is accelerating over time, and a bunch of highly speculative theories that you don\u2019t yet have the means to test. \u2018Mysterious Something\u2019 is not a good name for the effect, so you decide to call it \u2018Dark Energy\u2019 after noting that the acceleration requires some additional energy source that you can\u2019t detect.(this is pretty much where we\u2019re up to with Dark Energy. The universe is expanding, and the expansion is getting quicker. We don\u2019t know for sure why that\u2019s happening.)Okay, so much for Dark Energy. Let\u2019s talk about Dark Matter, which has been around a lot longer as a theory and we\u2019re fairly confident we understand:Matter is just \u2018stuff\u2019. Specifically, stuff with mass, meaning it gets attracted by gravity and exerts a gravitational pull on other stuff. \u2018Stuff\u2019 is a pretty broad category. It contains coffee mugs, air, black holes, water, planets, paper-clips\u2026 all these things have mass. Clearly though, all these things have very different properties \u2014 they behave in quite different ways when you do stuff with them. Just try throwing a coffee mug and a paperclip on the ground; you\u2019ll see what I mean.A lot of these properties are complicated and to do with chemistry or the science of materials, but some are quite fundamental things to do with physics \u2014 for example, the fact that all of them respond to gravity (because they have mass). Most of the stuff we\u2019re familiar with has another fundamental property, that it responds to the electromagnetic force. \u201cNo they don\u2019t!\u201d I hear you exclaim, \u201cI can\u2019t attract a coffee mug with a magnet!\u201d. You\u2019re right, of course, but you need to look a little closer. The atoms in the coffee mug are made from positive protons and negative electrons, and they are bound together by the attraction of opposite charges. The next atom over doesn\u2019t get any closer, because the electrons push each other away. So when you drop your coffee mug on the ground, the reason it stops abruptly and destructively is because the atoms in the floor didn\u2019t budge when they came into contact with the atoms in the mug. The local repulsion of a bunch of atoms overcame the gravitational attraction of the entire Earth.Right, so what happens if we suggest that there\u2019s other types of stuff out there which don\u2019t respond to the electromagnetic force? Well, firstly it means that gravity is now the most important thing in their lives. They don\u2019t form atoms, so you won\u2019t get complicated structures, just simple particles with mass that respond to gravity and nothing else. More dramatically, these are invisible, because it turns out that light is an oscillating electromagnetic wave. Coffee mugs are opaque because the wave interacts with electrons in the atoms and doesn\u2019t keep going. Even air isn\u2019t completely transparent \u2014 if it didn\u2019t interact with light, the sky wouldn\u2019t appear blue. So this type of matter \u2014 stuff \u2014 is genuinely dark. Or, in fact, invisible.So does anything like this actually exist? Well, yes. We\u2019ve detected particles called neutrinos which act exactly like this. But there doesn\u2019t just have to be one type of stuff like that, there could be a whole bunch of different particles which act just as I\u2019ve said. Finally, observations of the actual universe tell us that there\u2019s a lot more stuff out there than we can actually see, and simulations show that to form galaxies at all we need significant amounts of invisible stuff to hold them together. What I want to convince you of is that there\u2019s nothing strange about dark matter; it\u2019s just a different type of stuff that outnumbers \u2018everyday\u2019 stuff by a factor of four, but can\u2019t clump together to form atoms or planets.

            "answer_text": "Dark Matter and Dark Energy...Resolved! By Tom Watkins In 2008 (and updated by a second study in 2010), lead researcher Alexander Kashlinsky of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, and his team, completed a study of three years of data from a NASA satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) using the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. They found evidence of a common motion of distant clusters of galaxies of at least 600 to 1,000 km/s (2+ million miles per hour) toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of Centaurus and Vela. This corresponds with the direction of the Great Attractor, which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the Norma Cluster, located about 250 million light-years away from the Milky Way. Kashlinsky and colleagues suggested that whatever is pulling on the mysteriously moving galaxy clusters might lay outside the visible universe. Telescopes cannot see events earlier than about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) formed; this corresponds to a distance of about 46 billion (4.6\u00d71010) light years. Since the matter causing the net motion in Kashlinsky\u2019s proposal is outside this range, it would appear to be outside our visible universe. Kashlinsky calls this collective motion a \u201cdark flow,\u201d in analogy with more familiar cosmological mysteries: dark energy and dark matter. Dark Flow and the Great Attractor may or may not be the same phenomenon. \u201cThe distribution of matter in the observed universe cannot account for this motion,\u201d he said. Kashlinsky said: \"At this point we don't have enough information to see what it is, or to constrain it. We can only say with certainty that somewhere very far away the world is very different than what we see locally. Whether it's 'another universe' or a different fabric of space-time we don't know.\u201d According to standard cosmological models, the motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the cosmic microwave background should be randomly distributed in all directions. Dark Flow contradicts conventional theories, which describe such motions as decreasing at ever greater distances: large-scale motions should show no particular direction relative to the background. If the Big Bang theory is correct, then this should not happen so we must conclude that either (1) their measurements are wrong or (2) the big bang theory is wrong. Since they have measured no small movement (2+ million MPH) by 1,400 galaxy clusters all moving in the same direction, it seems unlikely that their observations are wrong. So that leaves us to conclude perhaps the whole big bang theory or some aspects of it are wrong. In fact, there are numerous indicators that our present generally accepted theory of the universe is wrong and has been wrong all along. Certainly our best minds are trying to make sense of the universe but when we can\u2019t do so, we make up stuff to account for those aspects we cannot explain. Or perhaps we got it all wrong. Consider the evidence and the assumptions we have drawn from them.The Big Bang is based on Big Guesses and Fudge Factors \u039bCDM is an abbreviation for Lambda-Cold Dark Matter. It is frequently referred to as the concordance model of big bang cosmology, since it attempts to explain cosmic microwave background (CMBR) observations, as well as large scale structure observations and supernovae observations of the accelerating expansion of the universe. It is the simplest known model that is in general agreement with observed phenomena.\u039b (Lambda) stands for the cosmological constant which is a dark energy term that allows for the current accelerating expansion of the universe. Currently, 0.74, implying 74% of the energy density of the present universe is in this form. That is an amazing statement \u2013 that 74% of all the energy in the universe is accounted for by this dark energy concept. This is a pure guess based on what has to be present to account for the expansion of the universe. Since we have not yet discovered a single hard fact about dark energy - we don\u2019t know what it is or what causes it or what form it takes \u2013 Lambda is a made up number that we backed into the math formulas to equal the observations in a crude manner. We do not know if dark energy is a single force or the effects of multiple forces since we have no units of measure to quantify it. It is suppose to be an expansion force that is countering the effects of gravity but it does not appear to be anti-gravity or reverse gravity nor does it appear to be emanating from any one location or area of space. It appears to have no direction other than outward and seems to be totally uniform wherever we look. We can observe the universe out billions of light years and yet we have not found a single observable evidence for dark energy other than its mathematical implications. Dark matter is also a purely hypothetical factor that expresses the content of the universe that the math models say must be present in order to account for why galaxies do not fly apart. Studies show that there is not enough mass in most large galaxies to keep them together and to account for their rotational speeds, gravitational lensing and other large structure observations. The amount of mass needed to account for the observations is not just a little bit off. Back in 1933, Fritz Zwicky calculated that it would take 400 times more mass than is observed in galaxies and clusters to account for observed behavior. This is not a small number. Dark matter accounts for 22% of all of the matter in the universe. Since Zwicky trusted his math and observations to be flawless, he concluded that there is, in fact, all the needed mass in each galaxy but we just can\u2019t see it. Thus was born the concept of dark matter. Although we can see 2.7 x 10 23 miles into space, we have not yet observed or detected a single piece of dark matter. To account for this seemingly show-stopping fact, advocates say, \u201cwell, duh, it\u2019s DARK matter\u201d, you can\u2019t SEE it!\u201d. However, it appears that it is not just dark but also completely transparent because areas of dense dark matter do not stop stars from being visible behind the dark matter. So, 22% of all the mass in the universe cannot be seen, is, in fact, transparent, has never ever been observed, and does not appear to have had any direct interactions with any known mass other than the effects of gravity. That is, at least, the generally accepted understanding. The remaining 4% of the universe consists of 3.6% intergalactic gas and just 0.4% makes up all of the matter (baryon particles) that makes up all the atoms (and photons) of all the visible planets and stars in the universe. \u039bCDM is a model. \u039bCDM says nothing about the fundamental physical origin of dark matter, dark energy and the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations: in that sense, it is merely a useful parameterization of ignorance. One last problem with modern cosmology. There is a very poor agreement between quantum mechanics and cosmology. On numerous levels and subjects, quantum mechanics does not scale up to account for cosmological observations and cosmology does not scale down to agree with quantum mechanics. Sir Roger Penrose, perhaps one of the pre-eminent mathematicians in the world, has published numerous studies documenting the failure of our math to accurately reflect our observed universe and vice versa. He can show hundreds of failures of math to account for observations while showing hundreds of observations that contradict the math we believe in. The conventional wisdom of the scientific establishment cannot find fault with his math or the observations but they have nonetheless labeled his documented anomalies as inconsistent with accepted theories and then they ignore him and his work. The truth is that we have done the best we can but we should not fool ourselves that we have discovered the truth. Much as we once believed in ether, astrology, a flat earth and the four humours \u2013 we must be willing to expand our thinking that notions like dark matter are ingenious and inventive explanations that account for observations but probably do not relate to factual and realistic natural phenomenon. This is especially true in discussions of dark matter and dark energy. There is, however, a logical and quite simple explanation of all of the anomalies and observations that perplex cosmology today related to dark matter and dark energy. The trouble is that we have actually created an arbitrary set of rules or laws that prohibits us from discovering this solution and resolving this problem. First, let\u2019s look at a few important indicators that should have led us to conclude what dark matter is. 1. We can locate the presence of dark matter by gravitational lensing of background stars and galaxies. When we do this, we find that dark matter is not evenly and smoothly distributed throughout the universe. It is clumped together in some areas and totally absent in others. It is also present in different densities in various galaxies. One interesting fact is that most galaxies have a dark matter halo around them that extends out about twice as far as the visible matter. This, in part, is what accounts for the galaxy rotation anomalies. However, recent observations has shown that this halo is more dense as the luminosity of the galaxy rises. In other words, bright galaxies have a larger, denser halo of dark matter around them - regardless of the size of the galaxy. A small bright galaxy can have a denser dark matter halo than a much large dim galaxy. This is a clear indicator that there is an interaction between the visible matter and the dark matter in the form of a pressure or push of the dark matter outward by some form of emitted radiation from the visible matter in the galaxy. Perhaps it is the solar pressure of the photons, or powerful neutrinos from supernovae or some other form of emitted radiation from the stars. 2. The dark flow described above would imply a massive gravitational presence that is attracting all those galaxies over such a vast distance. Most scientists hesitate to speculate about this because it is so far outside of \u201cconventional thinking\u201d to imagine an object large enough (hundreds of millions of light years across) to have that much gravity pull and yet it is not visible. The projected location of this source of gravity is also difficult to discuss because it is beyond the visible universe. If something that big is just beyond or way beyond the visible edge of our universe, what does that say about the size of our universe? And why aren\u2019t all of galaxies in a uniform circle around this gravitational source moving toward it? Why are its effects being felt only in a particular direction from this source? On the other hand, it might also imply something like a supermassive black hole - bigger than we have ever seen or imagine. To address this anomaly\u2026...we ignore it. 3. Then there is the dark energy problem making itself felt only as the unknown force that is causing the accelerating expansion of the universe. It has no observable location or source and we have no idea what form this force would take. If we let our imagination run wild, we could imagine the universe was inside a giant ball. The ball would represent an enveloping shell of dense matter that has a strong gravitational pull on everything inside the ball but it pulls outward evenly throughout the interior universe. If this shell was dense enough and had enough gravitational pull, it would do exactly what we observe that our universe is doing. The obvious question would be what is beyond this shell and where did it come from. But, then what scientist in his right mind would ever propose such a ridiculous idea. 4. To discuss dark matter, we have to first acknowledge that it has not been found in any collider experiment in the last 40 years. What are the odds that all the different studies and all the different scientists have not been able to find the least bit of evidence of something as massive as dark matter which seems to be 5 times as dense as regular matter and yet it has not been involved in one of these collisions or detected by any of the massive detectors that have been built? It can be logically argued that if dark matter existed as particles, they would have been found by now. 5. As is often done, using the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as evidence for dark matter is circular logic. The CMBR data is evaluated using the Lambda-CDM model assumptions, so it is no wonder that dark matter answers out of the application of the model back onto the same data. And then we have the rules we must follow in our thinking. Most of these rules exist for the sole purpose of keeping our thinking and analysis within limits of what we know how to do. In other words, they keep us from thinking outside the box. Let\u2019s look at some of them and their implications: A.\tThe Copernican Principle says that there should be no ``special'' observers. What this means to scientists is that if they think up a theory that requires a special origin or viewpoint, then it is not plausible - which means that if an idea requires some special condition, then it is incomplete or just dead wrong. Because nearly all cosmological and scientific theories are scrutinized by the Copernican principle, the adoption of this principle means that scientists will not even allow themselves to imagine a solution that challenges this rule. B.\tThe Cosmological Principle is derived from the Copernican principle and it implies that the entire Universe is isotropic and homogeneous. Isotropy means the Universe looks the same to all observers and the Universe looks the same in all directions as viewed by a particular observer. Homogeneous means that the average density of matter is about the same in all places in the Universe and the Universe is fairly smooth on large scales. This is clearly not true for the Universe on small scales but what constitutes a small or large scale has changed over the years. In today\u2019s world, by definition, we only consider the isotropy and homogeneity of the Universe on scales of 300 million of light-years in size. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is fundamental to observational cosmology. However, with the increasingly precise data provided by WMAP, the maps of the CMBR exhibits anomalies, such as very large scale anisotropies, anomalous alignments, and non-Gaussian distributions as well as the longstanding low-l multipole controversy. The scale of the cosmological principle has been adjusted larger and larger over the years as we have found more and more precise measures of how inhomogeneous the universe actually is. Despite this, no one will dare challenge this rule by even thinking that there might be differences in matter or other anomalies somewhere in the universe. Perhaps this is one reason that we have failed to explain dark flow and the Great Attractor. It should be noted that although the cosmological principle is derived from the Copernican Principle and it has no foundation in any particular physical or mathematical model or theory, i.e. it can not be proved in a mathematical sense. On the one hand, it is an absolutely essential criteria for scientists to resolve math models of the universe on cosmological scales. On the other hand, when we do actually measure or observe something that challenges this principle, we either adjust the scale upward to average out the anomaly or we discount the observation as being flawed. C.\tA corollary to the cosmological principle is that the laws of physics are universal. This has become an immutable law that demands that the same physical laws and models that apply here on the Earth also works in all parts of the entire Universe. As with the cosmological principle, this is a law that has to be followed because it makes our investigations possible. If we cannot count on our laws of physics to be the same everywhere, we could not compute most of what we do in cosmology. Also, as with the cosmological principle, we have no real proof that this is true, we simply assume it is true in order to make our calculations easier. As has been noted in hundreds of observed anomalies identified by Roger Penrose, we never allow ourselves to imagine that this corollary is false. We always look for some other reason and when none can be found, we either claim the measurement, observation or observer were flawed or we ignore it as an outlier. It is important to note that it is assumed that physical constants (such as the gravitational constant, mass of the electron, speed of light) are also unchanging from place to place within the Universe, and over time. Given the length of time and the size of the universe, it takes a lot of faith and hubris to maintain this idea, especially when we have no proof that it is true. Of course, you can argue that it is supported by empirical evidence but is it really? If the scale on which such changes might occur - millions of light years - we would not observe or experience changes in anything local to us within that distance. If we did (and we have), then we ignore that breaking this rule is a possible answer. For much larger scales, what ability do we have to measure differences that far away? How would we know that for a region of space 3 billion light years away, the speed of light is faster or slower than we observe here? We see what we limit ourselves to see and make what we observe to fit what we have defined. D.\tFinally, we come to a definition that we have accepted as fact that the Universe has to contain the properties of everything. This means that the term `edge of the Universe\u2019 assumes that there exists something that is not contained in the Universe. Invoking an outside property to the Universe (an edge to the Universe) we have defined as logically inconsistent since, by definition, the Universe must contain everything. This, too, limits our thinking despite the fact that we have no idea how big the entire universe is and we have observations, like dark flow, that defy explanation unless you allow for something beyond what we can observe. Now let\u2019s break some rules. Let\u2019s suppose for just a moment that dark matter does interact with baryon particles and/or other forms of high energy radiation. This is certainly implied by the denser halos around high luminous galaxies. We have dark matter maps that clearly show a non-homogeneous distribution of dark matter in the universe. Dark matter is present around, in and near galaxies and it is less often seen in areas of empty space. In those instances where it is measured in areas devoid of stars or galaxies, there might be unseen or thin clouds of gases or a density of radiated particles. What we observe, if we will allow ourselves to consider it, is that dark matter is affected by some form of radiation from galaxies and that dark matter exists primarily where we observe baryon matter. Now let\u2019s introduce the Higgs field. Since 2012,we know that the Higgs boson exists and was found by the LHC at CERN. The theory, which so far agrees with all of our observations, calculations and with the Standard Model, is that the Higgs boson is responsible for the Higgs field which permeates the entire universe and gives mass to baryon particles. We still do not know exactly how or why different particles derive different mass from the Higgs field but it seems that it is this field and the Higgs particle that is responsible. Since gravity is a function of mass, the greater the mass, the greater the gravity. One of those limitations in our thinking says that the mass of an object is the same everywhere or that mass does not change according to location. Since the Higgs field gives mass to objects and we know that the Higgs field is derived from the Higgs boson, the gravity of an object of a given mass is dependent upon the Higgs field. We have seen that the Higgs boson does react to baryon matter - that is how it was discovered - by slamming particles together and ejecting the boson. That means that the radiation from supernovae or other high energy sources might be able to push the Higgs field around and perhaps even create areas of dense and less dense Higgs field. If the Higgs field imparts mass to particles and objects, then what would the effect of an inhomogeneous Higgs field have on the mass of matter in these areas of dense and less dense Higgs field? Since we are not sure exactly how the Higgs field imparts mass to the various particles, it is conjecture to imagine if this process would be impacted by a higher dense Higgs field as opposed to a less dense area of the field. I am suggesting that it is the inhomogeneous Higgs Field that is responsible for differences in the mass of particles and hence the gravity of those particles and that is what appears to us as dark matter. Removing the search for a specific particle as the source of dark matter solves a lot of the questions and speculations about dark matter. The only thing we have to do to allow us to think that this is true is to allow ourselves to violate the barriers of thinking imposed by the Cosmological Principle and imagine that in the vastness of the universe, not everything is homogeneous and that if that includes the density of the Higgs field, then it also includes mass and the gravitational constant.This proposal does not need dark matter to be a new and as yet undiscovered particle. The 50+ year and multi-billion dollar search for dark matter is over.It does not need for the Higgs boson to decompose into a photon and a dark matter particle. (one of many crazy ideas that no one has proven)It does account for why there are clouds of dark matter near and around galaxies.It does explain how the halo around a galaxy is formed by the luminosity (radiation) from the galaxy pushing on the Higgs boson (not some unknown dark matter particle). This also explains why there is more DM in the halo than there is inside the galaxy - it has been pushed out into the halo.It does explain how we have something that is transparent and yet causes gravitational lensing.If you imagine that for some reason, there is a highly dense area of the Higgs field in a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of Centaurus and Vela, then you can also imagine that it is this ultra-strong gravitational field that is causing the dark flow identified by Alexander Kashlinsky and/or is the source of the Great Attractor.Since we experienced the difficulty of finding the Higgs boson first hand at CERN, this also explains why all our attempts to find a unique dark matter particle has failed. There is NO DM \u201cparticle\u201d, it is simply the Higgs Field that permeates the entire universe realized by the Higgs boson.It may also be that any discontinuity or inhomogeneous nature of the Higgs field exists only on large cosmological scales. This would mean that in the realm of our solar system and perhaps in most of our galaxy, there is no detectable variation in the Higgs field and therefore, we would not directly observe any local changes to mass, gravity or physical constants - which is exactly what we do detect.It is completely consistent with the Standard Model without invoking Supersymmetry. The Higgs particle was the last undiscovered particle predicted by the Standard Model. It had a solid theoretical foundation that predicted it, told where to find it and it was found exactly where the Standard Model said it would be.By contrast, dark matter is not predicted by the Standard Model. You need to invoke Supersymmetry which would allow for an electrically neutral particle that doesn't decompose in a couple of minutes. Some would say that Supersymmetry has all but been ruled out by the LHC experiments because the Higgs particle was found nearly exactly where the standard model predicted it would be.Finally, we have the one logical law that has proved to be accurate for a great deal of physics - Occam\u2019s Razor. The principle states that one should not make more assumptions than the minimum needed. This principle underlies all scientific modeling and theory building. Despite the need to violate the Cosmological Principle, this explanation is by far the simplest of all the ideas about dark matter.But wait, there\u2019s more\u2026.. If this can be accepted as a reasonable explanation and perhaps validated by further research, then what does it say about dark energy? The complexity of the suggestion that dark energy is repulsive gravity or some unknown force outside of any known model or theory - this clearly violates Occam\u2019s Razor. It is an exceedingly complex concept that dark energy is some unknown force that somehow accounts for 68% of the mass-energy density of the entire universe and yet we have absolutely no evidence of it other than as an explanation of the expansion rate of the universe. But, what if it is just another result of the Higgs field-dark matter proposal? Imagine an explosion in which the expanding wavefront of the explosion pushes out and compresses the air. Such explosive wavefronts can be seen in atomic bomb explosions as a large dome-shaped cloud forming and expanding at the moment of the burst. If this happened in space, the wavefront of expanding radiation would be a sphere. Now imagine that there is such an explosion of energy and radiation in every galaxy as a result of the accumulated emissions from the combined radiation of all of its stars. If there was air in the galaxy, it would be pushed out just like it is in an atom bomb explosion. What if, instead of air, it is the Higgs field that is pushed out from the galaxy center? As mentioned before, this might account for the halo of dark matter around high luminous galaxies. But now, let\u2019s apply this to a much larger explosion - the big bang. I am proposing that the big bang pushed a highly dense concentration of Higgs bosons creating a dense layer of the Higgs field as it expanded the universe. This might have occurred before or during the expansion phase or more likely in the radiation-dominated era of the big bang but the end effect was the creation of a shell of a highly dense Higgs field surrounding the entire universe. Yes, this violates the idea that by definition, there can be nothing outside the universe or that it cannot have an edge but let\u2019s ignore that limitation in our thinking for a moment. If such a shell exists, then it would have a gravitational pull and would be expanding outward. That gravitational pull could be the source of the \u201creverse gravity\u201d attributed to dark energy. It is, in fact, normal gravity acting to attract outward all parts of the universe. Rather than coming up with some unknown source and concept of reverse or repulsive gravity, this explanation simply uses the existence of normal mass-induced gravity and the idea that the Higgs field may have imparted a strong gravity to this shell. This might be the same as the gravity we experience here on earth. It might be much stronger but haven\u2019t we actually observed that can exist in the presence dark matter lensing? This does not violate basic physics other than those arbitrary principles and definitions that restrict our thinking. We do not have to invoke supersymmetry or violate the Standard Model. We do not have to redefine gravity or find some other new form of repulsive energy. By imagining that this shell around the universe itself has inconsistencies may also help explain the dark flow. If the proposal for the Higgs field resolving dark matter makes sense, then the extension that it also explains dark energy is equally valid. ============ I don\u2019t propose that this is the whole and complete theory. Besides the complex social, political and scientific issue of violating some of the fundamental principles of physics, we also have not resolved how and why the Higgs field reacts differently to different particles. We have not discovered if a denser Higgs field is even possible but if it were, would it invoke a greater mass to a particle than the same particle would receive from a less dense Higgs field? There are indications in the models that the Higgs boson existed very early on after the big bang but we don\u2019t know exactly when or how it might have been affected by the expansion phase and over time. These and other questions strike me as being much more solvable than continuing to look for dark matter particles and the nature of the dark energy force. ============ There is one more implication to this concept. If you buy into this Higgs field-dark matter hypothesis, then it means that the Higgs field is the source of mass of objects - the mass of objects gives them gravity but it also is tied to their inertia, momentum and weight. We now know (from the above logic) that the Higgs boson has some interaction with some sort of radiation emitted by galaxies that pushes the bosons and hence the Higgs field outward. Just for the sake of discussion, let\u2019s call the radiation that can move the Higgs boson the H-force. It might be neutrinos or x-rays or light or who knows what but it is somehow related to luminous galaxies and is probably a force that we already know about. It also might be a force that passes right through humans without any interaction (as, for instance, neutrinos do). Certainly not in the near future but someday, we might be able to create a H-force generator and be able to control and manipulate that force. When that day comes, imagine if we put such a generator into a space ship and used it to push most, if not, all of the Higgs bosons out of the spaceship -creating a bubble around the ship that is devoid of the Higgs boson and hence the Higgs field. Within this bubble, objects would have very little mass and therefore little inertia and momentum. Assuming the effects of the H-force is not perfect, there would be some mass but it might be measured in grams for a space ship that would otherwise weigh hundreds of millions of kilograms. How fast can you go if you apply the thrust of an ion engine to an object (including the ion engine itself except for its exhaust pipe) that has very little mass? As soon as the propellant exiting the engine at near the speed of light, it would boost the ship to massive speeds. If everything in the ship was affected by the removal of the Higgs field by the H-force generator, then objects would have almost no inertia and therefore would not be affected by the rapid acceleration or by fast, sharp turns. This is, in effect, warp drive. By warping the Higgs field around the ship, we create a bubble of near-zero mass that allows the ship to achieve speeds approaching the speed of light - making intergalactic space travel closer to reality. This had been an exercise in imagination science by a person that is not, by profession, scientists nor an expert in cosmology. It is, however, an attempt to think outside the box and imagine the possibilities if we extend our grasp of reality just a little bit further than we can reach now. Before shooting holes in it for failures to account for every nuance and gradation, consider if you are limiting your thinking by a set of arbitrary rules, conventions, stochastic processes or a priori. Are you allowing yourself to explore all the possibilities? ",

            "answer_text": "Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Bad Theory! Copyright 2020 Wardell Lindsay Quaternion Theory can best address these Dark phenomena. I have a Theory of Quaternion Cosmos. Energy is consisted of the product velocity V and momentum P. These variables are Quaternions consisting a scalar part and a Vector part. The velocity V=[c,V] has a scalar part c, the speed of light and V is the vector velocity. The speed is the scalar of all vector velocity! The Momentum P=[ ,P]=[ ,mV] and the Momentum has no scalar . Now here is the Law of Energy W Energy W=[c,V][ ,P]=[c0 -V.P,cP + V0 + VxP] W=[-vp,cP]=[-mGM/r,cP] This is the Energy a scalar - vp and a Vector energy cP. The vector energy cP is the Dark Energy! It is a Vector energy and has three dimensions, c(Ipx + Jpy + Kpz). Physics must recognize vector energy, torque is vector energy. Einstein created CC to counter force of gravity. Einstein thought CC was the reason that gravity did not collapse the Universe. He was right, it is seen in Force. Force is the 1st Derivative of Energy W, F=XW=[d/dr,Del][-vp,cP] F=[[vp/r -cDel.P, cdP/dr - Del vp + cDelxP] F=[mGM/r^2 -cp/r cosP, dP/dt + mGMR/r^3 + cp/rHsinP. The gravity opposed is -cDel.P, this is called the Diverging force, it is the outward force, opposing the inward gravity force. The Dark Energy creates the outward force that opposes gravity. I could talk more about Dark Energy. Newton knew about Dark Energy, he added P in his 3rd Law, to balance Gradient Force, dP/dt=cdP/dr= cdP/cdt=dP/dt. Dark Matter is not matter! My assessment it is a electromagnetic effect. The over gravity speed is the result of intergalactic electron flows that create a force eVxB=evB=mv^2/r. V=(e/m)Br=(176G)uI=176G (z/c)I=220km/s The current I is the result of charged suns rotating in the Galaxy. The current I creates the Bz field perpendicular to the plane. The incoming electron flow in eVr, the force is F=eVrxBz gives a force in theta direction and speeds the suns around faster than gravity. This is the explanation of Dark Energy and Dark Matter.

Follow my work as the Universe will be explained without dark energy or dark matter.

Physics work that pass the difficult work/explanations to dark energy, dark matter or \u2018radiation\u2019 are found lacking when properly weighed and measured against the truth and empirical evidence. Dark energy and dark matter fail woefully in too many critical physic\u2019s laws to garner the ardent scientist\u2019s subscription to either; and precisely why i set about the present work. Simply, the Hubble Constant is about to be scraped for an advance that explains a contracting Universe while indicating the \u2018extra\u2019 gravity dark matter attempts to explain. A contracting Universe require no dark matter opposing gravity.

Dark matter accounts for 27% of the Universe, dark energy accounts for 68% of the Universe. And again, astronomers really have no idea what what it is, only that they\u2019re pretty sure it does exist. 95% of the nature of the Universe is a complete and total mystery. We just have no idea what this stuff is. Back in the late 90s, astronomers wanted to calculate once and for all if the Universe was open or closed. In other words, they wanted to calculate the rate of expansion of the Universe now and then compare this rate to its expansion in the past. In order to answer this question, they searched the skies for a special type of supernova known as a Type 1a. While most supernovae are just massive stars, Type 1a are white dwarf stars that exist in a binary system. The white dwarf siphons material off of its binary partner, and when it reaches 1.6 times the mass of the Sun, it explodes. The trick is that these always explode with roughly the same amount of energy. So if you measure the brightness of a Type 1a supernova, you know roughly how far away it is. Astronomers assumed the expansion was slowing down. But the question was, how fast was it slowing down? Would it slow to a halt and maybe even reverse direction? So, what did they discover? Instead of finding that the expansion of the Universe was slowing down, they discovered that it\u2019s speeding up. That\u2019s like trying to calculate how quickly apples fall from trees and finding that they actually fly off into the sky, faster and faster!!! Astronomers know that dark energy exists. There are multiple lines of evidence. But as with dark matter, they have absolutely no clue what it is! Maybe just one of the features of space itself is that it pushes stuff away. And the more space there is, the more outward pressure you get. Perhaps from virtual particles popping in and out of existence in the vacuum of space. Another possibility is a phenomenon called Quintessence, a negative energy field that pervades the entire Universe. Yes, that sounds totally woo-woo! But it might explain the repulsive force that makes up most of the Universe. And there are other theories, which are even more exotic. But mostly likely it\u2019s something that physicists haven\u2019t even thought of yet! ",

I want to go out on a limb and say that the real evidence for dark matter is like the evidence for ghosts. Vase in the room moved? No one fesses up? Must be a ghost Here is just some basic info. If you are familiar with galaxies, you know that many of them are spirals. The odd thing is that the stars on the outside rotate at the same speed as the inside stars but they should be going slower. So, the dark matter theory goes, they must be pulled along by a Halo of dark matter surrounding the Galaxy. This dark matter however has to be five times more abundant than regular matter to make things work. Moreover, since we can't detect it with\u2026 anything, it must be stuff that only interacts gravitationally. Then, this dark matter is in a halo around galaxies. If it interacts gravitationally, why isn't it an integral part of the Galaxy since gravity is what makes normal matter clump together too. What process could possibly make it hang out in a Halo? Now you have to explain that which is an even tougher nut to crack than the one you claimed to have solved since there is 5 times more of it. Cosmologists favour the dark matter to be a new type of subatomic particle but quantum theory is fairly shored up now with no room for a new particle like this. Before the heleocentric model of the solar system came about there were many mathematicians that tried to make the Earth centered solar system work with complicated math and models. It did work. And you can keep refining it to for further observations but, in the end there was a much simpler more intuitive answer. I think we are at that point with dark matter. Right now we are juggling with math to make things work but when we get a crucial piece of the puzzle we are missing, things may make more sense. We just may find out it was the cleaning lady who moved the vase and not a ghost. ",

Yes think outside the box; but you have to stay attached to the box, or at least keep it in sight..otherwise its no longer the process of science; but just guessing\u2026.albeit\u2026intelligent guessing at times\u2026.but guessing none-the-less\u2026 One observation we can make about every point of reality around us, both adjacent to our existence, and the cosmological morphism\u2019s that extend beyond us\u2026 That there is an emergent behavior to all the systems we see, whether at the quantum level, molecular, biological, earth or planetary energies, even social dynamics\u2026. they all have specific boundary conditions that force a point of complexity on the processes within them, a balance is attained and we see the non-linear, emergent behavior\u2026from hurricanes, to economics, astrological, to even our own consciousnesses\u2026.. For me the question isn\u2019t about the flotsam and jetsam of an almost infinite number of possible observations that point to some unknown forces we can\u2019t see; some call dark matter and dark energy\u2026.but its about the emergent behavior of the whole\u2026that produces the effects we observe\u2026. rather than some missing matter or energy, might it be more about the collective behavior\u2026.for ultimately its not what\u2019s missing that is the key; but what effect is produced by what we cannot see..its basic chaos theory, learning to take a step back and not see chaos and paradoxes, but recognizing their is an unobserved order\u2026.. We all get lost in the infinite processes of our research; but we do have to come up for an intellectual breath at times, and realize the solutions are to be found in the whole of our conceptualizations, which are greater than the relative nature of the bits and pieces we constantly play with\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "None. If you were to see a chair suddenly move across the room unaided by any invisible force, you might conclude that its motion was caused by a \"ghost\". Well, the scientist did just that when they conjured up the scientific \"ghosts\" they now call dark-matter energy to explain why there's a flat speed for certain galactic stars and the appearance of a rapidly expanding universe. In other words, the approximate 2.2 x 10^5 m/s stable speed of stars revolving around the center of spiral galaxies is extremely mysterious, since they don't seem to follow the Newton/Kepler laws of motion. However, there was no need to call upon a \"spiritual\" dark matter to understand their galactic speeds. Those particular cosmic speeds should come as no surprise, since their speeds really do follow the laws of Newton/Kepler, if you understand the natural speed of 2.2 x 10^5 m/s. Although the mass distributions of spiral galaxies and solar systems are not the same, the 2.2 x 10^5 m/s velocities are nearly the same for both systems at a perfectly \"engineered\" distance of four times the radius of the central mass as follows: [ G x (1.7532 x 10^41 kg - mass within Sun's orbit around Milky Way center) / 4 x (6.044 x 10^19 m - radius of Milky Way central rotating bar or \"baton\")] SQRT = 2.2 x 10^5 m/s. [ G x (1.988 x 10^30 kg - Sun's mass) / 4 x (6.96 x 10^8 m - Sun's radius)] SQRT = 2.183 x 10^5 m/s. [ G x (4.0321 x 10^30 kg - Sirius A mass or 2.03 Suns) / 4 x (1.19 x 10^9 m - radius of Sirius A)] SQRT = 2.377 x 10^5 m (the actual mass of Sirius A = 3.4 x 10^30 kg, making the velocity 2.183 x 10^5 m/s.

            "answer_text": "Dark matter is the amount of mass we are unable to detect but has to exist for galaxies to spin as fast as they do. For Stars to orbit the galactic center as fast as they do, the total mass and therefore gravity must be a lot higher or the stars would get flung out of the galaxy. Since we know nothing else about it and are unable to detect it, it is called dark matter. Dark energy is needed to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe. If there was no energy driving the expansion, it would either be constant or decreasing. Like with dark matter, we are unable to detect it, but are quite confident that it must exist. In both cases, there is a small chance that the models we use are completely wrong and it is coincidence that it has worked to explain most of our observations but doesn't work on the very large scale, but it's extremely unlikely. So essentially, dark matter and dark energy are simply placeholder values to make our models fit reality. ",

If more scientists did this kind of research into how The General Energy Equation can confirm lots of these universal boundary behaviors, I think many would be on the same page with their definitions of the dark energy. My experiment shows that just as gravitational wells are curved like troughs, so energetic energy curves just outside of these gravitational wells are too. The first unstable offset of a universal change boundary (really the universe) is experienced as a wavelength (sine wave) that includes both trough and crest, both with curvature that is experienced by stars at the tips of galactic arms as an accelerant. I don\u2019t know why, but perhaps this has to do with how the universe perceives itself (any curvature = absolute curvature). Or the curvature between gravity wells might be made up of energetic energy interference. Or both. Light is also affected by this dark energy that creates gravitational-like lensing, even though in-line galaxies are not present. See NOVA\u2019s video on dark matter and/or dark energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Evidences Of Dark Matter 1.Galactic Rotation Curves:- The most direct evidence of dark matter's existence comes from measured \u201crotation curves\" in galaxies. According to the Newtonian formula for velocity \u2018v' of an body with mass \u2018m\u2019 orbiting a galaxy at a distance \u2018r\u2019 from its centre, the velocity \u2018v' is inversly proportional to the square root of the distance \u2018r'. So as expected the velocity of the orbiting body should drop off with an increasing distance from the centre. The surprising discovery was that as the distance from the centre of the galaxy increased, the velocity of the orbiting body was observed to stay at a constant peak value. This indicates that the orbiting body is gravitationally pulled by some another of matter other than the luminous matter, hence it constitutes direct evidence for dark matter. Many subsequent studies confirm this discovery. 2.The Bullet Cluster and Gravitational Lensing offers direct empirical evidence of dark matter:-  This is the observational result shown above. The images of the galaxy cluster 1E0657\u2013558, the \u201cBullet Cluster\" are displayed above. The picture on the left shows galaxies that make up a few percent of the cluster mass, the picture on the right is the X-ray image from the Chandra telescope showing where the bulk of hot gas is located. Superimposed on top of these two picture are the mass contours as derived from gravitational lensing. These contours have two mass peaks which, while they more or less track the locations of observed galaxies, are situated at very different positions from the atomic gas. Such an observation cannot be explained by any modified law of gravity but is consistent with the interpretation that this bullet cluster came about because of a collision of two clusters of galaxies. The dark matter and baryonic gas are separated because the dark matter(having small interaction cross-section) passes through \u201clike a bullet\" while baryonic gases are left behind. 3.Dark matter evidence from the CMB(Cosmic Microwave Background):- On a larger scale the abundance of dark matter can be quantified from the study of large cosmic structure and CMB. All this leads to a total mass density equal 0.25 of which the total baryonic density is 0.04 and the total dark matter density is 0.21. So the luminous matter associated with the stars we see in galaxies represents about 2% of the total mass content. Evidence Of Dark Energy The evidence of dark energy was found out by studying special supernovae called standard candles in cosmology, this are type Ia supernovae(SNe Ia) which are highly luminous(bright) and proper for cosmogical study. The discovery of an accelerating universe:- Because light from distant galaxies was emitted long ago, to measure a star(or a supernova) farther out in distance is to probe the cosmos further back in time. An accelerating expansion of the universe means that the expansion rate of the universe was smaller in the past. Thus to reach a given redshift(i.e. recession speed) it must be located farther away than expected. So observationally ,the light source in an accelerating universe would be measured dimmer than expected. In 1998 two collaborations: the Supernovae Cosmological Project and the High-z-Supernova Search Team studied some 50 SNe Ia at high redshifts corresponding to SNe occurring five to eight billion years ago. They made the astonishing discovery that the expansion of universe was actually accelerating, as indicated by the fact that the measured luminosities of the supernovae were on average 25% less than anticipated and the Hubble curve bent upward. A Hubble curve is a plot of the luminosity distance versus the redshift(measuring recession velocity). Below is the graph showing the Hubble curve(plotted dots on the graph). We can see that the curve is bent upward.  This accelerating expansion of the universe was accounted for a new type of energy which was called dark energy. So this are the evidences for dark matter and dark energy. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Clear evidence for dark energy comes from the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect named after Rainer Sachs and Arthur Wolfe. The Cosmic Microwave Background, the radiation of the residual heat of the Big Bang, is seen all over the sky. In 1967 Sachs and Wolfe proposed that light from this radiation would become slightly bluer as it passed through the gravitational fields of lumps of matter, an effect known as gravitational redshift. In 1996, Robert Crittenden and Neil Turok, now at the Perimeter Institute in Canada, took this idea to the next level, suggesting that astronomers could look for these small changes in the energy of the light, or photons, by comparing the temperature of the radiation with maps of galaxies in the local Universe. In the absence of dark energy, or a large curvature in the Universe, there would be no correspondence between these two maps (the distant cosmic microwave background and relatively closer distribution of galaxies), but the existence of dark energy would lead to the strange, counter-intuitive effect where the cosmic microwave background photons would gain energy as they travelled through large lumps of mass. The Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect was first detected in 2003 and was immediately seen as corroborative evidence for dark energy, featuring in the 'Discovery of the year' in Science magazine. But the signal is weak as the expected correlation between maps is small and so some scientists suggested it was caused by other sources such as the dust in our galaxy. Since the first Integrated Sachs Wolfe papers, several astronomers have questioned the original detections of the effect and thus called some of the strongest evidence yet for dark energy into question. In the new paper, the product of nearly two years of work, the team have re-examined all the arguments against the Integrated Sachs Wolfe detection as well as improving the maps used in the original work. In their painstaking analysis, they conclude that there is a 99.996 percent chance that dark energy is responsible for the hotter parts of the cosmic microwave background maps (or the same level of significance as the recent discovery of the Higgs boson).

Dark matter has been imaged through gravitational lensing: What is Gravitational Lensing? Dark matter is also needed to supply most of the mass variation for the formation of galaxies.  Images of the cosmic microwave background radiation of the early universe show that visible mass was not concentrated enough to collapse on its own in an expanding universe.  Dark matter would have been more concentrated and sufficiently so to gravitationally seed the formation of galaxies. The evidence for dark energy isn't as strong, but it is the only good explanation for why the expansion of the universe sped up billions of years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Before we try to answer the question \"What is dark matter?\" we should first examine why we think it exists. Precise astronomical observations strongly suggest the presence of \"Non-Newtonian\" motion of large celestial objects. This is based on the assumption that gravitation is the dominant 'action at a distance' force on a cosmological scale. If it is assumed that the mass of a galaxy can be determined by observing optically detectable objects and gasses then the total mass as well as the mass distribution in the structure should be determinable. The problem arises when an attempt is made to reconcile the observed mass and its distribution with the observed distribution of angular, or orbital, velocities of objects with the galaxy. This analysis strongly suggests that the mass model thus derived may be in error by as much as an order of magnitude. Other than consistent observational error (which is unlikely) there are two possibilities that come to mind; the presence of unobservable mass or Einstein-Newtonian dynamics is incomplete. All baryonic matter has mass and it also has detectable optical properties. So far, no optical or radiometric observation method has detected dark matter. However, the gravitational behavior is observable. These observations depend mostly on measurement of spectral shift due to velocity differences between the inertial frame of the observer and the thing being observed. If our understanding of the velocity related red-shift mechanism is correct then the presence of unobserved mass is directly confirmed by these observations. Recent observations of previously undetected massive gas clouds surrounding most, if not all, galaxies have complicated this analysis. It is estimated that these clouds may be significantly more massive than the galaxies embedded within them. This newly found mass suggests that a revision of galactic mass models is in order. This revision may result in a new set of requirements for the properties and quantity of dark matter in the universe\u2026 The issue of dark matter is really a two part question; 1) does it exist? and 2) what is it? Astronomical observations clearly indicate the presence of mass that has not been observed using conventional astronomical techniques and instruments. Anomalous non Newtonian motion in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is directly measurable by means of redshift observations. So unless you disregard the redshift velocity model (which some do) the presence of unobserved mass is inescapable if Newtonian dynamics is to remain intact. However, the assignment of non Newtonian motion is based on several assumptions. Historically it has been assumed that a relationship exists between the mass of a galaxy and its intrinsic luminosity. and that the distribution of mass is related to the distribution of luminous objects and gasses. Now there is evidence that this view is naive at best. Black holes, for example, are not luminous in and of themselves. Furthermore, the luminosity associated with these objects is as much a function of the quantity of material being drawn into them as it is a function of the objects mass. As a result, the black hole population of a galaxy must be taken into account when computing the total mass of the galaxy its self. Also, recent discoveries of massive gas clouds surrounding galaxies alters the mass model even further. However, while these phenomena require a restructure of galactic mass models there is still a significant quantity of implied mass that cannot be identified. It has been suggested that this residual mass consists of exotic or non-baryonic matter. So the question remains is dark matter simply ordinary matter that we cannot see for some reason or is it some form of exotic material that lies outside our concepts of atomic substances. It is beginning to look like it is a combination of both. Exotic dark matter will probably invoke new physics to accommodate its existence. And that is a very exciting proposition indeed. ",

It is often seen that the speed levels off outside the bright part of the galaxy. One would expect the speed to decrease with increasing distance, as star gets farther and farther from the bulk of the \u201cvisible\u201d matter of the galaxy. This means there is some unseen source of gravity, or that Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity (general relativity) needs to be modified. Most astrophysicists think the former is much more likely. Dark energy is postulated to explain the acceleration of the rate of expansion of the universe, which was the result of analyses of observations of distant type Ia (roman numeral 1) supernovas. These have the same intrinsic brightness and so act as standard candles. ",

The observed speed of the galaxy rotation at different radii (NGC 3198) does not match that predicted by a standard galaxy disk (disk) model. To account for the difference, the model was revised and could only solve the difference when a halo of invisible matter was included, surrounding the disk galaxy. The effects of dark matter on standard mater ca be seen in other areas such as in the famous bullet cluster or gravitational lensing but, in my opinion, the rotation curves are the best piecs of evidence. Dark energy is a little more tricky. The main driving force behind the theory is from comparing models of the universe to what it is today. Dark energy is necessary to inflate the universe which standard matter and energy cannot do. ",

The diffusing species\u2019 spacial dimensions become mathematically irrelevant as the mass is transported against the potential suppling the energy. The process is driven by the logarithmic expression which has no countable parts \u2026 it's a verb, and it's not a classical particle collisions process as such. It's terribly strange. The kinetic theory of gases fails to describe the mass transport for Stefanian diffusion. The mass transport is being driven by the empty space in the background. It's weird. The mass expansion phenomenon that everyone likes to talk about is not limited to astronomical processes but it's happening at the molecular mass transport level too. For those on a limited budget, check out diffusion. I suspect that the apparent active transport of cosmic mass causing an observation of cosmic accelerated expansion is the same process as the expansion activity in dilute diffusion observations at the molecular level. Just my two cents worth. They're remarkably similar. Intuitively I think they're the same, different scale. Since mass transport is involved, with dimensions collapsing in both systems, it sure is intriguing. ",

Dark matter was invented to explain why galaxies rotate like solid bodies rather than obey Newton's laws. Dark matter supplies the missing mass that allows the solid body behavior. The alternative would be to decide that Newton's laws are different on the scale of galaxies as opposed to much smaller scales. Dark energy was invented to explain why the expansion of the universe is accelerating. It furnishes the missing energy that propels the accelerating expansion. The energy of the vacuum is one candidate for this missing energy. ",
