            "answer_text": "If science says ghosts do not exist, how can ghosts be captured on camera? It should be noted that I\u2019ve been a professional photographer for many decades, a photo retoucher and I\u2019ve seen all kinds of images, many that will make you scratch your head and others that are clearly forgeries. Despite what stoic believers and pundits will argue, ghosts are not captured on camera. Double exposures, random shadows and splashes of light, dust, smoke, fog, mist, flying insects, lens flares, breath vapour in cold air, a mis-hung camera-strap or finger at the edge of the lens over-exposed by the adjacent flash, random electronic glitches and a plethora of other mundane things are the most common, plausible and likely explanations for such photos \u2013 Occam\u2019s Razor. But why do we misinterpret images so easily and routinely? Pareidolia causes us to see something familiar in otherwise random shapes and forms. It\u2019s the same reason we see familiar shapes in clouds. Our brain is a pattern seeking machine and when presented with an unfamiliar and undefinable object or image, it will strive to interpret what is seen by making the closest match that is familiar to us. A large portion of the human brain is devoted to facial recognition, a critically important adaptation as a highly social species. So when we see a ghost in a photo, it\u2019s not a ghost but our brain working hard to find a face or a body where there is none. For anyone questioning the above, I would ask that in all of the billions of photos people have taken, why have two people never photographed the same phantom at the same time in the same place? And why can they never be photographed repeatedly? All concrete and real things are repeatable photographically and easily captured by multiple cameras simultaneously or in succession. Of course this is ignoring the fact that there are countless fakes and forgeries to obfuscate any effort in finding an authentic ghost photo even if such a thing were to exist and possible. Thank you for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf science says ghosts do not exist, how can ghosts be captured on camera?\u201d You got it backwards, friend. \u201cGhosts\u201d can\u2019t be captured on camera, because they don\u2019t exist. And that, right there, is the end of it. You want to argue for the existence of \u201cghosts\u201d, then provide proof. And a few people saying they \u201csaw something\u201d or \u201cheard a noise\u201d isn\u2019t proof. Documented, peer-reviewed, PROOF. An actual, disembodied spirit which was seen, witnessed and recorded by multiple, people who were not associated with each other. Without proof, if you\u2019re going to insist that \u201cghosts\u201d are real, well\u2026I\u2019m going to claim that I can fly by just plain wanting to, and I expect you to believe me. ",
