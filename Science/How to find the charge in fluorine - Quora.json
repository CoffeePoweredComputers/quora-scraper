            "answer_text": "Florine has no charge (its an element) but its ion fluoride has a charge. simply check what group it is in, find valence e.g. for Florine which is in group 7, that also means it has 7 electrons in its outer shell meaning it requires only 1 electron to obtain a stable octet configuration therefore its valence is 1 but since its gaining an electron its charge becomes -1. remember valence is the number of electrons an atom can easily loose or gain.

            "answer_text": "Charge of fluorine is -1atomic number of fluorine is 9 and then find configuration 1S^2 ,2S^2 2P^6 ,3S^1electron configuration of the fluoride ion, F- . Neutral fluorine has 9 protons and 9 electrons in its orbitals, but the fluoride ion has an extra electron, giving it a total of 10 electrons and their configuration is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6 - the same as that of a neon atom.",
