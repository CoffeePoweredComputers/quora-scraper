            "answer_text": "First of all you need to find out whether the electric connection in your area undergoes voltage fluctuations or not. If the voltage remains stable there is no need to install a stabilizer for your air conditioner (AC), but if frequent voltage fluctuations occur the it is preferable to use a stabilizer. It can be concluded that if you want to remain on the safer side then you should install a stabilizer in addition to your AC, because in case of voltage fluctuations if any damage occurs then first the fuse of the stabilizer will get damage and your AC will remain safe.

            "answer_text": "Yes, as it\u2019s a costly and vulnerable home appliance, you must ensure it\u2019s protection from possible voltage fluctuations. A voltage stabilizer hardly costs 1500/- INR, for ACs upto 1.5 ton, of course, the optimum working voltage range is 190 to 270 V, for such stabilizers, and they cut off if it\u2019s beyond that band, thus offering protection. A stabilizer\u2019s cost increases if the working voltage range you need recedes from 190- 270 V. If the supply at your place has such fluctuations, you must go for a decent voltage stabilizer, no matter the cost. Thanks for A2A Cheers !!! ",
