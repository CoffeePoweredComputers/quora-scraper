            "answer_text": " A dictionary definition of a Christian would be something similar to a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ or in the religion based on the teachings of Jesus. While this is a good starting point, like many dictionary definitions, it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a Christian. The word \u201cChristian\u201d is used three times in the New Testament. \u201cAnd when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch\u201d Acts 11:26 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. Acts 26:28 \u201cYet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf\u201d 1 Peter 4:16 Followers of Jesus the Christ, were first called \u201cChristians\u201d in Antioch because their behavior, activity, and speech were like Christ. The word \u201cChristian\u201d literally means, \u201cbelonging to the party of Christ\u201d or a \u201cfollower of Christ.\u201d This designation is also referred to as Christianity.  Unfortunately over time, the word \u201cChristian\u201d has lost a great deal of its significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values but who may or may not be a true follower of Christ. Many people who do not believe and trust in Jesus, consider themselves Christians simply because they go to church or they live in a \u201cChristian\u201d nation. But going to church, serving those less fortunate than you, or being a good person does not make you a Christian. Going to church does not make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile. Being a member of a church, attending services regularly, and giving to the work of the church does not make you a Christian. The Bible teaches that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to God. \u201cNot by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost\u201d Titus 3:5 A Christian is someone who has been born again by God (John 3:3; John 3:7; 1 Peter 1:23) and has put faith and trust in Jesus. \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God\u201d Ephesians 2:8  A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus the Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day. \u201cBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\u201d John 1:12  The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God\u2019s Word 1 John 2:4, 10. A true Christian is a child of God, a part of God\u2019s true family, and one who has been given new life in Christ. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cChristianity\u201d as we know it in the Bible. The term \u201cChristian\u201d appears only three times in the Bible, in the New Testament and is used derisively to define hypocrites and half-believers. The idea of Christianity was developed over time into something else. A \u201cChristian\u201d is someone who believes in Christ and follows his teachings; later, the Apostles Creed was used to define a Christian: \u201cI believe in one God, the Father Almighty, the maker of heaven and earth\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a long prayer I was forced to memorize for Confirmation and when you read it now it\u2019s almost like a fairy tale. You have to believe a lot of strange stuff if you take the Apostle\u2019s Creed as the bellweather for Christianity. But if you are a \u201cChristian\u201d as one who follows Christ then your path is much simpler: You must love God with all your heart soul and mind; you must love your neighbor (hint: everyone is your neighbor, even Black people and illegal immigrants; you must love yourself. Christians, those who follow Christ, must define love the way Christ does because most people are all \u201cBible Lawyers\u201d who espouse, \u201cHow much evil can I get away with and still get into heaven?\u201d. Love, as defined by Christ means giving of MORE than your excess to feed the poor, clothe the naked, comfort the afflicted, visit the prisoner, welcome the immigrant, have compassion for all creatures, forgive unceasingly and shun those who continue to transgress against you without condemning them; acting fairly in all business dealings, accept what you have without jealousy or envy or avarice; be kind to all, hate what is evil, pray unceasingly, have patience, be gentle and humble, don\u2019t compare yourself to others, avoid self-righteousness, keep the commandments, don\u2019t be a hypocrite, stand up for your friends and be loyal if they are in the right, succor the poor, you must surrender your love of money and use your talents to help the less fortunate. That\u2019s what being a Christian means. It means loving everyone, including yourself. You cannot be a Christian and support hate the way Trump wants you to. They are antithetical. Love never equals hate. Love never justifies hate. Love never excuses hate. Trump does all those things. He is the deceiver and as the Bible says, he has led many people from the Way. ",
