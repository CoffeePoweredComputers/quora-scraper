            "answer_text": "Density plays the important role when 2 liquids with different density comes in contact with each other. Water being less dense than oil is unable to spread in denser oil so forms droplets at the surface of oil while if oil is present in large amount of water it will form a layer beneath. Hope this helps.:) ",

            "answer_text": "Water has higher surface tension due to hydrogen bond. For tiny droplets, this force is high enough to support the droplet against gravity. Oil also forms droplets. However, the size of the droplet is much smaller due to lower surface tension. ",
