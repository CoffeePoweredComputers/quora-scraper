            "answer_text": "Since they go hand in hand there is no way of making the case that one is better or worse than the other. You first have to drill a well before you can perform a hydraulic fracture on the formation. So no drilling means no hydraulic fracturing! The reason these questions come up is a lack of knowledge about how a well is constructed, what \u201cFracing\u201d is and how it is performed. A well is drilled into an oil or gas-bearing formation. If the porosity and permeability is low then a hydraulic fracture must be performed to induce the flow of the oil or gas. Porosity is having holes in the rock large enough to contain oil Permeability is those hole being connected to allow flow. The drilling is the construction part of the well. They drill certain depth intervals and set a casing. This casing in the first 2\u20133 are one inside the other and cemented to the surface. This is especially true if they penetrate a freshwater aquifer. After that, they set a liner which is anchored inside the last set of the casing and cemented several hundred feet inside the former casing. The hydraulic fracturing is part of what is called the lower completion of the well. We pump \u201cSlick Water\u201d which is water with a cross-linked gell, usually guar gum or a derivative of cotton. This allows the transport of the sand in the later stages. First, the slickwater is pumped to open up the fracture (which only extends about 50\u2013100\u2032 from the wellbore. This is then followed by a lite sand slurry beginning at 2 lbs per gallon of sand and ramping up to 12 lb per gallon at around 50 barrels of fluid pumped per minute. (a barrel equals 42 gallons) When the 2 lb per gallon sand hits the end of the fracture the fracture will stop growing in length. This is called the \u201cTip Screen out\u201d as the weight of sand is increased it swells the fracture. This continues until the sand enters the wellbore and rises for X number of feet up the completion string. At this point, the well cannot take any more pumping and the pressure spikes. This is called the final screen out. The Hydraulic fracturing operation is now over and the well is the completed with the upper completion and put online for production. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about what the other respondent said - if you don\u2019t drill a hole there is no well bore and therefore you have no access to the reservoir rock therefore there is nothing to frack. So your question becomes which is worse, fracking the wells you do drill or drilling enough extra holes to recover and equivalent amount of oil? In my opinion the extra drilling is definitely worse regardless of what measure you use to make that determination. Drilling extra holes takes more energy, requires clearing more land (for the drill pads for the drills), creates more waste heat (in the form of exhaust gas, thermal radiation from the engines and pumps etc), requires more steel and other products (to build that many extra rigs), creates vastly more pollution (in the form of drilling mud that must be mixed, used, and is eventually discarded, waste rock that is removed from the well bore, takes more water (to be mixed with the dry components to make the drilling mud that is essential to the drilling of any well), takes more fuel to propel the trucks that move the rig and equipment as well as to transport the drilling crew and support people (mud loggers, etc), and more energy to heat and or cool the buildings (it takes longer to drill a well than to frack one).

            "answer_text": "The previous answers give a pretty good answer to your question but I would like to expand on the process of fracking. An oil reservoir is rock. Oil is not found in enormous lakes a few feet under the surface. Minute bubbles of oil are trapped in the structure of rock several thousand feet down. When you drill into oil bearing rock some of those tiny, tiny bubbles will be at the edges of the hole just drilled. Any oil produced from that source would just about fill a cigarette lighter. For any reasonable amount of oil to be produced those tiny drops of oil must flow through the rock to reach the well. Some rock has a structure with lots of flow paths for the oil and those produce oil easily. Other oil bearing rock proves very difficult for the oil to move. Those wells cannot provide enough oil flow to ever be feasible. An interesting discovery was made several years ago. If you pressurised rock with more pressure than it was already experiencing from the weight of all the rock above it, the rock would crack. The important thing was the rock cracked horizontally. Tiny fractures would radiate out from the well bore opening easy flow paths for the oil to flow from the rock to the wellbore. The problem was that the pressure to open up these fractures prevented the oil from flowing. If the pressure was released the weight of the rocks above promptly shut the fractures. The solution is to mix sand into the fluid being pumped down the well. When the pressure causes the rock to fracture the fluid carries the sand into the crack. When the overpressure is released the fracture tries to close but the sand is trapped preventing the fracture from closing and providing an easy flow path for the oil. ",

            "answer_text": "No. In fact, horizontal drilling coupled with fracking is much better than drilling multiple vertical wells. Install one well pad, directionally drill in several directions, frack and re-frack the same wells. According to data that I read recently, less than 5% of new wells are not fracked today. It's better for the environment, better for oil and gas production, and better economically. ",
