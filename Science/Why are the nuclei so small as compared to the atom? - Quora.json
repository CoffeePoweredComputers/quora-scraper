            "answer_text": "Well, it depends the way you look at it, but mostly, it\u2019s because nuclei are really condensed compared to the rest of the atom. Because, around 99.999% of atoms are open space. The 0.001% is awarded to electrons, protons, and neutrons, which is probably why the nucleus is smaller than the rest of the structure, as the nucleus would have to be bound tightly together (out to the last electron shell). However, you could similarly say that the nucleus is the largest part of the atom, if you similarly condense the electrons into one part and compare the two side by side. ",

            "answer_text": "It has something to do with mass and (of course) the strong nuclear force. The heavier nucleus has a much smaller wave function than the lighter electron. There is much more in the forces that hold quarks and then protons and neutrons together but maybe that gives them a chance. ",
