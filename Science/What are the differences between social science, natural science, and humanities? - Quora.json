            "answer_text": "A man named Galileo, an Italian astronomer who lived in the XVI century, is often credited with developing the so called scientific method. It works like that (roughly): observe a phenomenon, develop an hypothetical explanation of the phenomenon, put your theory to the test of empirical experience, observe the results, drop your wrong conclusions and keep the right insights. The disciplines before the revolution operated by Galileo were mainly speculative or based on pure reasoning. They debated on scientific, moral, philosophical and theological matters resorting to arguments only, without appeal to data or experiments. This lead to little advancement of knowledge, despite the fact that very brilliant work has been done in the Middle Ages. Galileo's insight lead to a revolution in the so called natural philosophy, giving birth to physics as a science. In the following centuries, scientists like Boyle and Lavoisier developed chemistry while Lamarck and Darwin paved the way to biology. These three disciplines are the core of the natural sciences. They all follow (again, roughly) the same aforementioned scientific method, with slight variations related to the different objects of study. Following the enthusiasm for science and progress of Auguste Comte's positivism, the social sciences tried to imitate the methods of the highly successful natural sciences. It was soon proved that the difference between the two realms of phenomena required a new methodology, but the main charateristic of the scientific method, the appeal to empirical data in order to test theories was integrated into the method of the social sciences. Economy, sociology, anthropology and political science became the new scientific disciplines called social sciences. They quickly distanced themselves from the positivist method, but they are still characterized by the scientific method. The humanities are a completely different phenomenon. They have no single, defined, method of inquiry. They are in part the heirs of the pure reasoning method of philosophy and the critical analysis of texts of history and philology. They aim not at giving explanations of phenomena of the natural and social world, but at discussing the inherently human forms of living. Art, poetry, religion, politics, morality are also studied by many social sciences, but the humanities observe not the concrete phenomenona but the more conceptual dimension of those same phenomena. They do not analyze concrete case studies, but they develop critical discussions aimed at better define the peculiarities of a phenomenon. They do not explain, they understand (as Dilthey and others put it). The landscape of humanistic research is so wide that it would be too long to examine here the difference between, just to say, philosophy and literary criticism. What distinguish them is the fact that they are not bound to the scientific method of inquiry. This classification is far from accurate. It leaves out the formal sciences, the technical disciplines, applied sciences and theoric-practical disciplines. But it is a simplified narrative of how we got from natural philosophy, theology and metaphysics to a more nuanced landscape of disciplines and branches of knowledge. Too often confusion about the boundaries and the roles of those branches leads to conflict, while it is better to conceive of them as a coherent and harmonic whole of interrelated but different ways of looking at the world.

            "answer_text": "In very brief terms: The Natural Sciences are empirical \u2014 that is, they are addressed by using our five senses of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. Their facts can be verified \u201cempirically,\u201d that is, with the five senses. Everybody can verify them. The Social Sciences are statistical \u2014 that is, they are addressed by surveys of large populations, as well as by empirical evidence. For example, anthropology compares social groups in so-called primitive economic conditions with social groups in more advanced economic conditions. It also includes Archaeology, Psychology, Politics, Economics and History. Though most observations of Social Science can be verified, some observations are matters of opinion \u2014 subject to a cultural bias of the scientist. The Humanities are neither empirical nor statistical. This includes Ethics \u2014 the study of Right and Wrong (Good and Evil). It includes Aesthetics \u2014 the study of the Beautiful. It includes Poetry, Rhetoric, Drama, the Fine Arts and the Performing Arts. There is no empirical way to verify the data. The only methods of judgment that we enjoy in the Humanities are intuition, feeling, opinion, debate and criticism. There is almost never a consensus about them. I think that this summarizes, in simplest terms, the main differences between these broad fields. ",

            "answer_text": "\"All science is either physics or stamp collecting\"  - Lord Rutherford, 1930s Authorship is a bit of a controversy! (see https://www.quote.investigator.com ) Both social and physical sciences use similar methods (scientific approach) (on vastly different subject matter ) to investigate/analyze, etc. a specific point of discussion. Both \"sciences\" e.g., what makes them a \"science\" is that data is collected and analyzed \"quantitative, qualitative, predictive models, regression, statistical etc. ) et. al. to test hypotheses using the scientific method. Just as with physical sciences, social sciences may focus internally within a given system or across systems via comparative analyses spatially or temporally. (e.g., comparative analysis of US voter participation today versus the 1970s end/post-Vietnam cultural revolution what are the social, cultural, economic, political, physical and technological aspects that make this time different than that time...). (interestingly up through 2012 we have been steady at 50-55% participation; highest 1880 (>81%) turnout... ) As a discipline *social science* is an umbrella discipline within which \"downstream\" or narrower study areas are organized. Generally, social sciences involves describing, analyzing, evaluating and postulating hypotheses regarding social/cultural/political and related practices, values, structures, systems, system dynamics, and evolution. Subdisciplines include: Anthropology, Communication studies, Economics, Education, Geography, History, Law, Linguistics, Political science, Psychology, Sociology. [See classification history and theories in: \"Typologies, taxonomies, and the benefits of policy classification\" by Kevin B. Smith (Policy Studies Journal, Sep 2002). ] Physical sciences include chemistry, biology, ecology, astronomy, physics, etc. Social sciences include: political science, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc. look at nuances, change or theories regarding society - social structures, system dynamics, etc. Social science is replete with giants who contributed to the theoretical underpinnings of multiple sub-disciplines or narrower fields and who influenced the evolution of social science. \"Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture\" (Wikipedia) .... a nice big umbrella for disciplines that include some of the social sciences but are basically \"liberal arts\" degree fields.

            "answer_text": "Humanities and social sciences deal with human aspects like politics, law, linguistics, economics, and psychology. One of the major differences between the two is that humanities involve a more critical and analytical approach whereas social sciences deal with more of a scientific approach. Humanities are a branch of science that deals with the heritage and the question of what makes us human. Humanities deal with law, history, ancient languages, modern languages, philosophy, history, religion, and visual/performing arts. Humanities are considered to be more philosophical than social sciences. As there is a scientific approach to social sciences, it is considered to be a branch of study in between humanities and natural sciences. Anthropology, criminology, administration, archaeology, education, economics, psychology, linguistics, political science, law, and history come under the purview of social sciences. The study of humanities can be traced back to ancient Greece. It was during the Roman times that the concept of seven liberal arts developed like; rhetoric and logic, grammar, music, astronomy, arithmetics, astronomy, and geometry. There was a great shift, however, to the study of humanities in the 15th century. It was after the 15th century that humanities was regarded as a subject to be studied rather than practiced. When talking about social sciences, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber are credited with giving it a modern definition. Social sciences was influenced by the French revolution and the industrial revolution. Social science was developed from prescriptive practices that were related to a group\u2019s social improvement, or through applied and experimental sciences, or through the methodical knowledge of bases.

            "answer_text": "I can speak to my undergraduate degree. A degree in Humanities (B.A.) is similar to an English degree, but with a much broader field of course work, thus evoking and creating important cross contextual understanding to each of the courses and how the spin out and return; how they are related and impact each other. In addition, as you progress, you\u2019re trained to recognize and look for cultural links. So a class in Russian Lit is linked to an Art History class, a history of Jazz class, a Performance Art class. All the course work begins to have a deeper relevance. I loved being a Humanities major as it gave me so much opportunity to explore. An entire semester on Listening? Biology and Religion classes that combined to make one think of the ethics of God, or lack of? Yes, please. Similar job paths as an English major, but you\u2019re more highly educated. I went into nonprofit. No easy A\u2019s at Rollins, FYI; even History of Rock and Roll required a lot of hours for that A. It\u2019s NOT just about being a dilettante; it\u2019s the ability to communicate and synthesize a knowledge base that is appealing and understandable to those not in academia. I got over fancy pants words and began to speak in way that worked for the listener. I highly recommend as a B. A. Summary: Contextual Learning in Liberal Arts. The Greeks did it, or so my Humanities degree taught me. ",
