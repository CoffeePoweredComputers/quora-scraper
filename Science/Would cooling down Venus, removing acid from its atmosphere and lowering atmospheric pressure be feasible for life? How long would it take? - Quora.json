Artist\u2019s concept of a Venus cloud city, part of NASA\u2019s High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) plan.-Credit: NASA But to actually live on the surface of Venus, humans terraforming is needed first. Given Venus\u2019 similarities to Earth, many scientists think Venus would be a prime candidate for terraforming, even more so than Mars!!! But how? In his 1991 study \u201cTerraforming Venus Quickly\u201c, [1] British scientist Paul Birch proposed bombarding Venus\u2019 atmosphere with hydrogen. The resulting reaction would produce graphite and water, the latter of which would fall to the surface and cover roughly 80% of the surface in oceans. Given the amount of hydrogen needed, it would have to be harvested directly from one of the gas giant\u2019s or their moon\u2019s ice. The proposal would also require iron aerosol to be added to the atmosphere, which could be derived from a number of sources (i.e. the Moon, asteroids, Mercury). The remaining atmosphere, estimated to be around 3 bars (three times that of Earth), would mainly be composed of nitrogen, some of which will dissolve into the new oceans, reducing atmospheric pressure even further. Another idea is to bombard Venus with refined magnesium and calcium, which would sequester carbon in the form of calcium and magnesium carbonates. In their 1996 paper, \u201cThe stability of climate on Venus\u201c, Mark Bullock and David H. Grinspoon of the University of Colorado at Boulder [2] indicated that Venus\u2019 own deposits of calcium and magnesium oxides could be used for this process. Through mining, these minerals could be exposed to the surface, thus acting as carbon sinks. The concept of solar shades has also been explored, which would involve using either a series of small spacecraft or a single large lens to divert sunlight from a planet\u2019s surface, thus reducing global temperatures. For Venus, which absorbs twice as much sunlight as Earth, solar radiation is believed to have played a major role in the runaway greenhouse effect [3] that has made it what it is today. Such a shade could be space-based, located in the Sun\u2013Venus L1 Lagrangian point, [4] where it would prevent some sunlight from reaching Venus. In addition, this shade would also serve to block the solar wind, thus reducing the amount of radiation Venus\u2019 surface is exposed to (another key issue when it comes to habitability). This cooling would result in the liquefaction or freezing of atmospheric CO\u00b2, which would then be deposited on the surface as dry ice (which could be shipped off-world or sequestered underground). Alternately, solar reflectors could be placed in the atmosphere or on the surface. This could consist of large reflective balloons, sheets of carbon nanotubes or graphene, or low-albedo material. The former possibility offers two advantages: for one, atmospheric reflectors could be built in-situ, using locally-sourced carbon. Second, Venus\u2019 atmosphere is dense enough that such structures could easily float atop the clouds. Another suggestion has to do with Venus\u2019 rotational speed. Venus rotates once every 243 days, which is by far the slowest rotation period of any of the major planets. As such, Venus\u2019s experiences extremely long days and nights, which could prove difficult for most known Earth species of plants and animals to adapt to. The slow rotation also probably accounts for the lack of a significant magnetic field.  Artist\u2019s impression of the surface of Venus.

Credit: ESA Venus\u2019 rotational velocity could be sped up by either striking the surface with impactors or conducting close fly-bys using bodies larger than 96.5 km (60 miles) in diameter. There is also the suggestion of using using mass drivers and dynamic compression members to generate the rotational force needed to speed Venus up to the point where it experienced a day-night cycle identical to Earth\u2019s. Then there\u2019s the possibility of removing some of Venus\u2019 atmosphere, which could be accomplished in a number of ways. For starters, impactors directed at the surface would blow some of the atmosphere off into space. Other methods include space elevators and mass accelerators (ideally placed on balloons or platforms above the clouds), which could gradually scoop gas from the atmosphere and eject it into space.

Credit: ESA Challenges to Terraforming Venus Beyond the similarities Venus\u2019 has with Earth (i.e. size, mass and composition), there are numerous differences that would make terraforming and colonizing it a major challenge. For one, reducing the heat and pressure of Venus\u2019 atmosphere would require a tremendous amount of energy and resources. It would also require infrastructure that does not yet exist and would be very expensive to build. For instance, it would require immense amounts of metal and advanced materials to build an orbital shade large enough to cool Venus\u2019 atmosphere to the point that its greenhouse effect would be arrested. Such a structure, if positioned at L1, would also need to be four times the diameter of Venus itself. It would have to be assembled in space, which would require a massive fleet of robot assemblers. The orbital shade alone would cost more than the entire Earth\u2019s GDP to build, and install with our current technology. Increasing the speed of Venus\u2019s rotation would require a significant number of impactors that would have to come from the outer solar System, mainly from the Kuiper Belt. In all of these cases, a large fleet of spaceships would be needed to haul the necessary material, and they would need to be equipped with advanced drive systems that could make the trip in a reasonable amount of time. The cost of this is estimated at 2,700 times the GDP of the entire planet Earth, and we are still at least 50\u201375 years away from even possessing the needed technology.

Credit: NASA This is something that humanity cannot do in the short-run. However, looking to the future, the idea of Venus becoming our \u201cSister Planet\u201d in every way imaginable, with oceans, arable land, wildlife and cities, certainly seems like a beautiful and feasible goal. The only question is, how long will we have to wait? Certainly won\u2019t be in our lifetime. For now Venus remains the black sheep \u201ctwisted sister\u201d of our family. We love her, but we just can\u2019t hang out.

            "answer_text": "There is no technology in existence or seriously proposed that can do this. This is complete and total fantasy and will likely remain that forever. Sending things to Venus is exceedingly difficult, there are no shortcuts. It takes more fuel to go to Venus than it does Mars. Consequently, probes to Venus will be smaller. Venus is always going to be a one way trip. Nothing can ever leave the surface. It is far more difficult trying to get into orbit from anywhere on Venus than it is getting into orbit from Earth. The gravity on Venus is the same as on Earth but since the atmosphere is so thick, you could not even get a Saturn 5 into orbit from the surface of Venus. This is without even considering the temperature, pressure and corrosive nature of the environment, only the added air drag. So what you can send there is tiny and nothing you send can ever come back from Venus ever and the planet is the size of the Earth with several times Earths atmosphere. It took 200 years of burning fossil fuels in earnest to affect Earths atmosphere a fraction of a percent. What could you possibly hope to do on Venus to change that planet. Complete and total fantasy. ",
