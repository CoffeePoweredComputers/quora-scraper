            "answer_text": "Imagine dropping a tablespoonful of salt/sugar into a full glass of water & the same amount into a glass having only a teaspoon of water. Stir (or don\u2019t) both solutions. What might you expect to see? *If the volume of solvent is sufficient to absorb all the molecules of your solute, then both should vanish into solution, but, because there aren\u2019t so many water molecules in a teaspoon of water the solute will struggle to fit it\u2019s atoms into the gaps between them. Stirring (or heating the solvent) aids that process by bringing new water molecules into contact more quickly with the salt/sugar. Now imagine if you have the glass of water into which a tablespoon of salt/sugar vanished within a few seconds, and alongside that glass you now have\u2026 a bucket of water. What will happen when you drop your solute into each container of water? Will they dissolve faster if they have more water to dissolve in? All the while the crystals are falling under gravity (provided their Density is greater than that of water) their molecules must be reacting or intermingling with the water molecules (dissolving) so it seems intuitive to conclude that yes, if there is more rather than less solvent available - even if you do nothing else to facilitate the process - the solute will dissolve faster.

            "answer_text": "There are actually good answer but no exactly to the point. Your request is not so much in the quantity to dissolve but rather on the speed, they are different concept. We would have to know a little more about the behavior of the species involved. If you want to dissolve faster, then the first thing to maximize are the surface of interaction, this can be done varying the solute, having it powdered instead of a compressed pill but also the shape of the solvent container. You can use a graduated cylinder with a small base with a high column of liquid. This may be a very good design if you put your solute as a powder. The first particles will dissolve in the solvent, the remainder will keep going down in solvent that has no solute dissolved, so it will indeed dissolve faster than if you pour into a big beaker with a very low level of liquid. Of course, if we use an agitator, it will dissolve faster because there is a constant renewal of solvent with a lower concentration of solute, it is basically augmenting the surface area of contact between the solute and the solvent. Temperature may be used to our advantage provided we know if the solubility is higher at higher or lower temperature. Usually solubility is higher in a higher temperature up to a point then it may start going down. Some salts also have an inverse relationship of solubility versus temperature. So to conclude, the amount of solvent may help the kinetic of dissolution but physical factors like the shape of the pot and the size of solute particles will influence even more than the amount of solvent.

            "answer_text": "Let us assume you have enough solvent to dissolve a constant amount of solute in each case; i.e. low amount of solvent and high amount of solvent. As other answers have indicated: temperature, agitation, and solute particle size are the most important factors. So let us keep them constant for the two situations (low and high solvent amounts). Dissolution (dissolving) depends on solvent particles surrounding the solute particles (ions or molecules) to bring them into the solution. This is called solvation. As the solution becomes more concentrated (more solid dissolved in the liquid) fewer \u201cfree\u201d solvent molecules are available to surround the solid particles (a process called solvation) and the rate of dissolution slows down. Since the larger amount of solvent will always have more \u201cfree\u201d solvent molecules available for solvation it would dissolve the solute faster. This difference would be small if only a little solid is used and larger when lots of solid is used. By the way, agitation would be very difficult to control as a constant in this experiment but relatively easy to imagine. I would define it as a constant flow rate of solvent/solution over the surface of the particles. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 3 things that will affect the rate of solvation (solute dissolving in the solvent): TemperatureAgitationSurface Area (of the solute)Temperature because a higher temperature essentially means the molecules are moving faster, so they bump into each other more often and with more energy, so the solute will be dissolved faster. (Unless we\u2019re talking about gases, but let\u2019s not go there.) Agitation just means stirring. If you stir the solution, the solute will dissolve faster because the solute will be in more contact with the solvent. Surface area. So if I put an antacid tablet in water, the water can only dissolve the substance on the outside first as it moves its way in. If the solute is in a powder, the water can be in contact will even more particles and dissolve faster. If there is more solvent present, more solute can be dissolved, but it will not dissolve any faster than it would in less solvent. As for \u201cHow would the results be affected if different amounts of water (the solvent) were used in the beaker for each trial?\u201d I don\u2019t think I completely understand. There is not enough information that you are giving us. ",

            "answer_text": "No (as long as there is solvent\u2026 if there is no solvent, the rate is zero). The amount of solvent can affect only how much of the solute dissolves, assuming that you have more solute than would saturate the solvent. The rate of dissolution will not depend upon the amount of solvent. One way to think about this is to understand that dissolution happens only at the interfacial surface between the solute and solvent. Thus, it is a very localized interaction. The solvent that is far away from this interface doesn\u2019t have any effect because it can not interact with the solute, thus the amount of it has no influence. Also, note that once you reach saturation, the rate of dissolution does not equal zero. Saturation is an equilibrium condition, so at this point you have solute molecules going in and out of solution at exactly the same rate. ",

            "answer_text": "If the ratio of solvent to solute is close to the volume of solvent volume that can hold the solute at equilibrium, the difference between two times or five times that equilibrium volume matters a lot. At much higher ratios, the difference does not matter much. The reason is that the rate of solution depends on the concentration of the solute already in the solvent. At lower volumes, the concentration of the solute in the solvent when the process is half complete is higher. The further away you are from equilibrium, the less the solute will depress the solution rate. ",
