            "answer_text": "The Pauli exclusion principle relates to the spin degree of freedom. In particular it relates to the properties of systems of identical particles. If those particles have integer spin, the quantum wavefunction of a system of identical particles must be symmetric in space. That means there is no restriction on the position of the individual particles to the point that they can all occupy the same position in space. For particles with half integer spin, any combination of identical particles must have an antisymmetric wavefunction. That means two identical particles cannot occupy the same point in space, because the antisymmetry of the wavefunction means the wavefunction must be zero between them. This is the Pauli exclusion principle. The proof of the Pauli exclusion principle is not easy. Undergraduate physics courses usually don't teach it. The proof is in fact a triumph of relativistic quantum field theory. Spin is a quantum degree of freedom that actually can only be derived from relativistic quantum theory. It has no classical analogue. It is not related to spinning charge, but rather to the symmetry of the Lorentz transformation, which includes both boosts and rotations. Therefore the derivation of the Pauli exclusion principle is only possible in a relativistic quantum field theory, where quantum many body wavefunctions can be created from the vacuum, which requires particle creation operators. This is done in the Spin Statistics Theorem. One of the most remarkable consequences of the spin statistics theorem is that the results really only depend on whether the total spin is integer (Boson) or half integer (Fermion). Only Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle. What I find remarkable us that larger composite particles can be either Bosons or Fermions based solely on their total spin. That means different atomic isotopes can behave completely differently, which explains the isotope dependence of atomic species used to make Bose-Einstein condensates. ",
