            "answer_text": "Coming from a native Khmer, let me answer things in a straightforward manner: 1/ Thailand in the historical days was a land populated by migrating Chinese ethnic mountain people n they had simply adopted Khmer culture & traditions including the script as their Thai customs although they adamantly disputed this n nowhere in their books did they even teach the Thai children of the actual historical facts. Khmer alphabet have exactly same number of characters as Thai since Thai language is a pure derivative of Khmer language except that the Thais chopped off the heads n tails of Khmer characters. So all those Khmer ancient scripts carved in all the Khmer temples in Thailand (they dated since the old Khmer Empire that stretched from from Gulf of Thailand to cover even Mekong Delta n Central Vietnam all the way up to Laos, whole of Thailand n even down South to parts of Northern Malaysia), Khmer people can read them but not Thai people. Of course, history shown that the Khmer Empire collapsed as many others (Empires come n go) n Cambodia territory has shrunk as of today. Until today the Thai Royal Family do speak Khmer though that has not been really \u201c known\u201d by the public.  2/ In the 1960s, Cambodian economic & industrial development was way ahead of everyone in mainland South East Asia but obviously fate decided otherwise with civl war and Khmer Rouge regime annihilating millions of Khmer intellects n population in general. In those days, Thailand economic aspect was behind Cambodia but now it became the opposite as Cambodia was dragged back to decades in arrear thanks to the war. Thailand military regime of the late Prem Tinsulanonda in the 1980s has benefitted massively in funding n infrastructure thanks to UN & ASEAN/US/China consistent contributions. 3/ In Thailand until today, one finds it hard to have English language spoken by most Thais (even in the hospitality industry which is big in Thailand) while it\u2019s the opposite in Cambodia whereby even the motor taxi folks can easily converse in basic English n majority of Khmer folks also are easily conversing in English. French (as Cambodia was a French Protectorate), Russian/Spanish (during the Vietnam invasion days where they installed a pro-Vietnamese regime, the regime had many scholarships granted by former USSR & Eastern European countries including Cuba so many students were having their tertiary education in those places) n now English are the major languages that one can easily find people to converse with in Cambodia today. 4/ Cost of living is way cheaper in Thailand than Cambodia as of today in comparison. Thailand has become very industrialized n also a car manufacturing hub in SEAsia with the other country being Indonesia. 5/ Cambodia coastal area being developed today for the Tourism sector is exactly what Thailand coastal area was 30 years ago but if the government is not careful enough, we may also end up with ugly side of massive development in the name of progress and have Cambodian natural marine life destroyed like what occurred in Thailand today. So in brief, Thailand n Cambodia shared a common culture as the roots were from the ancient Khmer Empire same as Laos. However both countries are far apart in economic development achieved. Cambodia has graduated from being a LDC (Least Developed Country) to now a Low Middle Income Country aiming to be a High Middle Income Country by 2050. Hope the above brief analogy would shed more light into the \u201c difference\u201d. between these two neighbors. ",

            "answer_text": "Differences: many. Compared to Laos, Cambodia is strikingly different from its neighbour. Of course that will vary depending how close you are to the border. Thailand is clean, organised, ordered, people join queues in a way we would be used to and is by and large a modern country with good services. Cambodia is, unfortunately, strewn with plastic bags and litter, seems to lack a civic awareness and is generally considered to be similar to where Thailand was in the 1980s. I also feel the Cambodians can seem a little colder. A smile is part of the national language in Thailand whereas entire interactions can be had with Cambodian friends and colleagues where they rarely smile. It just isn\u2019t in the national character to the same degree as it is with Thais. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t as cheerful or happy as a Thai, just that smiling doesn\u2019t carry the same weight. Linguistically, Khmer is about as close to spoken Thai as Russian or German is to English. Very different. Otherwise, the presence of Therevada Buddhism, temples, traditional architecture, dress, song, and the countryside are very similar in both countries. ",
