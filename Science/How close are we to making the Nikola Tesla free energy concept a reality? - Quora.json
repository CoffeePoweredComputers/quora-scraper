            "answer_text": "Tesla had two different ideas about \u201cfree energy.\u201d One was about obtaining it and the other was about distributing it. The \u201cobtaining\u201d idea involved, roughly, somehow stringing antennas and wires up to the ionosphere to tap into the electrical potential difference between the Earth and \u201cup there.\u201d That idea is impractical because of the length and weight of the wires required, and the size and weight of the antennas. Cool in theory, unrealistic in practice. It\u2019s not like this idea was kept secret or anything; if it was a sensible idea then there would be power companies doing this and making a profit on it. The \u201cdistributing\u201d idea involved building big-ass coils to transmit power to whole cities the way wireless chargers do to your phone. You\u2019d essentially be turning a city into a huge transformer or induction range, and everybody living in it would be walking around in a periodic magnetic field. Anybody could tap into the electricity just by setting up a coil. This idea isn\u2019t completely impractical technically, though it would waste some energy heating up any bit of metal in the field. It\u2019s impractical from a public health point of view because there are likely to be negative effects from living inside a strong fluctuating magnetic field, in a way that\u2019s far more real than the one today\u2019s 5G conspiracy nutters worry about. It\u2019s impractical economically because who would want to build a lot of expensive infrastructure to provide a population with energy in a way that can\u2019t be metered and charged for? Regular ol\u2019 copper wire turns out to be more efficient and more practical in every way. And remember, this is just about distribution \u2014 the electrical energy would still have to come from somewhere. See above. In summary: Both of Tesla\u2019s \u201cfree energy\u201d ideas turned out to be garbage, and that\u2019s why they aren\u2019t implemented today. There are many clueless people whose IQ drops by several dozen when they hear the word \u201cfree,\u201d and these people continue to worship the idea of someone who invented a mechanism for giving them something for nothing.

            "answer_text": "We are very close to getting new energy creation systems that will access free electricity as well as other energies that we do not know about. Mainstream science lost Teslas positive concepts of electrical attraction when they embraced the negative electron and its pushing force that needed generation. A shift in consciousness is taking place and people are now awakening to their own unique consciousness. From this perspective we will all begin to become the creator that is innate within us. Science works from laws, assumptions and so-called facts which make systems that need to be enclosed, mechanical and finite. Nature and our universe (solar system) work from infinite and intelligent systems that have boundary conditions which are pervasive to higher vibrations so that unity of light happens through density of harmonics and can be seen in tones of colour such as a rainbow. As Tesla said, \u201cthe universe is light\u201d and \u201ceverything is vibration\u201d. 2020 is going to be a year of awakening for many people around the planet. As we begin to become aware of ourselves, we also become aware of the \u201cevil\u201d that is now in its death throws. Evil is not universal; it is a man-made concept. Pedophilia and child sacrifice are evil as is satanic worship. This year we are all becoming aware of what a group of elites who have been in control of the planet for 1000\u2019s of years has been up to. They have infiltrated into the top hierarchies of every institution around the planet and are now making their presence felt as they try and take as many people with them as they can. The last thing that they want is for individual human beings to begin to know who they are and what they can accomplish when they work together from a perspective of unconditional love and self-respect.
