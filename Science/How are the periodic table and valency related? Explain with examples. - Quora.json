            "answer_text": "From periodic table we can learn about the period and group number of an element.This group number indicates the valency. For example,in group 1 the valency of every element is 1. Also from period we can learn the number of electron shells an element consists of.And the last shell is the valence shell.from this information we can determine the valency of an element .Groups after 10 like group 12/13 ,The valency is (group number -10.) For example P is an element of group 15.Its valencey is 15\u201310=5. It can also be 3,4 but generally it is 5 So in a nutshell, 1.For s block groups and some d block groups Valency=group number. 2.For p block groups valency =(10-group number ) 3.valency generlly is either the no of electron is last electron shell of an element or (8-no of elctron) .
