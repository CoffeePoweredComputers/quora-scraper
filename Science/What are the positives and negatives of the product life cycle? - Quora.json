            "answer_text": "Positives :  - Recursive cycle to accept any changes in the specifications.- Acceptance to any new idea which may not be the primary feature of the product.- Add/Remove features based on feedback- Feedback Cycle is important part of Product Development- Satisfaction of creating new things and innovation has easy access in the product development cycle.- New Features are implemented faster.- Reusability of code/component, without wasting time on creating the same thing again and again.- Many more ... Negatives : - Ever changing specifications sometimes create confusion in the versioning of product.- Small the product development team, better it is.
