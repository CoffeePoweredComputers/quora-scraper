            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a bit complex and I\u2019ll use our Sun as an example. Bear in mind that although this seems complex it is only a very broad overview. A star like the Sun is about 80 percent Hydrogen , 18 percent Helium, and the remainder everything else. The life of a star begins with a cloud of dust and gas -mostly that 80 percent hydrogen. If that cloud becomes disturbed and compressed -by a shock wave from collision with another cloud, a shock front from an exploding star,etc- that cloud can become unstable-i.e the gravity now exceeds the internal pressure and it collapses. As the collapse occurs the gas grows denser and hotter. The collapsing cloud can then itself fragment into smaller collapsing fragments. If the mass of the fragment is large enough -roughly 8 percent of the Sun\u2019s mass- the collapse will proceed until the temp and pressure are enough to cause Hydrogen to fuse and form Helium- roughly 18 million degrees. At this point the star is called a Main Sequence star and it will spend the largest fraction of it\u2019s life in this state. For our Sun this will be about 10 billion years. Here\u2019s an image of the Orion Nebula M-42 which is currently creating new stars. There are four stars called the Trapezium at the heart of this image that were formed from these gases and are providing the radiation to light the whole area up. The green in the image approximates what your eye will see. Although you can\u2019t see it there is an already formed cluster of new stars deep within this complex.  At some point the star will run out of Hydrogen in the core. Once that occurs the star will shift from burning Hydrogen in the core to doing so in a shell surrounding the now inert Helium core. This causes the star to blow up like a balloon and cool the surface enough for it to turn Red (the first Red Giant stage).That Helium core will itself start to collapse and heat up. Once the temp reaches 150 million degrees or so the Helium in the core can now fuse to form Carbon and Oxygen. At this point the fates of various stars will diverge. More massive stars (greater than than 8 solar masses) will fuse successively higher mass fuels with the \u201cashes\u201d from one fusion cycle being the fuel for the next cycle up to iron.These stars will blow up as Supernovae and will never form Planetary Nebula. That fate is left to smaller mass stars like our Sun. Our Sun will stop at the Helium to Carbon/Oxygen step. Once Helium is exhausted in the core the Sun will become a Red Giant for a second time and a Helium shell periodically turns on and off (called a thermal pulse)- along with the already existing Hydrogen shell. The whole cycle lasts 10000 years or so with the Helium shell active for only a few hundred years and the rest of the time the Hydrogen shell is active. I like to think of the star \u201csputtering\u201d before going out. During this phase the star is unstable and will begin to pulsate -i.e expand and contract with a period of months to a couple of years Here is a star currently in this phase- R Leo in the Constellation Leo. It is roughly the mass of the Sun and currently pulsates over a period of about eight months while changing brightness by a factor of a hundred or so. R Leo is the Red star in the middle. The numbers around the other stars are the magnitudes of reference stars I use to estimate R Leo\u2019s brightens as it changes.  As the thermal pulses progress those short term pulsations will grow in amplitude. In a manner that we do not clearly understand at some point the envelope of the star will detach from the inert carbon/oxygen core. As the expelled envelope expands it thins and exposes layers that are deeper and hotter eventually leading to uncovering the remnant core of the star that was. If the temperature of that remnant exceeds around 50000 degrees the UV emitted by that core will cause the expelled gases to fluoresce. Voila! You have your planetary nebula. Incidentally to your eye- you mostly see the greenish O-III line from glowing oxygen- an interstellar fluorescent light Here is an image of one currently in this state. This is the Ring Nebula M-57 in Lyra. The glowing gases are clearly visible as is the remnant core that emits the UV radiation driving the fluorescence.  As that remnant core cools it will eventually stop emitting UV radiation and the nebula will fade from view. And that remnant core will dim , cool, and become a dead White Dwarf. All these images are mine so feel free to use them as long as you give proper credit. ",

            "answer_text": "First, the name of \"planetary nebula\" is confusing. Nope, it have nothing to do with planets, but it's a stellar phenomena. We call them this way because, in the times of the first telescopes, these deep sky object looked like fade planets ( since they are pretty spherical, with a little apparent diameter...). It happen when a star is dying, in the last steps of it evolution: When a star evolve in a red-giant ( like our sun in some billion of years ), its core will produce a lot more heat than before ( in short, the star will not have enough hydrogen to continue its nuclear reaction: they will stop. Because of that, the star will not have any force to prevent it from collapsing on itself, its diameter will reduce, increasing the pressure and so, the temperature in its core... until the temperature is sufficient to make nuclear fusion with helium and stop the collapsing.).Because of those increased temperatures of the core, the entire star willheat up and enlarge. This enlargement will be such important that it will make the outer layers of the star very sparse and pretty far away from the core itself... So, the temperatures of the outer layers will be much colder. Because of this, the star will appear red. But why do I need to explain what is a red-giant in our case ? The red giant is a \"near death star\", it has burned a very large amount of its original mass while its diameter have hugely increased.  Because of these two factors, the outer layer of the star is more likely to be blown by the solar wind since the mass of the star will not be able to \"grab\", to keep, all of this parse matter, this far from the core. All of this gas blown away will continue to expand in outer space since they have nothing to be attracted to, forming what we call a planetary nebula. These objects don't produce any light. We can see them because of the dying star at the center of the nebula, the one who's literally making it, which light it up ( Sorry the the approximate English, just trying to help a little :) ) ",
