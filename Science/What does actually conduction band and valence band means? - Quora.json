            "answer_text": "Conduction band: The conduction band is the band of orbitals that are high in energy and are generally empty . In reference to conductivity in semiconductors,it is the band that accepts the electrons from the valence band. Valence band: Most solid substances are insulators,and in terms of the band theory of solids this implies that there is a large forbidden gap between the energies of the valence electrons can move freely through the material.

            "answer_text": "The Valence Band The valence band is the band made up of the occupied molecular orbitals and is lower in energy than the so-called conduction band. It is generally completely full in semi-conductors When heated, electrons from this band jump out of the band across the band gap and into the conduction band, making the material conductive. The valance band can be seen in the diagram below.  ",
