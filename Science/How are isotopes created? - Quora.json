            "answer_text": "All atoms are isotopes. The number of protons (+1 charge) determines what element that atom is. If the number of protons changes, then you have a different element. Each element has fairly predictable chemistry and the isotopes of each element are all fairly consistent in their chemical interactions. As an example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 each have the same tendency to combine with 2 oxygen atoms to form CO2 or sometimes just CO. But carbon-12 is stable (non-radioactive) and carbon-14 is unstable (radioactive with a half-life of over 5000 years). Each element can have a number of different isotopes (same # of protons but different # of neutrons). Some may be stable, but many are not. Scientists have developed several techniques for creating isotopes (because they can be useful) by bombarding them with neutrons and other ingenious methods. As the atomic number increases, more isotopes are possible and most are unstable. Some (like carbon-14) are unstable with long half-lives, but most have much shorter half-lives, especially as the atomic number (element) gets heavier. ",

            "answer_text": "All elements heavier than hydrogen including all their isotopes were and continue to be created by nuclear processes in stars and distributed throughout space by supernova explosions. Many isotopes are extremely unstable and they decay extremely rapidly sometimes in a fraction of a nanosecond. These are not observed naturally on earth. Currently only the most stable isotopes remain. Stellar like nuclear conditions can be duplicated in specially designed reactors. Isotopes can be created, most commonly by neutron bombardment in this type of reactor. The isotopes we use in research, medicine and some industrial processes are manufactured in this way. The unstable (radioactive) isotopes created in this way will decay producing another isotope or chain of isotopes until a stable (non-radioactive) isotope is reached. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the significant findings from my \u201cSLA\u201d research into magnetism and atomic structure; is that numbers of isotopes of each element are equivalent to the numbers of different symmetrical compilations of protons, based on the \u201cSLA\u201d interpretation of atomic nuclear structure. Each of these different compilations of protons requires different numbers of neutrons to make them stable. Some structures are more stable than others; and there lies the difference between the percentages of each isotope. How many revelations do I need to reveal before my \u201cSLA\u201d research is taken seriously. If you have followed previous \u201cSLA\u201d answers to a host of different Quora questions; you will find that these are not coincidental predictions, for my theories depict each and every property associated to atomic structure, without exception. Details can be found in my research article www.magnetism-atomic structure.com by paid subscription. ",
