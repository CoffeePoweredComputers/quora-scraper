            "answer_text": "NMR is an analytical tool with applications in variety of areas ranging from organic chemistry, pharmacy, biophysics and oil industry. Limitations of any technique can be listed only if the application and question is precise and clear. However, due to intrinsic physics of NMR one thing stands out that it is a \u201crelatively\u201d insensitive technique. This means it relatively requires lot of sample ( upto mM in concentration and hundreds of microliters, although you get back your sample as it is non-invasive technqiue) for useful analysis. Particularly I can talk about biomolecular NMR where bio-macromolecules like proteins need to be soluble, isotopically labelled with NMR active nuclei, available in mM concentration, and should be below 80 kDa to be useful for NMR studies. Apart from that buying NMR machine and it\u2019s maintenance by periodic filling with liquid Helium makes it a expensive technique. Nevertheless, once all these limitations are addressed NMR provides rich and valuable atomic level insights which no other biophysical technique can provide. ",

            "answer_text": "The most serious limitation depends on the application you\u2019re trying to use it for. But overall, a big one is sensitivity: the NMR signal derives from differences in the population of nuclear spin states. Since the two eigenstates of nuclear spin are relatively close in energy even in a strong magnetic field, this population difference is low, and the signal strength of NMR relative to other techniques (like optical spectroscopy) is therefore low. (I can give a better answer to a more specific question, if you update it.) ",
