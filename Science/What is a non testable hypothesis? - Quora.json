            "answer_text": "Since the Scientific Method proceeds by contradiction, for the Scientific Method to make progress, for any given hypothesis, you must be able to conceive of experiments that can, in principle, contradict the hypothesis. However, you, as a practitioner, have limited abilities to interact with the natural world. For example, you live only in the current instant; you cannot return to the past to validate models of the past. You may also have limitations in your imagination, intelligence, and experience that prevent you from conceiving of appropriate experiments for any given hypothesis. Thus, \u201ctestability\u201d (and \u201cfalsifiability\u201d) are terms that describe the relationships between propositions and a practitioner. These terms do not describe intrinsic attributes of propositions. For example, \u201cGod does not exist\u201d may not be testable for some practitioners who lack the magical, transcendent abilities to discern truths about reality. ",
