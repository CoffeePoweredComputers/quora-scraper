            "answer_text": "What is inside the nucleus? Mainly nucleons which are in turn neutrons and protons. But what holds them together is the strong nuclear force whose \"gauge bosons\" are pions, so those have at least momentary, 'virtual' existence as they are exchanged from one nucleon to another. What you will NOT find in the nucleus are 1) electrons and 2) photons, except as they leave due to being generated there by some reaction. Above all, do not make the mistake of thinking that a neutron is \"made up of\" an electron and a proton. It is not. The only reason the two (proton/neutron) appear after beta decay is that they are produced by the nuclear reaction itself, as is the (anti)neutrino also characeristic of beta decay. ",

            "answer_text": "According to which model? Someone said it\u2019s just EM field which is just wrong! To that friend: sir you maybe a field theorist, but field theory is not the only theory that accurately describes the atom. But I get from your question that you\u2019re looking for Protons and Neutrons. Which are technically the same thing but that\u2019s another matter. So yes just heavy protons and neutrons, where the number of each depends on the atom and the isotope. ",
