            "answer_text": "Here is the chemical equation for the dissolving of ammonium phosphate: (NH4)3PO4(s) \u2192 3 NH4+(aq) + (PO4)3-(aq) So, you have 3 NH4+ ions for every 1 phosphate ion. The answer is in the chemical formula of the compound. The Ammonium ion (NH4+) has a charge of 1+, while the phosphate ion (PO4^3-) has a charge of 3-. The compound formed by these two ions must be electrically neutral. So that means you need the total positive charge to equal the total negative charge. This means that you will need 3 ammonium ions [3 x 1+= 3+] to neutralize the charge of one phosphate ion [(3+) + (3-) = 0]. ",

            "answer_text": "Take a look at the formula. The formula tells you that one molecule of ammonium phosphate consists of 3 ammonium ions (thats the 3 behind the brackets) and one phosphate ion. So if the substance dissolves, you get 3 ammonium ions for every molecule that dissolves (and one phosphate ion). ",
