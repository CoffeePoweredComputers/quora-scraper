            "answer_text": "Scanning Electron microprobe/microscope is when you look at an object with the instrument. You know crystal structure, bacteria, viruses, nanostructure, what have you. Microprobe analysis is when you shoot electron at the object, and depending on what the object is made of it gives off certain radiation, from visible light to X-ray, more electron, etc. and since every element gives off different radiation, that radiation can be measured and used to determine the makeup of the object. Of course there would be a library of profiles of known elements so it\u2019s great for determining the chemical makeup of a mineral, forensic analysis, etc. and it is very sensitive, able to detect ppm/ppb of Trace material.
