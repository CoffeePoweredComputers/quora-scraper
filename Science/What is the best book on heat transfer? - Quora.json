            "answer_text": "For an introductory level, the texts of Incropera et al. and \u00c7engel et al. cited in other answers are more than enough, clear, useful and full of examples and problems. However, in general, and especially for advanced studies, they are very limited. And not only, as it is logical, in the scope of contents. The problem is that they give a false impression of clarity and easiness that is very dangerous. Both advanced methods for any problem and complex situations are avoided; I once amused myself by compiling a list of pretty important things excluded by these books, and it is impressively long: treatment of variable properties, compressible flow, calculation of pressure drop in gases, regenerators, heat storage, heat pipes, cooling towers, instability and metastable states in phase change, advanced thermal radiation in gases, integral methods, basics of numerical convection, \u2026 The problem is that having so a fallible basis, it is very difficult to go on and progress to specialized books on any question. In this respect, I can recommend some books that go a step further than Incropera, \u00c7engel and friends. But please understand: they are not specialized treatises; they are just generic heat transfer books. They simply acknowledge that complex methods and situations do exist and are needed in heat transfer, attempt to make the reader cognizant of this fact, and give a short introduction to those subjects. Heat Transfer (3rd edition) by Mills and Coimbra. This is my favorite, lucid and complete and not trying at all to avoid complex issues. (There is a companion book on Mass Transfer, that it is also very recommendable for chemical and combustion engineers).Heat transfer by Adrian Bejan. A popular an ingenious author of the field, that offers a decent book one step further the basic things.A Heat Transfer Textbook, 4/e by Lienhardt and son. A classic of the father (Houston) that is maintained and updated by the son (MIT). A reference on several subjects, especially phase change. You can download it freely at the link.These three are modern. In general, also older books are of interest in this respect, it is also a question of time and fashions: Kreith, Ozisik, Baher & Stephan, Jakob, Eckert, Rosenhow are/were authors whose \u201cHeat Transfer\u201d books are worth a good look for any interested in the field.

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of books on the subject of Heat Transfer by different authors with different approaches to the subject. Based on your need you can pick out one from them. I would categorise them for you  If you are preparing for some examination like GATE/IES , the go for RC Sachdeva /PK Nag / DS Kumar. All are likely same with little differences. Out of these RC Sachdeva & PK Nag have insisted somewhat less on problems & more on theory when compared to DS Kumar.If you are there for developing a deep insight into the subject & explore it , I would suggest you to go for Incropera/ Younus A Cengel / JP Holman. Incropera is also considered as the bible of Heat Transfer! JP Holman is brief while Younus A Cengel will put forward the beauty of Heat Transfer with practical problems & elaborate the typical higher order differential equations in detail.Except these books, I won't suggest you to try any other book as they will just waste your time & will mess up your concepts.",
