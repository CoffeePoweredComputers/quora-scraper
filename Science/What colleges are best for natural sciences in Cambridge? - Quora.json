            "answer_text": "Forgive the cynical answer. Ideally you should try and be taught by an examiner. Supervisions held by an examiner will give you a better idea of the ideal answer to a question and the most likely form of that question. Larger colleges with more NatSci fellows will have more examiners. In the case of NatSci, this is less compelling as a reason. In the case of essay subject exams, it can be very important. Otherwise I thought all the other answers very good. ",

            "answer_text": "It does not matter. Lectures and practicals are organised centrally. Yes, your college organises your supervisions. These are one to one or one to two sessions where you go over your problem sheets / essay. But if they do not have someone who can supervise the course you want to do, they will find one from another college. In the third and fourth years you are quite likely to be supervised by people from outside your college. Everywhere is in walking distance - even Girton - though cycling is quicker. I did not have a bike as a student - though now I cycle across town to work. But there are large cultural differences between the colleges. So do some research. Though these change over time as admissions tutors change. ",
