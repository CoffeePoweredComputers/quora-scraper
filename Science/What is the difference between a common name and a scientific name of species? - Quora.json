            "answer_text": "For most species there is one preferred scientific name assigned in Latin with a Genus and species name presented in italics like, Homo sapiens. This name is assigned and undergoes carefully monitored changes if its membership in the Genus is reconsidered or there is a precedence of earlier naming for the species name. On the other hand a single species may have many common names assigned locally by local cultures and used in common parlance. For example from my expertise with cockroaches in the first half of my career as a biologist, Blattella germanica, in the USA is known as \u2018The German Cockroach\u2019 for apparently obvious reasons. But in New York it was known as the \u2018Croton Bug\u2019 because it seemed to appear in NYC at the time the Croton Aqueduct was built, which took much land by eminent domain that made it very unpopular. In Germany it is often called the \u2018Russische Schabe\u2019. In Russia it is called the \u2018Polish Roach\u2019 (in Russian). So, common names are ascribed often in erroneous and non methodical ways. In reality, B. germanica, likely became domesticated from a wild species, likely Blattella asahinai, that lives natively in Japan and not from a German origin. In domestication it became flightless, a good strategy for a pest to avoid being noticed. It was probably transported to Europe and Germany by trading caravans in the age of Marco Polo in the 1300\u2019s or the early Portuguese ship trade in the 1500\u2019s prior to it being given its Latin name, Blattella germanica, by Carolus Linnaeus who is considered the 'Father of Taxonomy' in the 1700\u2019s. Interestingly, Blattella asahinai has been introduced as an invasive species to Florida USA and does actually fly while B. germanica does not fly. The two are \u2018sibling species\u2019 i.e. considered very recently diverged in evolutionary time. They have hybridized in Florida and their offspring are fertile and fly to patio lights! Yikes!! What should we call them? \u2026 something derogatory for sure! The \u2018insect types\u2019 of us cockroach scientists say \u201cWatch for the research funding on these hybrids to surge when the flying Asia/German Cockroaches hit Washington DC!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": " Jaguar - in Mexican Spanish this is called el tigre.  Tiger -in Spanish this is called el tigre Confusing? To avoid this confusion they are given a scientific name, usually binomial showing the fact they are big cats (Genus Panthera) and then a specific name (Species tigris = tiger , Species onca = jaguar) So Tiger = Panthera tigris and Jaguar = Panthera onca Works well to avoid any misconceptions regarding what is being spoken about. All living things are named in this manner: Bellis perennis = Daisy Boa constrictor = Boa constrictor Pan troglodytes = Chimpanzee Troglodytes troglodytes = Wren  Parus minor = Japanese tit  Parus major =  ",
