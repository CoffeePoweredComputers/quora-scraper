            "answer_text": "These tables are copied from the article High and Ultra-High Vacuum (by Dan Herring, vacaero.com):  The best man-made vacuum so far, Extreme Ultra-high Vacuum, \u2248 10[math]^{\u201310}[/math]Torr, corresponds roughly to a density of \u2248 3\u00d710[math]^{12}[/math]particles per cubic meter. The average density of the entire Universe (as calculated by WMAP/NASA), is said to be \u2248 9.9\u00d710[math]^{\u201327}[/math]kg/m[math]^3[/math], equivalent to \u2248 5.9 particles (protons) per cubic meter. (NASA does not explain how they arrived at this density estimate.) Given the amount of stuff we can observe in the Universe (gas, dust, planets, stars, and black holes, in trillions of galaxies), there ought to be huge volumes in the intergalactic voidsthat are completely void of stuff (except maybe some theoretical \u201czero-point\u201d energy), i.e., absolute vacuum (or very close). So far, the best vacuum science has been able to produce contains about 10[math]^{12}[/math] particles per cubic meter. Deep space beats modern science by some 12 orders of magnitude, so we\u2019re probably not going to catch up anytime soon \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Not quite sure what you mean, but I suspect you are asking just how powerful the supposed \"suction\" force of a vacuum in space is compared to those created on Earth. If that if the case then you are making a basic mistake - a vacuum is merely the absence of anything material. That means there is an absolute minimum - e.g. everything within the volume of space in question is gone - past which you can't go and which is relatively easy to obtain. Therefore, the vacuum of space is just as \"great\" and strong as a vacuum created on Earth. Empty is empty no matter where you are. ",
