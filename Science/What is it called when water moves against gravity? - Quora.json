            "answer_text": "I can think of two examples: pressure-induced flow and inertial flow When water flows through a pipe, a pressure differential between the inlet and outlet may force the water through. If the pressure differential were high enough and in the right direction, water might be induce to flow against gravity. If somehow water entering the pipe at one end already has sufficient inertia, such as having fallen some distance before entering the pipe, its inertial will carry it through the pipe. If the end of the pipe is higher than the entrance, but lower than the initial height of the water, water will flow against gravity for some distance before it reaches the exit. Another type of inertial flow is exemplified by the Mississippi River. Because the earth bulges at the equator due to centrifugal \u201cforce\u201d of the earth\u2019s rotation, the source of the Missisippi is closer to the center of the earth (another words, at a lower elevation) than the mouth where it empties into the ocean. The same centrifugal mechanism that causes the earth to bulge causes the river to flow uphill, i.e., against gravity. Ultimately it is the inertia of the water opposing the angular acceleration of of the rotation of the earth that flings the water outward away from the earth\u2019s surface and up the hill of the bulge. A centrifugal pump uses the same principle. ",

            "answer_text": "A fountain carries freely flowing water upward to the point where gravity has absorbed the initial upward momentum. Water flows from taps in your home because water is sufficiently pressurized in the water mains beneath the streets. Tall buildings require booster pumps to get the water up to the higher floors. Capillary attraction draws water into thin tubes with capillary forces locally much greater than gravity. ",
