            "answer_text": "If you look at the electronic configuration of Nitogen then it is 1s\u00b22s\u00b22p\u00b3 and that of Oxygen it is 1s\u00b22s\u00b22p\u2074; we notice that in case of Nitrogen there are 3 electrons in the p-orbital and in Oxygen there are 4 electrons. Since a p-orbital can accommodate a maximum of 6 electrons so we can see Nitrogen has half filled orbital while oxygen has 2 unpaired electrons. \u201cELEMENTS HAVING HALF FILLED AND FULL FILLED ORBITALS ARE THE MOST STABLE AND HAVE LEAST ENERGY\u201d. So Nitrogen is more stable than oxygen. ",

            "answer_text": "Bond order of Nitrogen is 3 and that of Oxygen 2.Due to the presence of 3 bonds in Nitrogen molecule,the two Nitrogen atoms are present very close to each other with greater attractive forces.Where as in Oxygen molecule only two bonds are present between two oxygen molecules. Also in Nitrogen half filled 2P orbital is present which is more stable.In Oxygen 2P orbital is occupied by four electrons.  ",
