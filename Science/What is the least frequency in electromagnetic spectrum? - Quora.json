            "answer_text": "The frequency of a wave is a number which specifies how many times the wave pattern repeats itself per unit time (for example, per second). The frequency of a given wave can be anywhere from zero, which means that the wave pattern never repeats itself, to infinity, which means that the wave pattern oscillates so fast it looks like it's not changing its shape at all. Since wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, zero frequency equals infinite wavelength and infinite frequency equals zero wavelength. These match the intuitive descriptions above. However, this was all very naive since we did not take quantum mechanics into account. Electromagnetic waves are made of photons, and a photon's energy is proportional to it frequency. But a photon cannot have zero energy (due to the uncertainty principle) and it cannot have infinite energy (since nothing can have infinite energy). So the lowest frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum is the frequency corresponding to the lowest energy a photon can have, which is not zero but still very very small (the exact number is indeterminable).

            "answer_text": " Steven J Greenfield is correct in his answer, of course. Here is a very simplistic representation of the range of frequencies of the EM spectrum. The \u201cboundaries\u201d are fuzzy, with overlap. While the waves differ only in wavelength and energy (proportional to frequency), the different types arise from different interactions of matter. Now, here is the educator in me speaking\u2014not being snarky: If you can ask this question on Quora using technology, and you don\u2019t have access to any ordinary high school physics text, why not use a search engine and key in \u201celectromagnetic spectrum\u201d to locate an answer that fits your needs? Much quicker, and much more satisfying to answer for yourself! ",
