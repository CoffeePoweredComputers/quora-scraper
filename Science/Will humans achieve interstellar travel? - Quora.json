            "answer_text": "I\u2019m pretty sure we will, we are almost certain to start mining asteroids in the next few decades, given the cost of bringing material from Earth into space it would obviously make sense to invest in space based automated manufacturing to build future spacecraft from the materials coming from the asteroids rather than build stuff on Earth and then sending it up, once you have developed that capability it isn\u2019t much of a reach to imagine a self replicating mining and manufacturing system that is capable of developing a vast space based infrastructure. Once we\u2019ve built most of the stuff we want for exploiting our own solar system such as interplanetary ships, moon and starbases, satellites etc it seems entirely likely we will then move onto working on interstellar colonisation. With automated manufacture you could build millions or even billions of solar collectors that could be used to power a massive interstellar ship to protect human colonists travelling to nearby star systems using something like a light sail, with such an infrastructure getting around 10% of the speed of light is likely to be possible suggesting a travel time of around 40 years to Alpha Centauri, such a system would also presumably also be incredibly useful for defending against asteroid impacts. If you accept the above you may be wondering how we slow the ship down and what we ill do once we get there, the obvious answer to that would be to send a much smaller mass of automated miners and manufacturing equipment well ahead of time (probably a century or two in advance) in order to build a similar space based infrastructure at the destination before we send a colonist ship, a large chunk of the mass we would be sending initially is likely to actually be propellant in order to slow them down once they arrive. This would mean there would be a system in place at the destination to slow the arriving colonist ship down and an infrastructure already there for those colonist to take advantage off, by repeatedly doing this at each destination we could theoretically colonise all habitable areas of the Milky way by hopping between nearby star systems every century or so. I\u2019m certain we are going to do the automated asteroid mining and space based manufacture to build a vast space infrastructure within our own solar system, I\u2019m also sure that once we have done that if we haven\u2019t found any better ways to reach other star systems we will start building something similar to what I have described where we harvest solar energy to propel a craft rather than using an onboard fuel although the actual specifics may differ to those described although the above method does appear to be the most feasible method I have seen and doesn\u2019t really on theoretical constructs we haven\u2019t been able to confirm. It is possible we won\u2019t send ourselves but will grow us there instead but I would imagine there would be people who wish to do the journey themselves and a ship the size of a small city which such a system could propel is likely to be considered a reasonable place for them to live for 40 years or so in order to have that privilege especially if there is a planet at the destination that is habitable or has been terraformed before arrival. The timeframe for something like this is pretty wide, with the proper motivation we could probably start within 50 years although it could also take a few hundred, we are already considering asteroid mining and automation on Earth is likely to take a big leap so 50 years seems a reasonable possibility for the first few launches that would necessarily be made from Earth to start the process. Once we have the mining and manufacturing technology up and running however the rest is likely to be relatively quick, a few years to get to the asteroid belt, maybe a 20 year period that focuses entirely on replication, a 50 year period were it is mostly replication but some useful infrastructure is also built along with tiny intersteller probes to explore nearby stars, a 100 year or so period where the focus is mostly on local infrastructure, spacecraft, telescopes, starbases, some solar collectors to power interplanetary craft etc along with a small package of miners and manufacturers to send to nearby stars to start a similar process there and then probably a 100 year period or so to work on building sufficient solar collectors to power large interstellar craft which are also likely to be being built during this time. The point we actually start building the solar collectors in large numbers is likely to be the riskiest point for humanity, such a system could also be used as an extremely powerful weapon, since we should have had a couple of centuries or automated manufacture on Earth by then hopefully we will have moved passed being an aggressive species since we shouldn\u2019t have a resource problem of supporting the population for well over a hundred years at that point unless ridiculous levels of greed have taken hold. The fact I\u2019m sure we will do this is why I don\u2019t believe the Milky way has a species significantly more advanced than us, any species say 10000 years ahead should have colonised enough systems to be noticeable from the effect they have on the stars they have colonised, if we were to do this then anybody looking at our star at the right angle would probably see it gradually dimming with occasional large dips when we actually use the suns light to propel our spacecraft followed by nearby systems starting the same procedure a few centuries later, this seems to me to be a similar effect to what is happening with Tabbys star. I wrote an answer detailing what such a system at Tabbys star might be capable of propelling and came up with a mass of somewhere around 60 billion kgs at around 10g which should be somewhere around 3% the speed of light after around 24 hours of a 20% dip as viewed from Earth assuming the assumptions I made which I detail, my understanding of the research I did and the calculations were correct, given the variability possible in the assumptions the figure is only a vague approximation but even if the assumptions I made lead to it being off by 100 times (being off by 10x seems unlikely to me), it still looks like the sort of mass you might want to be able to move between star systems. The answer can be viewed at Paul Crompton's answer to Could the dimming of Tabby\u2019s Star possibly be mirrors being used as a propulsion source for spacecraft? if you are interested although it would be so much of a coincidence to have a species just one or two thousand years or so ahead of us given the 14 billion year age of the universe that it seems far more likely to be a natural phenomena although from the information I\u2019ve been seeing it seems inconceivable it could be something natural in orbit of the star suggesting something is going on with the star itself (maybe some sort of really rare, slow and weird catalytic reaction converting matter to something else such as dark matter with the large dips being the weird matter bubbling to the surface) or there is something between us and the star, presumably within our solar system that is causing the effect being observed which seems the more likely option to me albeit my knowledge is limited and is more based on visualising what could possibly be causing the effect rather than something with a theoretical grounding or with facts to back it up. In the event that is was to turn out that Tabbys star is actually an intelligent species doing something like what I mention above then on a personal level it would be great to know that we have found advanced life (I\u2019d be dead a 1000 years before they even know of us so I wouldn\u2019t need to worry personally about potential clashes with them) and it would hopefully lead us to focus on our own technological advancement but actually finding another intelligent species in the Milky way that was spreading out is also extremely risky for us, if they are friendly then great, but if they were hostile they would have probably somewhere around a 2000 year headstart on us (what I would estimate to be around 500 years for what we are seeing plus the 1280 years it takes for the light to reach us) which isn\u2019t great for our chances, given the distance between us however even if we were to start something similar it would be over a thousand years before they would notice us and probably another 5000-10000 years or so before we may come into contact, during the time when we are aware of them but they aren\u2019t aware of us a major focus on advancing ourselves technologically may allow us to catch up and knowing they are out there would hopefully focus us on advancing ourselves. Given the timeframe before we would come into contact however, hostilities between us would probably be a risky option given both species would probably have presumably focused heavily on technological advancement for 10000 years just in case the other was hostile even if both were hoping for friendship, in such a scenario the devastation that both sides could potentially invoke on the other would probably leave both species concerned enough to not want to risk a fight and so would probably have contacted each other well before coming close enough together to come to some sort of arrangement in order to avoid the risk of clashing.

            "answer_text": "YES. Yes, absolutely. What more, it is more than likely we will do so within the next 100 years. Here\u2019s why, here\u2019s how. First of all, the \u201cwhy\u201d of 100 years comes from the thought which led to the creation of well-known interstellar space grant project, 100 Year Starship. It goes something like this. In 1865, author Jules Verne published his successful and influential early science fiction book From Earth to the Moon. Approximately 100 years later, humankind actually goes to the moon. Bear in mind, even as late as the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s intelligent people believed human beings would never visit on the moon. It was with the model of 100 years from concept to fruition that NASA and DARPA (Defense Advance Research Project Agency, aka the agency which invented the digital protocols which led to the internet) that inspired the 100 Year Starship Project to engender an organization charged with fostering an interstellar accomplishment within 100 years\u2013the same time it took for idea to reality of human beings on the moon. That 100 year countdown kicked on in 2011 in Orlando, FL at the 100 Year Starship Study Public Symposium. Here\u2019s where it gets good. The stated purpose of 100 YSS is to excite multiple generations to commit to research and development of breakthrough technologies to advance the eventual goal of interstellar space travel. Indeed, since that time a number of organizations have sprang up and stepped to the forefront. The Dorothy Jemison Foundation fronted by astronaut Dr Mae Jemison won the leads 100 Year Starship but there is also Tau Zero Foundation, The Lifeboat Foundation, The Initiative for Interstellar Studies (I4IS), the newly-founded (and well-publicized) Project Starshot, and the organization Icarus Interstellar. [Full disclosure: I am a board member of Icarus Interstellar.] All of the organizations I named either were empowered by or created after 2011\u2019s 100 Year Starship Study Public Symposium. There is more credible work and real effort being generated to \u201cadvance the goal of interstellar accomplishment\u201d than ever before. In other words, the original stated goal of the founders of the 100 Year Starship Project\u2013Pete Worden, Peter Schwartz, Stuart Brand\u2013is working. Now if you think that\u2019s exciting, you should. But that\u2019s not all. It gets better. Before I elaborate let\u2019s be on the same page. Interstellar travel means from one solar system to another. It implies from ours to another. Our solar system is called Sol, named after our system\u2019s own star. The nearest star system to the Sol system is Alpha Centauri B (\u03b1 Cen B). It is a K-type (orange dwaf) star nearly as large as Sol itself but only about half as bright. One of the most interesting things about the \u03b1 Cen B system is scientists have recently identified a planet in the habitable zone of the system which may be what is called a \u201csuper earth\u201d. This is good for us. In addition to habitability, there is the potential for other life. So yes it\u2019s good for us that the nearest star system to our own may have an earth-type planet in that star\u2019s habitable zone, and if so there is also the potential for life. One catch, and it\u2019s a doozie. The \u03b1 Cen B system is 4.37 light years away from our system. A light year I will remind you is the distance light travels in one year. Light, for the record, travels at 186,000+ miles per second. At the speed of light it would take us approximately two quick blinks of the eye to travel from the surface of the earth to the surface of the moon. At the speed of light it would take us just over three minutes to get from earth to Mars. (Presently at best it takes us eight+ months.) At the speed of light it would takes us 43 minutes or so to get from earth to Jupiter. The Juno probe just did that journey\u2013as the fastest object ever sent from earth\u2013in just under five years. To put a fine point on it, even with an astounding breakthrough in propulsion engineering, it is unlikely we are going to able to push anything from our solar system to another. (One notable exception is direct impulse beam-powered propulsion which uses a beam of directed energy to push an object, such as a teeny tiny lightsail or \u201cstarwisp\u201d [R. Forward] from one place to another. It\u2019s feasible but would generally take one heck of a powerful directed energy beam. Aside from the incredible energy requirements, such a theoretical beam of energy if it existed and was located in space (no atmosphere to block/filter/dilute the beam) could likewise theoretically be weaponized and turned back towards the earth, classic super villain style.) So, aside from something like Very Large Energy Beam propelling Very Small Object to Very Far Away Place, the question remains: How would we get to another star system? Like I said, it gets better. You saw Interstellar. You know about the Alcubierre warp drive. It\u2019s a way to travel from one place to another in a way that transcends moving across vast distances. The general expression of this form of travel is FTL aka faster than light. Which as a way of moving is absolutely impossible. It is absolutely impossible to move faster than light. However, being in one place and then being in another\u2013without regard for distance or time and without having to move at all\u2013is a whole other story. There is no strict limitation (energy demands, costs, and and engineering withstanding) in the physical universe that forbids us from doing that. Ever seen the old tv show I Dream of Jeanie where Jeannie blink\u2019s her eyes and moves from one place to another? Warp field mechanics is exactly like that except with actual physics. Essentially, a warping field is generated around a spaceship/transport/something with an absolutely impossible amount of energy which makes space around the spaceship/transport/something get all wibbly wobbley timey-wimey (for lack of a better term). And then it ceases and the spaceship/transport/something has not moved but everything around it has. There are plenty of analogies on the internet as to how this takes place\u2013here\u2019s one I found that is smart and mathy (just google warp field drive)\u2013but the important thing is this: The math looks good and we are doing actual experiments to prove and disprove the work right now. AND some actual science is showing results. Most exciting of all? Initial results look, well, at least interesting. In fact, the findings have been good enough that the internet has gone through several spates of ZOMG! NASA DID IT WE GOT WARP DRIVES newscycles but NASA hasn\u2019t and we don\u2019t. Yet. However, what we do have is some interesting science findings which are encouraging. Don\u2019t get carried away (for instance) but Dr Harold \u201cSonny\u201d White of NASA Eagleworks has performed experiments at a very small and fine scale on some of the expected results necessary to prove Dr Alcubierre\u2019s work has practical (warp field) applications and found results which appear to begin to compliment the math predictions of Miguel Alcubierre. To quote Dr White, experiments done by Eagleworks have produced \u201cexciting, non-negative results\u201d. Here is Dr White presenting at SEDS Spacevision Conference in 2013 discussing this work, the data, and their findings. As it happens, I was there in the auditorium that day and, let me tell you, the feeling was electric. SEDS, which stands for Students for Exploration and Development of Space, is the largest organization of space science degree seeking students in the US. That 2013 SEDS Spacevision conference was, as always, a room full of smart scientifically-trained people. Listening together to Dr White\u2019s presentation, I can tell you we in the Spacevision audience were literally on the edge of our seats. Before us was an intelligent and informed scientist discussing fascinating work which is precursor to the most exciting movement in the history of humankind: The movement to move earth\u2019s humankind across a very tiny section of the universe. The movement to Build A Starship. Build A Starship is more than a turn of phrase. It is an open source grassroots campaign slogan initiated and spread by Icarus Interstellar and others inside and outside the interstellar community. The slogan encapsulates the idea, the plan, and the goal of the DARPA\u2019s 100 Year Starship Project and runs with it into the future. An interstellar future. One with starships. In fact, campaigning is precisely the stage where are we now in the process of building a starship. We have beginning physics and a slogan. Without mincing words, that is where we are. We are at the very, very beginning. That said, imagine if you will how it was to start the building the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the greatest achievements of humankind and a process that took 100,000 people working 12-hour days non-stop for approximately 20 years to finish sometime in 2500 B.C. Such a feat of technology, engineering, and organization seems incomprehensible to us today. Building the Great Pyramid is one of humankind\u2019s greatest achievements. Yet the stage in the process we overlook in the building of the Great Pyramid is also the the single most important step for us as we contemplate interstellar travel: It is the beginning. When we imagine how it was to build the Great Pyramid we completely ignore or fail to recognize the campaigning, the planning, and the movement that must have been implemented in order to facilitate such a monumental conquest. No one individual person woke up and thought \u201cLet\u2019s build a pyramid today!\u201d and then everyone just did it. The actual accomplishing of the building first demanded conveyance of the idea, creating a workable concept, building layers of support (among aristocrats, common people, even all the people who were enslaved and used for labor), fostering understanding and comprehension, and subsequently an extraordinary amount of conversation and dialog. All of this had to have taken place even before the first step towards the first stone to be first moved was first made. In other words, the beginning of building the Great Pyramid of Giza most certainly required a movement. Likewise, in the building of a starship that is where we are, we must foster a movement. The good news is the interstellar movement is underway. All the organizations listed above and their collective members and memberships are part of this movement. It is even more exciting to realize that once we human beings set our collective eyes on a prize\u2013no matter how seemingly unattainable or audacious\u2013history shows us, again and again and over and over, we hit that mark bullseye. If humankind can build a kind a starship\u2013a Great Pyramid that lasts 4000 years, traveling intact through time and space\u2013in 20 years, with our tools of technology and developed math and science today think of what we can build given 100 years. Say, another kind of starship, the kind which travels to other stars. We built the Great Pyramid 4000 years ago. And just 100 years ago cars, planes, radio, electrical lighting or tools, antibiotics, x-rays, and were all brand new inventions. Television had not even been invented yet. Yet look where we are today. Each of us literally has the entire repository of the Library of Alexandria in our pockets. And it talks. Today we have robots on Mars. Only 50 years ago we didn\u2019t even have luggage with wheels! To say we are on a roll is to put it lightly. In closing, consider this. Once upon at time, there were two kinds of people. Those who said we couldn\u2019t fly and those who pursued flight. Then, once upon another time, there were another two kinds of people. Those who said we would never go to the moon and those who pursued a moonshot. So today there are two more kinds of people. Those who say we will never achieve interstellar travel and those who pursue building a starship. At the end of the day the question is not will we\u2013we will!\u2013but which side are you on? Are you on the side that says no and calls it a day? Or are you on the side that says yes, the side having fun doing the work and experiments of math and science, the side whose members look up beyond the sky and past the atmosphere and who in discovering an absurdly large universe absolutely chockfull of stars can only think one irresistible thought:  You decide.
