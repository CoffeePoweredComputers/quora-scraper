            "answer_text": "All isotopes of fluorine have nine protons: 9 is thus its atomic number and identity as an element. To balance those nine positive charges, a neutral fluorine atom would possess the same number of electrons. Nearly all naturally-occurring fluorine is the [math]\\ _9^{19}\\mathrm{F}[/math] isotope, with 10 neutrons (19 - 9). 19, in this case, is known as the atomic weight (identifies the specific isotope of an element). You asked, however, about [math]\\ _9^{18}\\mathrm{F}. [/math]This would have to have 9 (18 - 9) neutrons. It\u2019s hard to tell from this question\u2019s notation, but if you meant to ask about a negative ion of [math]\\ ^{18}\\mathrm{F}[/math], that would indicate an extra electron \u2014 10 in all. ",

            "answer_text": "Fluorine-18 ( 18 F) is a fluorine radioisotope which is an important source of positrons. It has a mass of 18.0009380(6) u and its half-life is 109.771(20) minutes. It decays by positron emission 97% of the time and electron capture 3% of the time. Both modes of decay yield stable oxygen-18.  ",
