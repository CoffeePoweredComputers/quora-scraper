            "answer_text": "One of the most bizarre exoplanets we have found is definitely HD 189733b, 63 light-years away.  Looks pretty normal, doesn\u2019t it? Well this planet supposedly has an atmosphere scorching with temperatures of over 1000\u00baC (1832\u00baF) in which, wait for it, it rains molten glass, sideways, in howling 7000 kilometer-per-hour winds! Definitely my favorite. There are many other strange exoplanets that we have found however, here are a couple more examples: 55 Cancri e, believed to be composed mostly of pure diamond.  HD 188753ab, the only known planet in a triple star system. It orbits a star which has 2 other stars orbiting around it.

            "answer_text": "Trappist 1 is a red dwarf star which is around 39.6 light years from our sun. Seven temperate terrestrial planers have been detected orbiting the star, a larger number than detected in any other planetary system. The orbits are stable and harmoniously resonant. The planets of the system is likely not to have hydrogen rich atmosphere(presence of hydrogen would make the planet inhospitable for close-in planets). Definitly the system of planets might have much more sagas to tell us when James Webb telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019 start its work!
