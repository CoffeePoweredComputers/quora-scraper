            "answer_text": "The question is strangely phrased. An atom containing two protons must be some isotope of helium, so it is either helium-3 or helium-4 if it is stable. A neutral atom of helium contains two electrons. If it then gained three electrons it would then be a triply negatively charged ion of helium: [math]\\text{He} (-3).[/math] But I don\u2019t think such an ionic state can exist for any length of time. Perhaps what you mean is that the bare nucleus of helium gains three electrons: in that case it will not be neutral. It will have charge -1, and be a negative helium ion. This ion can be made, without too much difficulty, and it\u2019s done all the time in particle accelerators. ",

            "answer_text": "If the neutral atom did exactly as you specify, it would become negatively charged by one charge (+2-3 = -1) However, it's a pretty strange question. Even though I work on the ITER project, I don't think it's likely that you would normally manage to get a neutral atom to gain two protons. In everyday life, atoms stay forever with the same number of protons they were born with. Certainly, under the rules of Daltonian chemistry. ",
