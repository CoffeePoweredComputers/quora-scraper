            "answer_text": "In theory BHs can grow to any size (unless they all merge into one super-BH that subsequently absorbs everything (highly unlikely)) \u2014 as lomg as the CMB radiation is \u201chotter\u201d than a (any) BH, all BHs will keep getting bigger, all the time, as they keep absorbing CMB energy. This is true (in theory, that is) even if Hawking\u2019s BH \u201cevaporation\u201d hypothesis becomes experimentally/observationally supported (unlikely). And \u2014 again, in theory \u2014 all BHs, except (hypothetical) \u201cmicro\u201d BHs (which are yet to be discovered), have \u201ctemperatures\u201d way below the CMB. To my understanding, that makes \u201cHawking radiation\u201d violate the second law, as it says that energy can never (or rather, have never been observed to) flow from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d \u2014 only the other way around. But (to paraphrase \u201cBones\u201d McCoy (Star Trek): \u201cI\u2019m a programmer, dammit, not an astrophysicist\u201d \u2026 AFAIK, no theoretical \u201cupper BH mass limit\u201d exists. ",

            "answer_text": "There does not appear to be an upper limit. The limiting factor is how fast material can be pulled in from around the black hole. If one is sitting in the middle of a galaxy the size of ours (which contains about 100 billion stars) - then to get the size of S5 0014+81 would require it to \u2018eat\u2019 about 40% of the galaxy. We could certainly imagine such a giant eating an entire galaxy - but it\u2019s going to be far enough away from other galaxies that it\u2019s gluttony would slow *WAY* down once it had done that. Of course there are MUCH larger galaxies out there - but the Milky Way isn\u2019t exactly tiny. So I would imagine that, given the right circumstances, you could get much more massive black holes than S5 0014+81 - but because such a thing could only reasonably be situated in one of the larger galaxies - they are unlikely to be common.
