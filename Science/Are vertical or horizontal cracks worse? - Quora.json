            "answer_text": "Before we analysis worse cracks between vertical and horizontal, we should know about the formations of crack. A horizontal crack is formed by twist & bent and a vertical crack is formed when structural member can not resist the load which is passing through it. In my opinion the vertical crack is worse than horizontal crack. ",

            "answer_text": "Cracks also denotes there is a deflection due to excessive loading beyond its design capacity. Vertical or horizontal cracks on plastered walls indicate shrinkage and drying and are normal. Cracks that are jagged, resemble stair steps and are at 45 degrees, generally point to settling issues and structural movement. These cracks are usually harmless but can be serious sometimes. A crack that is less than 1/8th of an inch width, is usually caused because of stress and is considered to be harmless. However, a crack that is 1/4th of inch or more wide is more serious. In the case of concrete walls, vertical as well as diagonal cracks typically signify foundation movement. If the vertical crack widens at the bottom or top, it may be because of settling or gradual heaving. Stair-step cracks also indicate heaving. Horizontal cracks signify design defects or build up of pressure behind the wall. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that the location of the crack is important. Is it a vertical crack in a wall or in a column or in a beam? Is it a horizontal crack in a concrete slab or is a beam splitting open somehow. You guys really need to include more information in your questions. These are so open ended that they\u2019re difficult to answer. ",
