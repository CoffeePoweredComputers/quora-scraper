            "answer_text": "If you are thinking of the most basic reaction to make (or split) water, H2+1/2 O2\u2192h2o, then diatomic hydrogen is the hydrogen source. And a very interesting reaction. You can make water by combustiin (ie, to run an engine), or you can combine them over a catalyst to make electricity. It's interesting, because tge byproduct is water. However, a more common way of producing water is through combustion of organic molecules. If you burn methane, for example (CH4) in oxygen, you would produce h2o, co2, a little bit of co. The more complicated the fuel, the more messy the pollution. You can incinerate trash to make water and co2 mostly, and heat for a generator. But you also make fly ash, and other gasses and compound that are no good. Dioxin, fluorinated compounds, sulfur compounds\u2026. Also, since you are not burning fuels in pure O2, but actually in 30\u2105 o2, and about 70\u2105 nitrogen, you can make nitrogen oxides too. NOx as they call it, which in sunlight reacts to make acid rain. Water and combustion chemistry gets very complicated because in the real world, you are dealing with impure fuels, impure gasses, inefficient combustion systems\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re being too literal. Names are not required to be logical. So yes, it takes both hydrogen and oxygen to make water, but obviously they can\u2019t both be called hydrogen. May we let one of them be called hydrogen, or must we forbid that name? The name of bromine is from the Greek for \u201cstench\u201d, but sulfur and selenium smell really bad, too, so why aren\u2019t they all called bromine? All of the noble gases have names ending in \u201con\u201d, like argon and neon, except helium. Why isn\u2019t it called \u201chelion\u201d? Also, it\u2019s kind of confusing that we have boron, carbon, silicon, and iron that are not noble gases. Why are they named to sound like noble gases when they\u2019re not? What is your name? Why?
