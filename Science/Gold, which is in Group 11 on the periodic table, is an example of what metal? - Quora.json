            "answer_text": "Gold \u2026 Gold is a transition metal since Group 11 was once in the \u201cB\u201d groups of elements. The \u201cA\u201d groups were the \u201cmain group\u201d or the \u201crepresentative elements\u201d, while group IIIB all the way over to group IIB were the transition metals. The transition metals have their outermost electrons in the ns and (n-1)d orbitals. Gold is also a coinage metal, along with copper and silver. The name should be obvious because coins down from antiquity were often made of copper, silver and gold, along with jewelry and ornamental objects. These metals in group 11 are very non-reactive and therefore held up well, at least chemically (gold is a bit soft). Many countries still produce coins made of these metals. ",
