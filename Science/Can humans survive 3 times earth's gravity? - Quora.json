            "answer_text": "Humans are a very adaptable species. We do have our limits though. According to NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center\u2019s expert on humans in space, a person has survived 2x Earth\u2019s gravity for 24 straight hours without ill effects. They go on to claim that it is theoretically possible for a human to adapt to a gravity environment that is between 2x and 3x that of the Earth. However, they say that at 4 times Earth\u2019s gravity (4G) or above, human physiology cannot maintain sufficient blood-flow to the brain. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree humans are a very adaptable species. But there can be 3 scenarios possible in this case if there is sudden surge in gravity for a short while, humans will face some problems, but the human race will continue to survive.If there is a sudden and sustained surge in gravity, the whole ecosystem will collapse, as humans as a species are very dependable on other species which might not cope up with the sudden surge. This would surely leave a huge impact on human race. In this case human race mught face extinction or ve close to it.if the surge in gravity is gradual and slow. Across several generations and millenia. The human race along with the other species will adapt to it. Surely the fittest would survive. But chances of mass extinction are remote in this.",
