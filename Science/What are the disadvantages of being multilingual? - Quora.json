            "answer_text": "Mother tongue: Kannada Language of education: English Other languages: Hindi, Telugu, Punjabi (in bits), Sanskrit (in pieces) Learning stage: German Here are my problems: I mix the languages.Communication is an utter delight if you know the exact same languages as I do. Why? Because I can mix the languages so easily that I could probably do it in my sleep! But otherwise, it\u2019s painful. Maaro (\u2018Beat up\u2019 in Hindi) + Fy (as in stupe\u2019fy\u2019) = Maarofy (The act of beating up) Call + Thini (borrowed from maad\u2019thini\u2019 (Kannada), I\u2019ll do it) = Callthini (I will call) I\u2019m funny in Hindi and English.I can tell jokes in Hindi and English. I\u2019m useless and obnoxiously boring in a group of Telugu speakers. I understand their jokes, I have trouble giving a soul satisfyingly fitting reply to their sarcasm. Not being able to retort back to sarcasm crushes my core being! I laugh at the unlikeliest of jokes.I had an entirely different expectation of Stranger things when I started watching it last year. I didn\u2019t like it. When I saw in the tiles that it was created by Duffer Brothers, I giggled. Duffer might be a completely normal name but in Hindi it means \u2018stupid\u2019. It was created by stupid brothers, haha. I cook in Kannada and a little bit in Hindi. I\u2019m a horrible cook in English.For instance, I have no idea what is Jeerige, Menthya, Sasive, Ingu (Kannada), Sabudana (Hindi) in English. My white friends will never believe me when I say I can cook. I need google images to explain a recipe! I get angry and I curse in Hindi and KannadaI hate goobes (owls, kannada. Used as a derogatory word for loners and socially awkward people) And when you\u2019re being a gubald (Idiot in Kannada) and don\u2019t understand my cuss words\u2026Atha majhi stakli! (I know that\u2019s Marathi but hey, let\u2019s not restrict ourselves when it comes to anger, haha). And if you try and defend your idiotic act, battameez, chup kar! (Hindi, Rude human just shut it!) See the problem of being multilingual already? I become sad in Kannada. If you don\u2019t understand Kannada, I\u2019ll be more sad.I dance in Punjabi\u2026because, duh!I preach in Sanskrit. Read this: Chinmayee Raj's answer to What are your favourite shlokas?I contemplate life in English and it\u2019s hard to communicate to close ones because we are close enough to talk in Kannada. It\u2019s just weird to talk to them in English...German is still in its infancy. The baby needs to learn that culture to add a new dimension to my brain!",

            "answer_text": "I speak 4 languages fluently now: English, Oriya, Bengali and Hindi. I could speak in Sanskrit as well but I have lost touch with it over the past decade. The only disadvantage I can think of is sometimes literally translating idioms/phrases in one language to the other, so I often become the laughing stock in my group. An example that happened yesterday:My friend and I were driving another friend\u2019s car who is currently out of town. We had a mean random idea to run through every red light just so that she is greeted with a ton of tickets when she comes back (we didnt). I wanted to tell my friend, a Bengali, to rush through the lights. In Oriya, that would be \u201cMaadi ja\u201d. I translated it to Bengali and told my friend \u201cMere ja\u201d which is, uhm, \u201cKeep killing\u201d. And on and on it goes. When I was teaching a class this semester to undergraduate students (in USA, for context) and explaining a particularly hard topic, \u201cmatlab\u201d (Hindi: meaning/implying) slipped out more than once. So embarrassing! I subconsciously switch between languages when I am not too careful about it. I often scramble up everything and invent a language of my own. I interact with people who speak all 4 languages, often in the same room and sometimes I find the effort of analyzing their face and switching my dialect so tiring (I\u2019m lazy) I revert to sign language or just stay quiet. That\u2019s about it though. I love that I can speak in 4 languages, swear in 6 and dream in countless more! ",

            "answer_text": "If you do it wrong, being multilingual can be horrible. Suspicion Language and tribe are not quite synonyms, but almost. People who are very tribal cannot fathom getting along with people from another ethnicity. Since they don\u2019t relate to people from another tribe they can\u2019t understand how you can either. They will be tempted to see you either as a traitor to your race or a spy for the enemy. Confusion Some multilingual people never really develop a mastery of any language. They can\u2019t express themselves comfortably without code switching. Let me give you an example, Hace fr\u00edo. Put a sweater on o si no, te vas a resfriar. You can\u2019t miss work. A lot of these people suffer a crisis of identity. There is a growing literature of written code-switching between English and Spanish where the authors complain about how they don\u2019t fit in anywhere. It Doesn\u2019t Need to Be Like That Some multilingual people get really good at slipping between cultures. They put in the effort to speak their languages well and not get stuck in the middle. They are honest and genuine, earning the trust of people from the different groups. Being multilingual can be a totally enriching experience\u2014but not if you put your mind on autopilot. You need to be wiling to put in the effort. ",

I\u2019m sure that I already answered a similar question elsewhere, so this one is highly likely to be merged\u2026 Tongue-in-cheek disadvantages (all of which I have actually experienced): when watching entertainment wherein some character is supposed to be of some \u201cexotic\u201d background and speak their supposed native language, and being bothered by the fact they have the wrong accent and are speaking gibberishfinding the perfect word to use all the letters on your Scrabble rack but then realizing it\u2019s the wrong language; by the same token, the daily Jumble puzzle is actually harder because my wife and I often see more than one solution for certain combinations of lettersthere\u2019s a perceptible awkward moment when polyglots with different native languages meet and have to decide in which language to converseAnd one real disadvantage: in a monolingual society that prizes conformity, being overtly multilingual provides an easy pretext for being called out for being different",

Awkward exchange of solidarity even if you have nothing but language proficiency in common.

Bear with me please as I will be using some \u201cadult\u201d words :P The word eruvu in Palakkad Tamil means \u201cspicy hot\u201d, while in Tamil it means manure. So when I said the \u201cchutney has eruvu\u201d, my Tamil friends had a good laugh. The word thooral in Tamil means drizzling, but in Malayalam it means loose motions. So when someone says in Tamil \u201cmazhai thoorardhu\u201d (its drizzling), the Mallu in me guffaws. The word \u201ckundi\u201d refers to the door latch in Hindi, in Tamil it refers to a woman\u2019s private parts. So when someone says \u201ckundi lagao\u201d (lock the door) I am wondering whether to laugh or not. There are plenty more examples. Knowing multiple languages means one has to be aware of using such words lest you offend someone. That is the only disadvantage/hilarity I can think of. ",

Damn it\u2019s so tiresome when you\u2019re sleepy.. I\u2019m too lazy for it.Had to be the translator for few people in mixed groups.If i say i speak a little of Spanish, people used to expect me to translate a basic sentence and prove it which i obviously used to.
