They are interconnected at a fundamental level since both waves are produced by nuclei kinetics in other words they are connected by atomic behavior. The best way to understand the physics behind the connection is through the principles of atomic gravity.The first \u201c Law of Atomic Gravity \u201c explains the mechanism nature uses to mediate the force of gravity across distances in space. The principles are simple to understand. It is a good read for anyone interested in innovation to how gravity works and interlinks across the sciences. Welcome to twenty-first century physics innovation. Atomic Gravity Summary The basic structure of all atoms is a tiny nucleus at its center and a relative vast volume (over 99% of the atoms structure) of empty space all enclosed by a relative distant electron sphere. Atoms are the elemental building blocks of all objects including yourself. The simple structure of atoms enable three basic responses. Electromagnetic radiation interactions during excitation. Sound and seismic waves from a kinetic input. Weight change when gravity fields fluctuate. Gravity at the atomic scale works 24/7 here on Earth and is ubiquitous throughout the observable Universe. Nature itself has followed a set of unified principles without question or hesitation for many many millennia. The three Laws of Atomic Gravity are the missing link to unifying the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear) of nature. Existing experimental data sets and observations clearly support and confirm the three laws of atomic gravity. The \u201cLaws of Atomic Gravity\u201d bring order to the fundamental physic of energy interactions and transfers. Three Laws of \u201cAtomic Gravitational Fluctuation\u201d (AGF) Law #1 (AGF 1) Consider a system of a planet and it's one orbiting moon. Physical Factors: 1) The total mass (gravity signature (GRS)) of each structure. 2) The distance between the central gravitational points of each structure. 3) The relative velocity between each structure. Now consider a single atom on the surface of the planet. The nucleus of the atom is shifted relative to its central point toward the central gravitational point of the planet. As the moon transits over the atom, the nucleus of the atom, contained inside its electron sphere shifts towards and tracks the moon relative to its transiting velocity. The slight shift of the nucleus is relative to its own central point and away from the central point of the planet; toward the transiting center of the moon, tracking the moon\u2019s transit and then resettling back to its original position prior to the moon's transit. This effect on the atom is called atomic gravitational fluctuation type 1 (AGF 1). See diagrams below. Note: During the moon's transit the gravitational energy transfer between moon and planet is a simple force concentrated in each atom which twice daily moves millions/billions of tons of ocean water. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF 1) occurring in any gravitationally bound planetary and moon system interacts within the constraints of the structure of each individual orbiting body. Each atom\u2019s nucleus fluctuation is dependent on its position within the atomic environmental structure (AES) of either the moon or the planetary body and the relative AGF 1 inputs. Interaction is more observable in large structures of atoms in their fluid state within the interior, on the surface, or in any atmosphere present within each system. Atmospheric fluids of great relative depth will demonstrate a more robust accumulated system reaction to the external AGF 1 energy input.. Law #1 explains how the large transfer gravitational energy from orbiting structure works in the atmospheres of the Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune. This information enhances knowledge and solutions and innovation. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF 1) in each atom in the atmosphere, at the surface, or in the interior of a planet is constantly influenced by the relative alignments to its Sun or moon(s) and any additional planetary systems or areas of matter contained within its solar system. Observations show that individual solar systems demonstrate the influence of atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF 1) interaction with all the different gravity signature\u2019s in its galactic structure. The gravitational behaviour of the gravity signatures in galaxies operate differently from simple newtonian solar systems and eliminates the need for mathematically suggested dark matter. The first law of atomic gravity demonstrates the far reaching gravity influences of the very small and the very large. The gravitational link across space of our Earth-moon system occurs at the atomic scale. Experimental Data: In Feb. 2018 a portable atomic clock experiment demonstrates time dilation as a mechanical property of atoms. \u201cFor The First Time, a Portable Atomic Clock Has Been Used to Measure Gravity\u201d .This is an example of academia working with the principles of atomic gravity. The principles of atomic gravity disprove general relativity on this one! \u201c How time dilation works\u201d talks about the natural oscillation frequencies within the atom in relationship to acceleration. Another example demonstrating the first law of atomic gravity announced in December 2018 by NASA and Sunnyvale, California-based AOSense corporation of a new sensor for satellite gravimetry based on the the fact that atoms are highly sensitive to gravitational fluctuations. Another example of atomic gravity in action is the measured weight change of a constant mass under varying accelerations due to a change in gravitational field strength. The number of atoms that form the mass is constant \u2026. the weight change is happening at the atomic scale and is described by the first law of atomic gravity. See diagrams below. Check out this cool YouTube video to better understand the difference between mass and weight:  Note: Behavior of AGF 1 in gravitationally bound systems separated by voids of space induce a relatively low frequency of AGF within each atom. The system results are easily observable when occurring in fluid atomic environmental structure (AES) conditions, like in our oceans and atmosphere. Tidal force is the metaphor used to explain this type of energy (AGF 1) transfer. AGF 1 explains the mechanism of mediation fo the gravitational force between all orbiting bodies in gravitational linked systems. Some systems you know about include the Earth, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter,Neptune, and the solar system. Interestingly it also explains asteroids with orbiting bodies. The first law of atomic gravity apply to all gravity signatures formed by simple atoms. Diagrams The following diagrams illustrate nuclei kinetics inside the atom due to atomic gravitational fluctuation. However, it should be understood that it is a visual representation of the actual movement, utilized for easier understanding of the principle, and not to be used as an exact mathematical model of the behavior. The following illustrations are a simple visual representation of atomic gravitational fluctuation in action. Three Atoms on the surface of the Earth (AGF 2)  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the earth. Three Atoms on the surface of the Earth with the Moon\u2019s Gravitational Influence  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the moon, in conjunction with the attraction to the center of the earth. Three Atoms on the surface of the Earth within the Moon\u2019s Gravitational Influence  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the moon, in conjunction with the attraction to the center of the earth. Law # 2 (AGF 2) AGF 2 utilizes the same principle occurring in AGF 1 \u2014 that being the nucleus of the atom is shifted relative to its central point by a localized kinetic energy input. The kinetic input utilized to produce AGF 2 in atoms, can occur in all gravitationally bound atomic environmental structures (AES) which exist in a void of space. AGF 2 is a well understood observable influence which creates a multitude of effects within the Earth\u2019s structure. Waves produced by throwing pebbles into water or the sound of a singing bird are a few examples. This process is currently well understood and is easily observed and measured. Acoustic gas thermometry experiments are making great strides in observing this principle. Note: Behavior of AGF 2 within individual AES systems contained by voids of space (Planet Earth and the Sun are two examples) generally induce a midrange frequency of AGF within each atom in the system when compared to AGF 1 \u2014 the kinetic input tends to be of a localized nature, like the ringing of a bell or the shaking of the ground. Sound waves and seismic waves are a few metaphors used to generally describe this type of energy (AGF 2) transfer. Vibronic spectroscopy is another method used to study the kinetic energy analysis of energy fluctuations introduced to quantum atoms. The energy fluctuations introduced by vibration (kinetic energy) to quantum atoms is equivalent to the analysis of atomic gravitational fluctuation; type 2 (AGF 2). Experimental Data: Columbia University confirms through experiment the principles of atomic gravitational fluctuations in sound waves. Principles of physics first established and published in 2012 by Tim G. Meloche. The physics department at Columbia University experiments and publications support the second law of \u201cAtomic Gravity\u201d Angelo Esposito from Columbia University, the lead author on the paper, told Scientific American. \u201cIt\u2019s something we stumbled upon almost by chance.\u201d \u201cYou would expect classical physics results like this one to have been known for a long time by now.\u201d A recent publication (March 2019) from the Department of Physics, Center for Theoretical Physics, Columbia University describes sound wave and gravity interactions. The Columbia University\u2019s team analysis of the sound waves show the principles of atomic gravity are essential to improving the understanding of interconnected physics in the natural world. A recent publication (July 2018) from the Department of Physics, Center for Theoretical Physics, Columbia University describes sound wave and gravity interactions. The Columbia University\u2019s team analysis of the sound waves show the principles of atomic gravity are essential to improving the understanding of interconnected physics in the natural world. These recent publications demonstrate that academia is finally experimenting with the principles of atomic gravity and discovering the interconnected behavior of the natural world at the atomic scale. AGF 2 explains the mechanism nature uses to transfer seismic and sound energy. Law # 3 (AGF 3) AGF 3 utilizes the same principle as AGF 1 \u2014 that being that the nucleus of the atom is shifted relative to its central point by a kinetic input induced into the nucleus from electron flow. As electrons flow into or through a system of atomic environmental structure each atom has induced AGF introduced. Each nucleus\u2019s rate of fluctuation is dependent on its position within the atomic environmental structure AES, and the relative amount of electron flow through the structure. In general, increasing electron flow through a similar AES will also increase the radiant energy and sound waves emitted. This process is currently well understood and is utilized and controlled in many electrical products and systems. AGF 3 effects are easily observed in the many types of light bulbs and in natural phenomenon. Note: Behavior of AGF 3 within individual systems generally induce a high frequency of AGF within each atom in the system when compared to AGF 1 \u2014 occurring both naturally and by design and is controlled by electron flow or lower energy density input from electromagnetic radiant energy (light spectrum). The relative (compared to electron flow) reduced energy density input occurring from electromagnetic radiant energy will induce a lower intensity of AGF in the atom. The aurora australis and aurora borealis are natural examples. The heating element in a kitchen toaster is a man made example. \u201cExcitation\u201d of the atom is the metaphor used to generally explain this type of energy (AGF 3) transfer. Note: Luminescence, fluorescence, phosphorescence, and photoluminescence are a few examples of categories of AGF 3 which occur when lower energy density input interacts within specific atomic environmental structure (AES). Atomic emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy are some methods used to study the electromagnetic radiant energy emission or absorption initiated by energy fluctuations introduced to quantum atoms. The energy fluctuations introduced by electron flow or electromagnetic radiant energy interactions with the quantum atom are equivalent to the analysis of atomic gravitational fluctuation; type 3 (AGF 3). The Pound\u2013Rebka experiment conducted in 1959 at Harvard University is a well known experiment that focuses on the change of the resonant frequency of atoms due to a change in gravitational field strength demonstrating the change in atomic resonant frequency is a mechanical property of atoms and is not related to the theory general relativity. Again the laws of atomic gravity disprove old Albert\u2019s outdated idea of how gravity works in the natural world. AGF 3 explains the mechanism nature uses to transfer electromagnetic radiation. Section Conclusion Understanding the the three principles of atomic gravity allows the academic community to move scientific innovation forward under one set of unified principles of physics. Einstein's Equivalence Principle at the atomic scale. (Galileo, Kepler and Einstein identified the principle \u2026 however in the past \u2026 science did not understand how it works at the atomic scale) \u201cZERO-G\u201d Flight (at the atomic scale) Many people have experienced the sensation of weightlessness created in zero-g flights inside aircraft cabins traveling through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However the active physics enabling this sensation in the human body has been little understood. To understand what is going on at the atomic scale requires an understanding of atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF). So to gain a perspective let\u2019s send an atom on a similar ride through Earth's atmosphere. Isaac Newton\u2019s third law of motion states: \u201cWhen one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.\u201d The effects on the atom at all points along the ride demonstrate a unification with Isaac Newton\u2019s third law of motion. The effects shown on the single atom going on the ride can be applied to the many atoms that make-up the entire structure of a human body. These ubiquitous atomic fluctuations in the body\u2019s structure are shared by all people who experience acceleration or deceleration in everyday activities. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) occurs within calculable parameters and conforms to what we feel during each experience. Each atom that makes up the typical human body responds the same as to the single atom shown on its flight. So climb aboard and let\u2019s take a ride to \u201cZero-G\u201d. Atom in the parked Aircraft  The atom is held to the seat by the Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d The nucleus is held directly below the center of the electron sphere. Aircraft accelerating up into the Atmosphere  The atom is held to the seat by the Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d in conjunction with the resultant force \u201cB\u201d produced by the aircraft's upward acceleration \u201cA\u201d into the atmosphere. The nucleus takes up a position between forces \u201cG\u201d and \u201cB\u201d during the upward acceleration. Aircraft in level non-accelerating flight  The atom is held to the seat by the Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d The nucleus is held directly below the center of the electron sphere. The same effect demonstrated by the atom in the parked aircraft. The only acceleration in play is Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d Aircraft accelerating downward equal to \u201cG\u201d  The atom are now floating above the seat when the force \u201cB\u201d initiated by the downward acceleration \u201cA\u201d of the plane is now equal and opposite to Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d at that point in altitude with respect to the gravitational central point of the Earth. The nucleus is now at the center of the electron sphere. The duration and smoothness of the \u201cZero-G\u201d experience is determined by several factors. First \u2014 the aircraft's limitation to its maximum operating altitude \u2014 limits the duration at \u201cZero-G\u201d experience within safe flight parameters. Second, the pilot\u2019s skills in maintaining downward acceleration equal to the Earth's increasing gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d relative to decreasing altitude. Maintaining the appropriate acceleration downward is a technically difficult maneuver that incorporates the abilities of aircraft and pilot. International space station (ISS) \u2014 the same \u201cZero-G\u201d sensation felt for only brief cycles during the aircraft's parabolic flight is experienced 24/7 on the ISS. The nuclei of each atom that makes up the structure of the human body will remain at the center of the electron sphere during orbit on the ISS. The relative velocities to the central gravitational points of the earth, moon, and sun during its orbit induce only micro atomic gravitational fluctuations. Humans have evolved in conjunction with Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d \u2014the human body and its functions (eyes, muscles, digestion, etc...) quickly fail in \u201cZero-G\u201d in space. It is very important to apply the principles of atomic gravity to solve physical issues for future space travelers. AGF Generalization The human body consists of a multitude of atomic structure. Each atom is uniquely connected structurally \u2014 however each nucleus reacts the same to external accelerations at the atomic scale. Isaac Newton\u2019s three laws of motion are unified with atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) principles. The laws of atomic gravity unify gravity, kinetics and electromagnetic radiation (light). When riding in a vehicle and that vehicle comes to a sudden stop \u2014 atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) throughout the structure of the body occurs. The following diagram is of a single atom \u2014 which is part of the body\u2019s structure \u2014shown with the accelerating forces acting on it. This single atom and its behavior can be applied to the overall atomic structure of the body. This example demonstrates a stopping deceleration that is equal to the acceleration of Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d.  During non-accelerating forward motion \u201cM\u201d the nucleus is held to point \u201cA\u201d by Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d \u2014 during a smooth deceleration \u201cD\u201d \u2014 prior to stopping \u2014 the nucleus smoothly curves around the center of the electron sphere to point \u201cB\u201d then smoothly curves relative to the center of the electron sphere \u2014 back to point \u201cA\u201d upon stopping. These ubiquitous atomic movements in the body\u2019s structure are shared by all people who experience acceleration or deceleration in everyday activities. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) occurs within calculable parameters and conforms to what we feel during each experience of changing accelerations. In this energy balanced scenario\u2014 the nucleus follows curve \u201cC\u201d from point \u201cA\u201d to point \u201cB\u201d and back to point \u201cA\u201d \u2014 Curve \u201cC\u201d is correlated to the brachistochrone curve. An atomic scale explanation to why use of the wheel is the most efficient mode of contact land travel. Vibronic spectroscopy is a method used to study the kinetic energy analysis of energy fluctuations introduced to quantum atoms. The energy fluctuations introduced by vibration (kinetic energy inputs) to quantum atoms is equivalent to the analysis of atomic gravitational fluctuation; type 2 (AGF 2) Utilizing vibronic spectroscopy relative to various acceleration inputs and relative to various atomic environmental structure (AES) mediums will lead to a better understanding to curve \u201cc\u201d in all scenarios\u2019. Section Conclusion The ubiquitous effects of atomic gravitational fluctuation on each quantum atom applied to atomic structures is necessary to understand the natural mechanism controlling gravity and the experience of acceleration or deceleration in everyday activities. When taking a ride on public transit or an amusement park roller-coaster \u2014 a passenger experiences atomic gravitational fluctuation within the body\u2019s structure. The public transit or roller-coaster effects usually occur in a quick succession of dips, curves and stops when compared to the smooth acceleration required to maintain an extended zero \u201cG\u201d experience in an aircraft. We all experience and share gravitational fluctuation effects at the atomic scale daily. Biological life evolves and conforms within the principles presented and successful life on earth has evolved to be effective \u201cenergy balanced atomic anti-gravity beings\u201d with respect to the unique structure of each species. The above summary of the principles of zero \u2018G\u201d flight at the atomic scale is more specifically detailed in a three book series that also provide simple solutions for unified principles of physics, dark matter and dark energy all derived from existing observational and experimental data sets. Some in current academic circles protect outdated theories due to vested interests leaving the challenge of discovery and innovation to those looking for testable solutions. The principles of atomic gravity provide a platform for 21st century innovation across the sciences. The content (including diagrams) presented in this answer originate from the following publications. Unified Principles of Physics and Nature; Energy Fluctuation In Quantum Atoms, Black Holes, Stars, Gravity June 2014 Unified Principles of Physics; Black Holes, Galactic Structure, Gravity, and Dark Matter December 2013 What Causes Gravity & What Causes The Expanding Accelerating Universe December 2012 The three \u201cLaws of Atomic Gravity\u201d connected through experiment and observation are for those who seek knowledge, within the principles can be found the path to innovative twenty-first century unified science and discovery. Are electromagnetic waves and sound waves related? They are interconnected at a fundamental level since both waves are produced by nuclei kinetics in other words they are connected by atomic behavior. As you have learned the best way to understand the physics behind the connection is through the principles of atomic gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "I have already answered a similar question to this one: Jeremy Hughes's answer to Does sound behave like light in special relativity?, but I can try to look at it from a different perspective. We can look at the physical side where waves and light both undergo the phenomena of refraction, diffraction, reflection, etc, but we would also have to consider the fact that light is known to interact with matter in a particle like manner, such as in the Photoelectric Effect and the Compton/Inverse Compton Effect (I would include Mossbauer Effect here also, but this is not an accepted depiction of light acting as a particle, since it is independent of intensity.) Newton himself preferred a particle model for light since light does not diffract as much as classical waves. This information can be found with a general internet search. In the context of Relativity, it is of the utmost importance to understand that the classical understanding of wave motion and the second postulate share many similarities, BUT being aware of their major differences is absolutely crucial too. Understanding the related characteristics between light and classical waves is not only important for visualizing and applying the second postulate in the correct way, but also their differences can make us aware of when we can\u2019t apply a particular reasoning to a problem (thought experiment) because it violates the second postulate by making use of a wave model. The second postulate, though it shares some characteristics with a wave model is most definitely not a wave model. Light shares with waves the characteristic that a relative speed is impossible by motion of a source. What is NOT shared is that a relative speed of light is impossible by the second postulate, but a relative speed of a wave is possible through motion of an observer relative to a medium through which a wave propagates. The impossibility of a relative speed of light due to motion of an observer negates the possibility of a medium (Ether), which is another difference between the two theories. There is one exception, and one exception only, whereby light will behave like a wave and have a relative speed. But this point is crucial: this is only possible from the reference frame, and perspective, of an observer with relative motion to another observer or object. A relative speed of light is impossible in an observer\u2019s OWN frame of reference, but an observer in motion relative to this observer will have a relative speed to the same light, albeit ALWAYS lower than the speed of light. Einstein made this error in his description of the Relativity of Simultaneity thought experiment. He projected the results from one frame into the other frame in relative motion in his justification of relative time. And this error is perpetuated by those who do not realize when an observer can have a relative motion to light (across frames), and when they can not (own frame), using \u201chastening\u201d of an observer in its own frame to explain Special Relativity. Awareness of this distinguishing difference between waves and light is more crucial than understanding what they share. Using the shared properties of light and waves, leads to the right answer, and this is best accomplished by always considering an observer at rest in its own frame (you always should, because you have to), with a source in motion relative to the observer. Using what they don\u2019t share leads to errors such as thinking time is actually relative (not just measurement) and confusion among those trying to learn the second postulate and apply it correctly. Light is NOT a wave, but they are similar. It might be hard to distinguish between a Canadian and American at first glance, but once you get into their deeper nuances, we can easily distinguish the two and realize that they are not exactly the same. The same could be said with many Europeans until we hear them speak, or get a chance to watch their mannerisms - a simple picture would not be enough. Brad Pitt said that \u201cwe spend 95% of our time fighting about the 5% that makes us different\u201d, which I agree is pointless in some ways in terms of politics, but sometimes those 5% differences are crucial. Whether the stats are the same for shared characteristics between a wave and light, I don\u2019t know, but the crucial difference between the two must be understood. ",

            "answer_text": "Like everybody says, they share the common properties of waves. For example: Waves are masslessWaves change speed instantaneously when entering/exiting transparent materialThe frequency of waves don\u2019t change. Only the propagation speed and wavelength can change.Like Einstein reminded the world, wave propagation speed is constant and is not influenced by the speed of the source. However, the Doppler effect will make the wave blue shifted for the observers that are in the direction the source was moving and red shifted for the observers located in the direction where the source was moving away.If a source can move faster than the wave propagation speed, the frequencies all concentrate creating a sharp white noise called sonic boom for sound waves and \u201cCherenkow radiation\u201d for electromagnetic waves.There is many more common points but I wanted to highlight some of the most important and rarely mentioned characteristics. Two major differences: One is about 1 million times faster than the other (the slower one involve mechanical motion of atoms/molecules, the other involve electrons only which are 1836 times lighter ; not enough to explain the 1 million speed ratio, but half way there on a log scale)The shape is different : the mechanical waves is a growing sphere, the other a transverse wave like on a guitar stringRadio waves can be produced with arbitrary intensity. Whichever radio station has more money can use a bigger vacuum tube operating at higher voltage to produce higher power radio waves. However, somewhere between 100 ghz and 100 thz, we loose that capacity to modulate arbitrary wave intensity. When reaching the visible light frequency range, we can only produce \u201cparticle\u201d instead of traditional \u201cwaves\u201d. The only way to get a monochromatic light more intense than another is increasing the number of photons per second. Each photon start travelling in straight line from the source. Their physical length is one wavelength and the physical height (the peak to peak) is probably a ratio of the wavelength. Both sound (mechanical) waves and electromagnetic waves (in the visible light range and higher) follow the inverse square root law for intensity versus distance from the source (at twice the distance, the intensity decrease 4 times) but for different reason. In one case, the spherical wave simply decrease in intensity. In the other case, it is the number of particle reaching target that decrease. Each photon remain the same intensity no matter the distance or time since its emission. ",

            "answer_text": "They are both waves, so yes. Electromagnetic waves are obviously waves made up of an electric field that is oscillating and a magnetic field that is oscillating. One unique characteristic it has is that it doesn't need a medium to travel in (it can travel through space). Sound on the other hand is a vibrational wave. That is, it travels by vibrating through some medium. When you yell on earth, you are vibrating air molecules which in turn continue to vibrate the next air molecules, and that's how sound travels. Yell in space and nothing happens. Other than the fact that they are both waves, and share common wave properties (diffraction, reflection, etc) they aren't very related. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's go over this, very briefly with just a couple points to note the likeness and similarities of the two. I first ask, do both have crystals? Yes, they do. The crystals have electrons that surround them. This filtrates your magnetic field. So both, similarly are Electromagnetic.  Magnon is the key term here I believe. Finally, phonons were  photons previously. Only a rearranging of atoms and distortion changed this. Atoms removed, added and put in a different order can change the parameters of physical boundaries, perception and distort our known reality.  So, the frequency of the photon is disturbed, thus breaking its band gap and moving atoms to an ununified location. The vibration changes in the photon because the atoms must be uniform and equally proportionate. When even one atom is misplaced or freely moving, a phonon shall now exist in place of a photon.   The properties change following the obtrusion and the waves become close to opposite polarities, yet, once upon a time....they were both the same wave. ",

No: sound waves in fluids are longitudinal, whereas EM waves are always transverse. (Some crystals do support transverse phonon modes, but you can\u2019t hear them.) Sound waves need a medium to vibrate; EM waves traverse vacuum. Related? Yes, in the sense that electromagnetism (mediated by photons) are responsible for all the interactions between atoms that produce the compression or shear forces that generate sound waves. ",

The ways they are unrelated are much more interesting: Sound requires a transport medium, the air; photons (electromagnetic packets) are self-contained and are their own transport. Sound radiates in all directions; a photon, a single point, can only go in one direction. Sound energy is dissipated by its\u2019 transport medium and loses energy as it travels, photons don\u2019t. Sound contains many different frequency\u2019s, a photon has only one. Sound can be produced with a multitude of many energy amplitudes, a photon has only one amplitude, the smallest possible, the quantum. ",

EM waves are not compression waves, the waving is all sideways, and they don't need a medium to propagate through. And they're of vastly different speeds. But they're similar enough that you can use sound waves to make a viable analog of the two-slit experiment and show diffraction and reflection too. ",
