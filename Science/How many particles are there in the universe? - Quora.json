            "answer_text": "The answer to the question depends on what is meant by the universe. The standard cosmological model is that the universe is infinite. The only way the universe could be finite if it has a constant positive curvature, but the current measurement of the curvature implies that the universe is flat and therefore infinite. However, the observable universe is finite. The observable universe is the part of the universe that we can see - and since the universe is only 13.7 billion years old, we can only see photons that reach us in less than 13.7 billion years. Therefore the observable universe is defined as only the parts of the universe that are within 13.7 billion light years of us. The commonly accepted answer for the number of particles in the observable universe is [math]10^{80}[/math]. This number would include the total of the number of protons, neutrons, neutrinos and electrons. Now most of the photons in our universe are the photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation and it is estimated that there are [math]10^{9}[/math] photons for every particle in the universe so that would make [math]10^{89}[/math] photons in the universe. Until we know what the dark matter particle is, we cannot make an accurate estimate of the number of dark matter particles. We do know that the total mass of the dark matter is about 6 times the mass of the particles in the universe. Currently, the favored theoretical candidate for the dark matter particle is the WIMP - the weakly interacting massive particle. These particles are assumed to be much heavier (x100?) than a proton, so if this is the dark matter particle then it would not significantly increase the number of particles in the universe. On the other hand, if the dark matter particle is the axion, it may be 1/1000th the mass of a proton (or less) so it could push up the particle count by several powers of 10. We know even less about the dark energy in the universe, but the leading estimate is that it is \"just\" a small constant vacuum energy density. If the dark energy is just vacuum energy, then that would not increase the particle count for the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "What we do know is that our universe has a finite volume. It is not infinite like the counting numbers, of which there is no end: given one there is always a larger one. If as seems proven beyond a reasonable doubt (the best science can do), the universe started as a small entity followed by a Big Bang about 13 billion years ago, then we can attempt to make the calculation by observing its contents and making the rough calculation. Mr Brown's statement that we know neither of these things is right in the sense that we do not know them accurately, but we can make reasonable estimates, and that leads to my colleague Dr Specter's response, which is considered a reasonable estimate. The finiteness of our universe is in my view the key concept here and worth emphasizing. If one does not accept that intuitively difficult fact, no statement about these sorts of measures will make any sense. But it is finite, so one can take a cut at it, which is what astrophysicists do! ",
