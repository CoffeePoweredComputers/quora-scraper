            "answer_text": "Basically, yes. +/- 0.1 mm. Need to be careful here. Two major items in a measurement device are accuracy and precision. A measurement can be precise (say in this case to .001mm) and repeatable, but it does not mean it is accurate. It could be 10mm off, but is precisely (within .001mm) of 10mm off. We want a measurement that is accurate. The real value to be measured should be within that +/- 0.1mm window. I hope I explained this understandably. ",

            "answer_text": "You can have a metre bar that is accurate to 0,1 mm, but there\u2019s only 0m and 1m. It means that if you measure a value, then the range reported will be within 0.1 mm of the true length. When Angstrom was making his measure, he supposed that the standard kept at Upsalla was 999.96 mm, but it was shy of this by 0.02 mm, so the standard length is \u20181 metre\u2019, the reported length is 999.96 mm, and the actual length is 999.94 mm.
