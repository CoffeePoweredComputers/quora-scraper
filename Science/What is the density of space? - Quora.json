            "answer_text": "The answer is yes, it isn't as empty as we originally thought, but it isn't that dense. The few particles that are around are called WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles). The mass of the Universe is critical knowledge that scientists need to know, mostly for calculations involving big G a constant (or not) that would mean the universe will crunch (due to gravity) or just keep expanding. The figures don't add up. Something else is out there called Dark Matter, although I've never heard an understandable explanation of it. That there might be much more WIMP out there is a possibility, but its been largely discounted: but there was more than originally thought. Astrophysics changes a lot, This was the explanation around 5-10 years ago: it might be out of date. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends where in space you are. In interplanetary space, there are 5 particles per cubic centimeter. In interstellar space, there is only one particle per cubic centimeter. In intergalactic space, however, it starts to get lonely. You can go entire cubic meters without one particle. These pockets of nothing are called in science voids. In addition, because of dark energy everything is residing from us (Milky Way) at accelerating speeds. It only gets emptier.  Large cosmic void.
