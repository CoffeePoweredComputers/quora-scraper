            "answer_text": "I explain it to my 8th grade students like this. It\u2019s very simplified, but hopefully it helps them understand (and hopefully its correct!). Think of a nucleus like a stage. Of course, the best seats in the house are the front row, but that row only has 2 seats. The first two audience members in (electrons) will choose those two seats. Anyone coming in after that will take the next row, which has 8 seats. Now, the concert is being recorded, so having a half-empty row of seats just looks bad. So, there are two options. If you have less than half a row filled, you can ask them to leave (!) and remove the chairs, and now all the seats are filled. If you are short just a few, you can go grab a few more people to fill up the row and now all the seats are filled. In covalent bonding, you would fill that outer shell by sharing electrons from another atom or atoms. For example, oxygen has 6 valence electrons, while hydrogen has a single electron. Two hydrogens share their electrons with the outer shell of oxygen, giving oxygen a total of 8 (eight is great!) and oxygen shares one electron with each hydrogen so that each has two (the limit for the first shell). Now they are all \u201chappy\u201d and you\u2019ve formed polar covalent bonds.  If anyone has a better analogy, or corrections/improvements to this one, please share! ",

            "answer_text": "Every element wants to complete it\u2019s outermost shell by 8 electrons so they bonds with other element to complete it outermost shell. Take fluorine for example, fluorine has 7 electrons at it\u2019s outermost shell and fluorine just need one more electron to complete the octet rule, so other atoms would easily bond with fluorine and release energy. Nitrogen, it has 5 valence electron and it wants 3 more so it bonds to itself to form a diatomic atom N2, because no atom reacts easily with nitrogen because of the 5 valence electron, it needs lot of energy to break down the triple bond of nitrogen. Hopes this helps:) ",
