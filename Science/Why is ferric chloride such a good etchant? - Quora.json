            "answer_text": "Well, the chemistry behind is nothing special: FeCl3 + Cu \u2192 FeCl2 + CuClFeCl3 + CuCl \u2192 FeCl2 + CuCl2 Ferric chloride is a mild oxidizer, the copper is etched by becomming CuCl and then CuCl2, in which form it is solluble in water.  It is often used as an etchant in a PCB industry because it is cheap and doesn't decompose like other etchants (HCl + H2O2), and also does not have to be heated up like sodium perchlorate. It is not so aggresive, which means also that it won't attack the thin protecting film layer. It also does not form bubbles during the etch. Bubbles are a problem if you don't stir the sollution because they might protect the copper so copper \"drops\" are left behind. ",
