            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a disingenuous effort by alternative media to blow any perceived error on the part of the mainstream media as evidence of the alleged bias and malfeasance. Then they turn around and deliver stories that will confirm the biases of their audience. It\u2019s part of their business model and has been very effective. A good example was this article from the Fox News website that claimed that the media misrepresented President Trump\u2019s comments about George Floyd  [1] \"Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying, 'This is a great day that's happening for our country.' It's a great day for him. It's a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great day in terms of equality. It's really what our Constitution requires and it's what our country is all about.\" - President Trump The article would have received a poor grade in a high school English class. It was a bad lesson on context. Basically, the article is saying that because trump briefly mentioned equal justice just before he made the above comment, he wasn\u2019t referring to the jobs numbers that were the focus of the press conference. The article never explains what \u201cequal justice\u201d event happened that day that would have made Floyd happy. Unfortunately, if you look at the comments, most readers seemed to just suck it up without question. It fits their narrative about the mainstream media. Footnotes[1] Mainstream media falsely frames Trump's 'great day' George Floyd remarks on jobs report instead of equality under law",

            "answer_text": "There are several reasons for the current skepticism. 1) A president who has called journalists \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d; 2) an utter lack of understanding about how biased the press used to be and what improvements have been made; 3) lazy people who jump on bandwagons without investigating; 4) need for a new whipping boy and a scapegoat for all these people don\u2019t like; 5) mass confusion over what \u201cthe media\u201d really is and how many voices it includes, more than ever before; 6) social media which isn\u2019t really media in that it is edited, but is really a bathroom wall where anyone can post any garbage.
