Sure, 80% of the world knows that you need to control your diet to get a body fat low enough to see abs, but that 20%\u2026well, a fool and his money are easily parted. And thus, ab workouts were born, to lessen the burden of that wallet. You want to know the best ab exercise? The one that rose to the top when Bret Contreras tested dozens of them? The bodyweight chinup. You ever seen THAT in an ab workout??? Yup, chinups and pullups are fantastic ab movements.  Rounding out the top 3? Hanging Leg Raise, Ab Wheel You don\u2019t need anything beyond that, for the rectus abdominis.  \u201cBut what about obliques?\u201d  Internal Oblique Ab Wheel from FeetAb Wheel from KneesExternal Oblique Ab Wheel from FeetHanging Leg RaiseAnd what about the erectors, the muscles of the core that the world seems to have forgotten, that literally hold you up all day?  Just deadlift. Squat. Row. Take my hand, get your probably chaffed ass off the floor and let\u2019s go do some real exercises. In reality, most of that time spent flopping around on the floor doing ab workouts isn\u2019t going to be very effective. It\u2019s just bullshit. You feel like you\u2019re doing something, but any results are almost entirely diet, and you could be building the other 95% of your body in the time that you wasted wasting your waist.  Please stop.

Even if you are not fighting, the places where you need strength, with a good core strength you can bring things to work. But a weak core may really put in trouble on times of massacre. However, these were not a priority in the past as our ancestors included lots of Hindu pushups, back exercises and crunches leading to a strong core. We see, lots of our old body builders and fighters had big bellies. Those because, they were least focussed on thinning their belly but keeping more strength in their body. As modern body evolved and Abs became a trend, humans, especially boys focused on lean tummy and instead weakening their core. This can lead to too much strain on backbone and quick fatigue and tiredness. What good trainers are doing now is they strengthen the core first then focus on secondary muscles. So its not the buzz word but a need. ",
