            "answer_text": "Energy currency of the cell ATP is synthesized n the flow of electron from one electron acceptor to another.ATP is essential to drive dark reaction wherein CO2 is reduced into glucose .This ATP is used in synthetic process of starch ,lipids,nucleic acids, pigments within the chloroplast . Non cyclic photophosphorylation does not produce enough ATP in relation to NADPH to operate the dark phase of photosynthesis.The defeciency of ATP compelled in the operation of cyclic photophosphorylation.
