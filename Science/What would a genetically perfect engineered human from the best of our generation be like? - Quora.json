            "answer_text": "Probably a lot like a combination of \u201cGMO\u201d crops and Dr. Ian Malcolm\u2019s quote regarding the recreation of dinosaurs in Jurrasic Park: \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.\u201d As a Christian, I believe that life and death is in the hands of an almighty God. NOTHING that human beings have made as a \u201csubstitute\u201d for something natural has worked out very well (think formula vs. breast milk as a basic example). Yes, I understand that we have genetic mutations, even serious abnormalities, but that is because we live in a fallen world in which those things were introduced as a result of man\u2019s choice to rebel against God. I look at the idea of genetically engineering a human being in the same was I do cloning - as man\u2019s attempt to \u201cplay God\u201d and/or improve upon/fix what God has done. I am not a Christian scientist; I am not opposed to reasonable medical treatment. However, there is an enormous difference between treating someone for an infection and attempting to create the \u201cperfect human\u201d through genetic manipulation. Have you ever seen the movie Twins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito? Yes, it\u2019s a comedy, and not intended to be realistic, but think about the hurt, lies, and failure that was woven through the story line. I think if someone literally tried this, the reality would be far worse. ",
