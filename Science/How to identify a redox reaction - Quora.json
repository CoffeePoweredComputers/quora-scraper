            "answer_text": "A redox reaction occurs when oxidation and reduction take place in the same reaction. This happens as one species is acting as a reducing agent and is oxidised by another species that is acting as an oxidising agent (and is reduced). Oxidation occurs when a substance gains oxygen or loses hydrogen and/or loses electrons. Reduction occurs when a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen and/or gains electrons. Therefore an oxidising agent oxidises a reducing agent by taking electrons from it and gaining electrons in the process, hence the oxidising agent is reduced. An example would be the following reaction: CuO + Zn -> Cu + ZnO The ionic equation for the reaction is as follows: Cu2+ + Zn -> Cu + Zn2+ From these two equations we can see that copper is acting as an oxidising agent as it takes electrons from the zinc, causing Cu2+ to be reduced to Cu and the zinc to be oxidised to Zn2+. The copper is also being reduced because it loses oxygen to the zinc which is oxidised to zinc oxide. This redox reaction occurs as copper is a more powerful oxidising agent than zinc as the reduction of copper is more feasible. This is means that copper has a higher standard reduction potential, so it has a greater tendency to gain electrons and be reduced. Likewise, zinc is a more powerful reducing agent so it has a greater tendency to lose electrons as the oxidation of zinc to Zn2+ is more feasible than the oxidation of Cu to Cu2+. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether the chemical reaction is redox or not can be confirmed by checking in the reaction whether one of reactant is undergoing reduction and other one reduction .This can be decided by the change of oxidation numbers (increase and decrease) .The two reactants may react directly or in any suitable medium acid/alkaline . In some cases the only reactant can act as an oxidant and a reductant , in such reactions atom of the same element undergo in higher oxidation state and in lower oxidation state Such redox reactions are called disproportionation reactions ",
