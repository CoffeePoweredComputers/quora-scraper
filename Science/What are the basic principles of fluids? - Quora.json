            "answer_text": "It depends on the application and how \u201cfundamental\u201d you want to go. The first chapter of my class notes on the fundamentals goes over: Fluid definition: material that continuously deforms under shear forceFluid kinematics: the ways a fluid element can deformFluid dynamics: accelerations resulting from applied forcesViscosity: Newtonian and inviscid fluidsIncompressible flow: flow at low Mach numberIrrotational flow: flow outside the boundary layer and wakeIf you ask google/quora about these topics you can get into as much detail as you like.
