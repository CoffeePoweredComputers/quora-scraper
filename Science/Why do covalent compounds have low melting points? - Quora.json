            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. However, you already have four answers here, and the question has been addressed fairly well. I\u2019ll see what I can add. Bonds with strong covalent character - those in which atoms \u2018share\u2019 electrons to fill their shells - are among the strongest chemical bonds. This can be seen by looking at the enthalpies of formation of some common covalent compounds, which are much larger than their ionic equivalents. Indeed, compounds which form continuous networks of covalent bonds are extremely strong and have very high melting points. Examples include boron nitride (3246 K), silicon carbide (3000 K) and silicon dioxide (1986 K). However, network covalent bonding is the exception rather than the rule. Covalent bonds are very directional and bond two specific atoms, rather than acting as a general \u2018glue\u2019 between atoms. This means that most covalent compounds form discrete molecules. Melting of a molecular solid does not require breaking of the strong, covalent, intramolecular bonds. Instead, it is only necessary to break the weaker intermolecular bonds. Depending on the compound and the functional groups available, these may be hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions or van der Waals forces, any of which are weaker than covalent bonds. For this reason, molecular solids have much lower melting points. ",

            "answer_text": "Covalently bound materials CAN have LOW melting points, i.e. [math]CH_{4}[/math], [math]CO_{2}[/math], [math]H_{2}[/math], but they CAN have HIGH melting points also \u2026. e.g. [math]C_{\\text{diamond}}[/math], [math]Al_{2}O_{3}[/math], or [math]SiO_{2}[/math]. The key factor that differentiates between high, and low melting points, is NOT covalency, but the MOLECULARITY of the material. Molecular materials, e.g. [math]N_{2}[/math], [math]CH_{4}[/math], [math]Ar[/math], routinely tend to have LOW to middling melting points, because the intermolecular interaction is NOT STRONG, and only weak dispersion forces bind the molecules together. Some molecular materials, i.e. water, or ammonia, have elevated melting and boiling points, given that these possess stronger intermolecular forces of attraction (which are\u2026?). On the other hand, NON-MOLECULAR materials, e.g. ionic salts, metals, graphite, have HIGH to IMPOSSIBLY HIGH melting and boiling points\u2026 ",
