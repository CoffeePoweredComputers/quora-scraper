            "answer_text": "The geometry of PH3 is pyramidal. We know the phosphorus atom is in 15 nth group and so it has outermost 5 electrons out of which 3 is used for three normal two electron bond with three hydrogen atoms and there is one electron pair left which make the structure pyramidal from square planar shape\u2026 Similarly the shape of NH3 is also pyramidal.
