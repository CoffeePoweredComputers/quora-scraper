            "answer_text": "Until somedays back, I didn't pay much attention to taking care of my physical health, but from the past few weeks I've decided, not to excuse myself from it. I am not an early morning person, but I find it best to exercise then, because at all other times I make excuses like, it is too hot, it's dark, I am already tired, etc\u2026 So I've decided that once I'll get up in the morning at six, exercise for an hour, and then go back to sleep. So far, it has been great and is working for me, somedays when I was unable to sleep at night properly I'd try to excuse myself, but now instead I try to cut short the time I exercise for, rather than completely leaving it out and somedays I end up completing my target. So for me it is just a matter of getting out of bed. ",
