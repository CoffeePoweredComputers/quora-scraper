            "answer_text": "An alkali is a base which dissolves in water. The alkali metal hydroxides are bases which easily dissolve in water. Add to that the alkaline earth metal hydroxides, although the solubility of these goes way down. All of these metal hydroxides ionize in water to produce OH- ions. The clinker is Mg(OH)2 which has such a low solubility it is often left out of the alkali grouping. Ammonia is also on the fringes since it doesn\u2019t contain OH, but it can produce OH- ions upon reacting with water.\u2026. NH3(aq) + HOH(l) <==> NH4^+ + OH- \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Kb is small Then there are the alkali imposters, those metal hydroxides which have formulas which look like those of the soluble alkalis, but have really low solubilities like the transition metal hydroxides (like Cu(OH)2 or Fe(OH)2) and a few hydroxides of the post-transition metals, like Al(OH)3. Like all so-called insoluble compounds, they dissolve to a slight extent. Bases are those substances which can neutralize acids and include all of the alkalis. What constitutes a base depends on the level of theory. In the Arrhenius theory a base is an alkali and produces OH- ions in solution. In the Bronsted-Lowry theory a base is said to \u201caccept\u201d a proton (hydrogen ion). In the Lewis theory a base is an electron pair \u201cdonor.\u201d Therefore, \u201cbases\u201d form a large group of substances usually in aqueous solution. ",

            "answer_text": "All bases dissolve in water. Some better than others. I think your question relates to solubility. Referring only to the hydroxides and not the large class of bases formed when salts dissolve, the alkali hydroxides are all very soluble in water. All the rest of the metal hydroxides have varying solubility, but most have very low solubility. Look up a Ksp table for the definitive list. ",
