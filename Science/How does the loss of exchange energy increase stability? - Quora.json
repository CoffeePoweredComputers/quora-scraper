            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean by \u201cexchange energy\u201d. If you are referring to the chemical bond, exchange energy is merely one term in an expression in one particular theory, but as a general rule in any assembly describable by a Lagrangian, we have something called the virial theorem, and for an inverse square field, the total energy equals half the potential energy, which equals minus the kinetic energy. Accordingly anything that raises the kinetic energy, or lowers the potential energy, lowers the total energy. The lower the total energy, the more stable the system is. In my opinion, \u201cexchange energy\u201d is not helpful because it s not clear what its sign is. If you look at some papers, it behaves as if it lowers the kinetic energy when they men to total energy. The best way of viewing the chemical bond, in my opinion, is to argue that because the two electrons gain two new interactions with nuclei, and only one repulsive interaction the potential energy lowers. If you assume that quantum mechanics involves linear wave superposition (as in general QM, but NOT in many computational papers) then it is possible to calculate chemical bond properties quite nicely based on potential energy. My efforts can be found here if interested. I think you will find (a) the calculations are quite accurate and (b) you don\u2019t need a computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me give you an example. Let say you put a ladder against the wall and clime up. If at this point an earthquake happens, the ladder would fall. This is due to the instability of the ladder. When you raised the ladder and put it against the wall and climbed up the ladder, you gave it gravitational energy. This energy made it unstable. Now if you take this energy from the ladder by laying it on the ground, the earthquake can not make it fall. In general instability happens when the derivative of energy versus x (location) is positive. Which means system has energy and wants to give it away, but is locked in a situation that it can not. In this case the more energy it has the more unstable it would be. ",

            "answer_text": " Bond is basically, the net-2 force equilibrium (blue arrow) of a) electrostatic attraction of electrons and protons and b) direct nucleostaticmagnetics (strong) force repulsion between electrons and nucleons. However, surrounding electrons repel each other (red arrows); yet, that gives the structure a sideway component (yellow arrows) of stability. The calculation of the blue versus red is how \u2018deep\u2019 the energy valley is. That means more stable. For example, a hydrogen bond has no surrounding electrons for the 01-H Hydrogen side. As a result, they are probably the least stable bonds in nature.  Any yellow force form the side, will break a Hydrogen bond. That is the reason for the high boing point of H2O water. ",
