            "answer_text": "You have got a good question, I think many people are confused. Let's sort it out. As we know, black holes are the most powerful objects in the universe. They have the strongest gravitational pull towards their centre part (singularity). The gravitational pull is so strong that even light can't escape it. And now comes the question that how our brilliant scientists took image of such thing that does not emit light, or in other words, such thing that cannot be seen. Shown below is the first image of a black hole Messier 87 (M87), have a look at the image and scrolling down you'll get complete explanation of how this image was taken.  Scientists thought that it was impossible to capture a black hole with the existing telescopes. So they calibrated 8 different telescopes located at different parts of the world. They sycronised all the 8 telescopes with a powerful atomic clock and formed the largest telescope that could fit on Earth. All these telescopes were together named the EVENT HORIZON TELESCOPE. Given below is the globe representing the location of all the telescopes.  Now the question is, how something got pictured that can't be seen! Now, here is your answer - black holes swallow stars and even solar systems and during this process large amount of energy is released most of which is captured by the black hole and rest of the energy is visible as light (fire) at the event horizon of the black hole. The first picture of the black hole shows yellow bright region around a dark spot and according to the research the bright yellow-orange region is the event horizon ( at the time of black hole swallowing a star ). And the dark region is the black hole (path to singularity) from which even light can't escape. The black hole M87 is situated at the centre of vigro cluster and is 55 million light years away from us. It has a radius of 60 light years. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the size of the sun which is very enormous. It is also very large as compared to the size of other black holes. Scientists observed M87 for several day until the we're sure that it is a black hole. Here are the pics of M87 on different days.  Now the scientists are planing to capture the image of the black hole which is present at the centre of our own Milky way galaxy but it would be difficult because it is comparatively smaller than M87. Imaging the black hole is a revolutionary step towards modern science. Hope your confusion if clear. Thanks. ",
