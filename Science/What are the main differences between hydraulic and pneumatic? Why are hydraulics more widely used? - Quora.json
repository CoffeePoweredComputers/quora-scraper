            "answer_text": "The main difference (i would consider) is the medium used to transmit power. In Hydraulics liquid/oil is used to transmit power, whereas in pneumatic compressed gas (generally air) is used to transmit power. Due to this difference there are many things that differ between the systems. For example you would need a tank to store oil from which the system can draw oil in case of deficit. In pneumatic the system can just draw air from the atmosphere and just a filter would be required to purify it. In my opinion I wouldn't say that either is more common than the other, rather each have their own specialties which make them unique for their corresponding applications. For further detailed explanation of the differences read on. Here is a basic comparison of the two.  Here is a application wise comparison of various power transmission systems. The also have details of other mechanisms kindly ignore them.  A brief on the pros and cons of each system Pneumatics offer a very clean system, suitable for food manufacturing processes and other processes which require no risk of contamination. Hydraulics is generally not used in these environments due to the risk of hydraulic oil leaks from faulty valves, seals or burst hoses. Pneumatics offer rapid movement of cylinders and have the great advantage of availability in very small sizes. Why do pneumatics offer a higher operating speed of its components? This is mainly due to air compressor flow rates, air is very agile and can flow through pipes very quickly and easily with little resistance, while hydraulic oil is a viscous substance and requires more energy to move. Also in pneumatics, cylinders and valves can dump their compressed air straight to the atmosphere when they need to change direction or alter their state quickly, compared with hydraulics where the oil must be routed back to the reservoir. Pneumatics does not have the potential force that hydraulics has to offer. The lifting or moving of heavy loads is not best suited to pneumatics. Hydraulics can smoothly lift and move loads because the hydraulic oil is not compressible, compared to air which can become jerky and spongy as the air pressure fluctuates with cylinder movement or load changes. In general a much larger pneumatic cylinder is needed to obtain the same force that a hydraulic ram can produce. In terms of energy costs pneumatics is more costly than hydraulics, this is mainly due to the amount of energy lost through heat production while compressing air.

Difference among above is type of energy required for rotary or linear actuator. Hydraulic Actuator : In hydraulic actuator pressurized oil is used for actuator. actuator are generally hydraulic cylinder (linear ) or motor(rotary) . There are different type of hydraulic linear actuator : single acting , double acting , telescopic , tandem etc . Also rotary actuator : Gear motor , vane motor, piston motor etc. Hydraulic actuator is used generally where large force and accurate speed and position control is required. Pneumatic Actuator : In pneumatic actuator compressed air is required for actuator. Same as hydraulic actuator pneumatic actuator are cylinder(linear) or motor(rotary). Linear Pneumatic actuator : single acting cylinder , double acting cylinder , tandem cylinder , stopper cylinder etc . Rotary pneumatic actuator : rotary fixed rotation cylinder , continuous rotation cylinder etc Pneumatic actuator is used generally where high speed is required rather than large force. It is also less costly among all. Electric actuator: Electric actuator use power screw with motor which required electric power. Rotary motion of motor is converted in linear motion using screw and nut mechanism . Electric actuator serve between hydraulic and pneumatic system. It can be used for large force and high speed also. Magnetic actuator : Electromagnetic actuator is generally solenoid. in which electric energy is converted in to magnetic field and due to magnetic field armature moves on. It is generally used for small stroke and quick response. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydraulic fluid is not compressible, so it is safer and much more controllable than pneumatics (at the same power levels ). For example, if a 3,000 psi hydraulic tank burst, it would release a small amount of fluid to bring the tank pressure down it 0 psi. Conversely, breaking the valve off the end of a 3,000 psi inert gas (pneumatic) tank has resulted in the tank shooting through multiple cement walls, destroying everything in its path. Pneumatics are used in situations where high pressures are not required or where contamination is not acceptable. For example, pressurized industrial control systems typically use low pressure (~ 100 psi) oil-free compressed air because it is clean and will not gunk up control system components; also slow leaks are not harmful to the environment.

            "answer_text": "Hydraulic and pneumatic both use a fluid rather than mechanical, electrical or magnetic, or human or animal power. So the primary difference between them is which fluid they use. Hydraulic uses liquid. Pneumatic uses a gas. I would class hydro dams, wave power, blood circulation, ground water circulation, vascular circulation in plants, saliva, tears, lymph, urine, fuel pumps, water pumps, windshield wipers, irrigation, oil and coal pipelines, submarines, tsunami\u2019s, rip tides, aircraft carrier rams, and water wells all as hydraulic, as well as hydraulic oil pumps, cylinders and motors. They all use a liquid to do work. I would class wind energy systems, parachutes, airplanes, dirigibles, breathing, internal combustion gas engines, turbines, respiration in plants, anemometers, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning, the Jet Stream, weather patterns, tornadoes, sodas, pressure cooking, gas stoves, gas cutting torches, natural gas pipelines, fuel-air explosives, as well as pneumatic cylinders, motors, and compressors as pneumatic. They all use gases to do work. So, the mechanical properties of liquids (such as in-compressible, specific gravity and specific heat) and gases (compressible, low viscosity, combustible) are major differences. I don\u2019t know that hydraulics are more widely used. They are for high power applications in most industries. So, for lower power applications my guess would be pneumatics are cheaper and more numerous. ",

            "answer_text": "We have many power sources to drive a machine , like steam turbine, hydraulic turbine, IC engines etc. Some cases, small powers with accurate manipulation is necessary like earth movers, controls etc. So, electric power is used to actuate the hydraulic and pneumatic units and deliver controlled and high power. Differences are hydrulic controls uses mostly hydraulic oils and pneumatic controls uses air for their power transmission. Hydraulic pumps-cylinder will operate high pressure say, 5000 psig and pneumatic compressor - cylinder uses only utility pressure, say around 100 psig. There is risk of explosion and huge calamity if the pneumatic control fails as air expands. For jerking or shaking loads, pneumatic power is famous. Oil cannot be used for such jerks/shakes. Vibration can cause the hydraulic power unstable. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydraulics involves the use of fluid such as automatic transmission fluid for example to operate hydraulic pistons & a rotor vane pump is used to pump the fluid, pneumatics involves the use of compressed air which is usually made by a piston air pump compressor which pushes air to operate either pneumatic pistons or rotor vane driven air tools. Hydraulics are more widely used because hydraulic fluid cannot be compressed like air can,so hydraulic fluid which is pumped at a pressure such as 1300 PSI is literally as hard as steel despite being a liquid. Since air can be compressed,hydraulics are used to operate hydraulic rams or presses instead ! ",

Almost all industrial automation systems use them for a variety of reasons, but a single production line may have hundreds or even thousands of pneumatic devices. You just need to look in the right places. Hydraulics are used in some obvious places like dump truck, excavators and other heavy equipment, mainly because they are HEAVY equipment. These are easily seen by everyone but pneumatics are hiding behind almost every industrial door. ",
