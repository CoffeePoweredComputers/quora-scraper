            "answer_text": "Have you ever turned on the news, and watched a couple of people yammer for an hour about the interest rate and how it reflects on the economy, while you sat there scratching your head and wondering how the heck this has anything to do with you? Have you ever debated whether or not to finally buy a new car, now that the only thing that's reliable about your old car is that it'll break every Thursday? Has the thought \"well, I'd love to have a new car, but I've put so much money into the repair costs just now so it just doesn't pay to replace the old one\" ever entered your mind?  Have you ever seen a protest, in which people are yelling at the government to raise the minimum wage, and asked yourself \"well, why not? Why shouldn't everyone who works earn more money?\".  Have you ever wondered why housing prices (not everywhere, of course, but I'll use my country - Israel - as an example) seem to only be going up and up and up?  These situations - along with hundreds of others that you're experiencing on a daily basis - are the reason why we should all be taking an interest in economics. Because once you\u2019ve studied economics, you'd know that $100 now is usually worth more than $100 in the future (unless inflation - a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services, which essentially means that your money is worth less - is high) because the $100 that you have right now could be invested in the bank, in the stock market, in real estate, or in many other projects, and turn into, say, $105 in a year from now (as in, a 5% increase). Therefore, it's good to know what the banks\u2019 interest rate is, as your money can be invested there, or alternatively - that how much you might be paying if you were to take out a loan. And once you\u2019ve studied economics, you\u2019d know that the money that you've already put into your lousy old car is a sunk cost - meaning, you've already paid the money and you're not getting it back - and therefore shouldn't be taken account into your decision of whether or not to replace it. What should be taken into account is how much the new car would cost: how much cash would be paid upfront and how much interest would you be adding when you pay back the loan; how much repairs would cost for the new and old car in the future, gas prices, depreciation (how much of its value a product loses), etc. Since you'd already know how to take into account how much a future cost translates to in present value terms, you'd be able to determine if buying a new car is worthwhile. And once you've studied economics, you'd know that the minimum wage is far more complicated than just giving some workers more money. The money would be coming from the employer's pockets, and if the employee is creating a lower profit for the employer than the new wages he's given, that employer may very well fire that employee. Some employers (who aren't necessarily part of corporations, they could easily be privately owned businesses or partnerships!) would even be forced to close shop because their business model no longer works, and they'd be unemployed as well. Perhaps, then, the protesters who are championing raising the minimum wage are in fact mistaken, and you, now knowledgeable in the ways of economics, can see the other side of things as well. You\u2019d also be a far more well-informed citizen on matters such as housing prices. You\u2019d know that what sets the prices for housing is the supply of houses and the demand for them, and that if the supply is low yet the demand is high, that means that there are many people desperately looking for a house in an area in which there are few available, and are consequently willing to pay more for the privilege of living there. You\u2019d understand that while some governments try and manipulate the markets by using price ceilings and other techniques which sound fancy on the news, they\u2019re just doing it for the sake of being reelected and they have no idea how the economy actually works. Do yourself a favor - pick up an economics textbook, which will describe in great detail what the words I\u2019ve highlighted in bold mean. You\u2019ll learn far more about the world you live in, and let me tell you - you will not regret it. ",
