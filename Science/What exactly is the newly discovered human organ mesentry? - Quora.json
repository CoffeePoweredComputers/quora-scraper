            "answer_text": "Mesentry was considered just a fold of peritoneum connecting the different organs like stomach, small intestine, spleen, pancreas, liver and other organs to the posterior abdominal wall. But the recent discovery has considered it a new organ.  According to Ben Guarino at The Washington Post, the mesentery has been in the anatomy books for over a century. In fact, Leonardo da Vinci even described it in 1508. But doctors believed the two-walled sheet of membrane, which lines the abdominal cavity, was a disjointed series of tissues spread throughout the area and not connected together.It wasn\u2019t until J. Calvin Coffey, a surgeon at the University of Limerick, began looking more closely at the mesentery that he found it was in fact one continuous ribbon of tissue, documented in several studies in 2012 and 2014. Coffey has continued his work examining the mesentery more closely, coming to the conclusion that it is indeed an organ, laying out his reasons in a recent edition of the medical journal The Lancet.A new study from researchers at the University Hospital Limerick reveals that the mesentery is actually one single band of tissue, beginning at the pancreas and continuing down through the small intestine and colon, wrapping around these vital organs to hold them tight and help them maintain their structure. It is made of a folded-over ribbon of peritoneum, a type of tissue usually found lining the abdominal cavity.\u201cWithout it you can\u2019t live,\u201d says J. Calvin Coffey, a Limerick University Hospital researcher and colorectal surgeon. \u201cThere are no reported instances of a Homo sapien living without a mesentery.\u201dIt was by peeling away the peritoneum and repeated observations that Coffey built his case for the mesentery. In 2012, Coffey\u2019s team determined the mesentery was indeed a single, connected structure. In this most recent study, published in The Lancet, Coffey\u2019s team outlines evidence collected over four years that it says affirms the mesentery\u2019s organ status. The mesentery is highly integrated with the intestine, he says, and is located in an area of the human body that has not been fully explored \u2014 we still, apparently, contain new frontiers.And, according to The Independent, the seminal medical textbook Gray\u2019s Anatomy was updated in 2015 to include the new definition of the mesentery. However, Coffey isn\u2019t exactly sure when an organ is officially an organ.\u201cThat\u2019s a fascinating question. I actually don\u2019t know who the final arbiter of that is,\u201d says Coffey.In apes and other creatures that walk on all fours, he says that the structure of the mesentery, and the organs it supports, is slightly different, which affects the layout of their guts. Understanding how and why our digestive system is arranged the way it is could be crucial to our understanding of diseases like Crohn\u2019s and irritable bowel syndrome.\u201cThere are a lot of disease that we are stalled on, and we need to refresh our approach to these diseases,\u201d Coffey says. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve clarified its structure, we can systematically examine it. We\u2019re at a very exciting place right now.\u201dThe era of mesenteric science has taken a new turn.The Mesentery: The Human Body's 79th Organ? - D-brief Meet Your Newest Organ: The Mesentery The Mesentery: The Human Body's 79th Organ? - D-bri ",
