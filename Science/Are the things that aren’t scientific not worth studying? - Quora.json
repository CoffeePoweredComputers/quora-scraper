            "answer_text": " No, everything else has a great importance. Imagine that one-day music, songs, movies, TV series, TVs, games, theater, books, etc. just disappear from the world, and nothing replaces it. If this happens, it'll drive people crazy. I know I'd go crazy within a week of no songs. Evolution has made humans crave for some sort of entertainment. Though some people can live just with their work and no entertainment, they are negligible. All others need some kind of entertainment. I bet you come under latter too. Keeping that point aside, everything is worth studying because everything is science. Think about it...we can apply science to everything. People\u2019s belief and religion, culture, etc...something great for sociology and psychology research. Almost everything that doesn't fall under natural sciences is an excellent resource for social sciences. You indirectly need to know some physics to play an instrument. And the list goes on...everything is science.   You may think that everything is not worth studying, but that might just be because you love sciences...everything else is quite important. ",
