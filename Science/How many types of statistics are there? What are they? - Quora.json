Descriptive statistics are first used to organise and present collected data into a coherent form that can be further analysed through inferential statistics. Examples of descriptive statistics include: MeanMedianVarianceStandard DeviationCorrelation CoefficientInferential statistics are used to draw conclusions from descriptive statistics, and make predictions or assumptions about the entire population from which the data were sampled. Examples include (from simple to complex): Student\u2019s T-testRegression analysisAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA)Statistical Equation Modelling (SEM)",
