            "answer_text": " There are estimates at a per-episode average cost of around $250,000. There's no one source that says, and it's noted that they avoid discussing production costs.  Considering the variances of costs for materials, it could range from $100K to $350K What is the budget for the Mythbusters per episode? The budgets range all over the place. Strapping a rocket to a car can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and training goldfish costs a couple hundred, says Adam Savage.Taken from this 2011 interview of the stars of Discovery Channel\u2019s hit show \"Mythbusters\", we found some figures that might be still very helpful to answer this question now.Adam and fellow mythbuster Jamie Hyneman said that the budget for materials per episode is $5,000-$10,000, the materials range, depending on the episode, from $150 all the way up to the rocket car at $100,000 and that because of Jamie\u2019s Hollywood shop experience they usually find the cheapest way to do it.source: What is the budget for the Mythbusters per episode?
