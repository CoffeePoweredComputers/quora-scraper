            "answer_text": "Lets start from basics, what is gravity then will share the the calculation how it works:\ud83d\ude42 Gravity definition: the force that attracts a body towards the centre of the earth, or towards any other physical body having mass. Gravitational force: The gravitational force between two objects can be calculated by using the formula:  F= G (M1 * M2)/ r^2 Where F = Force of gravity/Gravitational Force G = Gravitational Constant. The value of G is always 6.673\u00d710-11 N m2 kg-2 M1 = Mass of first object M2 = Mass of second object r = distance between the centres of two objects Let's find the earth is not having gravity like moon with Calculation: g : Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of earth. G: acceleration due to gravity on the surface of moon. We all know this g = 9.8 m/s^2 - - - - \u2014(1equation) G=1.63 m/s^2 - - - - \u2014(2 equation) Dividing (1equation)by (2 equation) g/G=9.8 /1.63 g = 6.01 G We had learned earlier that force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass of the objects. When you compare the earth\u2019s mass with respect to the moon\u2019s mass, you will find that the earth has a far greater mass. Thus, the earth has greater gravitational pull compared to the moon.

            "answer_text": "A body has surface gravity is proportional to its mass, but inversely proportional to the square of its radius. The Moon is far less massive than Earth.The diameter of the Moon is 2,160 miles (3,476 km) where the Earth has diameter of 12,742 km.The Moon's mass is about one-eightieth of the Earth's mass.As the force of gravity at the surface of an object is the result of it's mass and size, the surface gravity of the Moon is only one-sixth that of the Earth.That\u2019s why the Earth is not having the gravity like Moon.
