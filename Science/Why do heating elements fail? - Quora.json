            "answer_text": "There are many different types of heater elements and some are extremely reliable. Different types of elements also fail due to different things so I\u2019ll keep it general. Firstly, most elements consist of a filament within an insulator within some sort of protective shealth. If you think of a light bulb this is the filament within the gas within the glass. On water heaters this is a heating coil within an insulator (Usually ceramic ) within a conductive outer (Usually a stainless steel tube). A grill element is constructed in a very similar way. They fail due to: Vibration, excessive voltage, control failure and breakdown of the outer casing. Elements in water can corrode and overheat if the water isn\u2019t there or has a buildup of minerals like calcium. A grill element fails if cleaner or foodstuff corrodes through the outer casing or if it overheats due to excessive voltage or a faulty control. Inevitably almost all appliance heater elements fail because they have to work in a humid environment and cope with such a large temperature range. The dissimilar materials that the elements are made from also expand and contract at slightly different speeds so the element will slowly degenerate as it is used. Not too scientific but I hope that that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "easiest way to think about it is that heating elements usually use metals with appreciable resistivity to conduct electricity and heat up (e.g. nichrome). These metals usually are prone to oxidize (with oxygen around). The fact that they (purposely) get hot, make them oxidize faster. Then, like rust, they are no longer as springy-flexible as when they are pure unoxidized metal. In addition, they will conduct more poorly (resistance goes up). It will become cyclic as a patch of oxidized metal will get even hotter than the surrounding element, due to higher resistance, which will cause it to oxidize even faster, which will make it even hotter, etc. Finally it will break, being also very brittle and not tolerant of temperature-change flexing.
