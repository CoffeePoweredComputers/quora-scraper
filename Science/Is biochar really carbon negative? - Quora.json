            "answer_text": "Yes, biochar is carbon negative. However, it is too small a mitigation strategy by itself without reductions in fossil fuel use. There is a way to multiply the effect through. That is by tieing the LCP to biochar. This could be large enough to mitigate AGW with far more reasonable reductions in fossil fuel use. The reason this can work is the biochar isn\u2019t seen as the primary carbon sink into the soil, but rather as a jump start creating habitat for microbiology which continues to pump large quantities of carbon into the soil basically indefinitely. The two together if practiced world wide and a much more reasonable 35% reduction in fossil fuel use could potentially get us to a CO2 drawdown scenario. How rapidly the drawdown would happen though is pretty uncertain due to many stabilizing feedbacks kicking in. For example, right now the oceans absorb about ~ 1/2 of emissions. But should we get to negative emissions, the oceans would likely switch from a sink to a source and put back a % of what it absorbed before. What those %\u2019s would be and at what rate is still pretty uncertain. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can make biochar from renewable sources, and use the waste energy to do something useful (e.g. heat a school) that may otherwise have been done with fossil fuels.  Then you have a product (biochar) with a known carbon content that you can use to remediate polluted soils, and/or add to soils with low carbon (improving nitrogen retention) and the biochar breaks down much more slowly in soil that the renewable source you started from. In fertile soils, the biochar doesn't stimulate a lot of plant growth, but in poor soils, you can see a big improvement.  For example, we can use biochar to remediate main tailings (with cowstomp) and those soils become fertile enough to grow grasses and trees again. So we've improved our soils, increased our soil fertility, grown some trees, and there's still some extra charcoal in the soil, in longer term storage if you will. Plus, the total cost for this type of project is much smaller than a conventional remediation project that does the same thing, so you also save money. ",
