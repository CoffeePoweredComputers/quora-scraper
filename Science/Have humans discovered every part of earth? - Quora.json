            "answer_text": "No, earth is still an alien planet and there is much to be discovered. 1. Earth\u2019s mysterious underground superocean. We\u2019ve only explored about 0.4% of the Earth\u2019s total mass. It might turn out to be the mostinteresting 0.4%, but the fact remains that almost everything wemight ever find on Earth is underneath us. For all of human history, Earth\u2019s explorers have been\u2014quite literally\u2014just scratching the surface. And this may actually turn out to mean that we\u2019ve never been anywhere near Earth\u2019s largest ecosystems. Geologists are increasingly certain that a massive ocean (or \u201chydrous mantle transition zone\u201d), larger than all of Earth\u2019s surface water combined, lies underneath us. It\u2019s not at all unrealistic that this superocean might contain life; evenintelligent life isn\u2019t completely beyond the realm of possibility. We\u2019re talking about what may be a completely unexplored underground ecosystem, larger than the oceans of Europa and Enceladus combined, on a planet that wealready know to be habitable. What\u2019s not to love? The trouble is that in some respects it\u2019s actually much easier to travel through 390 million miles of space than it is to travel through six miles of solid rock. Over the next ten years, the JapaneseChiky\u00fcvessel will allow humans to directly access Earth\u2019s upper mantle for the first time\u2014by digging through the ocean floor to get to it\u2014and thatmay give us evidence of life under the crust. Or it may not. Either way, this will only be the first step in the very long process of exploring the 99.6% of Earththat is as alien to us as the surface of any new world. 2. The upper atmosphere. September 2013, British molecular biologist Milton Wainwright flew a high-altitude balloon over England and found something he didn\u2019t expect to see: algae floating 17 miles above Earth\u2019s surface. We\u2019re not sure how it got there, and until we have a solid theory we have no reason to assume that these algae are the only life forms we\u2019ll find in the skies of Earth. 3. The ocean floor. A commonly-cited (and accurate) statistic that less than 5%of the ocean\u2019s floor has been explored. There are two ways to read this figure: one is to look at the ocean as if it\u2019s an aquarium, and to say that we\u2019ve neglected the floor because everything interesting is swimming around inside it above the surface. But the other is to look at the ocean floor as if it were land, which it is, and realize that we still haven\u2019t mapped over 95% of it. If we\u2019d only mapped 5% of a continent, how well-explored would we say it is?Dry land only makes up 29% of Earth\u2019s terrain; the rest of the surface is hidden from us by massive amounts of water. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find at the deepest depths, though what we\u2019ve already seen suggests that a lot of it is going to bereally freaking weird. 4. The frozen world. Global climate change has thawed outfresh mammoths,living megaviruses, and the mummified bodies of World War I soldiers. As this process continues, we\u2019ll no doubt discover new forms of life\u2014and veryold forms of life\u2014buried, and preserved, underneath the ice. (That\u2019s assuming the same warming process doesn\u2019t kill us first, of course.) Studying these ancient, well-preserved remains before they decay is going to pose a challenge for scientists. 5. Our own bodies. In a very real sense, each of us is a walking planet full of diverse microbial ecosystems of unimaginable complexity. And there are more than seven billion of us.We\u2019ve long known that we\u2019re full of bacteria (collectively, the amount of bacteria in your body weighs about as much as your head), and the Human Microbiome Project has made strides towards cataloguing them. But now, scientists have uncovered evidence suggesting that there\u2019s an undiscovered microbial ecosystem that includes bacteria-eating viruses that feed on our bacterial flora, and there\u2019s no reason to believe that this is the last microbial surprise our bodies hold.While we\u2019re working to discover evidenceof past microbes on Mars, we\u2019re still discovering new things about the microbes that live in our pores and between our teeth. While we\u2019re looking to explore the oceans of Enceladus and Europa, we\u2019ve only just begun to explore the oceans of Earth\u2019s crust\u2014and we haven\u2019t even touched the ocean of Earth\u2019s mantle. And while we explore the skies of exoplanets for atmospheric biosignatures, our own atmosphere contains life that remains, on the whole,mysterious to us. It\u2019s an exciting time tobe an astronomer, without question\u2014butit\u2019s also an exciting time to study the largely alien planet that produced us, and to meet the creatures who share it with us. For all of our advances in mapping this planet and cataloguing what we find on it, there\u2019s still a great deal of exploring left to do. ",

            "answer_text": "There are still some places on Earth that have not been explored much by people. The ocean is one of these places. It covers more than 70% of Earth's surface, and it contains many types of ecosystems. We know a lot about some of these ecosystems, like the mangrove and kelp forests that surround our coastlines, and the polar seas at the North and South Poles. But we still have much to learn about remote and mysterious places like the deep sea. The technology we use to explore the ocean continues to get better and better. People can now send robotic Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to dive deep into the ocean. Scientists operate the \"robot\" from a ship on the ocean surface. At the seafloor, the ROV can take pictures and videos, and even use a robotic arm to collect water and rock samples.  A Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) explores the seafloor. The ROV brings back valuable information that scientists can use to help protect and conserve marine organisms and habitats. For example, in 2006, scientists sent an ROV deep into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington State. They were able to learn more about deep-sea corals and sponges that can be easily damaged by commercial fishing equipment.  An ROV took these pictures of deep-sea corals and fish. Unlike the oceans, almost every place on land has been visited by people. By using new technology, scientists can now learn more about remote places that are difficult for us to travel to, such as areas that are very cold, very wet, very dry, or very high. In some of these places, scientists are also discovering new species! For example, in 1992, a new mammal species called the saola was discovered in the thick forests of Vietnam. (And some new species are even found in familiar places. In 2002, researchers found a new species of centipede living in the leaf litter in Central Park, New York City.) As we document and learn about plant and animal species around the world, we can help understand how they live and how we can best protect them. ",
