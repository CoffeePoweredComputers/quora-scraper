            "answer_text": "A darker complexion is a precious gift of God. I have seen people carrying this complexion with full confidence example Carol, she is a supermodel and of course how can we forget Rihanna. Though I understand that choosing unique colours of clothes becomes tedious for such complexion. I would suggest you colours like: White: yes a wheatish complexed person wearing white would seem like a glowing tubelight but on a dark complexion it would be soothing and eye-catching. ( A white upper along with blue denim would be perfect)Peach: not actually light pink but peach again would win the red carpet.Mustard: would definitely be the best of all.Grey: not so white and not so black. The perfect call.Here is a sample portray of the colours that I suggested:     Hope these examples and colours were helpful! Let know if it helped. Cheers to the good life! :) ",
