Are colliders the only way to split atoms?\u201d \u201cSplit atoms\u201d is an archaic expression that isn\u2019t much used today because it\u2019s ambiguous. It could mean fissioning a nucleus. What happens then is the creation of \u201cfission products,\u201d lighter atoms that share the mass of the original. You can also fission atoms in a nuclear reactor, and it even happens spontaneously. Colliders operate at a much higher energy scale. They put a lot of kinetic energy into particles such as protons, which converts into exotic, short-lived particles. ",

            "answer_text": "What you mean by splitting atoms ? It is relatively trivial to split atoms into electrons and nuclei which corresponds to the matter plasma state. Colliders are used for high energy collisions of elementary particles and also of nuclei , like in case of the LHC. At sufficiently high collision energies nuclei may be completely destroyed and even composing them nucleons melt sometimes into quarks and gluons. Heavy ions and quark-gluon plasma Details of such high energy nuclei collisions depends on their centrality which determines number of nucleons participating in this violent event. ",
