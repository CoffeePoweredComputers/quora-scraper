            "answer_text": "Ooh, about a 7. 8 on a good day. Unless it's hiding secrets from us, in which case a 3. I don't know how to begin to answer your question. We know an enormous amount about DNA - I'm tempted to say we know all about DNA, in the same way we know all the letters of the alphabet. But that doesn't mean we understand how language works, or that we understand everything ever written. We know how DNA works chemically, pretty much to the last detail. But we are only beginning to understand what natural processes are DOING with DNA and how the interactions between gene products and genes work. We've decoded the genome and know what about 90% of it codes for. But that's not really the same as \"understanding\" it. If I show you the plans for a violin, you can see how one is built - but you'd have to be amazing to extrapolate that to music (if you'd never known of music before) and those violin plans don't contain any violin music, despite being essential to its creation. In terms of DNA - we understand the violin plans and can see what most of them are for. Some bits we're not sure of - how important is the shape of that funny hole? The plans say the pegs are black - is that important? - and we're beginning to see how it contributes to making a sound. But how that sound links in to orchestras is something we're still grasping towards and it's going to be a long time before we write our own symphonies. ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard to say how much we know about it, but it's safe to assume that the current model of the DNA i.e., the double-helical model which was proposed which was proposed by Watson and Crick is the most accurate. This, we can confirm because the effect of the discovery of DNA on scientific and medical research has been enormous. Whether it involves the identification of our genes that trigger major diseases or the creation and manufacture of drugs to treat these devastating diseases. We have also paved the pathway to formulate brand new drugs to treat diseases. In fact, drugs can essentially be custom made to complement a person's personal biochemistry and genetic makeup. For those diseases that were previously considered lethal and where treatment was either non-existent or largely unsuccessful, the discovery of DNA has essentially led to breakthrough drugs and treatments for patients with serious illnesses.
