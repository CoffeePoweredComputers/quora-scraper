Being a computer engineering student u know not all subjects are good enough with you practical knowledge and aptitude .. some subjects are there which you can't avoid but remember to at least get passed :-) Some theory subjects are very interesting to learn .. you can grasp the concept so that you don't have to remember everything. Its good for you too as you know the concept, it will help you. Some subjects are there which are very hard to crack .. for them best way is go for suggestion, look for last 3-4 years of questions and make probable note. ",

            "answer_text": "haha! good question. I am sure each and every one has his/her own hack or strategy to it. Let me tell you what I did.  During semester breaks, I would check the syllabus and buy the prescribed book of such theoretical subjects. I used to read those text books like novels once during my holidays before the actual semester started.  It helped me when the teacher actually taught the subject in class, I could easily relate to what I read earlier. Also the second time understood the subject better. ",
