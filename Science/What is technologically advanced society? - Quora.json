            "answer_text": "This answer will forever be out of date. For every advancement we make, it extends a step. But what really sends it flying out of control is imagination. Science fiction or especially fantasy writing or art can truly explode our ideas of what society could become off the page and into reality. Once we dreamed of flying like birds and worshiped angelic beings who could. What do people dream of doing today? It\u2019s hard to find the time. Back then we spent months working hard labor or waiting for the fruits of said labors to sprout and grow, or tracking animals for days on end. It allowed so much boredom and imagination flourished. Today we have more inspiration than ever before, and a way to show it to everyone in the blink of an eye! But people are rarely bored, and thus there is a glass ceiling on creativity in that we are constantly working, sleeping or online doing other things. Very few individuals actually dedicate time purely to creation, such as artists and writers on Quora here. As for your question, I could dream of a world where inspired creation flowed like wind and stirred hearts like flowers blooming in the spring, and maybe this is such a place. So I\u2019m going to assume you meant what our society would look like as it advanced, rather than meeting a purely advanced society out of the blue, since that could look like absolutely anything you could imagine, and I certainly dare you to imagine one that has never existed before, it\u2019s easier and more fun than you might think. The hard part is sharing it, but that\u2019s what makes it worthwhile. Now let\u2019s list some ways. We could define advancement by the ability to cognize and solve problems as we see them, and artificial intelligence provides that niche for us nicely. It can eventually self-improve but would be difficult to evolve out of control as the fear of that potential has been built into every other movie and futuristic dystopia written to date, thus we have researched ways of growing ourselves with omnibeneficiality along with AI so that we remain at the same level, rather than becoming parasitic bits of a godlike machine. It is as we advance together that we hold the potential to advance far more than either flesh or circuit alone.Note how so many people focus on technology, when a truly \u201cadvanced\u201d society would not need technology. They would be perfectly moral, so that no harm would need to be done because everything needed is provided to all who need it, within reason of course. Technology only facilitates speed, for the most part at our current level. We already could have as much food and entertainment as we wanted playing games in the jungles with animals as companions. Why do I bring this up? Because a truly advanced society would know the difference between making technology that makes things slightly easier and truly transformative technologies such as the ones coming up.Our physical bodies are the most advanced machines ever known, nothing else even begins to remotely compare in our history. We self-repair, learn, self-replicate and everything else you might need. I am sure you could think of many other needs or fun things we could do, and you will find them in plants and animals in nature. We are all composed of exactly the same biological technology, namely DNA that is perfectly compatible for splicing virtually any combination you could imagine. Want to not age, be stronger, regenerate limbs, resist more diseases, breathe underwater or fly? It\u2019s all there, but would require additional mastery of biological technologies to adjust for remixing various aspects just like you can\u2019t remix by simply playing two songs at once. It would sound terrible. You have to select for certain aspects, add new background supports, and more to make a good sounding track. The same is true for what is inevitably our mastery of biological tech that we already have. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that, seeing as some other advanced technologies do not even exist here yet. So let\u2019s focus on perfecting ourselves before we look elsewhere.Honestly I\u2019d be pretty happy with fluid customizable intelligences and meta-biology portfolios to mutate on demand, but we could also remix these into the quantum realm. Imagine if the very fabric of the universe contained consciousness, physical manifestation and influence over physical structures? That\u2019d be a truly advanced technology, but really just requires a simple awareness of the quantum nature of matter itself for a moment to alter your own nature to incorporate that editor. Personally I would continue to perfect that quantum editor as I explored the multiverse as a quantum dimensional consciousness but that\u2019s up to you. Does that sound like a soul? It should.I could go on, but once you have the ability to adjust your intelligence, consciousness, and manifest whatever tech or body you might want at will, it sure sounds like the end game. But that\u2019s just the beginning. These are the basic tools one uses to create and discover of your own volition, but what would you do with them? What would you become?",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. What is technologically advanced society? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a really simple answer to this question. Not all technology results in social advancement. Although fictional, I would refer you to the different social constructs demonstrated in the Star Trek franchise. Earth is a member of the United Federation of Planets and seems to have grown up from savage tribal competition and offensive war. Both the Klingons and Romulans have some technologies that are superior to those in Star Fleet, but they are still depicted as relatively savage and conquest-oriented. The Cardassians aren\u2019t particularly fussed on whom they conquer, and in Ensigns of Command, Data is forced to evacuate a colony of 15,000 humans before the Sheliak just barge in with their own terraform equipment with no consideration for the lives that are already there\u2014it\u2019s our planet. We want it. It is our own personal judgement as to how advanced a society is, and we must include some form of morality in that judgement. Yes, these potential invaders have a morality of that is incompatible with ours, but which is the best one to enhance everyone\u2019s survival? Even Q was eventually revealed to be operating on some level of morality that we were never going to understand. Just because a group is overloaded with technological development doesn\u2019t mean that it is an advanced society. As we venture out into the great beyond we may find species that use very little technology, but can be considered to be far more advanced than our own. ",
