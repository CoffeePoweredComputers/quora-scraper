            "answer_text": "Q. What are the arguments against fracking? A. There are several arguments against fracking, here they are in my opinion the most likely to be effective to least likely. It is expensive, as compared to several other ways to get fossil fuels out of the ground the costs and technology involved in fracking (although it has been around about 100 years as an applied concept) are higher.It requires lots of water, that ends up polluted afterwards.Its \u2018wells\u2019 tend to go \u2018dry\u2019, or peak at least, faster than most other forms of pulling out fossil fuels.The fossil fuels it provides tends to be slightly less \u2018sweet\u2019 than other sources - probably due to the water used in the process.Because it peaks so quickly, and is less \u2018sweet\u2019 the profit margin on making a permanent infrastructure to a well just isn't there, instead trucks and trains are used to ship the oil to the nearest pipeline, further increasing the chances of a serious spill incident and attendant pollution.Those are some of the better arguments against fracking IMHO. Mind you, if the price of oil gets high enough fracking will be profitable enough for starting another \u2018boom\u2019 cycle. Which will go bust again when the demand falls again. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no valid arguments against hydraulic fracturing. The technology begin in the 1860\u2019s and innovations have been almost continuous since. As with all of the surface n subsurface activities in the US, problems have occurred and, over time, been remedied. altogether, here\u2019s the scoop. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE DOCUMENTED CASE OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION IN THE HISTORY OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING. But.... but... but what about those flaming faucets? Sorry to bust your bubble but those flaming faucets were there long before any wells were drilled and fractured in the neighborhood. But what about the registered contamination in the Marcellus? None of it came from frac jobs, those were surface spills. Yeah, they were screwups but not from a frac. And Pavilion Wyo? Most likely from a faulty cement job near surface. It\u2019s happened before and a certain few operators take shortcuts which lead to those kinds of situations. Then they get fined and possible barred from drilling if the infractions are too severe or too often. Any hydraulic fracturing operation properly designed and performed cannot cause contamination in a water reservoir 5000 feet or more above it. Physics just doesn\u2019t allow it to happen. ",

            "answer_text": "One fear, which I think is probably overblown, is that fracking causes earthquakes. Most fracking takes place at around 3000 feet or so deep, less than a mile down. Earthquakes can occur down to 25 miles or more and are a whole lot bigger in mass than any man-made fracking operation. ",

In addition, fracking has been known to cause seismic disturbances and contamination of groundwater. Future investments in energy development should be directed to renewable sources, not fossil fuels. ",
