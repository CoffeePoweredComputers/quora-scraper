            "answer_text": "All metal detectors do the same thing: they detect metal. That said, yes, they do detect gold, but they all detect a lot of metallic garbage, too. The difference between a $50 detector and a $5000 detector is in the type of system it uses, sensitivity or lack of, ground balance ability, discrimination, ability to block out electrical interference, ability to block interference of extreme mineralization in the ground, or salt water, depth, etc. A metal detector takes a while to learn to use properly. Nearly everyone gets frustrated at first with a new untried machine, but over time it becomes second nature. The operator has a world of things to take into consideration, like differences in sound tones, digital readouts (if the machine has that), when and how to use different size coils, and a host of others. You have to learn its \u201clanguage\u201d, and then you can do almost miraculous things with most any detector. Any detector will find gold, but maybe not the small flakes you will most like encounter in streams and washes. Older detectors will find gold as well as new ones, but again probably not with the same sensitivity. I had on old BFO machine once, one of the first commercial detectors based on the WWII mine detectors. It made an awful noise and screamed at ANYTHING metallic in the ground. It was useless in parks, but I found it invaluable in the hills searching streams for black sand deposits, likely locations for placer gold. It was extremely sensitive to any ground differences. I saying this because you should not discount any detector until you know what it can do and how to do it. You don\u2019t need to spend a ton of money, but you do need to practice and be patient until you know what every beep and grunt means. An experienced detector operator will consistently find more good items in the ground with a $50 machine than a novice will with one costing $5000. Cost is not a real indicator of what can be found. Experience and patience are. ",
