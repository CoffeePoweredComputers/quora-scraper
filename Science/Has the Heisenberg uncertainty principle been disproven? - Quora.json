            "answer_text": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle has never been successfully disproven, but there has been one and only one time that someone has tried to disprove the uncertainty principle. This was EPR. In the EPR paper, the authors (mainly Podolsky) came up with a thought experiment to measure position and momentum. They showed that quantum entanglement allowed for a violation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle[1]because a value could be determined for both position and momentum. In other words, quantum mechanics was an incomplete description of reality. Bohr rejected this argument because once a value was measured for either position or momentum, it could not be measured for the other[2]. The particle being measured had already been tampered with by making a measurement, so you could not measure the original value for the other variable. The EPR argument is the only time that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle has been disproven by a theory, although the EPR argument is completely wrong, and wasn\u2019t even the reasoning Einstein had against entanglement. There have been no other theories that have proved against the uncertainty principle. Sources: Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not wrong, but in Quantum Field Theory (my favorite theory) it has a different interpretation than the original one - an interpretation that makes sense. Here\u2019s how I explain it in my book \u201cFields of Color\u201d, which explains QFT to a lay audience. (You can \u201cLook Inside\u201d here.) The probabilistic interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation eventually led to the uncertainty principle of QM, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This principle states that the exact position of a particle cannot be determined, but the uncertainty in position is related to the uncertainty in its momentum. So not only do we have wave-particle duality to deal with, we have to deal with particles that might be here or might be there, but we can\u2019t say where. If the electron is really a particle, then it stands to reason that it must be somewhere. Resolution. In QFT there are no particles (stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before) and hence no position, certain or uncertain. Instead there are blobs of field spread out over space. Instead of a particle that is either here or here or possibly there, we have a field that is here and here and there. Spreading out is something that only a field can do; a particle can\u2019t do it. In fact, there is a property of fields called Fourier\u2019s theorem that relates the spatial spread of a field to the spread of its wavelengths. Now in QFT the wavelength of a quantum is related to its momentum, so Fourier\u2019s theorem is equivalent to the relationship between position and momentum in the Uncertainty Principle. I still remember my moment of insight in graduate school when I realized that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is nothing more than Fourier\u2019s theorem. ",

            "answer_text": "To argue a principle is wrong, you have to falsify it by showing evidence that it is cannot be correct. There is no such evidence. It is also possible that a principle could be correct, but the way it is presented in misleading. In terms of the Uncertainty Principle, in my ebook \u201cGuidance Waves\u201d I show how to derive it, but obtain an answer that is a little more uncertain than most, the product of the uncertainties being h. Who is correct? To determine that, you would have to do an experiment where you could absolutely demonstrate that the data points lay between the two predictions. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Why do you ask? The Uncertainty Principle is at the heart of Quantum Physics, and so, if it were disproved, the entire theory would become unhinged, which isn\u2019t the case. In fact, as experimental science becomes more advanced, it has been able to prove some of the bizarre predictions of Quantum Physics such as Quantum entanglement. ",

From there we can surely work out the speed and displacement of both particles (relative to each other) therefore disproving heisenvergs uncertainty principal??  ",
