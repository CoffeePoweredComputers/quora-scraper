            "answer_text": "What's the big deal? We won't get a lot of chances - if we get something like this wrong. The potential impact of various mining practices on many aspects of our daily lives is pretty credible.  I'd like to weigh in based on what I've read and heard- if I may be so bold - because I haven't heard anyone give an answer that raises some of the most troubling issues in hydraulic fracturing practices that scientists, entrepreneurs and policy experts are studying and trying to grapple with- for all our sakes. Many experts are keeping a watchful eye out - so we can learn about and, if need be, address the full impact of hydraulic fracturing over time.  There's a saying that goes : \" If you can't see a problem, you'll never solve it\". Do the other people weighing in here really believe that the problems have all been refuted? I don't see evidence of that.  America is a very safe place to live... Our food and water is tested for some things (not all) and many of us don't have to rely on bottled water - the way others do in far off countries.  However- in some counties in California and elsewhere- this is no longer true. Our water, soil and air quality have eroded and the worsening problems here have received a great deal of international attention from people in many industries and organizations. We have looming public health, quality of life, natural resources management and prosperity problems for farmers and other citizens. While we may not have definitive answers yet- the jury is still out on the potential damage posed by hydraulic fracturing, including: public health problems in food, water and air- along with risks posed by geological changes. Finally- we are looking at serious natural resource waste and management problems:   We may be creating cavities deep within the earth that could collapse with dramatic consequences when we don't refill the space. We are already preparing for major disasters in California, for example, because we have so many natural earthquake fault lines. We know that petroleum contains dangerous carcinogens that reduce water quality and pose significant public health risks when it's not managed well and kept out of the water supply. Once we have a problem spill - we don't know how to quickly manage that contamination- as we're seeing in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. [I don't know why we can't do a better job of using sensors on our oil pipes.] Oil leaks do shut down municipal water systems on occasion - all over the country. They have huge ongoing problems in West Virginia, for example. We (our communities, politicians and the world of science) are still learning about the possible cancer causing effects of petroleum by oil contaminants in soil and plants. I think the health risks in our agricultural products are still being examined. Policy experts have raised good, ethical questions about the waste of natural resources in hydraulic fracturing. By this, I mean that we have to take a step back and ask if it's worth the risk to our community in the long run - if we are inefficiently using one disappearing natural resource (water) to excavate another (oil) - when viable, though arguably less profitable, energy solutions exist. We have are endless supplies of solar power and biomass in California - for example.Americans see, study and solve problems with ingenuity.  I only want to stress that, from what I've read, we're not absolutely sure about all our risks, options and decisions as a community. We have so many options- so many rapidly advancing technologies because we're smart and capable of using what we know to solve problems.   Electric carsSolar energyEnergy storage technologiesBiomass / biogas convertersWind energy convertersWave energy convertersWater energy convertersWater reuse and purification technologiesDesalinization technologiesSensor technologies for problem detectionSatellite, robot and drone imaging technologiesSmart building constructionMicrowave decontamination technologiesOrganic soil enriching capabilitiesSmart watering technologies....the list goes onYes- we have a few looming problems- especially in places like California. But we have some of the smartest, most philanthropic, entrepreneurial, creative and risk tolerant people in the world at our disposal. If we can take the perspective that questions have been raised by the research that may help all of us to understand our smart choices and innovative next steps- we will keep our country strong . Can we combine economic prosperity with long and healthy lives in our great country? Why not? But we have to look at the problems that exist...and tap all our impressive scientific innovation. ",

            "answer_text": "The same as the environmental effects of iron mining or making solar PV panels or importing sneakers.  Using a technique, hydraulic fracturing in this case, makes it easier to extract resources to use.  The fact that the resource is oil and natural gas is what gets people upset, because they think we shouldn't use hydrocarbons to power our economy.  The problem is that we are really not ready to switch over to solar and wind full time right now.  The resources just don't exist yet, and probably won't for the next fifteen years or so.  That is why natural gas is referred to as a \"bridge fuel.\"  It helps us to bridge the energy gap between really dirty oil and coal, and less dirty solar. Using natural gas still releases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides into the atmosphere, but so too does the manufacturing and mass marketing of solar panels.  Nothing that humans do on this planet is benign.  Some people believe that because of the environmental momentum of too much CO2 in the atmosphere, climate change at this point cannot be reversed in our lifetimes.  The change will go on no matter what we do.  That doesn't mean we should give up.  It just means that we should try a little harder to slow down our consumption of \"stuff\" and try to live with what we have.  When things do get really bad, we may need all we have. ",

            "answer_text": "fracking is causing methane gas and other chemicals arise from the earths core. Relying on shale oil as a natural gas is exposing these chemicals in peoples water and we are some people who are around these gas lines can light theyre hose water on fire! Also, methane is being released carelessly into the atmosphere melting the poles and contaminating water. Areas are being flooded. Because of this climate change. At this rate. Earth has 20 years. But research has found out that we have enough wind power to generate energy for the earth just as long as shale oil.   ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, nothing. Fracking uses a small quantity of water, often non potable formation water. Of course, there is the possibility of something going wrong, but that possibility exists with every step required in the drilling of a well. In the US, the exploration industry has a remarkably good record of environmental and human safety. ",
