            "answer_text": "I can share a bit of a personal story here. I had absolutely no interest in mathematics and I pretty much hated it from the bottom of my heart when for the first time I sat through a course based on I.N.Herstein's abstract algebra.  I don't think I can call myself a \"mathematician\" but today I use quite a bit of it for my research - as you can see from my list of research interests. I can always brag about having gotten a A in a graduate course in UIUC on Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces :D What changed for me was this - I met an incredible mathematician who for some unknown queer reason liked me a lot. We struck a great friendship on \"Day 1\". In those days during the 2nd year of my undergrad, I was reading Einstein's gravity and this mathematician helped me learn topology and slowly took me into differential geometry and algebraic topology and so on and so forth.  He never kind of \"taught\" me but just kept exposing me to more and more exciting ideas and patiently answered every dumb question that I had to ask. Unlike many conventional mathematicians he never said, \"Unless you know this X you can't understand Y\".  On the contrary he said, \"Since today we have a microwave, you don't need to start from learning how to light a firewood.\"  I was 50 years younger to him then and he interacted with me as if I was his colleague! There was never a top-down feeling and that changed the dynamics! We could even crack jokes sitting in a coffee shop! (I never felt that I was talking to a legendary scientist of such international repute!)  Unlike all other mathematicians I knew he *never* discouraged me from asking questions about very advanced topics - even if I knew next to nothing about what I was curious about -  and instead he encouraged that! I had hardly learnt basic topology when I asked him about cohomology and he did find a way to motivate the idea from whatever little I knew then! This post is a tribute to the living legend and my undergraduate mentor and a life-long inspiration, Prof.S.Ramanan. S. RamananGlobal Calculus ",

            "answer_text": "https://www.khanacademy.org/ You can setup a free account at Khan Academy. Here you can study math from Kindergarten counting through Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. The website will get you through at least math needed for a computer science degree. There are many videos connected to Khan Academy that are hosted on YouTube and this avenue of study tracks your progress and gives you feed back. Inside the Academy there is even a community tutoring section. This allows you to either ask questions of people when you don\u2019t understand something, or share some knowledge with people when you do. And the best part, as I said, it is free and will not require buying too many textbooks, no textbooks are required actually. You can start on any subject and work on it, you can choose any grade level to test your knowledge and move forward, or you can find specific mathematical concepts and only practice those. This is a picture of the math I have worked on in my account. Just for fun I decided to work through every single math class to make sure I had seen and understood how to work all of the math problems from Kindergarten into Highschool, and soon I will start on finishing up Algebra and Trig and dig into Calculus and the later maths. *edit: Here is a sample video from Khan Academy on the Pythagorean Theorem, and there are videos like these for hundreds of topics across all the subjects listed below.  And this is an example of math problem on Khan Academy, and it will generate as many of these as you need to make sure you understand it.  All problems have 4 levels of rating, not practiced, level 1, level 2, and mastered. You can work these problems and watch videos and get hints and even ask the community until you understand it.  Other things to consider are working through books like Retracing Elementary Mathematics, which provide the needed number theory and proofs and logic primers to describe the real numbers through most of what is used in Algebra. This is very important since strictly speaking pure mathematicians are dealing with discovering new properties of numerical paradigms and then writing mathematical proofs to make their case and then submitting those proofs to peer review. A second reason why this kind of book is so important is that it builds in the mind the arguments and underlying structures use in mathematics, which enables you to solve more problems with greater ease because you have a better grasp of mathematical grammar, as it were.  You don\u2019t need to use these two resources I have listed, but it will cost you $50 bucks at most to get a copy of the number theory book I listed and then the math learning tools on Khan Academy are free. With Focus you could work your way through both of these by the time you started college, I am assuming you are a Junior in High School, and you will have what is needed for at least your first 2 years in college maths already finished with a good head start on a Bachelor's in math.
