            "answer_text": " This boy lived for 12 years in a plastic bubble. Born by caesarian section, he did not get to swallow normal bacteria so his gut remained sterile. He had a severe immunodeficiency and any bacteria that got to him could kill him. He died at age 12 from complications from a bone marrow transplant Incredible photos of Texan boy who lived 12 years in a bubble The fetal intestine, in the absence of congenital infection, is sterile in utero. The bacteria that come to colonize the bowel are acquired during birth and shortly afterwards, a process that is very much influenced by how a baby is born Unintended Consequences: Cesarean Section, The Gut Microbiota, and Child Health You can get germ free animals born and raised in similar conditions for research. Germ-free animal - Wikipedia So the answer is YES. Although since the gut microbiome has significant metabolic effects, animals including humans will be slightly different if they do not have gut bacteria or they have different gut bacteria. They will be more prone or less prone to certain diseases. The study of these differences is a relatively new field ",
