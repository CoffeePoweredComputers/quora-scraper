            "answer_text": "Q: How do I prove that I am a time traveller? You could start with taking well known people to the past or future and bringing them back with souvenirs, in front of an audience. I\u2019m sure the people you take would be amazed and not stop telling others about what happened. Second, you could learn about events of the upcoming year and then tell us about them before they happen. Maybe find events that are impossible for humans to alter, like volcano eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, snow storms, etc. and spell out the exact place and time they will occur. ",

When you\u2019re proven to be right thousands of times, people will begin to take your far-fetched claims seriously! But since you\u2019re from the future I\u2019m sure you would already know this.
