            "answer_text": "Yes.Not only is it possible, it has actually already happened. The person who invented the time machine was Xepsis Klerglemoss, and this is what it looked like from photos he left behind:  The machine itself did not actually go anywhere, it simply - in effect - vaporised the time traveler, and then unvaporised them in the appropriate time period. The machine could be controlled from wherever he was. From his diary notes we find that his first attempt was just to go back a year.The machine worked perfectly, except it only vaporised him but not his clothes, so he arrived naked except for metal objects.And it happened that his workshop had previously been a Victorian drapery, and was full of ladies at the time of his arrival.  Luckily he was able to vaporise himself quickly, but not before he was snapped by a photographer taking pictures of the shop\u2019s sales day.  This picture of him was used by the police in their hunt for the strange intruder.The unfortunate consequence of the incident was that the Draper\u2019s shop was boycotted by ladies thereafter, and had to close down.Some newspapers claimed that the shop had deliberately staged this event as it was trying to promote its special protective clothing for ladies. Mr Klerglemoss realized that going back in time had unintended consequences, and that his workshop was the consequence of his own action, as the drapers became bankrupt due to his action, and he had himself bought the premises cheaply for his experiments. It poses a rather complex paradox, and resulted in his deciding to abandon Time travel, and to destroy his equipment.His story is only known by a chance event in that he was in the process of moving to a new house, but had lost his keys. He decided to time travel back to the morning when he last had his keys, which he did, and found them.But on traveling back to the present time, the Moving men had shifted his wardrobe, and unluckily he arrived back in his locked wardrobe. He had dropped his \u2018Vaporiser\u2019 but there was not enough room for him to bend down and pick it up.The result was that he was discovered some time later, dead, and naked in his wardrobe, with no explanation of how he got there.It was reported in the local paper, and a journalist, out of curiosity, discovered what appears to be the above story, though his version of it was dismissed by the police. We might never know the full truth of the matter, but there is a lesson to be learned about tampering with Nature.

            "answer_text": "Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo. To answer this question, its best if tell you some of the time travel thought experiments I have thought of over my life, and it should give you an idea of what is possible, and what is not possible, if you have an actual time machine. If you have a time machine, you need to be able to lock up the time period you left from causality effects, effecting it. Imagine if the time machine you had could move things from the past, from the future. Move a quark out of place in an atom in a grain of sand, on a beach 1000 years ago. Something as little as this, is enough to change the whole history of the earth from that point on. If you watch videos on the grandfather paradox it is a misconception that you can have enough time to stand in front of him to pull the trigger, let alone have a conversation with him.  But how can you exist if you were always going to go back in time, and kill your grandfather? I believe that it can be set in stone that you will go back in time, and kill your grandfather, but you will not vanish from existence until you actually visit, and tear a hole in the space in the past. So there was one scenario where you existed in a timeline, then when you went back, and killed your grandfather, you created a whole new timeline where you do not exist. But there was always a timeline that once existed with you in it, that has vanished, and that is now gone. Click on the YouTube video (below) to see the mad scientist paradox.  So you cannot go back in time and get the winning lottery numbers, you cannot kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor attack, you cannot save JFK, or stop September 11th.  Another example is if you went back in time after the super bowl final, and moved this football in the field (above) out of place by a foot, this would completely change the score of the game from what the score was originally. You can only change these things if the time machine can lock up causality effects from the past you visited, so causality effects do not effect you, and so you can return to the future you came from without anything have changed. But the changes would never count in reality you came from, just the other dimension you went back into, and messed around in. If a machine can do something as amazing as recreate the past, then locking up causality should be no problem for the time machine to do. Maybe people from the future go into the past in the technique I described above, or have the technology to view the past from the future on a television monitor, without visiting the past in person, and causing causality effects. These are the only three ways I can think of that do not effect causality.  In the diagram above just imagine timeline 2 is the recreated past in another dimension, where anything you do, and change does not effect time line 1, the timeline where you came from. So after doing what you wanted to do in time line 2, you just go back into timeline 1, a second after you left to be safe, because the same matter cannot occupy the same space. Lets say for a minute we could reverse time.  As you reversed time backwards the time machine would have to split you into a kind of a other dimension (like in the picture above) because the same matter cannot occupy the same space, if this does not happen there could be a scenario where you meld with your older self in the past as you reverse into time in the past.  It would depend how your time machine works, but there could be a scenario like this in the picture (above) where Han Solo is melded into carbonite, where you meld with your previous self as you reverse into time in the past, because there is now two of you in the past, and you are occupying the same space. It would be a lot safer to reverse time backwards slowly, while adjusting your place in space as you reverse time. It would be dangerous also to vanish from the present, and re-appear in the past because of factors like the earth is in a different place in the past, from where you are in the present, and the same matter cannot occupy the same space. Or, imagine a room where time reverses, you would have to live in this room for a period of time so that there is information, or an event to reverse in the first place. So you stay in the room for lets say a year, then you push the button to reverse time, for exactly 1 year. So you would step out of the room, after a year of time reversing backwards, and you would have no memory of time reversing, so from your perspective you would step in the room, and step right back out of the room instantly, with no memory of being inside the room for a year, but 2 years have passed for you from your perspective. Imagine that in the image (below) is every moment in space, and each, and every moment in time, that has ever existed from the big bang.  Maybe it would be better to send a cubic area in space back in time rarther, than send the whole of space back in time.  Its also very spooky, and mysterious how electrons are able to get through a wall with enough momentum (like in the diagram below, click on the diagram to see the electron animation) maybe the electron is time traveling into the past to a place before the wall was up.   In another causality experiment I thought if its the interactions with people, and other things which cause causality, then what if you went back in time into a solid thick steel container, that was buried ten miles deep down in the in moons crust, it would be one mile thick in every direction up, down, left, right, forwards, and backwards. You MAY be able to subdue causality effects from going back in time. So if you go back in time into the container on the moon, it should not create any causality effects, because you do not interact with anything. Click on the picture (below) if it is too hard to read.  The ripple effects of causality have been subdued. There would be dampening systems in the container to stop your vibrations, but it may not be enough, and not work at all. Just interacting with the air molecules could be enough to cause causality, even the space in the container. Dark matter, and energy is still not understood, and time travel into the past into the steel container could have an effect on the way dark matter, and dark energy effect other objects, to maybe cause causality. In this thought experiment which really cannot be confirmed to be correct. Imagine a really long line of people, standing on a platform, stretching from earth to Pluto.   At there closest Pluto is 2.66 billion miles away from earth, it would take light just over four hours to get to Pluto. So the last person in this huge line of people would be standing on Pluto, if you placed a camera on the last person, at say 12:00pm, and recorded exactly what the person was doing, for say 1 minute. So if you went back in time to 11:55am, to the front of the line of people on earth, and you did something different, like say hello to the first person in the line. Would the ripple effects of causality travel through the whole line of people from earth to Pluto instantly? So at 12:00pm the last person in line who is standing on Pluto would the person be doing different things, than before in the 1 minute camera recording. If you you recorded the persons new actions on camera for a 1 minute would they be different, or exactly the same? You going back in time has sent ripple effects of causality through all those people, right up to the last person in the line, for the person to be doing what he was doing differently. The point is this is a instant change, in a straight race between the speed of light, and causality effects traveling through people, and other objects, from going back in time, are ripple effects of causality faster? So are ripple effects faster than light? Causality ripple effects are an invisible force, but they do have an effect on things. Things like dark matter, dark energy, air, gravity, and sound are all invisible but you can see the effects of them on things. So why are causality ripple effects no different, the change of what the last person in line was doing, after going back in time, is proof of a change, and an effect on something even though the force is invisible. So what's faster the speed of light, or ripple effects that travel through people from going back in time, and changing something? What do you think? In this next causality thought experiment it possibly proves that aliens never built a time machine, BUT it only proves they never did it from a certain time period, and if causality is a problem they cannot get around.  In this picture there is around 10, 000 galaxies, according to the best estimates of astronomers there are at least one hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. They've counted the galaxies in a particular region, and multiplied this up to estimate the number for the whole universe. Which kind of gives me hope that the aliens probably have a time machine, but this next causality experiment tells me they possibly did not. You could use an infinite amount of examples to choose to do this next causality experiment, but I am just going to use a T-Rex skeleton, and my own time lifeline from November 3rd 1981, to the Present, to demonstrate this causality experiment. If aliens had a actual time machine, and were time traveling all the time we would never know, there would be no way to tell, but if they can not get past the time travel causality problem with the technology they have, they would probably kill themselves each time they went into the past, if they went into the past into long periods into the past, because of the grandfather paradox rule. Click on the diagrams below if the text is too small, and hard for you to read.     Organism Coronacollina Acula in the picture below.  The most visited place by a time traveler if possible, would be the bookstore depository (picture below) where Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK back in 1963, at the exact moment he shot him, or the Dinosaur period.  Maybe there is some clues around there of future time travelers, especially in the Zapruder film of JFK being assassinated.   Some people think this lady present at the JFK assassination is a time traveler, they call her the Babushka Lady. Some people think time will stop, or reverse when the speed of light is broken. I think that time would continue to stretch with time dilation. Speed of Light (c): Light travels at a constant speed of 1,079,252,848.8 (1.07 billion) km per hour. That works out to 299,792,458 m/s, or about 670,616,629 mph (miles per hour). That is just a random number. If you could see a light clock, on a light beam exceeding 670,616,629 mph, I doubt you would see it freeze, and stop, but this is my opinion, I could be wrong. As for going back in time, by exceeding the speed of light, I doubt that would happen also. If you could see the behavior of a light clock as it travels at the speed of light. You would see the the beam move from the top of the clock to the bottom, and back to the top again, to complete 1 second, as the light clock moves forward through space. If you are not familiar with what a light clock is you can see how a light clock works in this video below, you can skip to 17 minutes, and 20 seconds to see the explanation about how a light clock works.  So you see the light clock create a V shape, as it moves from the top to the bottom, and back to the top again. So no matter how fast you are going the V shape is just going to get longer, and longer as speed increases, from point A, to point B, even if the distance from point A, to point B is googolplex long amount of distance in light years. The V shape of the light clock, would never stop growing longer as speed is constantly increased, or stop, or reverse, why would it, it can\u2019t. Even if it takes a googolplex amount of time in light years for the light clock to move vertically by 1 cm, time has not stopped, message me if I am wrong In this other thought experiment it is possible to double the time dilation rate you would get, because it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light. I emailed the thought experiment to a physicist at Princeton University, and he confirmed it to be correct. He said \u201cI was free-styling with the laws of physics.\u201d Now this though experiment is totally impractical, and just as impossible from happening as traveling faster than light, but it is a way of doubling the time dilation rate. Say there are three identical twins, called twin A, twin B, and twin C, and they are all the same age 20 years old. Twin C lives on earth, twin B is on a rocket ship traveling at light speed, and twin C is in a small rocket ship, small enough to fit inside twin B\u2019s larger rocket ship. If twin B travels for 1 year at the speed of light in his rocket ship, from twin B\u2019s perspective his brother, Twin A on earth will be 70.4 years older because of time dilation. So after the trip twin B is going to be 21 years old, and twin A is going to be 90.4 years older. Now this is the complicated part, imagine for a minute that twin B\u2019s rocket ship is really big, and long horizontally, long enough for his brother twin C to travel at the speed of light inside of twin B\u2019s rocket ship, in a westerly direction. So what is going to happen is that twin C is being already carried at the speed of light, in twin B\u2019s rocket ship in the north direction, so as he travels at the speed of light in a westerly direction he is getting double the time dilation rate. Remember twin C is already being carried at the speed of light, as he travels at the speed of light in the westerly direction inside twin B's rocket ship, this it what doubles the time dilation rate. Or you could just imagine the black circle (below in the diagram for you to see) is the path twin C traveling at the speed of light in long circles inside a very large, and very long horizontal space ship if this is easier. If twin C travels for a 1 year from his perspective, his brother twin B is going to be 90.4 years old, and his brother on earth twin A is going to be 160.8 years old. If twin A could live to be 160.8 that is. Totally impractical, but it works, and it is a way to double the time dilation rate without traveling faster than light.  Short term time travel though like 10 seconds into the past, I am unsure about the outcome, in this thought experiment it might help you. The time is 11:45 a.m. a time traveler decides to visit himself in the past, he would go into the past at 12:00 p.m. exactly, to go back in time to 11:50 a.m. He would go back in time from across the room from himself, (because both time traveler's cannot occupy the same space). So at 11:50 a.m. he knows that he will see another copy of himself appear from the other side of the room. But he says to himself before the time travel experiment, \u201cthat no matter what happens, it must be set in stone that I must go back at 12:00 p.m\u201d Because if he does not, who is the other person standing across the room from him. So can the time traveler visit himself, have a conversation with himself before going back in time? I am unsure to what's the answer: Will time and space, not be able to handle this paradox, and causality would instantly kill him.Causality would thrust him instantly somewhere else, but not kill him.If it is allowed a endless loop would be created, where time would never go past 12:01 p.m. ever. Because it was set in stone that the time traveler would always go back in time at 12:00 p.m. no matter what happens.Both time travelers are unaffected, by causality, and the time traveler remembers his other self visiting him, just before he visits himself in the past, and all this is allowed to happen in physics.As the time traveler meets himself, he sees his other self go into past at 12:00pm, and an endless loop is not created, and time goes on for him from that moment.Orbiting a black hole to time travel into the future is a lot safer than using a neutron star, because of gamma waves, would be tearing your rocket ship apart, and there would be a problem with the landing, because the fastest-spinning neutron star ever found has been discovered in a crowded star cluster near the center of the Milky Way, a new study reveals.  The star rotates 716 times per second, and has an escape velocity of about 33% the speed of light. Which means that any object caught in a neutron star\u2019s gravity would be accelerated to a tremendous speed. If you are not ripped apart during your descent (you would be), all of your atoms would most likely be destroyed upon impact, for the most part you would be turned into a pile of neutrons. It just is not possible to make a man made neutron star, to then keep adding matter to it to collapse it into a black hole, to try and use the black hole as a natural time machine. Because there is just not the means on earth technologically, to force electrons, and protons into neutrons to make a man made neutron star. Like a medium sized star does with its strong gravity. Then there is the problem of getting the material to build a neutron star. There is more material (atoms) in a 20 kilometer neutron star than all material in the solar system. Let's say you could get enough material, and force it together with enough force like in a medium star, to make a fairly small stable piece of neutron star matter, you could park it next to a star to get the rest of the material to grow in mass, to collapse it into a black hole. The material from a star would be neutronified, by the small piece of neutron stars gravity, and the neutron star matter would grow in mass, then collapse into a black hole. This is probably the closest thing humanly possible to ever to building a time machine, and even then its impossible to do currently. So the problem is getting the matter to make the neutron star, and forcing the matter into one place with enough force. If you could remove a cubic piece of neutron star matter from the neutron star, it would expand and violently explode, because there is nothing holding it together with enough force.   The best thing to do is to time travel into the future orbiting the black hole, a lot safer also. There is also this YouTube video below, of Stephen Hawking explaining how to a black hole can be used to time travel into the future, by orbiting the black hole.  The best documentary I ever saw about time was Brian Greene\u2019s Fabric Of The Cosmos: The Illusion Of Time (below) in the YouTube link.  Also Michio Kaku\u2019s four part Time series is excellent, in the YouTube link (below)  Also look at Ronald Mallet's time machine on in the YouTube video in the Worlds First Time Machine link above, but it can only send information back to the point when it was switched on. Hope these thought experiments helped you understand more about time travel, and what we can, and cannot do. The universe I believe is just a area of planets, stars, and galaxies in space. Space, and time is ultimately everywhere in all directions, and maybe if you travel far enough through space, like a vast distance like a googleplex in light years, you would reach a point where space, the up, down, left, right forwards, and backwards, and time, as we know it ends, and something else begins, a place with no space, and no time maybe, and its something out brains cannot comprehend.   Maybe its a place where the physics of time travel are possible\ud83e\udd14 but how do we get there? Time travel is interesting to people because people want to go back in time to fix their personal problems. But even if you go back in time you will still remember those bad events even if you fix them. Depending on the situation, and circumstances, possibly it would be better to erase the memory of the event from your mind, it would be more simple to do that than go back in time to fix the problem. That is what I am working on below. If you are interested please look at my idea for a human memory erasing machine, the link to see the idea is in another Quora answer below.

I suppose you have:  This is the first interstellar object discovered in our Solar System and it is called 'Oumuamua (from the Hawaiian word for \u201cmessenger\u201d or \u201cscout\u201d). Is it possible that the \u2018Oumuamua mysterious cigar-shaped object spotted tumbling through our solar system last year may have been an alien spacecraft sent (from the future?) to investigate Earth? Before we even think about time travel paradoxes, the twin paradox and an advanced civilization who has come from the future to investigate Earth, let us see what scientists have to say about this cigar.  Half-finished cigar smoked by Winston Churchill \u2014 not a UFO According to Nasa, 'Oumuamua came into our solar system from another star system in the galaxy. It was spotted moving at a very high speed, 87.3 kilometers per second. It will not be influenced by our Sun's gravity, i.e. will not circle on an elliptical Keplerian path. Instead, it will follow the shape of a hyperbola. Good Lord, this cigar-shaped object has come to a visit here and it will keep on going out of the solar system, and never come back\u2026 It neither behaves like a comet nor like an asteroid. Though it is impossible to take a close-up photo of 'Oumuamua, its dramatic variations in brightness over time suggest it is highly elongated. In short, astronomers had never seen a natural object with such extreme proportions in the solar system before. Scientists on the Breakthrough Listen project used the Green Bank telescope in West Virginia to eavesdrop on the 400m-long 'Oumuamua and have found no evidence it is anything other than a long lump of space rock. Scientists performed scans for alien technology aboard this mysterious object but these checks have found no evidence it is the work of an intelligent civilization. The search for alien signals from 'Oumuamua has so far found nothing. Neil deGrass Tyson simply agrees with them. Stephen Colbert interviewed Tyson on Late Show With Stephen Colbert: Colbert: \u201cThis thing came from deep space, not from our system.\u201d Tyson: \u201cThis time, or ever, an object from interstellar space, has been observed to visit our solar system\u201d. Colbert: \u201cThis looks too much like a spaceship\u201d. Tyson: \u201cThis is not a photograph. This is an artist\u2019s rendering. We know it\u2019s elongated. I don\u2019t believe its\u2019\u2026 cigars just don\u2019t come journeying into the solar system\u201d. Colbert: \u201cThis is why it has to be an alien spaceship\u201d.  But perhaps Colbert might be right after all? Because three weeks ago, Harvard astronomy department chairman Prof. Avi Loeb asserted in a Scientific American paper the following: But this is no excuse for leaving the artificial-origin option off the table for \u2018Oumuamua. The notion that an alien civilization might exist rests on the facts that our civilization exists and that the physical conditions on the surfaces of many other planets resemble those on Earth. The possibility of a \u201cmessage in a bottle\u201d from another civilization should therefore not be dismissed ab initio. After all, there are mainstream concepts that are far more imaginative than this possibility, but similarly unproven. \u2026 In addition, the spin period of \u2018Oumuamua did not change as we would expect from cometary outgassing [jetting of volatile materials]. If the advocates for a natural origin of \u2018Oumuamua have a good explanation for its orbital anomaly and lack of detectable outgassing, they should present this explanation in a scientific paper so that it would be tested with future analysis of existing data or future data on similar objects. This would be equivalent to suggesting theories of dark matter made of conventional material, or modified gravity, as alternatives to the notion of a new form of invisible matter. \u2026 Galileo Galilei taught us through experimentation that despite our gut feeling, heavy objects do not fall faster than light objects. Similarly, experiments have taught us that \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d is a feature of quantum mechanics, despite Albert Einstein\u2019s gut feeling that such a thing was impossible. The lesson from these historic examples is that in questions of science, we should base our inferences on evidence and not prejudice. Before the truth becomes evident, there is a long period of uncertainty with some \u201cgut feelings\u201d being misguided. \u2026 Since \u2018Oumuamua appears to be weird, its birthplace must be very different from what we currently imagine, irrespective of whether it is natural or artificial. Loeb and his undergraduate student at Harvard College, conclude their scholarly paper discussing \u2018Oumuamua type objects by saying: Our calculations indicate that \u2026 there should be \u223c 350 trapped objects [of interstellar origin] in our Solar System\u2026 Exploration of trapped interstellar objects could potentially help reveal the prospects of life in other star systems as well as extraterrestrial artifacts. Do you think advanced aliens have sent the \u2018Oumuamua cigar-shaped probe to monitor Earth? Maybe people from the future have sent it to our period?\u2026 One thing for sure there's still disagreement among scientists about what is the \u2018Oumuamua. ",

            "answer_text": "While it\u2019s tempting to answer this question with a) funny examples of time travel derived from fiction or b) philosophical thoughts on the possibility or impossibility of time travel, for the sake of taking the question seriously and framing an answer in the context of Quora\u2019s best traditions. Firstly, instead of simply replying \u2018no\u2019, it\u2019s important to explain why the answer is supposed to be \u2018no\u2019. And here we have to start with some assumptions. Because I\u2019m not a physicist, neither will most of Quora\u2019s audience be, I shall attempt to make things simple. Secondly, where comes the whole idea of time travel being \u2018possible\u2019, in the physical \u2014 not fictional \u2014 sense of the word? Well, basically we have to understand that Einstein\u2019s relativity equations are not only a description of our current universe, but they are rather a set of complex equations with multiple solutions, and each solution describes a particular universe. By filling in certain assumptions and variables in Einstein\u2019s equations, we can come up with the description of a universe, and we can check with the observations of our own universe and thus see if we have found the \u2018right\u2019 solution to the equation. Several people (including Einstein) have proposed many solutions and agreed upon those that better describe our universe. Nevertheless, finding out other solutions can possibly throw some light in particularly difficult questions about our universe, which might be very hard to solve using the \u2018correct\u2019 equations for our universe, but very simple when considering solutions for other universes. This might sound strange until we understand that in the hard sciences this approach is very common: to solve a complex problem in one domain, scientists try to figure out a way to represent that domain in a way where the complex problem becomes quite simple, solve it, and then spend the rest of the academic paper explaining how the two domains are related. A very simple example: we can assume that Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun is a circle and not an ellipse, and therefore make much easier calculations \u2014 like saying, for example, when the seasons are supposed to start: it\u2019s easy to figure out how to divide a circle in four sections, each comprised of 90 degrees of arc, which, in turn, makes calculations rather simple. Now we know that Earth\u2019s orbit is an ellipse with the Sun in one of the focus, but the difference is not that great, so that we can do some basic calculations and assumptions using the orbit as a circle, just to reach some conclusions very quickly; and, later, we can explain things in more detail, by making the same calculations using elliptical equations. The point is that we can advance very quickly and come to interesting conclusions using a simple model; if we can see how our theory applies to that model, then we can argue that it is sufficiently similar to the \u2018real\u2019 model, and do the much harder calculations at a later stage. There are, indeed, some solutions to Einstein\u2019s equations that create so-called \u2018closed timelike curves\u2019 \u2014 paths across spacetime where, indeed, time travel is possible. One of such solutions was shown by the infamous G\u00f6del[1], a horrible little Austrian-American mathematician and philosopher who made life hard for everyone by shattering their glorious dreams. Bertrand Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica would have been the greatest mathematical accomplishment of the 20th century, and Russell credited as the greatest mathematician ever, if annoying G\u00f6del hadn\u2019t proven that Russell was wrong, using one of G\u00f6del\u2019s infamous Incompleteness Theorems, which have plagued both mathematicians and philosophers ever since \u2014 because it proves that it\u2019s impossible to describe this universe completely merely with mathematical formalisms, contrary to what we have always learned at school. Scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers have been trying to prove G\u00f6del wrong (they all failed) or that his theorems didn\u2019t apply to [insert area of knowledge here] (they have had better success in this area). As you can see from my sarcasm, I personally think that G\u00f6del was the best mathematician of the 20th century, but because he annoyed everyone else by disproving their theories, and, to make matters worse, left a mathematical \u2018proof\u2019 of God\u2019s existence written allegedly on his deathbed, everybody universally hates him and tries to strike his accomplishments out of the history of science. Well, almost. One of such accomplishments was, indeed, showing that Einstein\u2019s relativity could be used to mathematically describe an universe where time travel was possible and legitimate (note: to be honest, he just validated an earlier formulation by a fellow mathematician; but as he was a regular correspondent with Einstein and generally annoyed everybody else and was therefore well-known \u2014 especially because his work tends to have annoyingly difficult arguments to disprove). Now this has some intriguing consequences, and, of course, the first question to be raised is if G\u00f6del\u2019s solution could apply to our own universe as well. In general, the answer ought to be \u2018no\u2019, since the so-called \u2018G\u00f6del universe\u2019 lacks some vital characteristics that are present in our own universe. However, this is not the point; because G\u00f6del has shown that it is possible to use relativity to describe an universe where time travel is possible, then we can at least logically assume that a better, more complex description of our own universe (i.e. a more complex solution to Einstein\u2019s equations which describe an universe that we can fully validate empirically) may also include the possibility of time travel. In other words: G\u00f6del showed that time travel is not mathematically impossible using relativity to describe universes. What is left undone is to find a solution to Einstein\u2019s equations describing not only our universe in a better, more accurate way, but which also includes time travel. Just because there are no feasible solutions right now, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist; it just means that Einstein\u2019s equations have not been solved with the proper parameters. You might therefore ask why not more work is put in this. One stupid reason is that G\u00f6del, who might have done exactly that just to annoy his fellow mathematicians and physicists, is already dead, and few like to continue his always disturbing work. But a better reason is simply that such a description of the universe might be unnecessarily complicated. The solutions we have for Einstein\u2019s equations right now are so precise in describing our own universe, to an incredible accuracy, validated over and over again, that \u2014 according to Occam\u2019s Razor \u2014 scientists prefer to use the simplest explanation of our universe which has the most explanatory power. Creating an even more complex explanation \u2014 one that takes time travel into account \u2014 and painfully solving every tiny little equation to show that it indeed \u2018fits\u2019 to our universe and includes the possibility of time travel is far too much work for little value \u2014 unless, of course, someone had devised a time travel machine, and needed the equations to understand what it could accomplish. So here is the state-of-the-art from a scientific perspective: we have validated Einstein\u2019s equations over and over again, and the more we validate the equations that describe our universe, the more accurately this validation is \u2014 so we can say with a very high degree of confidence (in fact, relativity is one of the most proven theories in science, closely followed by quantum mechanics and evolution through natural selection) that we got the \u2018right\u2019 solution to the equations. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of time travel, because we know that there are perfectly valid solutions to Einstein\u2019s equations which, indeed, include time travel. So we cannot rule out the possibility that our own universe \u2014 described by a more complex solution to Einstein\u2019s equations \u2014 might, indeed, also include time travel. This is what is generally meant when we casually said that \u2018time travel can be shown to be consistent with Einstein\u2019s general relativity\u2019. It is indeed, even if we haven\u2019t figured out how to reconcile G\u00f6del\u2019s solution with the current solutions describing our universe \u2014 mostly because that work is fruitless and uninteresting to most physicists, unless, of course, something dramatic changes.Now, just because this area of research is pretty much a dead end (in the sense that not enough resources are placed in figuring out something which might be useless, except from a purely mathematical perspective), this does not mean that nobody has given the concept some thought. And, of course, the problem of time paradoxes is also one of the many that has bothered several scientists. Stephen Hawking proposed what is known as the Chronology protection conjecture[2]which roughly states that although time travel might be allowed at submicroscopic scales (which we know to be possible), the laws of physics may be such that time travel is impossible at macroscopic scales. Such a statement is not unusual, because we\u2019re aware at lots of things that work well at submicroscopic scales, described by quantum mechanics, but which simply don\u2019t happen at the macroscopic level. I could go on and list a few tons of those, but since these are not directly relevant to this question, I leave it as an exercise to the reader :) Google for them for a bit, and you\u2019ll quickly figure out for yourself how weird, strange, and counter-nature the submicroscopic level is, even though it is so accurately described by quantum mechanics. So Hawking thinks that the same applies to time travel. While this is merely a conjecture and not even a hypothesis (which could be empirically or mathematically proven and therefore become a theory or law), there are solid, mathematical arguments sustaining that conjecture. In general, therefore, it is expected that researchers in the field of time travel, the closer they come to a solution to Einstein\u2019s equations which simultaneously describe the observed universe accurately (to the same degree we already have today) and explain how time travel could work in our universe and our timeline, then such a solution would also include \u2018new\u2019 laws of physics (not a new system of laws, but rather new laws that would emerge from Einstein\u2019s equations naturally, and which we didn\u2019t know about, even though they had always existed \u2014 we just hadn\u2019t a mathematical description of them) which would prevent macroscopical time travel. Think of some new equations which would require a small, finite amount of energy for a particle to do time travel, but, as more and more particles are added to the system, that amount of required energy quickly surpasses the whole mass of the observable universe or becomes infinite; in other words, we might be able to send particles forwards and backwards in time, and perhaps by tapping the power of the Sun or of the whole Milky Way we might even send a few atoms back in time, but the equations would never allow us to send the tiniest bacteria across a \u2018closed timelike curve\u2019. This would not be the same thing as imagining some sort of anthropomorphic \u2018agency\u2019 which would \u2018stop\u2019 time travel (i.e. an inventor of a time travel machine breaking his creation due to regret at what it could accomplish), but rather the simple notion that the laws of physics simply don\u2019t allow time travel to be accomplished at a macroscopic level in our universe (other universes, like the ones described by G\u00f6del, would be different and allow time travel at the macroscopic levels \u2014 but such universes are not compatible with what we can observe of our universe, or, if they match a lot of characteristics, they tend to be inherently unstable and collapse of their own accord). Now, to prove that Hawking is right in his conjecture, we would need to develop a full theory of quantum gravity, and we haven\u2019t that yet; even string theory, with all its faults and lack of completeness, tends to indicate that the conjecture would hold, but, again, string theory is still not a full theory that can be empirically validated \u2014 yet. Even if we assume that Hawking is a loony and that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, there are at least two other, weaker explanations of why time travel hasn\u2019t happened yet and why there was no need for an inventor of time travel to destroy his own machine. One is known as the Novikov self-consistency principle[3]which states that if we have an universe where time travel is possible (i.e. a particular solution of Einstein\u2019s equations which precisely describe our universe and includes \u2018closed timelike curves\u2019, the ability to do time travel), then the probability of an time travelling event in the past to change our current timeline is zero. In other words, under Novikov\u2019s principle, we could have macroscopic time travel of some sort, but if a time traveller would attempt to change irrevocably events in the past to affect the course of history in the future, then such attempts would never succeed (i.e. they would have a probability of zero success). In other words: we might be able to time travel to watch Jesus being crucified, and possibly, under Novikov\u2019s explanation, perhaps the crucifixion is currently being watched by millions of time travelers, but all of them would have to be properly attired and speaking flawless Aramaic or Greek to be able even to converse with natives of that time and period \u2014 but they could never prevent the crucifixion from happening. If they tried to do that, their time travel would be abruptly cancelled \u2014 somehow, the machine providing the time travel would blow up from an energy surge or be destroyed by a singularity or something tragic like that. In essence, time travellers would be passive spectators, or at most innocent bystanders who would eventually be able to interact with the environment but have no way to affect the future. Now, Novikov\u2019s principle might just seem to be an arbitrary rule, but it is actually grounded on some solid physics, and, indeed, a few followers of Novikov\u2019s theories have shown that a time traveller \u2018inside\u2019 a \u2018closed timelike curve\u2019 would be limited in their actions; each action would trigger a certain amount of events, and there is a mathematical limit to how many events could be added until the \u2018closed timelike curve\u2019 collapses mathematically. I cannot pretend to understand what exactly this means, on the mathematical side of things, but it is interpreted as meaning that the more you try to change the past to affect the future, the more likely the \u2018closed timelike curve\u2019 generated by a time machine will collapse of its own accord. It\u2019s not clear for a layperson how exactly human actions translate to complex mathematical descriptions of events \u2014 and those somehow are related to the energy necessary to maintain the \u2018closed timelike curve\u2019 \u2014 but I\u2019m assuming that those who research these areas of physics know what they are doing :) Perhaps a similar concept which is more accessible to everyone is trying to accelerate a (macroscopic) mass to the speed of light. As we get faster and faster, our mass increases more and more (requiring more and more energy to sustain the acceleration), until it quickly becomes an exponential resulting in infinity: so, a body accelerated to lightspeed will have infinite mass and require infinite energy to continue its progression. It\u2019s not like Einstein imagines a traffic cop raising a sign if you\u2019re travelling too fast; it\u2019s simply that the equations describing near-lightspeed acceleration will very quickly converge to infinity, rendering such accelerations impossible \u2014 and not because somehow there is something \u2018magical\u2019 in the \u2018prohibition\u2019 of going beyond lightspeed. I imagine that the same concept applies to time travellers using the Novikov principle: if you time travel just to observe past events and keep quiet about them, then you spend little energy, and the time travel machine will allow you to do that. As you start to interact with people and events in the past, in the attempt to change them and affect the future, then the time machine will require more and more energy to sustain the \u2018closed timelike curve\u2019 until it exponentially consumes energy reaching infinity at the exact moment where you are almost succeeding in killing your own grandfather; at that moment, the machine explodes and you\u2019re back to where you started. Under Novikov\u2019s principle, therefore, time travellers could exist, they could have perfectly working time machines, but, because they couldn\u2019t affect the past, they would have no need of destroying their creations \u2014 thus providing an explanation of why we don\u2019t have time travellers at all points of History attempting to change our timeline. We might also not be able to \u2018see\u2019 time travellers because they would have no choice but to interact with us in a manner that they would cause exactly zero interference with out timeline \u2014 in other words: the safest way to time travel would be to observe only, while if interaction was desired, such time travellers would need to look exactly like natives, talk like natives, dress like natives, pretend to be native; otherwise, if they start giving out clues that they come from the far future, their time machines would simply collapse before they had any chance to tell us anything. Pretty neat, huh? Novikov, of course, is not universally accepted, and many physicists have refuted him with several complex arguments; so we have no way of knowing how \u2018right\u2019 he is. There is another further alternative, which is to assume that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is true. In such a scenario, time travel would be done across alternative timelines; in other words, if you travelled to the past, you would shift to a different timeline, where you could not affect your present or future. You would affect that timeline\u2019s future only. This would still allow time travel to do very interesting things \u2014 say, historic research, taking pictures of the crucifixion and bring them back, in full HDR \u2014 but it would make it impossible to \u2018affect\u2019 the past because we would simply be travelling to an alternate world, exactly like ours with the tiny difference that you could affect its future. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics solves a lot of problems (not only with time travel), but introduces also many of its own, and this is one reason why it\u2019s also not universally accepted either. It cannot be shrugged off or discarded easily, of course, because it\u2019s a mathematically plausible interpretation of quantum mechanics; it\u2019s just not popular enough among physicists, since other interpretations provide even greater explanatory power, at least in areas which physicists are more interested in researching (time travel is not a popular field of study\u2026). Last but not least, it has been shown that in \u2018our\u2019 universe (that is, the universe currently being described by a particular solution to Einstein\u2019s equations), \u2018solving\u2019 the problem of faster-than-light travel will result in creating a time machine; in other words, the two problems are equivalent, if you discover one, you discover the other. Now, while time travel might not be a fundamental area of research (except perhaps for those who are more philosophically inclined), faster-than-light travel is crucial for interstellar exploration, and it has been given some considerable thought \u2014 and even some experimenting. Because going deeper in this subject means getting off topic, I will just give one very interesting example, the Alcubierre drive[4], which has also been nicknamed \u2018warp drive\u2019 (and yes, Alcubierre told William Shatner in an email that he was inspired by Star Trek). This intriguing device \u2018cheats\u2019 the lightspeed limit by subtly \u2018warping\u2019 (i.e. deforming) local spacetime, and sort of \u2018riding the wave\u2019 of that deformation, which in turn allows a spaceship to move at what would be perceived as faster-than-light travel from the perspective of an Earth observer. In reality, such a spaceship would technically be absolutely static and not move at all, when referencing its local spacetime frame. It\u2019s just that spacetime would be pushed and pulled \u2014 deformed, warped \u2014 around it, so it would look like it\u2019s moving from the perspective of an observer outside that frame. The passengers inside the spaceship would not feel any acceleration or any other force; and they would also not \u2018suffer\u2019 from any relativistic time paradoxes, i.e. time for them would pass exactly as time for an external observer. This neat trick of \u2018deforming space\u2019 to \u2018violate\u2019 the lightspeed limit is actually quite interesting, because in truth no laws of physics are being broken. The mathematical explanation is beyond me, of course, but at least I can point to one very complex aspect of Einstein\u2019s general relativity, and that is that it applies to referential frames; there is an aspect of locality inherent in relativity, and it\u2019s regarding to that \u2018locality\u2019 that things like the speed of light do apply. In other words: two frames might actually move faster than the speed of light when considering the speed that each of one us using relatively to the other, if there is no exchange of information between them. This is something even I have some difficulty of understanding, but it makes sense from the perspective of the Alcubierre drive: you\u2019re shifting frames of reference around the universe, at speeds faster than light, but nobody is actually in touch with the spaceship while it\u2019s inside the \u2018warp bubble\u2019. Light, when measured inside the spaceship, is faster than the spaceship itself, like it has to be, if we are maintaining general relativity. It\u2019s just that bits of the universe, inside the \u2018warp bubble\u2019, are being shifted around. Of course, this neat trick is very cool but required, in theory, things like exotic matter and negative energy. This should place the Alcubierre drive into the realm of science fiction, but there are a few people (even at NASA) that think otherwise and devised a few experiments to shift some particles around using a modified Alcubierre drive. So far, the last experiment, done in 2012 or so, was pretty much inconclusive, and we have to assume that NASA gave up on that. Now, the interesting bit about the Alcubierre drive is that it provides faster-than-light travel without breaking any physical laws, nor requiring \u2018infinite\u2019 amounts of energy, and, most importantly, without creating any time paradoxes. It is therefore consistent with the conjectures and principles enumerated above, and contradicts the idea that faster-than-light travel implies the existence of time machines. Not so with the Alcubierre drive, because it\u2019s a static device which is technically not moving \u2014 it\u2019s space that is being warped \u2018under\u2019 it. Therefore, all usual issues affecting near-to-lightspeed travel do not apply to spaceships equipped with Alcubierre drives, and no time paradoxes emerge from travelling around the universe with a \u2018warp drive\u2019, although there are many other implications which might render the Alcubierre drive impossible (we\u2019ll see about that!). So\u2026 to conclude\u2026 Time travel is possible, if you just have the right solution to Einstein\u2019s general relativity equations. Some solutions, like the one from G\u00f6del, admit time travel, but they do not describe our universe. We would need a different solution to Einstein\u2019s equations, but that is just a question of applying some time to do that. Nothing in the theory prevents time travel; it\u2019s just that the current solutions we have for Einstein\u2019s equations and which we know to represent our universe with an incredible degree of accuracy do not include the possibility of \u2018closed timelike curves\u2019 which would allow time travel.If time travel is possible, and the Hawking conjecture holds, then time travel is only possible for submicroscopic particles, and we do not need to worry: there are no time travellers, existing time machines in the future will only be able to send particles back in time, and they will not need to destroy their creations.If time travel is possible, and Hawking was wrong, but Novikov is right, then we can construct time machines which would allow visitors from the future to observe and even interact with the past, but, at the moment they try to affect the future by changing events in the past, such time machines would collapse the \u2018closed timelike curves\u2019 due to fundamental laws of physics (i.e. affecting the past to change the future might require infinite energy). This would therefore mean that creators of time machines would not need to worry about accidentally changing the past, because that would be physically impossible to do. People would still be able to do time travel and enjoy themselves quite a lot, and perhaps this is happening now as we speak, but nothing that they are doing right now will affect either our past or our future, so we have nothing to worry about.If 2 and 3 are wrong, but the multiple-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is right, then time travel would just place us in an alternative timeline. We would be able to explore it and affect its events as much as we wished \u2014 and that would possibly provide us with lots of insights about historical events \u2014 but we would not be affecting our own timeline, just an alternative timeline. Thus, no time travellers can come from the future to affect our timeline \u2014 they\u2019re all happily exploring parallel timelines to ours and having fun murdering their own grandfathers, Hitler, Stalin, Donald Trump, etc. and see what happens. All that would be perfectly harmless towards our universe and timeline, which is not accessible in any case, so no time machine inventors need to worry about their machines.If we develop faster-than-light transportation, then it will very likely be of the kind suggested by Alcubierre, or a similar variation, where we are not really accelerating beyond the speed of light (and thus having the ability to time travel, according to an interpretation of general relativity\u2026), but we would simply be compressing, deforming, warping space, which is theoretically possible (remember, any body of matter will deform spacetime due to the action of gravity) and feasible, without breaking any laws of physics, and, most importantly, not falling into any time paradoxes whatsoever, since devices similar to the description of the Alcubierre drive are technically static and therefore, not moving relatively to their frame of reference, thus not subject to any strange paradoxes.Whew. Ok. So this was perhaps not the most interesting answer, and certainly not the most creative one; but I hope to have given a glimpse on what is the current state-of-the-art of scientific thought regarding time travel, and I think we can remain optimistic for a while \u2014 time travellers will not be changing our past, and therefore we can sleep at ease during the night!

            "answer_text": "PROLOGUE: TRAVEL BACK IN TIME IS NOT POSSIBLE. BUT WHAT IF IT IS? I do not believe time travel to the past is possible; having given the matter enough thought to become convinced that it is absurd to believe that anything ever escapes the present, and that the present\u2019s continuous transformation into the future leaves nothing behind. There is nothing backwards in time to travel to. Running time measurement devices backwards does not affect the forward flow of time, it only operates to confuse our thinking. No evidence or logic suggests that time can ever flow backwards. I will below nevertheless attempt to analyze what time travel would mean to a traveler and to those existing when the traveler departs. THE NATURE OF SPACE-TIME PREVENTS CALCULATION OF A DESTINATION. Even if a way of moving the date and \u201ctime\u201d of the present were invented, it remains impossible to calculate a specific destination before traveling. One\u2019s location within the universe is constantly changing at huge speeds relative to other matter (the more distant the faster it recedes from us), and only the concurrent motion of our immediate environment masks this, just as the earth\u2019s rotation is hidden from us because everything on its surface is rotating with us. When considering the spacial location changes of anything over time, give some thought to science\u2019s discoveries about the expanding universe and what it means on the galactic scale over time; coupled with the motions of galaxies, stars, planets and gases throughout the universe dancing in space under the force of gravity, black energy, photons, electro magnetism and the atomic forces; stirred further by space-time distortion generated by innumerable black holes. How can position in the universe at a past time be calculated to determine a destination when time traveling? That is, assuming it were possible at all to treat the past as if it were a location. No fixed references to past locations of the original environment are determinable. The time traveler can never determine where the intended arrival point is to be, even if somehow the when could be determined. This is the reality of space-time in our universe. This is another problem I will ignore below in my hypothetical analysis. WHAT EFFECT WOULD TRAVEL TO THE PAST HAVE ON THE PRESENT? Despite my disbelief, it is a sobering exercise to imagine trips into the past and such voyages\u2019 effects on the flow of events which culminated in the present existing as the voyagers begin time travel. As a mental game, the rules as to how it would confuse the pre-existing time line of events can be puzzled out, with many things proposed ruled impossible contrary to careless assumptions. First, any change in the flow of events resulting from the backwards time travel must result in unending changes in events, like circles of dominoes falling outward. This happens not only on the scale humans observe, but on all scales of existence down to and even below the scale of quantum physics and multi-dimensional strings of energy. Ever widening sub-atomic effects extend into multiple dimensions, altering events whose very existence is beyond our human capacity to detect or even imagine. The time traveler\u2019s \u201cdestination in time\u201d [ignoring for simpler analysis the problem of location] will be a \u201cpresent\u201d which for an infinitesimally small point matches a moment of the past of the universe the traveler started from. TIME TRAVEL DESTROYS THE TRAVELER\u2019S PREVIOUS REALITY. Thereafter the changes begin. There will never be a way for the destination\u2019s forward moving present to become the same as the time track taken by the universe from which the time traveler left. The old \u201cpresent\u201d from which the trip commenced will never exist. The mental states, memories, form of being, and many or all other qualities of the humans existing when the traveler left never form. The extent of the changes will of course depend, to a theoretical (but impossibly \u201coutside the universe\u201d) observer, on the time distance traveled, since a nanosecond of travel leaves a far smaller footprint than a hundred years of travel due to the quantity of time available for the ripples of change to spread. However big the change, the change will be absolute and obliterate the \u201cold\u201d present, which never occurs, and a new present instantly comes into being with a time line leading to different presents through cause and effect on every scale. Running time measurement devices backwards does not affect the forward flow of time, it only operates to confuse our thinking. No evidence or logic suggests that time can ever flow backwards. TIME TRAVEL IS UNDETECTABLE TO ANYONE EXCEPT THE TRAVELER. There will be no \u201cjump/slip\u201d or trace of memory of never to occur events because those former future humans never existed at all, and never will exist (at least as they \u201cwere.\u201d). The former \u201cpresent\u201d is destroyed instantly after the Traveler\u2019s arrival in the past, when the timeline of cause and effect is changed. If time travel, contrary to my intuitive belief, is a real possibility, it is undetectable to all other as they are at all times in the present of the only time of the universe (the present) which has at such moment ever existed. Alternate futures have no existence once modified. TIME TRAVEL WILL NOT CAUSE ANY PARADOX OF CAUSE AND EFFECT. Here\u2019s why seems an apparent paradox (the traveler\u2019s origin) is avoided. Time travelers themselves, after arrival, are no longer from a future that ever existed. It will seem like they came from a real place to theTravelers, assuming they are alive and conscious throughout their experience before during and after the travel. Nevertheless, when arriving in the past (the new present), a time traveler will have just popped into existence from nowhere, because the time left never will exist. They will be able to affect the flow of events upon arrival, in fact unable not to affect how events occur. But they are now constrained in the present they find themselves, with nothing to return to. As their new present moves into its future, they will be living in a new place in which time goes forward as it always does. The further back they went, the more events in the destination will vary as time advances, and they will be interacting with their present without any stake in modifying the former reality they left. Surprises will multiply for them when expectations of identical timeline are met with unanticipated changes, and with enough distance traveled, the travelers\u2019 hopes to control the future will be dashed. RESULTS FROM TIME TRAVEL ARE UNCONTROLLABLE. So what would the point of intentional time travel be? Even were profit realized from some potential accurate predictions, the future will remain uncertain in the new present, the same insecurities and risks we must accept as part of our present daily lives would be part of the traveler\u2019s life, and the moment of death cannot be known. Might just as well stay in the present, from an existential perspective. Not to mention homesickness for a future and people that will never be. There would be a total failure of evidence supporting any traveler\u2019s claim of travel. Time travel would never be established to have occurred by those in the present where the traveler arrived, so such a claim would be unlikely to ever be accepted. Claims of travel would likely be treated as insanity or worse. NO PROGRAM OR RESEARCH EFFORT TO TRAVEL IN TIME DESERVES OUR SUPPORT. Those contemplating time travel may wish to turn attention to other problems, after reflection of the points raised above. Socially, no reason to support such an effort seems to merit support, considering one result of such travel is destruction of the reality of the current present time. One would hope that were the consequences of time travel fully considered, no sane person would attempt to construct such a machine. That still leaves room to fear acts by the insane. CONCLUSION, AND ULTIMATE ANSWER TO QUESTION. It is likely that if I am wrong about the possibility of building a time machine, it is very likely such invention has been deliberately destroyed by its maker. The unanswered point of speculation remains. Was it used first? We will never know. ",

We really don't need to look further than the laws of physics. As has been pointed out numerous times elsewhere, travel to the past would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, allow perpetual motion machines, set up any number of paradoxical narratives, and irretrievably alter any recognizable present you were hoping to return to. Do not do it. Imagine the misery of success. The discovery that all the motivating influences in your life, the little voices, the Jiminy Crickets that helped you along the way, were gone. They never knew you. Even if the same people were alive, they simply wouldn't recognize you, they wouldn't care about you the way they had. They wouldn't see you as a person to nurture and cherish. You would be, in a very absolute and literal and permanent sense, totally alone. Do not do it. Imagine the ultimate creative disappointment - you paint the Mona Lisa, the Sistine Chapel, the Guernica... and the very fabric of culture that might have appreciated those things has been cored out of the world, so that only you even remember that someone once valued such things; and no one even senses anything missing. No one realizes that a horrible, degrading, irredeemable theft has occurred - the theft of humanity's soul. And you are the thief. And there will be no market for your booty. Do not do it. Imagine scaling the cliffs of Heaven, clawing up unwelcoming sheer rock, to a perfect land that throws a disappointed penetrating glance and does not invite you in. But you had to do it, over the years and decades of turmoil and toil, you had to steal your way in, to beg a second chance. How impossible that hope! How inevitable the failure! And then somehow to feel an immeasurable mercy laid upon you, the mercy and the gift to let you wend your way through time's labyrinth and find your earlier, better, most wonderful self, your most perfect happy younger self. And then to put one footstep different for that perfect you. To tell them everything in the briefest moment. To tell them...to tell them... Do not do it.  ",

See rest of poorly-written answer below. I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut even being at work without my materials in front of me. Apparently for me the Internet isn\u2019t a valid source of citation at the moment either\u2026 but it\u2019s worthy of musing on. Is it possible someone invented said device: Given entropy is 100% transformable within a closed space, sure. Think about that all the way through and what the definition of \u2018entropy\u2019 really is. Even entropy has an ordering to its disorder. Considering the somewhat complex to visualize \u201cgap defect\u201d transformations within a manifold that has been given the appropriate geometric properties (at least two nonholonomic reference frames with a torsion element that is adiabatically invariant to the frequency of rotation of the frames, as opposed to becoming a source of inefficiency) that support \u2018time travel\u2019 this alters the definition of the dreaded entropy reversal topic and as such permits this type of movement. Turns out there is some magic to complex electromagnetic fields. Fear is a higher-ordered organism\u2019s reaction cascade to unknown/unrecognized stimulus or better put, a manufactured internal response to an incompletely processed perception of reality in its own foreground space. It\u2019s made up. So to say \u2018figured out how dangerous it was\u2019 is an assumption that privileged person made that was pretty superfluous, in my humble opinion.

Too bad for all that good hardware! I wonder what it\u2019s worth on the recycling market right now.

            "answer_text": "Great answer from Stan Hayward, documenting the history of time travel! I would add, though, that there have been other journeys through time, too, The folks involved in the Back to the Future films knew this, and featured a Donald Trump character Biff Tannen well before the rest of us made the connection:  [Biff appeared in the original 1985 movie. This clip is from Back to the Future II in 1989.] There\u2019s even a connection to Tannen\u2019s ancestor \u201cMad Dog\u201d Tannen. An insider reference to \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis? Hmmmm. Stan posted a picture of an early time traveler. I found another one, again clearly discovered by the people who made the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d films. Take a look at the time-travelling DeLorean on the right. It\u2019s pretty much an update of the vehicle on the left.  OK. Let\u2019s get at least semi-serious for the moment. Things are being invented\u2014and are in common use\u2014today that people just 50 years ago would have said were impossible. Cell phones. The Internet. The personal computer. Organ transplants and artificial organs. I remember working in Washington, D.C., in the 1970s and seeing people who appeared mentally unstable having active conversations with\u2026nobody. They were animated conversations. Only the other person wasn\u2019t there. Take a few people from the 1970s and transport them to Washington (or any other city) today. They\u2019ll see lots of people walking down the streets having animated conversations with . . . nobody. At least nobody you can see. It\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d cell phones and perhaps BlueTooth. I remember watching Star Trek in the 1960s and seeing these devices that would instantaneously translate from one language to another. And the devices could answer questions on their own. Just ask, and the hand-held device would answer. Today, any cell phone can do that. Or an Echo Dot for $25. Point is: Things that seemed impossible to us only 50 years ago are commonly accepted today. And let\u2019s not get started on airplanes, or the ability to have people walking on the moon. Much less something like GPS, that can show where you are anywhere on earth within a few feet, and in many places can speak to you, giving you directions. Or I just tell my cell phone: \u201cDirections home,\u201d and it figures out where I am, where I\u2019m trying to get to, and the fastest way to do so. How about self-driving cars in a few years? Is time travel impossible? Heck, no. We already know how to go forward in time. We just don\u2019t know how to control the speed yet. As far as going backward? I\u2019m not a physicist, so I don\u2019t pretend to know for sure. Though I do know that many major predictions by the leading scientists of their day have turned out dead wrong. And let me leave you with this thought: When the movie \u201cThe Graduate\u201d came out in 1967. \u201cBen\u201d (the Dustin Hoffman character) is given advice on what field to go into: Plastics. It sounded funny, hilarious even, at the time. Seriously? But, darn, that was good advice.  So let me leave you with 2 words: Quantum mechanics. Or, if you prefer, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. ",

            "answer_text": "quick answer: Yes but probably not for the standard interpretation of the question. We already have time machines ... however it is only in one direction - to the future... to many this is a boring interpretation of the question.We have other time machines that do 'travel' to the past ... they are called telescopes - again many might find this a boring interpretation of the question.There is also the case where someone thinks (without really verifying) that they have invented time travel, then on pondering the implications decides it is too dangerous to use and then destroys it ... Is it possible that someone already invented a time machine able to go backwards in time? Yes ... but not as simple as it is frequently presented in fiction also probably not in a meaningful and useful way (and thus destroyed/discarded it since their used of it didn't match the reasons they wanted it for. example: parallel universes where travel to the past is allowed but not to your own timeline, they 'effected' the past but not their past (not really changing it because they are part of it) -  as to the dangers involved ... well that depends on the mechanics of it which of course depends on it being possible in the first place ... Causal loop/boot-strap paradox and the Grandfather paradox are amount some of the reasons why many people either think backward time travel is either dangerous or not possible. before we get too excited: there is no known working model of a time machine and the several scientific theories that cover the topic tend to suggest it either isn't possible to make a backward in time travelling machine or it isn't practical to make or power - some requiring insane amounts of energy or engineering projects that are astronomically large and thus nowhere feasible in the 'near' future ",

If your answer is \u201cyes\u201d, then the answer to your question is also yes. If your answer is \u201cno\u201d, then how do you justify this no? There is no scientific study on invisible fairies or gnomes to justify your \u201cno\u201d. I think we cannot give definitive answers to questions such as this one. But we can answer the question \u201cis this scenario logically consistent?\u201d And this just boils down to whether time travel is logically consistent. (The figuring out it is dangerous and destroying it is obviously possible given that the machine exists in the first place.) The question of the possibility of time travel boils down to the following: Time travel to the future is not only possible, but has been demonstrated by astronauts. But to go more than a few nanoseconds into the future is very expensive. This may not be so prohibitative in a few centuries.Time travel into the past is only theoretically possible if spacetime is distorted enough to form loops. Tiny wormholes in spacrtime may exist, coming into and out of existence spontaneously, but the kind of manipulation needed to allow humans to travel through them does not seem feasible.Another place loops in spacetime may be encountered is within the chaotic twisting and writhing spacetime inside a black hole. But such forces are produced by a massive gravitational field, not by human manipulation. And humans (and any other conceivable life forms) could not survive those conditions.The fundamental question is, given enough time, could our civilization advance to the point where these difficulties are overcome? Because, if the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, then the time travellers could already be among us and the knowledge to build time mschines too. My own estimate is \u201cno, we don\u2019t have enough time\u201d\u2026 but\u2026Alien civilizations, perhaps billions of years much more advanced than our own could have perfected the technology or could one day perfect the technology (adding a few billion years to the timescales is just so awesome that nearly all our dearly held concepts would be blown away).To me, scenario 5 is the only one that makes your scenario logically consistent. But the time machine destroyed is unlikely to be the only machine in existence. Of course, the person (more likely: civilization) who destroyed the machine could have been the original alien civilization that figured out how to make it. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course a television producer would tell you that time travel is possible ( and 400+ science fiction buffs would upvotes the comment). Hollywood, psssh. While anything is possible, time travel isn't on that list. If you just look at the pure logic of the issue, with a little common sense, and you'll arrive at a sound conclusion. There is only one existence and that is now, present. No amount of scientific advancement will ever create time travel or a device that will make it possible. Where would you travel too? There would be nowhere for you to land. They only time machines we have are movies and music. The past is nothing but a memory. I'm sure the intellectual supremacist are going to argue until they are blue in the face. There wouldn't be anything tangible to go back to. You can travel back to the past, but it will be virtual experience ( like visiting a past life). The ideas of physically visiting the future is just as absurd because there is nothing tangible to visit; the future is a state of potential based upon what we do now and how that action will/ could play itself out. A person who can foresee future events does so based upon a trend. If a person continues down a certain path, doing this, that, or the other, then that course, based upon other influencing factors, will have a certain result. But if you change the course of your actions, etc, you change the course of whatever might have happened. I fortell coming events all of the time, and do so professionally for other people. You can fortell the future, but cannot visit in the flesh . Your mind, film, and music are the only time machine there will ever be. Since this a physics question, I'm sure there is going to be all kinds of nerdrific answers that defy both God and reasoning. But, wait. This is a scienctic question, and thanks to Kathleen Kenyan, most scientific people providing answers think God is fairy tale. Flying, saucers, aliens, time travel, eTC, are possible, yet God is a fairy tale? Imagine the illogic of that. Oh well, there goes my chance of getting any upvotes. Psssh. ",

No it isn\u2019t, we do it all the time. As far as I know no one has been hurt directly by the time travel itself. Seems okay. If you and I were identical twins, with identical life spans, with matching super accurate watches and: you went for a super sonic plane ride that I didn\u2019t go on, we are no longer identical twins and our watches no longer match. You have moved into the future. Your watch ran slower than mine did due to the speed, so you have not aged as much. I will now die before you.. you go live in a deep mine and I go live on a mountain. Again I die first and your watch ran slower as it was in a stronger gravity well. Both gravity and speed affect the passage of time by slowing it down. This is very evident in our GPS system. It works with very accurate clock pulses\u2026 that have to be adjusted every day to account for time travel due to both their speed and their reduced gravity. Every day eh, it\u2019s common place. Moving into the future is fairly easy, the further you would like to go into it the faster you must get moving. Gravity does this as well but there gets to be a problem with squishing fairly quickly. About six times regular gravity is about all you can stand before it gets fatal. If you want to see the future just get on a space ship, rev it up to 99.9999% the speed of light and go for a ten year trip. When you return you will find that ~3600 years have passed on earth in those 10 years you were on the ship and nothing at all remains of the civilization you left behind. There is no one who even remembers that you left. Perhaps the monkeys are now running the show and they are trigger happy. Alien craft could be from earths our own distant past, they took a 20 year trip, came back to this mess. Traveling backwards in time just doesn't work however. The greatest gap you can achieve would be zero velocity, next to no gravity (just your own). Great the earth just took off at 2.5 million kilometres per hour and not much changed. Your certainly still moving forward in time. Worm holes, galactic strings and negative energy solutions all have that squishing problem again. It may be possible to view the past. Several quantum processes do seem to work backwards in time where the effect precedes the cause. To date however the cause is generally a current event not a past one. LOL that was a little hard on my imagination. Could a current effect be observed, having been indirectly created by a past cause that created an effect even further in the past thus causing the present observed effect. Sounds reasonable eh. ",

            "answer_text": "Copied From my Own Blog Cosmic Chatter - But not yet published. Time travel is an interesting concept and many fictional novels and TV shows have been written about it. We have also see videos, and photos of suspected time travellers. But what we still keep asking is, is time travel possible and what are the limitations etc. Well I want to answer some of these questions and propose a list of Time Travel Rules and regulations. Universal Concepts The universe is a big placeAlterations in time and space may affect the whole of the universeLocalised time and space alterations may cause ripples throughout the universeTime itself cannot be altered and moves on regardless of your actions.To stop Earths Time is to change the universes TimeTime Constant - Time does not stand still Even though we record time based on seconds, minutes, hours and years according to Earths rotation and how we experience it, time across the universe is governed the exactly the same. The entire universe experiences time movement at the same consistent rate. Time in space is sometimes measured by Light Speed. The time it takes light to travel in one year. Light Speed ~ 299 792 458 m/s If we were to meet an Alien their calculation of time would be most likely different to ours as it would relate to their world and how they experience it. In space today we tend to use atomic clocks for space time keeping, however as you will see with concepts such as time dilatation. These clocks become inaccurate as you change gravitational influences and high speed momentum. Time itself does not slow or speed up, but rather the clock timing mechanism becomes distorted. This dilation within the clock is a real issue and allowances are made for things such as GPS navigation. Einstein was on the right path with his special relativity but had fundamental errors due to a non-practical, unrealistic and inaccurate demonstrations. One proposed question, is time travel back in time, rewinding time, and going forward accelerating time? If time was a continuum and all events in front of us and behind us already exist then moving forward or backwards could be done with relative ease, and one would simple sit on a time bus and get off where they wanted. See H.G Wells \"The Time Machine\". You can see especially in the movie how events unfolded around the time traveller. In this event there would be no point of origin and you could come and go to any of the timeline points you liked.  However, if the time that has gone past is in fact that, gone, never to be seen again and time in front of us has yet to be written, time travel would be a much harder process. If only now exists you create a point of origin, a point of now. To step away from this point would require separating yourself from the now and rejoining the time line at your destination. More like the TV movie \"Back to the Future\" where they jump from one time period to the next.  If we did time jump, when we return do we return to the exact point in time we left? Point of Origin - The moving return point in time. The point of origin is the point in time in which is considered as now. The point of origin moves with time and moves forward at a constant and predictable rate. We are living it now. When a time traveller leaves a given \"point of origin\" that point continues to move forward. If the traveller travels to a different time and spends one hour, one day, one week etc. then the point of origin will have also have moved forward by that amount. The time traveller must return to the new point of origin on their return. Returning to the original time in which they left, is the traveller actually returning to the past as the point of origin has moved forward already. Altering the past may alter the future so care must be taken in returning to the correct time. Why does the point of origin move? Lets discount moving forward or backward in time for now. We know that time moves forward at the current rate in which it is doing right now. Just because the traveller no longer resides in the \"now\" time movement for the rest of us does not change and time continues to move forward at the same rate. If the person travelling in time experience time at their new time designation at the same rate of change as we do, then the hour he experiences is the same hour we experience. The traveller will age an hour, just as we will age an hour. Is the Point of Origin Irrelevant, if the Time Traveller is Outside the Now Time Influence? If however, we say the traveller has left the now. Are they not free to move around and return to the same point as they left. Whilst they are not in the now, the now time does not influence them, because they are outside of the NOW time? This is a hard question to answer, however it is logical to assume that we cannot stop time. To stop time would mean the ability to alter all aspects of the universe at once. To move or alter a limited space in and around time is far more logical and reasonable. Therefore, just because a traveller was to leave the now, does not mean the now time would stop, whilst they were away. Thus the concept behind the moving point of origin. The concept of a moving point of origin brings up the question of moving forward or backwards in time, would it make a difference? Is the Point of Origin Different for Moving Forward and Backwards in Time? Lets not go into cause and effect here. In moving backwards in time the reference point is a time period already experienced and the point of origin will hold as we have stated. Going back in time is like looking at a movie already made and picking a point to re-watch. Moving forward in time has an interesting context. If the future is yet to be written, then is the act of moving forward literally moving the point of origin to your destination. How do you watch a movie that has yet to be made? If I was frozen or in a coma and wake up some point in the future. Then It could be said that to my memory I have time jumped to a new Now period. For you to jump out of the now time and skip to the future, you have to literally wait till the future has been written to be able to observe it. If then returning to the point of origin that you left. you could be altering the future, as you are now in the past. before you do your head in over those points, I think it is time to look at cause and effect. Cause and Effect When we make choices the outcomes of our future change. But not just for us, they also change for other people as well. So as we make decisions, other people make decisions and every thing around us changes, all in an instant and we do not even know about it. A few good movies play on these concept well. Sliding Doors is a classic as we follow a lady who makes 1 different choice during the day. We then follow the two timelines and see the outcome of both. Well worth watching.  We all know ground hog day and the ability to change the future by revisiting the same day over again. Here are a few worth watching. Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow and a classic Run Lola Run. [gallery ids=\"4615,4614,4613\" type=\"rectangular\"] Here is the movie link for Run Lola Run.  Now when we go into the past and we make a change we alter the future of that event. Some changes will go unnoticed and have very little changes to the future, whilst others will cause huge changes that can will have huge impacts on everyone around the even and more. This is known as the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect How one simple act can change a huge amount after that event, and the effects can filter through everything around it.  Image these simple scenarios. You go back in time and see a dinosaur about to kill and eat some random mammal around at that time.You scare the dinosaur away.The random mammal runs away. Yay saved an animal.Dinosaur still hungry finds a new meal and kills and eats an ape.Ape was not an ape at all but the ancestor of humans and now no humans on the planet.You go back in time and kill Hitler as a boythe war never happens. Yay saved millions of lives.Women don't get to step up and workWomen's rights take 50 more year to developMy dad was a war baby, so I would not have been born either as too would many others.Over population happens quickerUSA did not drop bomb on Japan so no Nuclear arms agreement put in placeUSA and Russia nuke each other in cold war.You travel back in time an kiss a girl She falls in love with you. You have \"fun\" and make a baby.She was going to marry the person who ended up begin the parent of Einstein.Theory of relativity never invented etc.Even the smallest of changes in the past can effect the future. BASIC RULES OF TIME TRAVEL One must not change large fixed events (i.e Kill Hitler)One must not return to the same time point already visitedOne must not alter family linesOne can only take what is considered lost to time. (i.e. enter a burning building and taking something that was know to have been destroyed)One must be careful not to bring back technology that would change the future.A time traveller is not an adjustment bureau, but rather an observer.A time traveller is of community benefit and not a profit maker.Love to gain your thoughts on what would be the rules to time travel. And to your theories. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine you just created the first time machine. You are overjoyed. After decades of hard work, endless hours of studying, and millions of dollars in investments, you did it. You decide to first go back in time to kill hitler, so World War Two never starts. The second you do, everything stops. What just happened here was an infinite time loop. You go back in time to do something with the intention of doing it, and that instantly changed the future to include the effects of what you did. This means there would be no reason for you to go back in time, and you never make the change. This means it was never changed, so you go back in time to do something. See? It never stops. This is reason No. 1 why time travel could never exist. A possible way to reverse time would be to fly away from earth above light speed, then travel back at a faster speed. But how would that work? The universe, the space time continuum, they all have counter measures to prevent you from changing anything. TL;DR- time travel is impossible. If someone did find a loophole, they wouldn\u2019t destroy the machine for the danger, the universe already broke it. You just can\u2019t beat the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "He probably killed himself, if he went back in time before he was born, short term though is a bit of an unanswerable question. Maybe some of these explanations will help with your questions. Some people think time will stop, or reverse when the speed of light is broken. I think that time would continue to stretch with time dilation. Speed of Light (c): Light travels at a constant speed of 1,079,252,848.8 (1.07 billion) km per hour. That works out to 299,792,458 m/s, or about 670,616,629 mph (miles per hour). That is just a random number. If you could see a light clock, on a light beam exceeding 670,616,629 mph, I doubt you would see it freeze, and stop, but this is my opinion, I could be wrong. As for going back in time, by exceeding the speed of light, I doubt that would happen also. If you could see the behavior of a light clock as it travels at the speed of light. You would see the the beam move from the top of the clock to the bottom, and back to the top again, to complete 1 second, as the light clock moves forward through space. If you are not familiar with what a light clock is you can see how a light clock works in this video below, you can skip to 20 minutes, and 30 seconds to see the explanation about how a light clock works.  So you see the light clock create a V shape, as it moves from the top to the bottom, and back to the top again. So no matter how fast you are going the V shape is just going to get longer, and longer as speed increases, from point A to point B, even if the distance from point A to point B is googolplex long amount of distance in light years. The V shape of the light clock, would never stop growing longer as speed is constantly increased, or stop, or reverse, why would it, it can't. Even if it takes a googolplex amount of time in light years for the light clock to move vertically by 1 cm, time has not stopped, message me if I am wrong. If you have a time machine, you need to be able to lock up the time period you left from causality effects, effecting it. Imagine if the time machine you had could move things from the past, from the future. Move a quark out of place in an atom in a grain of sand, on a beach 1000 years ago. Something as little as this, is enough to change the whole history of the earth from that point on.  If you watch videos on the grandfather paradox it is a misconception that you can have enough time to stand in front of him to pull the trigger, let alone have a conversation with him.  You cannot go back in time and get the winning lottery numbers, you cannot kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor attack, you cannot save JFK, or stop September 11th. You can only change these things if the time machine can lock up causality effects (keep the time period you came from from causality effects effecting it) But the changes would never count in reality you came from, just the other dimension you went back into, and messed around in. If a machine can do something as amazing as recreate the past, then locking up causality should be no problem for the time machine to do. Maybe people from the future go into the past in the technique I described above, or have the technology to view the past from the future on a television monitor, without causing any causality effects. These are the only two ways I can think of that do not effect causality. In another causality experiment I thought if its the interactions with people, and other things which cause causality, then what if you went back in time into a solid thick steel container, that was buried ten miles deep down in the in moons crust, it would be one mile thick in every direction up, down, left, right, forwards, and backwards. So if you go back in time into the container on the moon, it should not create any causality effects, because you do not interact with anything. The ripple effects of causality have been subdued. There would be dampening systems in the container to stop your vibrations, but it may not be enough, and not work at all. Just interacting with the air molecules could be enough to cause causality, even the space in the container. Dark matter, and energy is still not understood, and time travel into the past into the steel container could have an effect on the way dark matter, and dark energy effect other objects, to maybe cause causality.  Unless the aliens have a time machine, but they are not going to share, because we are about money, greed, exciting our excitatory neurotransmitters, and power, and cannot be trusted, even if we can understand the time machine technology they created, if explained to us by them.  Aliens explaining how their time machine works to us, It might be like explaining calculus to a ape. Maybe we are just not smart enough to understand it. The most visited place by a time traveler if possible, would be the bookstore depository where Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK, or the Dinosaur period.   Maybe there is some clues around there of future time travelers, especially in the Zapruder film of JFK being assassinated.   Some people think this lady in this picture is a time traveler, they call her the Babushka Lady. Short term time travel though like 10 seconds into the past, I am unsure about the outcome, in this other thought experiment. The time is 11:45 a.m. a time traveler decides to visit himself in the past, he would go into the past at 12:00 p.m. exactly, back in time to 11:50 a.m. He would go back in time from across the room from himself, (because both time traveler's cannot occupy the same space). So at 11:50 a.m. he knows that he will see another copy of himself appear from the other side of the room. But he says to himself before the time travel experiment, that no matter what happens, it must be set in stone that he must go back at 12:00 p.m, because if he does not, who is the other person standing across the room from him. So can the time traveler visit himself, have a conversation with himself for less than 10 minutes, before going back in time. I am unsure to what's the answer? Will time and space, not be able to handle this paradox, and causality would instantly kill him.Causality would thrust him instantly somewhere else, but not kill him.If it is allowed a endless loop would be created, where time would never go past 12:01 p.m. ever. Because it was set in stone that the time traveler would always go back in time at 12:00 p.m. no matter what happens. So what the 4th possibility.Orbiting a black hole to time travel into the future is a lot safer than using a neutron star, because of gamma waves, and there would be a problem with the landing, neutron stars have an escape velocity of about 33% the speed of light. Which means that any object caught in a neutron star\u2019s gravity would be accelerated to a tremendous speed. If you are not ripped apart during your descent (you would be), all of your atoms would most likely be destroyed upon impact, for the most part you would be turned into a pile of neutrons. There is also this YouTube video below, of Stephen Hawking explaining how to a black hole can be used to time travel into the future, by orbiting the black hole. Look at Ronald Mallet's time machine on YouTube, but it can only send information back to the point when it was switched on. Hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "Traveling to the future is very possible (relativity, Einstein) and there is experimental proof. Regarding travel to the past, one of three things is true. One: travel to the past is possible and there are an infinite number of parallel universes. All possible outcomes of a decision that CAN happen, DO happen in a series of alternate realities. Thus, time paradoxes are a non-issue as a change to the past would merely create a new future in a parallel universe rather than alter the one from wince the time traveler came. It would also mean that if the traveler travels back to his present, it will not be the present he left but rather the alternate one he created. Getting back to the original universe would prove impossible. Thus, from the point of view of the universe the traveler originally left, travel to the past would be unprovable and thus deemed impossible. Two: There is only one single universe, casualty is a thing, and time paradoxes are real. In such a universe, the very act of traveling to the past would alter the future such that the future from which the person traveled did not happen. Thus, time travel to the past is deemed impossible. Three: time travel to the past is impossible. All three possibilities, from our point of view, yield the same result. Edit: a fourth option might be that it is somehow possible to observe the past without interacting with it. The events have already occurred. You are merely somehow viewing them. This would be provable and perfectly safe. Of course, by this definition, everyone with a box of home movies has a time machine. ",

            "answer_text": "In one of my favorite Harry Potter fan fictions (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) Harry is given a time turner and begins to think of all sorts of amazing things you could do with it. I think if someone did finally invent a time machine, they would probably have something like this happen to them   Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his motionless hands. Harry had just had an idea for a truly brilliant experimental test. It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was why he had cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to be tested right away, immediately, now. Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his bed, yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs, and started moving boxes of books around. (He really needed to unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he hadn't had time.) Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs. The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the Great Hall and start the day. \"Excuse me can you do something for me?\" said Harry. He was flipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with the first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the book at Anthony Goldstein. \"Pick two three-digit numbers from this list. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them together and tell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to double-check? Please make really sure you've got the right answer, I'm not sure what's going to happen to me or the universe if you make a multiplication error.\" It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over the past few days that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything like \"Why'd you suddenly flip out?\" or \"That seems really weird, what are your reasons for asking?\" or \"What do you mean, you're not sure what's going to happen to the universe?\" Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment and quill. Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to see anything, dancing back and forth and bouncing up and down with impatience. He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got ready to write. \"Okay,\" Anthony said, \"One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four hundred and twenty-nine.\" Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he'd just written down, and Anthony confirmed it. Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk, glanced at his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and then shut his eyes. Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps, followed by the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding shut. (Harry wasn't worried about suffocating. An automatic Air-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you were willing to buy a really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have to worry about electric bills.) And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been hoping to see, a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift of his future self. Call that piece of paper \"Paper-2\". Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad. Call that \"Paper-1\". It was, of course, the same piece of paper. You could even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges matched. Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would follow. If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write \"101 x 101\" down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back in time, drop off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and head on up out of the cavern level to join his dorm mates for breakfast. If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it, Harry would multiply those numbers together. If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those two numbers on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time. Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write down the new pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the number on the right greater than 997, in which case Harry would add 2 to the number on the left and write down 101 on the right. And if Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1 blank. Which meant that the only possible stable time loop was the one in which Paper-2 contained the two prime factors of 181,429. If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer that was easy to check but hard to find. He wouldn't have just shown that P=NP once you had a Time-Turner, this trick was more general than that. Harry could use it to find the combinations on combination locks, or passwords of every sort. Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets, if Harry could figure out some systematic way of describing all the locations in Hogwarts. It would be an awesome cheat even by Harry's standards of cheating. Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it. Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting: DO NOT MESS WITH TIME Harry wrote down \"DO NOT MESS WITH TIME\" on Paper-1 in slightly shaky handwriting, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any more truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least fifteen years old. To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest experimental result in the entire history of science. ",

In fact I would have to say it is highly unlikely. The invention and the construction of a time machine will inevitably be preceded by some other conditions: Physicists will have reconciled all forces into a Grand Unified TheoryQuantum computers will be more available though not necessarily replacing traditional computersNew type of math will have been invented to feed the quantum computer and to describe the grand unifying theorySuperconductors will operate within domestic refrigeration temperatures so that the right kinds of electromagnetic fields can be constructedUltra high density and efficiency solar cells to allow for extremely high level of energy conversionsUltracapacitors will be more commonplace and affordable to store the energy.Now, is it possible that some sort of reclusive genius was able to fulfil all these conditions in secrecy? Yes, its possible. But not very likely. Especially in today\u2019s day and age. When someone does eventually invent a time machine, it will come as no surprise to the people living in that period. ",

            "answer_text": "If Time travel to your own past, is possible then there may be many times it was or will be invented. One explanation is that there are many timelines and ours is one where we have not been obviously visited by people from the future. A similar argument is used to explain why we seem not to have been visited by real aliens in flying saucers. There are may other stars and planets aliens might visit first. On the other hand if aliens or time travelers exist we might expect to find some evidence. Some argue that our world is a computer simulation running on a giant quantum computer. Maybe the programmers set a game in pre-time travel situation. Almost anything is possible but Science looks at evidence. In situations where there is no evidence we sometimes have to guess. Hawking seemed to think that if Time Travelers exist they should have come to the party he hosted. The simplest explanation is Time Machines are impossible but (to my thinking) the mathematics of time and space seem to suggest otherwise. E.g. Hawking wrote a paper where saddle shaped bends in spacetime should allow reverse time effects. Some aspects of spacetime math only seem to allow time travel at first glance but once you look into the details you find things are not as they first appear. This is especially true of non-quantum models such as Einstein\u2019s original special relativity. As we understand quantum logic better through quantum computing and quantum physics nano technology we may get a better handle on how the quantum world works. When we do the aspects of time related to the quantum nature of our universe may show us how to do things with time that not seem impossible. ",

They used space somewhere at MIT, but they wanted donations to cover things like coffee and soda and donuts (maybe even pizza). I thought the idea was both simple and clever enough to warrant me sending $10.00. The coordinator sent me an email thanking me, and asked me if I would be attending the \u2018convention\u2019 the following month. I replied, \u201cYes, I did. I had a wonderful time.\u201d Yeah, its like that. ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to travel through time? To answer this question, we must be a bit more specific about what we mean by traveling through time. Discounting the everyday progression of time, the question can be divided into two parts: Is it possible, within a short time (less than a human life span), to travel into the distant future? And is it possible to travel into the past? \"Our current understanding of fundamental physics tells us that the answer to the first question is a definite yes, and to the second, maybe. \"The mechanism for traveling into the distant future is to use the time-dilation effect of Special Relativity, which states that a moving clock appears to tick more slowly the closer it approaches the speed of light. This effect, which has been overwhelmingly supported by experimental tests, applies to all types of clocks, including biological aging. \"If one were to depart from the earth in a spaceship that could accelerate continuously at a comfortable one g (an acceleration that would produce a force equal to the gravity at the earth's surface), one would begin to approach the speed of light relative to the earth within about a year. As the ship continued to accelerate, it would come ever closer to the speed of light, and its clocks would appear to run at an ever slower rate relative to the earth. Under such circumstances, a round trip to the center of our galaxy and back to the earth--a distance of some 60,000 light-years--could be completed in only a little more than 40 years of ship time. Upon arriving back at the earth, the astronaut would be only 40 years older, while 60,000 years would have passed on the earth. (Note that there is no 'twin paradox,' because it is unambiguous that the space traveler has felt the constant acceleration for 40 years, while a hypothetical twin left behind on a spaceship circling the earth has not.)

And for some reason, there's this chatter about time travel being proved impossible. That's the first sign that it's someone talking out of their field. There has been no proof that time travel is impossible, in fact that's why Stephen Hawking came up with his Chronology Protection Conjecture which failed (even I killed it six ways to Sunday - Experimental and Theoretical Analysis Of Chronology Protection Conjecture Failing On The Discovery Channel ). To give a straight answer to the question, sure, somewhere, somewhen, in some parallel universe, some dork could have invented a time machine and gotten scared and destroyed it, but it's highly unlikely. Anyone smart enough to actually design, engineer and build a time machine would have a lot more on the ball to know exactly what they were doing in using it. Or they just wouldn't make it back home.

            "answer_text": "Depends on if events are mutable or immutable in time. Normally I\u2019d prove the following point with some graph theory, but I\u2019ll try to keep it to text. Provided a timeline P there can be only 3 resultant possibilities: Time travel is either not possible, not discovered, or is never used within timeline P.Timeline P creates time travel and uses it to effect event T at some time in the past. However temporal events are immutable and not subject to change, thus timeline P transitions back onto P following attempt to alter event T.Timeline P creates time travel and uses it to change event T at some point in the past, thus resulting in transition to a new timeline Q. This leaves one of 2 sub-possibilities:Timeline Q eventually creates time travel and further transitions to a 3rd timeline R.Timeline Q does not discover time travel or never uses it to effect the past.An observer standing at the end of time on the primary timeline looking back could then only see a timeline with 1 of 2 following inevitable features: Time travel (possible or impossible) is never created and/or used to effect the past. It may have been used, but would\u2019ve resulted in the annihilation of the timeline upon which it was created and would only eventually result in the observer\u2019s timeline after some number of time travel event transitions. This is the case if temporal events are mutable.Time travel (possible or impossible) is created or not created, but any and every event in time is all-inclusive of any attempts to alter that event. Thus nothing can be changed, but time travel remains possible without destroying your pocket-universe of a timeline. This is the case if temporal events are immutable.The first of these last 2 points can be further expanded to include the perspective of an individual in the present. Looking forward you will never observe time travel. If you do then your present at the time of observation and thus your memory of observing it will inevitably be overwritten with a new timeline wherein you did not observe such an event. Thus, though time travel may be possible, it is likely impossible for you to both observe it, use it and alter time. Though it would still be possible to time travel and observe time travel provided that events are immutable. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the possibilities is that somewhere in the future time travel was discovered and people from that period of time already traveled into the past, some of which might be the present day for us. In other words what is to say that people from the future are not among us today, doing what they came here to do without telling anyone about it? When it comes to destroying the time machine I figure that once the breakthrough in technology happens, destroying the first model or so will only delay the process with a few years. It\u2019s not like if the first human who invented the wheel destroyed it for some reason, we wouldn\u2019t have known that invention as a species as some point. I think time traveling, if possible, is strictly related to a discovery in science that will probably coincide with a new step in our evolution as humans. It will be demarcated as a point from which you can look back and say \u2018before time traveling\u2019 and \u2018after time traveling\u2019 as two distinct eras. It would be greater than Jesus, The Industrial Revolution and the discovery of Evolution put together, and will probably be connected to space traveling outside our solar system. Following the breakthrough in science, time machines will be manufactured by private companies who will compete for the most affordable, reliable model until governments around the world will put restrictions on it. People will still build them and travel back in time \u201cillegally\u201d probably realizing that nothing that they would do in the past affects the present because they would be traveling in a different past that the one they\u2019ve already lived in, therefore they will be influencing the future of the people from the past, who are not the same with the people from the future that traveled into the past, and for which the future will be different than the future from which the people traveled back from. In other words the multiverse theory would be confirmed, or created at that moment of the first time travel. ",

It might just \"go away\" due to its own action.Consider the situation where a time machine can be invented, and it allows someone to actively change the timeline in some way (i.e. a change in the past causes events to unfold differently).Now consider that such a situation makes the timeline itself unstable. It will flap about to different sequences of events, the changes being large or small, self-correcting or significant, depending on what is done by each time machine user.This is, in physics terms, an unstable system. The changes will continue until the system reaches some point of stability, whereupon the changes will stop and the timeline would run smoothly.I would suggest that the only two possible situations of stability would be1) a timeline where the time machine was never invented, or2) a timeline where such a machine existed but was unable to change the past.And of course, the people living on that timeline (i.e. us) would never get to hear about the changes that might have happened prior to the stabilisation.

            "answer_text": "No one will ever invent time machine. Why? Simple reason, and you don\u2019t have to know anything about mechanisc, physics, mathematics, or basically any science at all, to know that to be true. The reason is if anyone will ever invent time machine, even in 100.000 years, we would know, cause he would travel in any year before the date I\u2019m writing this on (in 2017). I don\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t. And if he would, we would know, I don\u2019t think something like that could be hidden, especially if we know that if a time machine would ever be invented, there would not only be one person traveling to one time, but millions of people would travel to countless times. Since we never heard of any such case, time traveling will never happen. At least not to the past. I know there are theories which say that every time traveling would create a parallel universe, and that the timeline of ours would not be affected. Still, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, since someone would still eventually travel to our universe, which would be parallel to theirs Only possible explanation which I could accept, would be that each time someone travels back in time and changes something, everything else also changes instantly. Like our memories. So maybe all of things in your lifes which you remember, maybe \u201chappened\u201d one second ago, cause someone changed the whole history of universe with a time travel, and thus also your memory changed. And that could happen constantly and we just don\u2019t know it. But in that case time traveler himself would not be able to time travel at all, since if he would change anything in the past, also his \u201cfuture\u201d invention of a time machine could not manifest. I mean, what if he dies in the past, how could he invent anything in the future? And thus negating his own time travel? Of course in this case, he would not die in the past, since his death prevented him to time travel, and thus he could invent the time machine again\u2026 ok, I just blew my own mind here :) So yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever possible to time traven, except if there is some methaphysical knowledge I am not aware of.

Quantum physics treats time rather oddly. The results of an event and its observation by a sentient being vary to the \u2018n\u2019 degree. For every action there are an infinite number of responses. Responses occur for every permutation of outcome and each permutation occurs in an alternate reality (many world hypothesis). The only hypotheses associated with time travel occur in Einstein\u2019s general theory of Relativity. Not sure there have been successfully tested and reported in the scientific literature. I never view anything impossible. It\u2019s best to view the concept within a given set of parameters. Is time travel possible within the limits of known physics? Probably. Might have time travel occurred in nature or in a more advanced civilization somewhere? Possible. ",

(Based on no scientific knowledge or evidence. ) Time travel will be invented multiple times and those travels will end with a pop or a splat. I\u2019m thinking that it is possible to travel backwards in time, but not in space. So you travel backwards in time 100 years and everything seems fine except the earth is travelling approximately 3.08 million kilometres per hour which means that you are a long way from home. That's where the pop comes in. Maybe you will get lucky and land in another galaxy on another habitable planet. Unfortunately it's also travelling at approximately 3.08 million kilometres per hour in a slightly different direction, which is where the splat comes in. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not really. The best you do is either travel at near light speed or subject your self to a high gravitational field or acceleration (if you can survive that), so that time travels slower for you than others at a lower acceleration, velocity, or gravitational field. When you stop traveling so fast or decrease the acceleration or gravitational field, since time will have moved slower for you, it will seem like you have traveled into the future. Of course, you will not be able to travel to the past doing this sort of thing. Borrowing from the Fermi paradox, if time travel were possible, why is that no one from the future has come to visit? Even if in general travelers from the future try to hide themselves, eventually someone would be discovered. Note people come in all types, and eventually there would be an unethical time traveler trying to manipulate events. Regarding Xepsis Klerglemoss, I could be wrong, but I thing that back then, one had to pose for photos. Action shots were not easy to capture, and it is clear from the photo that the photo of him was taken while he was posing as opposed to running or trying to hide, and the photo could have been taken any time and then given another date. It is hard to imagine someone who suddenly finds themselves without clothing, posing for photo, instead of trying to figure out how to hide or find clothing. However, it makes for a great story. ",

These time machines of which you speak, do they only send you back in time? Where are you dropped off? In the same physical location as where the time machine was located when you left? Because if so, you might want to be sure you dress appropriately, and I don\u2019t mean some pirate\u2019s costume or Roman toga. More like a space suit with a fair amount of oxygen, food and water, because your ride hasn\u2019t arrived yet and depending on how far you go back, you might have to wait a while. If you only go back a short while (seconds, minutes) you might want to be prepared for trying to occupy the same space as say, a mountain. Which brings us to this set of questions\u2026What happens to the space you occupied just prior to leaving? Something akin to cavitation I would think (nature abhors a vacuum)\u2026probably pretty noisy at least. And\u2026What happens to the air (or rock or whatever) that was occupying the space you just jumped into (assuming you at least landed near your home planet, or another celestial body, or an alien spacecraft, or\u2026)?And, associated with the first question is whether or not your momentum is conserved during the \u2018travel\u2019\u2026 are you moving at the same rate/speed/direction as when you \u2018left\u2019? So, if that is the case, and #1 isn\u2019t somehow taken care of (meaning you time machine does not also provide positional adjustments to properly locate you), then not only do you just pop into space at the same place (\u2018point in space\u2019) from which you left, now you fly off on a tangent, and your planet will never arrive to pick you up!

The reality is that only matter exists, bits of physical matter that fling around at high speeds, glob on to other bits of matter to form atoms and molecules and/or bounce around randomly exerting some kind of effect on anything it collides with. The tiniest bits of matter form fields of force that push entire galaxies in specific directions and possibly even induce gravitation\u2026 while the largest globs of matter tend to aggregate into large regions of star systems, dust clouds, and other celestial objects to form galaxies of varying shapes. There isn\u2019t some independent phenomenon called \u201ctime\u201d. When we measure time, it\u2019s really only a metric of the underlying foundation of the motion of matter. In all our observations of our immediate location and of our own Solar System, our own Milky Way galaxy, and what we can see outside of our galaxy, there isn\u2019t a single observation that\u2019s supernatural in nature. So to believe in completely supernatural concepts/theories such as time travel, wormholes, portals, warp drive, Alcubierre drives, or additional spatial dimensions would be downright ignorant, because everything we can see and experience and evidence is completely the opposite. I would suggest that General Relativity falls firmly into the same category as time travel. ",

Einsteinian physics espouses that at the speed of light - when matter becomes pure energy - time stands still, and that it is physically impossible to even approach the speed of light, much less go beyond it for time travel. What this boils down to is that you can never have a time machine that is made out of matter, for the inherent limitation of matter will lead to an insurmountable obstacle in manifesting time travel! The time barrier will definitely be broken but not by high tech engineers. Many have tried many times. By the way, The Reticulan Empire can't do it either. That is why, after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed in 1945, the Zetan-Greys expressed their dislike to abductees about Terran atomic weapons being developed. Even more significantly: the space empire failed to venture back in time to the USA in the early 1940\u2019s to stop The Manhatten Project in the first place! Time travel will be achieved by future ascended masters who have learned to harness the most powerful source of energy in ALL THAT IS (beyond Reticulan antimatter reactor technology - like our current artificial sun): The Infinite Light of God. The power source that The Intelligent Designer used to create the universe! ",

Therefore, let us assume that it is possible to easily go back in time, when you do, you will find that the Earth is not where you left it. You might find yourself in mid air, in solid rock or, most likely, the vacuum of space. My conclusion is that if time travel could happen, we would also need some pretty sophisticated abilities to move to an exact space as well. Perhaps that could be possible to coordinate both space and time with some future calculation ability, but I doubt it has already happened. ",

Let\u2019s just say that it is possible to travel back in time. The Earth is not just travelling through time, it is travelling through three-dimensional space. It is going around the sun. The sun is going around the galaxy. The galaxy is moving through an expanding universe with no fixed reference point and accelerating at some rate. Your machine needs to put you back to a specific point in space-time - not just in time. If the calculation is off by a tiny, tiny amount, you will probably die. ",
