            "answer_text": "For answering that question, first we need to elaborate what the mathematics is and what theory is? So the mathematics first!! Q. What is mathematics? A. Mathematcs is a subject? Q. Subject of What? A. Subject of Knowledge? Q. Knowledge of What? A. Knowledge of Reality of the Unicerrse? And the reality of the Universe is Something like Nothing.. For Nothing refer following answer: Tufail Abbas's answer to If we say the Universe started up from 'Nothing' why do we always find 'something' in that 'Nothing'? Hence the starting point is Reality of the Universe. Knowlegde originated from Reality of the Universe, otherwise we should accept that Knowledge is from outside the Universe. Subject originated from Knowlege, otherwise we should accept that subjects(e.g. Maths) is not the knowkedge. In this way, Mathematics is a sub-set of Reality. So if we understand the superset (i.e. Reality) directly then it is not necessary that it should be understood with assistance of sub-sets.(I.e. maths) Rather, with the help of this super-set , it would be possible to explain sub-sets. But it is possible that somebody holding the super-set might not be in a possession of the keys to unlock the dimensions of sub-sets. Therefore, it will still require the assistance (keys) from people with expertise in sub-sets to unlock the superset into components of subsets, for the benifit of the people who cannot directly grasp the superset. The outcome of this last step is that which we call THEORY. However , if if if, it would be possible for everybody to directly understand the superset, then they by themselves will be able to explore , understand and explain the meaning of Mathematical Operators from the Reality of the Universe, and not vice versa. And such possibility might result into development of a observable physical theory without maths, otherwise it is difficult. This is because Mathematics is not from outside this Universe. It has certainly originated from Reality of the Universe, not vice versa. For similiar philosophy refer BIG QUESTIONS ",

            "answer_text": "\"Observable physical theory\" to me means anything in the scope of observation in the physical world. The word \"theory\" that you used is a contradiction in every sense with the rest of your question... Because theories are about ideas. This question makes me think of the great inventors (aka Einstein) of physical phenomena that was being and continues to be observed and thought about. \"Physical theory\" is different than \"physical phenomena\" (of course) in the meaning. Anyway... Understanding exactly what you mean is critically important. In one sense, the answer is \"true\" but in the other sense (like the behavior of my friend's wife) the answer is not so much based on math as it is based on behaviorology... Which is a related to things that have a huge impact on the real physical world as well. Does that make sense please?Prof Doug ",
