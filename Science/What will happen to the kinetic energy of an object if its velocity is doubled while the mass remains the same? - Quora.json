            "answer_text": "let me give you the answer with explanation, we know, Kinetic Energy = (1/2) m(v^2) where, m= mass of the body v= velocity with which it is moving If we double velocity then velocity will be = 2 X v = 2v put the value of velocity=2v in the formula of kinetic energy kinetic energy = (1/2)m((2v)^2) = (1/2)m(4v^2) = 4 x (1/2)m(v^2) = 2m(v^2) thus , kinetic energy will be 4 times the initial kinetic energy.
