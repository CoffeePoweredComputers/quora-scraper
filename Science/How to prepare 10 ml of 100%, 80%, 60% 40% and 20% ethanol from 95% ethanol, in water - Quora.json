            "answer_text": "Well, actually, 95% is already the maximum concentration of ethanol in water you can get by distillation (look up something a minimum boiling azeotrope). So, without using some kind of dehydrating chemicals to extract the last 5% water you can not get 100% ethanol. To get the lower concentrations, simply take some samples of the 95% and dilute them with the right amount of water. I assume those percentages are by volume so start with, say 10 mL of your 95% solution. that means 9.5 mL of that are ethanol. now figure out how much the total volume should be to make it whatever percentage you need. For example, [math]80\\% = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.80 = \\frac{V_{Etoh}}{V_{total}} = \\frac{9.5}{V_{total}}[/math] rearranging this to solve for total volume gives you [math]V_{total}= \\frac{9.5}{0.80}[/math] Now, change the .80 for whatever concentration you want and you can get the rest. each time, you add [math]V_{total}-10.0 mL[/math] since you already have 10 mL of liquid to start with.

            "answer_text": "95 x V= 10 x 80So V= 10 x 80/95= 8.42- ml.Therefore when we pipette out exactly 8.42- ml into a 10- ml standard flask and then dilute with distilled water up to the mark you will get 80% Ethanol in water. (Or)Add (10\u20138.42)= 1.58- ml of distilled water to 8.42- ml of 95% Ethanol and mix, you will get 80% Ethanol.Similarly the amount of 95% ETHANOL and distilled water to be mixed are given below to get various Ethanol (%) concentrations.Vol.of 95% Ethanol ==> water===> % got8.42 (ml)=======> 1.58 (ml) ===> 80%6.32( ml)=======> 3.68 (ml )==> 60%4.21(ml )========> 5.79 (ml)==> 40%3.16 (ml)========> 6.84( ml)==> 20%A 100% solution of ETHANOL cannot be prepared from a 95% solution.",
