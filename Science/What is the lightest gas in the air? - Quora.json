            "answer_text": "Water, yes water! The most abundant gases in the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and water vapour. Since the amount of water vapour varies, i.e. the humidity varies, the abundances of the other gases are usually given for dry air. By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen (N2), 20.95% oxygen (O2), 0.95% argon (Ar) and 0.04% carbon dioxide (CO2). Water vapour (H2O) can vary between 0 and 1\u20132%, but averages 0.4%. When water vapour is present the concentrations of the other gases decrease proportionally by volume. No other gas is present in air at more than 0.01 %. Neon is next at 0.0018%. A question about the lightest gas is really a question about the least dense gas. If you filled a balloon with the gas, would it float or sink in air, ignoring the wight of the balloon itself. Under normal atmospheric conditions all 5 gases can be regarded as ideal gases. That means their density under standard temperature and pressure (STP, 0 \u00b0C, 100 kPa) is proportional to their molecular weight. Their molecular weights are (approximately): N2 28 g/mol; O2 32 g/mol; Ar 40 g/mol; CO2 44 g/mol and H20 18 g/mol, which immediately tells you that water is the least dense or lightest. Yes water! At standard temperature and pressure air has a density of 1.29 grams per litre (g/L). At STP pure nitrogen has a density of 1.25 g/L, oxygen 1.43 g/L, argon 1.78 g/L, carbon dioxide 1.98 g/L and water 0.80 g/L. That tells you that if enclosed in a hypothetical weightless balloon and released into the atmosphere, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide would sink, whilst water would rise. Although it would theoretically rise, pure nitrogen is so close to the density of air (1.25 vs 1.29 g/L) that no practical experiment would produce this result. Also note that water vapor would rapidly condense if raised to a concentration of 0.80 g/L at STP, which is well above it\u2019s condensation point in air (about 0.005 g/L at 0 \u00b0C), but the fact that it is lighter than air is seen that when the humidity increases, the density of air decreases. For example at sea level and 20 \u00b0C, dry air has a density of 1.203 g/L, whilst air saturated with water has a density of 1.193 g/L. The concentration of water in air at 20 Celsius and 100% humidity is 0.017 g/L. The difference increases as temperature increases. At 40 \u00b0C dry air at sea level has a density of 1.127 g/L. Saturated air has a density of 1.096 g/L. A parcel of moist air will rise in dry air! Theoretically at least. ",

Helium is the next heaviest gas present in our atmosphere and is present in trace amounts. If you specified a minimum concentration, I could provide additional gases that meet your criteria. ",
