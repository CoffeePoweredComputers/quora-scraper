            "answer_text": "Well, the opposite of stability is collapse, so \"political stability\" generally refers to where a nation's politics fit on a spectrum between those two extremes. A nation that is constantly having political coups or revolutions or civil wars would be said to have very low political stability, since there would be very low levels of respect for the existing political order, constitution, and government institutions by key political players like politicians, judges, and army officers. One could not take it for granted that, say, the president would be in power (or perhaps even alive) within a year, regardless of how long he was supposed to rule, simply because the political culture would be so chaotic and disrespectful basically any assumption, custom, or convention would have a high likelihood of being ignored or undermined for any number of reasons. A nation with high political stability would be one where politics was extremely predictable. For example, an extremely oppressive totalitarian dictatorship that had been ruled by the same family for ten generations. There'd be no question about who was running the show, or who would be running the show in the future, or whose orders everyone was going to obey in a system like that. But a country that's been a safe and peaceful democracy for more than a century \u2014 like say the United States, Canada, or Sweden \u2014 would be very stable as well, since their history would help foster enormous public reverence for respecting the traditions of elections and resolving political disputes within the well-understood rules and precedences of the constitution. Totalitarian governments are probably the most stable, followed by established democracies, then mid-to-long term dictatorships, then countries that have only recently embraced either democracy or dictatorship, then so-called \"failed states\" that have been wracked by years of internal political violence or severe economic/natural disaster. But every government has the seeds of some instability. Sometimes a totalitarian dictatorship doesn't have a clear succession plan. Sometimes a long established democracy is confronted with a \"constitutional crisis\" that introduces a problem for which there is no understood tradition for addressing. And sometimes nations have their stability threatened by other countries who hope provoking war could help address their own stability deficit. ",

            "answer_text": "With the other answers dealing with the conservative politicians approach on stability, let me answer with a different approach. Stability usually describes the quality of a system that allows the system to return to a balanced normal condition. As you might notice, this normality is open for discussion and has to be set by something like a community\u2019s constitution (democracy et al.) OR the opinions of an individual or small group (autocracy et al.). The problem with a very conservative definition of stability is that it is usually off-center. Imagine it like the definition of a good citizen. The conservative might say that the good citizen follows the law, does not risk his health and takes care of of his children. Unfortunately this does apply for a dead citizen as well. But every changing condition would make it impossible for the late citizen to adapt, no matter how well adapted he is to the defined need of the society he was a part of. Now look at stable political systems. If their only approach to problems is only violence, increasing the power of the executive or trying to keep eternal growth at all costs, they are acting like a dead person already as the solution to the problem might be the cause, but the state might be too dead to notice. From this perspective political stability is defined as resilience, the ability to adapt to external influences and get back up on your feet. Without actually killing yourself on the way up. You might need to hurt yourself, but the more you have to, the less stable you are actually. Like someone being pushed or hit, the more stable you are the less you stumble, fall (physical stability) or pull out a gun (mental stability). ",

Life and economic activity can continue normally for most people.In practice, this will be a bit different in different countries. China would be described as politically stable. Their government changes, not by a democratic process, but without a major upheaval. Some nominally democratic countries would not be described as politically stable. ",
