            "answer_text": "Edwin Powell Hubble is the man most directly associated with the discovery that red shift generally increases with distance, throughout the Universe. His work was not done in a vacuum, of course. His conclusions were based on the accumulated evidence gathered by people like Henrietta Swan Leavitt on Cephids - a type of variable star whose variability is directly tied to their inherent luminescence, and which therefore act as a very good measure of the distance of the cosmic body in which they exist. Their luminescence falls off with distance in the direct linear pattern of all objects in space, but their variability determines how luminescent they must actually be at zero distance. That combination determines their distance, while the redshift in that luminescence determines their relative speed towards, or away from you. Thus he concluded that objects at greater distance were all, apparently traveling away from us faster, and therefore space, itself was expanding. (He is also the man who inferred from these conclusions that the physical Universe extended way beyond our own galaxy and that some 'nebulae' were actually entire other galaxies beyond our own. This was a precursor to his mind-expanding, Universe-expanding second conclusion.) In itself these realisations did not lead to the flood of discoveries that followed, but they do represent the opening of the flood gates, so I think the crown belongs with Edwin Hubble - especially since his published findings caused Albert Einstein to realise that some of the implications of his own Theory of general Relativity - which he had disregarded for several years and not published - were not, in fact, down to calculation error, but were directly attributable to the Universe that Hubble was describing. Einstein, himself, had not accepted the model of the Universe that his theories implied, which Hubble's conclusions eventually provided corroborating evidence for. This last point is one of the best examples of how adopting a new line of reasoning is not hindered by the things that this new line of thought, in itself, implies (for that is simple acceptance of the logic) but in discarding your former assumptions, which get in the way of what the Universe is trying to tell you: \"the base metal will never turn itself into gold. Stop poisoning yourself, for the real truth is more beautiful than you can possibly imagine\". ",

            "answer_text": "In 1916 Einstein published his theory of general relativity. With this he also proposed a theoretical model of Universe (which was not expanding). Then in 1927 Georges Lemaitre proposed the big bang theoretical model of the expanding universe. In around 1930 astronomer Edwin Hubble found that all galaxies were flying away from each other in all directions as predicted by the model of the expanding universe. So scientists conjectured that in distant past (13.8 billion years ago) all the matter of the universe was confined to a single point called Singularity which did not really explode but it underwent what is called Inflation, which means very rapid (exponential) expansion of the universe. Then George Gammow and other scientists predicted hot big bang. They calculated the temperature of the cooled universe at present time. This was experimentally verified by Wilson and Penzias and later others to be 2.7 degree Kelvin. This established the big bang theory as a viable theory of creation. ",
