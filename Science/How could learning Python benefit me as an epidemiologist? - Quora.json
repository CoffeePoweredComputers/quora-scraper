            "answer_text": "Learning Python, or any other high-level general-purpose programming language, would give you tools to rapidly solve problems that may look hard or impossible to solve by yourself right now. It may therefore make you more productive at what you do, possibly a lot more productive. Let's invent an example: you will be able to download, clean up, and transform a data set from the web (e.g. diseases and statistics from a CDC web page that doesn't provide a structured data source); get a list of all tweets that mention these diseases in the last day; perform some kind of analysis on the resulting data set (e.g. get the geographical distribution); and then visualize or graph the results. All of this as a matter of days, possibly hours. Sounds pretty cool, right? You also get the ability to modify your code easily to tweak any of the parameters or algorithms, to re-run it at will, save intermediate results for future analysis, easily share your tools with others, etc. Python has excellent facilities for any kind of generic data manipulation, a vast array of third-party libraries for special-purpose tasks, and a thriving developer community. The same rationale applies to many different scientific disciplines, not just epidemiology. A population geneticist who picked up Python at 23andMe and then went on to do his PhD at UCSF told me once that knowing how to code made him feel like he had superpowers. His fellow students who did not know how to program were in awe of what he could accomplish with just a little bit of coding. I think he went on to try to make introductory programming a required course for incoming PhD students. I hope he succeeded. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to the general benefits of being able to program, Python, in particular, has a rich set of scientific libraries available (for free!) that can help you very rapidly manipulate and visualize data using sophisticated mathematical and statistical tools.e.g., SciPy, lots and lots of math and stats tools: http://www.scipy.org/Matplotlib, graphing using the syntax of Matlab: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ One thing Python is very strong in is parsing text and other data, so prepping your data sets is (relatively) painless.  I can tell you that after discovering these tools I find myself prodding and poking data in ways I never would have even considered before for fear that the analysis would simply take too much effort.
