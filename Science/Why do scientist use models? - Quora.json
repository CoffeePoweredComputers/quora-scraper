            "answer_text": "Models are at the core of what it means to do science. All the experimentation and theorizing done in science is for the purpose of settling on a set of ideas that best explain and predict phenomena. These ideas can then be passed on to future generations and continually improved upon to better fit them to our observations. Well formulated ideas on how the world works become the models that form the basis of science.  The model represents science's best \"guess\" at describing some aspect of our exceedingly complex world. Whether it's the climate, a gold atom, a rock formation, a black hole, or a \"kit\" of pigeons, science uses models to explain and predict the behavior of the parts that make up our world.  The reason science uses models is because we can never fully describe a system. The sheer multitude of variables and randomness means the best we can hope for is some abstract representation of the object or process. The model must be simple enough to be understandable, but complex enough to be useful.  Models must also be falsifiable, meaning they must at all times be testable against new observations and collected data.  This is how science progresses. As new situations arise allowing new data to be collected, models will either continue to explain and predict the newly seen behavior or they will fail to describe what is seen and thus need revision.  Often models are \"tweaked\" to better describe our world, but sometimes full paradigm shifts occur where the model is replaced with a fundamentally different set of ideas. An example of this is when Einstein came forth with the Theory of Relativity to better explain, among other things, gravity. The General Theory of Relativity now forms the basis of our understanding of gravity whereas before Einstien our best \"guess\" came from Newton's ideas on mass and attraction. These well formulated ideas are examples of models. In the absence of a model, science would not be grounded in anything testable. It would lack an anchored set of ideas on how the world operates. It would be unable to explain things and processes because there would be too many variables to describe the systems that make up our universe. Models are both the core tool and main purpose of the scientific enterprise, and the defining characteristic that drives scientific knowledge forward. Their ability to be codified using the language of mathematics lends them to validation and self-consistency, grounding their existence in our strongest forms of rational and objective inquiry. ",

            "answer_text": "Because non-scientific models are boring dates. A \u201cmodel\u201d in scientific terminology is a theoretical description of how a system is expected to behave. It can be used to provide a general summary of a phenomenon, provide a background against which phenomena can be measured and compared, or make predictions for testing. Models are often, but by no means always, mathematical. The conditions inside the Sun are a model derived from mathematics and physics. The picture of what happens at a typical subduction zone is a model, too, but generally a descriptive one. ",
