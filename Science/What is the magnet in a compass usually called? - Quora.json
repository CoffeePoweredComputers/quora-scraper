            "answer_text": "What is the magnet in a compass usually called? It's referred to as a compass needle, which floats suspended on a pinpoint so it can spin freely and align itself with Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines. It's a tiny bar magnet with both north and south poles.  South pole tip at 60 degrees, ENE (east northeast). Gold-tipped north pole at 250 degrees, WSW (west southwest). The magnetic compass was invented more than 2000 years ago, the first made of lodestone, in Han dynasty China between 300 and 200 BC. The south tip of a modern compass needle is painted with a color, red most commonly, some glow in the dark (above), having been painted with radium based radio-luminescent paint. Women factory workers painted pocket watch and compass faces, and because they contracted radiation poisoning were known as The Radium Girls. It didn\u2019t help that they also painted their nails, face, and teeth, and were told to \u2018point\u2019 their brushes with a touch to the tongue. Old watches with radium will no longer glow in the dark, and radium has been replaced by phosphor. The other end, the north end, with a non-descriptive dot of material for balance. It's the south tip that points north, the same principle as when two bar magnets are placed side-by-side, opposite poles being attracted to each other. With the compass held horizontally to the Earth, the needle spins freely, and aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field lines pointing towards the Earth\u2019s magnetic north pole. It will also tilt down, hence the counter-balance. In the southern hemisphere, the needle will still point towards Earth's north pole, the colored tip still acting as the reference. A compass will always point north, but that doesn't mean it will tell you where you are or in which direction to go to get where you want to be. A compass is used, or read, by aligning the markings on or in its case with a similarly matching emblem, called a rose, windrose, or Rose of the Winds, found on virtually all maps, pictured below. Their designs have been endless and unique throughout the centuries, traditionally considered a piece of art by map makers.  Some, very ornate, were commissioned to represent wealthy families or shipping companies.  Held flat down horizontally on a road or wilderness map, the compass case is oriented with the rose, and the needle points north. The map and compass are then rotated together as one so that the needle points to the N indicated on the compass. This orients the map correctly with regards to your terrestrial location. From where you are, you now know in which direction to go to reach any destinations indicated on the map. If you don't know where you were to begin with, you'll still know which way is north, and hopefully, you'll have some clue as to what lies in that direction. Or ask at a gas station for once!  The points N,S,E,W, are referred to as the cardinal points, and NE, SE, etc., as the ordinal. The rest as sub-ordinal. A trivia fact is that the cardinal points are traditionally listed in the above order to represent making the sign of the cross, the rose facing away (E=left, W=right), as sailors looked up at the sky praying for divine protection on a long ocean voyage. We still always without thinking say \u2018North\u2019, \u2018South\u2019, \u2018East\u2019, and \u2018West\u2019, in that order when referring to the cardinal directions of a map or compass, even in literature and song.  A compass points to magnetic north, not true north, which is the point defined by our planet\u2019s rotational axis. Magnetic north, first located in 1831, is not a fixed point, and moves northward at an average rate of 10 kilometers per year. Currently it\u2019s on Ellesmere Island in Northern Canada, where Earth\u2019s northern magnetic field lines have been accurately measured to enter the Earth. The difference between North Magnetic and North Geomagnetic and their relationships to magnetic declination is a bit complex and best left for another time, but are all critical factors in navigation.  Here you see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. It\u2019s caused by the interaction between charged particles shot out from the Sun and Earth magnetic field. Particles strike atoms in the atmosphere along the Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines - which are strongest at the poles, and why you don't see auroras in the lower latitudes - causing electrons in the atoms to move to a higher energy state. When they drop back to a lower energy state, they release a photon: light. What you see here are our planet\u2019s actual magnetic field lines being lit.   Here\u2019s the Aurora Australis, a stunning view from space showing the Earth\u2019s southern magnetic field lines lit up as they enter the Earth above the South Pole. That's Australia, upper left, with Antarctica surrounded by the Southern Lights.  This brass compass belonged to my great-grandad, a three-masted sailing ships captain out of New England. Has a street named after him in Hawaii. Note the \u2018O\u2019 where you expect a \u2018W\u2019. That\u2019s because this compass is of French origin, \u2018West\u2019 being spelled \u2018Ouest\u2019. Say \u2018O-est\u2019. Now say \u2018West\u2019. Same mouth shapes that sound identical if you speed up the former. It also has a brake/lock lever, a [black] rotating direction arrow, and magnetic declination arrow. Note the ring for a watch fob is at the South mark, so when attached to a chain or cord and held in the hand, North is away from the user. North, South, East, and Oest.  Compass designs vary in shape, size, style, design, and materials, from plain to ornate, but their function is universal. There are no compasses customized for the southern hemisphere, because you never know when you might find yourself north of the equator. A modern day pocket-watch style compass complete with fob.  Central Eastern United States map with windrose.  The photos below are all true color and unretouched. No need for enhancements when the beauty is natural.  Harbor night lights  Caribou under the Moon  Forest ablaze  Here\u2019s Hotel Kakslauttanen in Finland. The glass igloos are heated and have beds, from which guests can comfortably view the sky.  I hope that you found what began as a simple question about compass needles ended by being both informative and inspiring. I still have my scout compass around somewhere, but hey, before I started, I didn\u2019t even know there was a magnet in a compass. ;o) ",

            "answer_text": "We have a magnetic dipole type of magnet in compass, meaning that every of the two magnetic poles of a compass needle points one of the magnetic poles of the Earth. It may be called a dipole magnet or just a magnetic compass needle. Do not forget that the South magnetic pole of the Earth is situated near the North geographic pole, and the North magnetic pole - near its South geographic pole. Thus in fact so-called North pole of the compass needle points the South magnetic pole of the Earth (but its North Georgaphic Pole). To distinguish the needle\u2019s end that points North, it is coloured red or has an inscribed letter \u201cN\u201d, for it is known that opposite magnetic poles attract. So, the North pole of the magnetic compass needle will point North, being attracted by the South magnetic pole of the Earth. This pole of the needle might also have an inscribed dart or just be dart-formed (see figure).    Figure ",
