            "answer_text": "Hey buddy,, Here as Alpha particles are positively charged particles, force on it in magnetic field is given by  Force is cross product between Velocity and Magnetic Field, therefore it would be perpendicular to both such that when you go from direction of velocity to that of magnetic field while curling up the fingers, thumbs points in the direction of Force . In above picture, red arrow is in west, black is in north, and you can in reverse direction of above explained process to get direction of Magnetic Field which would come to be UPWARD DIRECTION. ",
