In what ratio these two mixtures should be mixed so that the ratio of milk and water in the resulting mixture becomes 14:9? Solution: Container A has milk and water in the ratio of 3:2. Container B has milk and water in the ratio of 8:5. Take x quantity from A and y from B, so that, we have (3x+8y) : (2x+5y) = 14: 9 , or 27x+72y = 28x+70y, or x= 2y Take 2 parts from A and 1 part from B, to get the milk-water ratio as 14:9, Answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Statement of the given problem,Two containers contain milk and water in the ratio of 3:2 and 8:5, respectively. In what ratio these two mixtures should be mixed so that the ratio of milk and water in the resulting mixture becomes 14:9?Basic assumptions,Let (MA, WA) & (MB, WB) denote (milk, water) in original mixtures present in vessels A & B respectively.Let C denotes the vessel where final mixture in which milk and water will be in the proportion of 14 : 9.Hence from above data we get following relations,MA / WA = 3 / 2 [vessel A]or MA = (3/2)*WA \u2026\u2026 (1a)MB / WB = 8 / 5 [vessel B]or MB = (8/5)*WB \u2026\u2026 (1b)(MA + MB) / (WA + WB) = 14 / 9 [vessel C]or [(3/2)*WA + (8/5)*WB] = (14/9)*(WA + WB) [from (1a) & (1b)]or (14/9 - 3/2)*WA = (8/5 - 14/9)*WBor (1/18)*WA = (2/45)*WBor WA = (4/5)*WB \u2026\u2026 (1c)Hence from (1a) & (1b) we get,(MA + WA)/(MB + WB) = [(3/2)*WA + WA]/[(8/5)*WB + WB]or (MA + WA)/(MB + WB) = [(5/2)*WA]/[(13/5)*WB]or (MA + WA)/(MB + WB) = (5/2)*WA/[(13/4)*WA] [from (1c)]or (MA + WA)/(MB + WB) = 10/13or (MA + WA) : (MB + WB) = 10 : 13Therefore it is evident from above thatthe required proportion in which the (milk + water) mixtures should be taken from the vessels A & B is 10 : 13 [Ans]",
