            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think science can because the methods they use to test require something to be tangible and solid\u2026.although, you can \u201cfeel\u201d ghosts, or at least some can. I can\u2019t speak for everyone as I\u2019m a psychic-medium but you can feel them, sometimes it feels like a touch/poke/hand other times more commonly it feels like you\u2019re being shocked or a staticy/webby feeling like walked into a mass of energy. This static electric field usually creates a cold spot and people often get goosebumps and their hair standing up. This isn\u2019t really common as it\u2019s basically a spirit trying to manifest as that point. They draw energy from electrical sources/batteries and yes even people, animals and probably plants, the soil, water, minerals and what not but I mainly have experienced them draining batteries and people for obvious reasons\u2026batteries that were fully charged suddenly die and people start feeling weak/vertigo/malaise/tired suddenly. Usually when they do this they try to manifest or do something somewhat dramatic like move an object, speak on a spirit box or other ITC device more vocally/loudly or will tap on walls, make footsteps, light anomalies, shadow figures, touch people, scratch people, throw pebbles, etc. So no it\u2019s not an exact science by modern standards using EMF/triboelectric/motion/microwave radiation devices to pick up on spirit presences but it\u2019s a start. Using laser grids, Kinect sls are tools also used but not proven by science either. Photos and videos are probably the best sources of existence aside from eye witness accounts. There are many videos and photos of spirits and objects moving, disembodied voices, light anomalies, shadow figures, orbs are up for debate. I do think some orbs are legitimate spirit manifestations and probably the more common concentrations of energy, however, dust, moisture and possibly bugs can be mistaken for orbs (bugs usually have a wing pattern but if it\u2019s on a lens maybe not). Dust and moisture usually are in a flurry, many and often small but it\u2019s still very hard to tell the difference between a spirit orb and the other possibilities\u2014usually spirit orbs will be one or two at a time and will have an intelligence to their movement\u2026.maybe a sudden turn or avoiding something as it goes by. I\u2019ve also asked some to come towards the light (flash) of my camera and they\u2019ll do it or touch an item on the table and they\u2019ll do it. But again, spirits have an intelligence and may not want to or just may not be around or have the energy to do so. I usually keep my investigations and ghost tours fairly short 2\u20134 hours because they often lose energy (or interest?) before then and quit talking or interacting with equipment or what not. I do have photos and YouTube videos of my investigations but usually don\u2019t post my youtube videos because of skeptical haters that like to give a thumbs down but I will post some photos. I\u2019ve posted these before on Quora w/ similar questions. Some of these are demonic. Not all of these are mine, some were sent by friends or people who didn\u2019t mind me sharing. Some are thanks to my friend John J. Moran                    ",

            "answer_text": "No. But I believe some things aren't as cut and dried as science, atheists, or religious folks would have us believe. I have been both religious and atheist at different times in my life. But then the universe subtly reminds me to remain agnostic. My mother died last summer. Expected due to poor health but the speed of her decline still took us by surprise. A month before she went to the hospital we had started to reconnect while packing her home to move her to a closer and smaller place. Myself, my sister, and mom had a chance to reconnect through pictures and family heirlooms, toys, records, old boxes of memories. And then before she could move she fell ill, back in the hospital, eleven days of anesthesia struggling to heal and then she was gone. Eleven days the three of us stayed together. The packing remained, tears were shed in an empty home. A home for many years shared by just myself, my sister, and my mother. I would take breaks in the front yard before and after her death, admiring the spring flowers. The front of her house and driveway were filled with blooming tiger lilies. They were my favorite. I didn't expect an answer but I felt better talking to her in the house as if she were still there. I did ask, foolishly I thought, for some sign that she still existed. Of course there was no answer. Or was there? Almost a month after she died there was a thunderstorm. In the morning the sun was warm and bright. And I sadly made the drive back to the empty shell of her home to continue packing. I walked up to the door and I saw them. Lying on the threshold, three perfect tiger lilies. The date was August 3rd, the day before my birthday. I took the picture as they were, interlocked, touching, the three of us symbolically represented by three delicate flowers that survived a storm. I will never be able to believe she's living in heaven in a gold mansion, just as I can never believe she was just a collection of atoms, an animal in clothes. But I believe somehow, she was there on that doorstep that night...  ...to leave a final message. \"I will see you again... but not yet... not yet...\" - Juba ",

            "answer_text": "It's 12:00AM now, the perfect time to answer this question\u2026.!! :-p Albert Einstein, one of our greatest scientific minds of all time, offered a scientific basis for the reality of ghosts. A recent Google search turned up nearly 8 million results suggesting a link between ghosts and Einstein's work covering the conservation of energy. The assertion is that, \"Einstein proved that all the energy of the universe is constant and that it can neither be created nor destroyed. ...!!!\u201d So what happens to that energy when we die? If it cannot be destroyed, it must then, according to Dr. Einstein, be transformed into another form of energy. What is that new energy? ... Could we call that new creation a ghost?\" When we are alive, we have electrical energy in our bodies. ... What happens to the electricity that was in our body, causing our heart to beat and making our breathing possible? Here is the simple scientific answer : After a person dies, the energy in his or her body goes where all organisms energy goes after death: into the environment. When a human dies, the energy stored in his or her body is released in the form of heat, and transferred into the animals that eats us (if left uncremated) and the plants that absorb us. If we are cremated, the energy in our bodies is released in the form of heat and light. When we eat dead plants and animals, we are consuming their energy and converting it for our own use. Many ghost hunters say they can detect the electric fields created by ghosts. And while it's true that the metabolic processes of humans and other organisms actually do generate very low-level electrical currents, these are no longer generated once the organism dies. Because the source of the energy stops, the electrical current stops \u2014 just as a light bulb turns off when you switch off the electricity running to it. Most of the \"energy\" that any dead person leaves behind takes years to re-enter the environment in the form of food; the rest dissipates shortly after death, and is not in a form that can be detected years later with popular ghost-hunting devices like electromagnetic field (EMF) detectors. Ghosts may indeed exist, but neither Einstein nor his laws of physics suggests that ghosts are real. Gracias Dios\u2026.No Fantasmas\u2026!!! (Translation :Thank God\u2026. No Ghosts\u2026!!)

            "answer_text": "Here are six logical explanations for the ghostly presence : 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS For decades, a Canadian neuroscientist named Michael Persinger has been studying the effects of electromagnetic fields on people\u2019s perceptions of ghosts, hypothesizing that pulsed magnetic fields, imperceptible on a conscious level, can make people feel as if there is a \u201cpresence\u201d in the room with them by causing unusual activity patterns in the brain\u2019s temporal lobes. Persinger has studied people in his lab wearing a so-called \u201cGod Helmet,\u201d finding that certain patterns of weak magnetic fields over someone\u2019s head for 15 to 30 minutes can create the perception that there\u2019s an invisible presence in the room. Some subsequent research has pushed back on this theory, arguing that people were responding to the suggestion that they would feel a ghostly presence, rather than to the electromagnetic field. However, Persinger counters that this experiment followed very different protocols than his own research. Other scientists have also found that environments that have a reputation for being haunted often feature unusual magnetic fields. 2. INFRASOUND Infrasound is sound at levels so low humans can\u2019t hear it (though other animals, like elephants, can). Low frequency vibrations can cause distinct physiological discomfort. Scientists studying the effects of wind turbines and traffic noise near residences have found that low-frequency noise can cause disorientation, feelings of panic, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and other effects that could easily be associated with being visited by a ghost . For instance, in a 1998 paper on natural causes of hauntings, engineer Vic Tandy describes working for a medical equipment manufacturer, whose labs included a reportedly haunted room. Whenever Tandy worked in this particular lab, he felt depressed and uncomfortable, often hearing and seeing odd things\u2014including an apparition that definitely looked like a ghost. Eventually, he discovered that the room was home to an 19 Hz standing wave coming from a fan, which was sending out the inaudible vibrations that caused the disorienting effects. Further studies also show links between infrasound and bizarre sensations like getting chills down the spine or feeling uneasy. 3. MOLD Shane Rogers, an engineering professor at Clarkson University, has spent the past few months touring reportedly haunted locations looking for not-so-paranormal activity: mold growth. Preliminary research indicates that some molds can cause symptoms that sound pretty ghostly\u2014like irrational fear and dementia. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of ghost shows,\u201d he tells mental_floss, and began to wonder \u201cif there\u2019s some kind of link there, where we might be able to explain why people are having these feelings.\u201d So far in the data collection process, \u201cit\u2019s hard to say whether that\u2019s a contributing factor or not, but anecdotally we are seeing these [toxic molds] exist in places that are haunted.\u201d 4. CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING In 1921, a doctor named W.H. Wilmer published an odd story about a haunted house in the medical journal the American Journal of Ophthalmology. The family who lived in this haunted residence, called the H family in the medical literature, began experiencing weird phenomena when they moved into an old house\u2014hearing furniture moving around and strange voices in the night, feeling the presence of invisible specters. They report being held down in bed by ghosts, feeling weak, and more. As it turned out, a faulty furnace was filling their house with carbon monoxide, causing aural and visual hallucinations. The furnace was fixed, and the H family went back to their lives, sans ghosts. 5. SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT WAS REAL. In a 2014 study, Goldsmiths, University of London psychologists had participants watch a video of a \u201cpsychic\u201d supposedly bending a metal key with his mind. In one condition, study subjects watched the video with a \u201cparticipant\u201d who was actually working with the researchers and professed to see the key bending. Those subjects were more likely to report that they saw the key bend than subjects who were paired with someone who asserted that the key didn\u2019t bend or said nothing. \u201cOne person\u2019s account can influence another person\u2019s memory,\u201d study co-author Christopher French tells mental_floss. If someone else confidently asserts that they saw the ghost, it might influence a fellow eye-witness to believe they saw it, too. 6. WE WANT TO BELIEVE. \u201cThere is a motivational side to belief in ghosts,\u201d French explains. \u201cWe all want to believe in life after death. The idea of our mortality is one we are not generally comfortable with.\u201d Confirmation bias holds powerful sway over our perceptions. \u201cWe find it much easier to believe evidence for something we want to believe in.\u201d Source: 6 Scientific Explanations for Ghost ",

A 2014 UK survey found that 52 percent of participants believed in the supernatural. A 2015 survey by Chapman University found that more than 40 percent of Americans believe places can be haunted by spirits. However, there may be a more scientific basis to things that go bump in the night than a restless afterlife. Here are six logical explanations for that ghostly presence in your house: 1.

For instance, in a 1998 paper on natural causes of hauntings [PDF], engineer Vic Tandy describes working for a medical equipment manufacturer, whose labs included a reportedly haunted room. Whenever Tandy worked in this particular lab, he felt depressed and uncomfortable, often hearing and seeing odd things\u2014including an apparition that definitely looked like a ghost. Eventually, he discovered that the room was home to an 19 Hz standing wave coming from a fan, which was sending out the inaudible vibrations that caused the disorienting effects. Further studies also show links between infrasound and bizarre sensations like getting chills down the spine or feeling uneasy. 3. MOLD Shane Rogers, an engineering professor at Clarkson University, has spent the past few months touring reportedly haunted locations looking for not-so-paranormal activity: mold growth. Preliminary research indicatesthat some molds can cause symptoms that sound pretty ghostly\u2014like irrational fear and dementia. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of ghost shows,\u201d he tells mental_floss, and began to wonder \u201cif there\u2019s some kind of link there, where we might be able to explain why people are having these feelings.\u201d So far in the data collection process, \u201cit\u2019s hard to say whether that\u2019s a contributing factor or not, but anecdotally we are seeing these [toxic molds] exist in places that are haunted.\u201d 4. CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING In 1921, a doctor named W.H. Wilmer published an odd story about a haunted house in the medical journal the AmericanJournal of Ophthalmology. The family who lived in this haunted residence, called the H family in the medical literature, began experiencing weird phenomena when they moved into an old house\u2014hearing furniture moving around and strange voices in the night, feeling the presence of invisible specters. They report being held down in bed by ghosts, feeling weak, and more. As it turned out, a faulty furnace was filling their house with carbon monoxide, causing aural and visual hallucinations. The furnace was fixed, and the H family went back to their lives, sans ghosts. 5. SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT WAS REAL. In a 2014 study, Goldsmiths, University of London psychologists had participants watch a video of a \u201cpsychic\u201d supposedly bending a metal key with his mind. In one condition, study subjects watched the video with a \u201cparticipant\u201d who was actually working with the researchers and professed to see the key bending. Those subjects were more likely to report that they saw the key bend than subjects who were paired with someone who asserted that the key didn\u2019t bend or said nothing. \u201cOne person\u2019s account can influence another person\u2019s memory,\u201d study co-author Christopher French tells mental_floss. If someone else confidently asserts that they saw the ghost, it might influence a fellow eye-witness to believe they saw it, too. 6. WE WANT TO BELIEVE. \u201cThere is a motivational side to belief in ghosts,\u201d French explains. \u201cWe all want to believe in life after death. The idea of our mortality is one we are not generally comfortable with.\u201d Confirmation bias holds powerful sway over our perceptions. \u201cWe find it much easier to believe evidence for something we want to believe anyway,\u201d he says ",

There is no need for any scientific explanation, they are real. Now, in our world, science can investigate trees and discover lignin and cellulose and pollination and transpiration. In your world they might measure transparency, persistence, communicability. Attributes. But those are not explanations of existence, just attributes. Now I can imagine several things that might look like ghosts; Nearly-alive elemental spirits jealous of human form, who at the moment of death mould themselves into a likeness within the now unoccupied corpse.The persistence of pseudosouls from a multiple personality victim. All the fake personalities still rattling about with nowhere to go.'stone tape' recordings of strong emotion in the fabric of a building, endlessly looping through a few moments of fear or lust or paranoiaThe projection of people's memories or fears with semi-physical form. Poltergeists by telekinesis, fortune-telling by telepathy. Externalisation of imagination.Some sort of wiccan energy accumulated during life that has to return to the unseen natural reservoir after death, and does so by manifesting in the minds of thone around.Breakdown of the progression of time caused by strength of will dissipating at the time of deathSimultaneous communication of diverging many-world quantum states for example the divergence between dying and surviving a car crash. Harmonic intervals along the two diverging timelines where both are simultaneously accessible, briefly.Spiteful, deceitful, fairy shades, trading the deceased life-force in the afterlife in exchange for the chance to pass on a message. Afterlife predators.Cosmic debt collectors wanting the return of emotions borrowed to create experience. (I don't fancy meeting them)Timeslips, like the two English ladies at VersaillesEtc.It it is not the business of our scientists, in our world without ghosts, to rationalise your fantasies about a different world. That's just weird. If you are going to invoke a world in which ghosts are real you need to do the work, in advance, as part of whatever process you are using to make that into reality. You can't just claim, like some paranormal CEO to be an ideas man, and expect the rest of us to summons up your vision. F you want to invite me to a place where ghosts are real, you need to make sure they are - you can't expect me to conjour them afterwards. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Or more specifically, not yet. The ability to prove the existence of ghosts is beyond our current scientific ability. Our current toolset is archaic at best. EVPs? Orbs on film? Very little of that \u201cevidence\u201d would convince anyone with an objective mind. But science is a funny thing. Current scientific theory will point towards one conclusion, but then someone(s) will (eventually) come up with indisputable evidence to prove that conclusion wrong. \u201cNo balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful\u201d - Lord Kelvin\u201cThere is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will\u201d - Albert Einstein\u201cIf excessive smoking actually plays a role in the production of lung cancer, it seems to be a minor one.\u201d - W.C. Heuper, National Cancer Institute, 1954But how can the best minds of their time be so wrong? It\u2019s because science isn\u2019t static. We can only draw the best conclusions that we can, using the best tools, data, and reasoning that we CURRENTLY have. The conclusion changes when new tools, or data (or theories) are discovered. The following is the best analogy I can think of, of science as it relates to ghosts: In 1809, Nicolas Appert, a French confectioner and brewer, invented \u201ccanned food\u201d. He observed that food cooked inside a sealed jar did not spoil. But no one understood how it worked, as it was beyond the current level of what science could explain. But it was impossible to argue that it did work, as the results were easily reproducible and observable. So imagine ghosts are the \u201ccanned goods\u201d in the analogy above\u2026 except that there is no reliable way to observe ghosts. With the canning example above, even if you can\u2019t explain how it worked, if you put food in a can, sealed it, and heated it, you would have observable proof of the results (that the food doesn\u2019t spoil). But in the ghost analogy where the ghosts are the \u201cfood\u201d\u2026 you can\u2019t get the food to reliably appear (much less put it in a can, seal it, etc). So all we have are eyewitness testimonies and unconvincing \u201cevidence\u201d from our recording and measuring devices. It\u2019s not enough. At least not yet. But it\u2019s slowly getting better, as we better understand space, time and energy. To all the naysayers that say ghosts don\u2019t exist because science can\u2019t prove their existence? Science has been wrong before. So please try to keep an open mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Science behind existence of Ghosts  A surprising number of people believe in ghosts. However, there may be a more scientific basis to things that go bump in the night than a restless afterlife. Here are six logical explanations for that ghostly presence in your house: 1. ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS For decades, a Canadian neuroscientist named Michael Persinger has been studying the effects of electromagnetic fields on people\u2019s perceptions of ghosts, hypothesizing that pulsed magnetic fields, imperceptible on a conscious level, can make people feel as if there is a \u201cpresence\u201d in the room with them by causing unusual activity patterns in the brain\u2019s temporal lobes. Persinger has studied people in his lab wearing a so-called \u201cGod Helmet,\u201d finding that certain patterns of weak magnetic fields over someone\u2019s head for 15 to 30 minutes can create the perception that there\u2019s an invisible presence in the room. 2.INFRASOUND Low frequency vibrations can cause distinct physiological discomfort. Scientists studying the effects of wind turbines and traffic noise near residences have found that low-frequency noise can cause disorientation, feelings of panic, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and other effects that could easily be associated with being visited by a ghost. 3. MOLD Shane Rogers, an engineering professor at Clarkson University, has spent the past few months touring reportedly haunted locations looking for not-so-paranormal activity: mold growth. Preliminary research indicates that some molds can cause symptoms that sound pretty ghostly\u2014like irrational fear and dementia. 4. CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING In 1921, a doctor named W.H. Wilmer published an odd story about a haunted house in the medical journal the AmericanJournal of Ophthalmology. The family who lived in this haunted residence, called the H family in the medical literature, began experiencing weird phenomena when they moved into an old house\u2014hearing furniture moving around and strange voices in the night, feeling the presence of invisible specters. They report being held down in bed by ghosts, feeling weak, and more. As it turned out, a faulty furnace was filling their house with carbon monoxide, causing aural and visual hallucinations. The furnace was fixed, and the H family went back to their lives, sans ghosts. 5. SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT WAS REAL In a 2014 study, Goldsmiths, University of London psychologists had participants watch a video of a \u201cpsychic\u201d supposedly bending a metal key with his mind. In one condition, study subjects watched the video with a \u201cparticipant\u201d who was actually working with the researchers and professed to see the key bending. Those subjects were more likely to report that they saw the key bend than subjects who were paired with someone who asserted that the key didn\u2019t bend or said nothing. If someone else confidently asserts that they saw the ghost, it might influence a fellow eye-witness to believe they saw it, too. 6. WE WANT TO BELIEVE. \u201cThere is a motivational side to belief in ghosts,\u201d French explains. \u201cWe all want to believe in life after death. The idea of our mortality is one we are not generally comfortable with.\u201d Confirmation bias holds powerful sway over our perceptions. \u201cWe find it much easier to believe evidence for something we want to believe anyway. \u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as ghosts. But I had a cat that died and for weeks afterward I would see him from the corner of my eye, typically in spots her would always be sitting such as the top of the speaker or the end of the bed. But when I directed my attention directly to the spot he would not be there. Was it a ghost? Our brain helps fill in the images of our normal everyday surroundings so it won\u2019t have to process the information from our eyes. When you are on familiar turf, the majority of your peripheral vision is made up of \u201cghost\u201d images because our brain is always seeking the path of least resistance. However, sometimes our brain isn\u2019t yet aware that something has since vanished. Even when we\u2019re consciously aware of the items absence, the impression is still fixed in our sub-conscious memory. Like my cat. For example, someone could steal a painting off a wall and the owner may pass by the wall several time before he realizes the painting is missing. It\u2019s also why you can spot a tourist from a local, locals are barely watching were they\u2019re going but when you see a tourist walking down the same street it\u2019s as if he has head on a swivel.

In general such sightings do show some consistency. The figure is seen as a solid form, indistinguishable from that of a living person. However, in some cases it seems to be moving independently of its surroundings, in the sense that it does not appear to see or respond to the witnesses. These cases are sometimes explained as residual energy/stone tape phenomena, where the witness is picking up information that has been recorded in the environment. A more recent interpretation is that of a time slip. In a few cases, however, the ghost does respond to witnesses, often trying to get their attention, sometimes trying to resolve some unfinished business from their life. In a few cases people who have been murdered communicate the names of their killers. In general it would be impossible for science as it now stands to integrate these data into current theory. The more common response is denial. However, a few scientists have continued to study the phenomenon and it is possible that breakthroughs will occur in the future. In cases where the ghost does appear to be a deceased human, the implication is clear that it exists in some other dimension not yet recognised by current science. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually think we are taking steps towards doing so. Think about it this way, Science has never had all the answers and possibly may never have all the answers. The more I talk to people in this kind of field the more I realize science is starting to look more and more into these things. Perhaps that\u2019s why shows with people using equipment to validate the existence of ghosts are so popular these days even if I don\u2019t agree with everything on them. (Not all hauntings are satanic). Some of the best examples I\u2019ve seen research in are Near Death-Experiences and possible messages in lucid dreams. I also believe science does validate the \u201cparanormal\u201d with the law of conservation of energy. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another. We all are full of energy, so it would make sense that that energy continues on after death. I personally, though not a \u201cqualified scientist\u201d that actually does things for a living like others are able to do with college degrees, consider science at its most basic, which is studying the world around us even in the unknown testing different things for your own knowledge, so while most people won\u2019t see my studying into the paranormal as actual evidence. I\u2019ve studied some psychics (though a lot of scammers are out there) on their predictions, and tried to keep an open mind on them, and compared notes to see when things actually happened or what actually made sense at least to me. While I have not met a psychic that has been 100% accurate, I\u2019ve met some that have been a good 85%-95% accurate on their readings especially when they describe people they had no possible way of knowing. It\u2019s also shown me to see that the real issue with time travel is that time is always changing. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen through readings a world that one thing was supposed to happen, but actions that other people did ended up twisting it the other way. Essentially, through readings I\u2019ve been 100% certain the multiverse theory has been proven. ",

            "answer_text": "(1) Short answer: NoBecause Science itself is a ghost.(2) Consider gravity. It seems completely natural to presume that gravitation, and the Law of Gravity existed before Isaac Newton. It would be insane to think that until the 17th century, there was no gravity. (3) So, when did this law start? Has it always existed? So, before the beginning of the earth, before the sun and the stars were formed, before the generation of anything, the Law of Gravity existed. Sitting there having no mass of its own.No energy of its own.Not in anyone\u2019s mind because there wasn\u2019t anyone.Not in space because there was no space either.(4) This Law of Gravity still existed? If that law existed, what does whatever have to do to qualify for non-existence? It would seem like that law passed every test of non-existence there is. You can\u2019t think of a single attribute of non-existence that the law didn\u2019t have. Or, a single scientific attribute it did have. And yet, it\u2019s still common sense to believe that it existed. That the law was always there, even when it applied to nothing. Gradually, the world came into being, and then the law applied to it. (5) If you mull this over, round and round and round, you\u2019re likely to arrive at only one possible, rational conclusion. The Law of Gravity, and gravity didn\u2019t exist before Isaac Newton. No other conclusion makes sense. (6) What this means is that the Law of Gravity exists nowhere except in people\u2019s heads. It\u2019s a ghost. As in the ghosts that play up in your mind when you were a kid after listening to campsite ghost stories. Ditto the other laws of Physics. The laws of Logic. The Number System. The principle of algebraic substitution. (7) The pesky problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy, but the scientists can\u2019t escape its predominance over everything they do. Laws of nature are human inventions. Like ghosts. Politically correct ghosts, unlike the ghosts from your ghost stories. This includes the idea that the laws of nature isn\u2019t a human invention. ",

Most seem blissfully unaware that there is an over 100-year history of research into \u201cthe paranormal\u201d by private, university, and government agencies. All negative. Various private outfits, formed around the turn of the century with the rise of the \u201cGolden Dawn\u201d movement and \u201cMadame Blavatasky\u2019s nonsense\u2026. Simply disbanded. Nothing found. All manner of university and college-based \u201cparapsychology\u201d departments were formed during the \u201cNew Age\u201d fad of the 70s and 80s\u2026. Again, most all now forgotten. Nothing found. The US and Soviet governments both spent billions researching \u201cpsychic espionage\u201d\u2026 Enlisting some very shady characters indeed\u2026 And again, both nations abandoned these efforts as non-productive. James Randi\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Prize\u201d was never awarded, despite dozens of applicants hoping to prove they had paranormal abilities. (None did) Most seem blissfully unaware that there is in fact a science-based organization devoted to examining such things. Previously called \u201cCSICOP\u201d or The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranomal\u201d. (Now\u2026 The \u201cCenter For Inquiry\u201d). They publish the \u201cSkeptical Inquirer\u201d magazine monthly. Has scientific inquiry \u201cproved\u201d taht the paranormal doesn\u2019t exist? No. Somewhere, someone might be having fun doing telepathy and telekinesis\u2026. And who has never been examined. But to date, no evidence whatever has ever come to light. Until that mystery person comes forward and presents themselves for testing\u2026 We can be pretty well assured that no such abilities exist. ",

Most of science is Junk Science. It is not true impartial exploration of the facts with a non tweaked conclusion. How can we be truly impartial in creating an experiment or even an observation? Okay, past the word science. YES. We have many pieces of equipment that record sounds, voices, other dimensions that we can\u2019t see as well as video. The veil is so thin right now, even with people who barely have their 3rd eye open or connected\u2026it is possible to see the \u201cinbetween\u201d with your naked eye. Ghosts however are a huge debate in themselves. There are spirits that are truly on a residual energy type of loop like an energy imprint and these have been observed in places like Gettysburg and many other places. (I\u2019ve observed them in my own home.) If you or anyone else is having personal experiences\u2026.who cares what science says? Science is only applicable (or any field o study for that matter) if it directly affects your life in some way. Whether science believes in ghosts or spirits or demons or ANYTHING is irrelevant. What do YOU know? What do YOU think? The great minds like Tesla and Einstein didn\u2019t sit around discussing what SCIENCE thought. They went out and BECAME SCIENCE themselves. ",

So yes they exist for sure ! Ghost or spirits are actually free electromagnetic energies in terms of science and relation with science ! the scientific relation to it is that , generally the human conscious energy ( human electromagnetic energy ) gets dispersed in the atmosphere is form of heal and light once a person dies , but in some cases , it doesn't ( science has no concrete proof about why it doesn't and in what cases it doesn't but some researches say that , where there are lots of death due to wars and such bad reasons ( no natural reason , untimely death ) and lots of bad history , that places to become haunted !) so if the conscious electromagnetic energy of a human brain doesn't disperse in the atmosphere and still remain as a intelligent energy after death it means the persons soul hasn't attained white light (in scientific relations ) and when such energies gather very much in a certain place then the place tend to become haunted ! so not all persons become a spirit ! or a ghost ! this is the logic ! we have found many evidences and concrete proofs which many team all around the world have documented of a intelligent electromagnetic energy existing at real haunted locations ! so yes they exist in form of energies the energies in scientific terms are electromagnetic energies ! these energies are called as ghost or spirits !

            "answer_text": "Ghosts are supposedly the soul having shun the body existing in their own form upon the earth I rather call it spirit because Ghost usually assumed to be the scary appearances some people claim to have seen and the number of these eye witnesses is not small by any means. Science being what it is and scientist being who they are it (they) is not recognizing the reality of them,as far as science and scientists are concerned there are no Ghosts. I know that when someone dies their indestructible soul leaving the body being invisible is met by an angel or angels and it is taken to a place designed by God for them to await the resurrection of the body to which they belong ,this place is not a confinement in a small area rather it may seem to the soul to be another life altogether. So the chances of the angel of angels assigned to the soul to miss their assignment is so very null ,there may be other explanation for the number of eye witnesses is too many to have all be refuted . Evil spirits are also met by angels and apprehended . In this case even more so promptly. I've seen a few extra ordinary phenomenon in my life they were real, really real but even at the time of the experience I didn't think any to be a Ghost.

Our conscious mind lives on even after the physical body has expired. I know this for sure in the many thousands of hours of research. :I thought a perverted spirit was trying to lay on me until I realized, I am not recording a spirit with a dirty mind, I was recording the thought waves of my dog Scrappy, he\u2019s a chi weeny. I tested it and tested it and achieved the same outcome thats proof . I also heard 2 men, one was in training and they turned out to be mice in the shed I was recording in and he describes where he found the green pellets and was advised not to eat them but it was too late and he says im dying 8 times, says he needs water and dies. Turns out those pellets cause dehydration until death. I can take this info to scientist, but they refuse to acknowledge the findings, this is the code of this planet. Keep all the good stuff under quiet minds. I plan to take a challenge to prove it with IGG who offers 100k if you can prove the paranormal, I might become the first and you might want to save this correspondence ",

I\u2019ve had paranormal experiences personally myself, and they are not coincidental or random. I\u2019ve looked and observed for myself and have enough for me to know that something exists. Science isn\u2019t that simple right? E.G Even if I were a qualified scientist claiming the same thing it wouldn\u2019t automatically be true itself. But furthermore explaining paranormal activity on it\u2019s own, I don\u2019t think we will ever have any technology possible to do that. My knowledge on explanation of paranormal activity would come from the Lord Buddha, since he himself obtained a state of mind that got him the divine or wisdom eye to see beneath the paranormal and observe and recognize things as other realms of existence. We know of formed, and formless existences so it would (paranormal) categories under demons, ghosts or even divine heavenly beings. But this on it\u2019s own has no scientific proof either that obeys or all of it so I can conclude for myself that they don\u2019t mix, and never can either. Somethings just can\u2019t be explained by science is what I think. It is neither disproved or proved..? It can\u2019t be explained. ",

            "answer_text": "So far, no one has been able to explain paranormal phenomenon via science. However, I do have a theory. I was once on a ghost tour, and the guides stated that we emit energy every moment of our lives. They also said that this energy gets concentrated when you die, and that it manifests at that point in time. The only realistic thing I find comparable to this is th at we emit radiation constantly. Everything in the Universe does. When you die, I believe that that radiation has no place to go, so it will try to find living genetic material from you. And where is the place where you leave stray hairs or dead skin or saliva? Your house. However this is only a theory, and a theory with lots of holes. How does the radiation travel? How does it do what you did in the past? How does it make objects move? There may be inconsistencies, but it is a start. EDIT: I just recalled an0ther theory with less holes in it. One of Einstein's theories was that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. If energy cannot be destroyed, then where does someone's energy go when they die. The answer to this could possibly lie in the form of ghosts. Again, it is just a theory. I hope that helps! Happy Reading! ",

Ghost are entities that fall within our spectrum of light for an instant and then disappear. We do not understand it, we do not want to believe it so we knock it off as impossible. Why are we so limited to believe that if we can not see it nor prove it, it must not exist? We do the same thing with God. Before microscopes we had no idea about the expansiveness of microscopic life. We will eventually get to the understanding that the \u2018air\u2019 is full of energetic life. For example, every emotion is a conscious living energy. We can't see it so we believe that it does not exist. For example, shame has always been thought of as a sensation created in us. In reality it a living energetic entity that is entering our aura. Without shame as a living organism, we would never be able to feel shame. This goes for all emotions. It is difficult for us to grasp this because we can not see emotions. It is the same for what you call, ghosts. For me ghost is a general term for all amorphous beings in another dimension who are living a full and abundant life as much as you and I. We just can not see them. Life is far more diverse than what we are able to \u2018see\u2019. ",

How far do we need to rewind in biology class to explain what is energy (sugar, fat, alcohol), how do we digest food and convert it to mass, motion and brain activity, how a single cell creates a neural tube to become brain that learn, become a person and destroy itself in 3 minutes after the blood pump stop. I didn't know Albert Einstein have been promoted to doctor\u2026 and it doesn't help to prove anything. Descartes would have been a more credible name to use when inventing a fiction, pretending that ghost is proved scientifically. Since the current belief in ghost is actually inspired by Hollywood movies, we should ask if Steven Spielberg himself really believe or was it just making money by creating a fiction that replicate a popular fantasy?

The net effect of this very strict and definable determination is that paranormal phenomena cannot be examined scientifically, even if you have devised a methodology that is achieving demonstrable results. What you\u2019re engaged in is pseudoscience, and - again - it has nothing at all to do with how you\u2019re conducting that research. It has everything to do with what the official, prevailing paradigm [what the scientific mainstream defines as real, actual, existent] has already declared to be logical and possible. Yes, it does seem to be a Catch-22, but this is how science is conducted. Modern science is restricted by paradigm to include only research into material structure, a selection of forces, and those relationship fields that exist as a direct result of material structure and those select forces. The physical existence and/or nature of non-material factors and/or agencies [like information, precedent, and non-local relationship dynamics] is specifically treated as a\u201cbrute fact\u201d black box [just the way things are] due to the philosophical restraints of the physicalism/materialistic paradigm that rules modern science, and if these common non-material phenomena are off-limits, then you\u2019ve got to know that paranormal phenomena are as well. So, no, paranormal phenomena cannot be explained by science, it can\u2019t even be scientifically examined. The science that we pursue was [long ago] specifically devised and developed to counter and combat the world of phantoms and faith-based reality and the powerful influence that world has traditionally had on our human race. These two reality views are intentionally incompatible; designed to never come together in any official manner. ",

Just too bad lack of funding to research ghost or haunted place, comparing with funding for industrial and military purpose, which has real impact for sure.

The scientific method is a method or procedure that has characterized consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.

            "answer_text": "Yeah, that can be done. (In fact, I think ghosts have been being detected for decades now, but nobody\u2019s aware that\u2019s what was actually going on. Check out ghost-hunter reports of \u201cbattery drain\u201d.) Scientifically, two things are required to prove the existence of ghosts, or disembodied souls. Theory and experiment. Theory: It is literally child\u2019s play to logically deduce we are all eternal beings with eternal souls and always have been. I will list the proof in a minute. Experiment: It is not quite so easy to prove it experimentally in the laboratory, by building a soul-detector, but I suspect it\u2019s easier than you might think, and I think we\u2019ll wind up thanking the ghost-hunters one day. My first choice for a possible soul-detector would be something patterned on the ghost-hunter \u201cbattery-drain\u201d thing. I would first try to observe the phenomenon in the field with the ghost-hunters, and nail down PRECISELY what happens when they see sudden voltage drops. (Note to you scientists: If what the ghost-hunters are reporting is correct\u2014-energy is being drained to NOWHERE. This is a FIRST LAW VIOLATION. This is sorta strange, huh. Personally I find that hard to accept and think the more likely explanation is some supposedly-unchangeable physical constant is actually changing. I further observe you would win a Nobel Prize\u2014-EITHER WAY.) Here, let me post the theory and, this being Quora, you can decide for yourself. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy. Won\u2019t take ten minutes. And oh, by the way, the ultimate result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the absolute, utter, permanent, irrevocable destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. (The following is a line of reasoning I have posted before on Quora. All the content, every single word, including the referenced links, is entirely my own work, and it hasn\u2019t been posted anywhere except Quora, unless you count my hard drive. Here is a link to the original source: Jeff Corkern's answer to Is there any hard scientific evidence in support of life after death? ) [EXCERPT] The basic problem you have to consider\u2014-and that scientists have never, ever, considered, not even for a nanosecond\u2014-is the SUPREME threat sentients pose to a Universe. Sentients have the power to blow the Universe COMPLETELY to Hell and gone. Stephen Hawking, bless his little heart, dreamed up an elegantly simple way ONE sentient could do it by pressing a button ONCE. I will lay out the Stephen Hawking Method For Destroying The Entire Universe a little further down. So: Suppose you are a Universe Engineer. You have been handed the problem of designing a Universe that is going to evolve sentients. Sentients who, moreover, have been directly required by the Boss to possess the property of completely, totally free will. It gradually sinks in you have an INCREDIBLE design headache. How in the WORLD are you going to stop all those trillions and trillions and TRILLIONS of sentients, every single one of whom will have the theoretical capacity of destroying the entire Universe, from doing just that? While retaining completely free will? Man, that\u2019s just impossible. Just flat-out impossible. You go back and ask the Boss to let that free-will requirement go. It\u2019s just too dangerous. The Boss says: \u201cNO!\u201d Back to the drawing board. You make your coffee, grumble to yourself about impossible Bosses with their impossible demands, lean back in your chair, and you think. You think, and you think, and you think, and you think. And one day, the solution hits you out of nowhere, a bolt from the blue. You will make every single sentient\u2014-an ETERNAL being. Beings for whom existence has NO limit. This will keep your free-will-sentient-containing Universe safe for a brilliantly simple reason. Nobody sane is going to burn down their house while they are still in it. Right? And even if somebody tried, all the other free-will sentients would QUICKLY exercise their own free will and put a CRASHING halt to it. HA! THAT\u2019S IT! THAT\u2019S IT! So you immediately set up all your laws of physics so that all sentients are eternal beings. And bang, you have set up a Universe that is completely, perfectly safe from its free-will sentients. The, ahem, Boss is gonna be really, really happy with you. Please note that \u201ckeeping the Universe safe from its sentients\u201d is a totally logical, totally SCIENTIFIC, reason for believing in an afterlife. No citing religious texts. No calls for blind faith, no call to \u201cBelie-e-e-ve, brother!\u201d Just calm, clear logic. You now have a totally rational reason to go into the lab and try to build a soul-detector. Here is one possible way of doing that, based on ghost-hunter reports of \u201cbattery drain\u201d. http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... Along with the story of the cat soul who dived through my chest. (Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it. Not just theory with me.) On Detecting Souls: A Proposed Experiment Now, let me repeat all of the above in a more rigorous fashion. And would you like to live in a world where nobody is afraid to die? Where you personally are no longer afraid to die? It\u2019s only a single experiment away. Oh, by the way, the eventual result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the complete and total destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day. (You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodied the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understood the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it was Stephen Hawking. If anybody suffered at the hands of the Universe, it was Stephen Hawking. (Return to us quickly, Stephen. We need your mind.) And waddya know, Stephen Hawking found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. (Note to physicists: The initial estimate for an accelerator large enough to reach Higgs field energies and catalyze the destruction of the Universe was \u201can accelerator the size of the Solar System\u201d. Accelerator technology has rapidly evolved since. Fingernail-size accelerators have recently been constructed. Here: https://www.npr.org/sections/hea... How many of these things would you have to daisy-chain together to reach Higgs field energies, I wonder? You physicists should figure this out. And then ask yourselves why this has NOT happened, why the Universe is still there.) We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivethese... Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivethese... The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... Reincarnation. I observe fiction is reincarnation. A RATIONALIST LOOKS AT REINCARNATION People wonder what happens to them when they die. They do it every time they go to a movie, read a book, watch TV, or even watch a commercial. And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the... This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming. [EXCERPT] Jeff Corkern -------------------------------------------------- Consider the following as a statement of logic, and rank it as \"True\" or \"False\": \"If people possess immortal souls, it should be possible to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions.\" http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com ",

Reincarnation theory: We are all unique individuals, and how we exercise our free will determines our fate in the next life. By taking personal responsibility for our own life and fate, we can acquire wisdom and overcome rhetoric, improving our personal outcome. The two-world hypothesis: We are citizens of two, coincidental worlds; a physical world, that is open to the eyes of its inhabitants and an ethereal world that is only visible to a very few gifted individuals. The physical world is finite, in that it is limited to the materials created in the Big Bang, whereas the ethereal world is infinite. Both worlds can act upon each other. The benevolent theory: There is a benevolent force acting on this world with vision and purpose, based in goodness and wisdom, attempting to inspire people to choose a path to it. At the same time, the ruling power of this world is trying to circumvent any and all attempts by the benevolent force to maintain its power over mankind. ",

            "answer_text": "Science in it present state cannot quantify the paranormal/spiritual so seeks explanations that are measurable and rational. Claims of ghosts are frequently dismissed without investigation and explains offered without supporting evidence. The assumption is the cause exists in the natural world of the five senses. Scientists in Switzerland believe they have an explanation for ghost sightings. Volunteers took part in an experiment which mixed up their movements and brain signals. They saw up to four phantoms positioned around them and believed that ghosts were touching their backs with invisible fingers. Professor Olaf Blanke, from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, said: \"Our experiment induced the sensation of a foreign presence in the laboratory for the first time. Ghosts created by scientists in 'disturbing' lab experiment The full article is too long to post here so go to the above link. Here are some more explanations that dismiss the paranormal: Is there any scientific evidence which points to the existence of ghosts? And still more: Some Paranormal Experiences May Be Explained by Sleep Paralysis, Exploding Head Syndrome ",

            "answer_text": "Science is based out of theories, experiments, historical events, evidences, research and tests that have been approved with a reasoning by various sets of organizations, people or intellectuals. Study/research has been done on mostly things that are visible or have a valid presence or occurrence that can be recorded or caprured. In case of paranormal the biggest challenge that has been observed is the seeing or the visual presence of such things. The first battle of proving the presence of such things or events has even not been proved yet not because they are not there, but because it is difficult for a human to rationalise something that may have a presence but is beyond human or scientific understamding to prove it. So science ideally disapproves its presence as its beyond human or scientific reasoning to even see it or feel its presence around. We as humans could not develop equipments to capture certain things that are there but cannot be explained. In my personal opinion its a parallel science in itself which will take vedic/yogic study to bring out the facts to the world. But for this one has to have these powers to prove it to the world. There are some siddh yoga gurus and enlightened souls who have answers to these but first its a search to find them and then reach the next level to ask questions. So to answer your question \u2014 science does not have the capacity to explain things of paranormal world hence they don\u2019t consider it exists. ",

The wicked dead will remain dead. And the wicked who are alive will be killed and await the time when they are resurrected for judgement. Then they will be punished, and destroyed. Never more to live again. But satan hopes to use the fallacy of the dead still being alive, because many look to the dead to find answers they seek. And satan can tell them any lie he wants.

There\u2019s many other beliefs surrounding the existence of ghosts and even what it means to be a ghost.

B) can't build a tool/machine to measure that to which we have no comparison. Simply put, we can't prove something ethereal. My own theory about spirits is also simple. The part of us that makes us who we are individually is our soul/spirit. We are essentially energy. In a flesh vehicle. The important thing to remember is that energy cannot be destroyed, only change to a different form. After the flesh car dies, we are still very much alive. Now, the question of why ghosts on Earth. If you lived a long, beautiful existence in a place you loved, why would you ever voluntarily leave? It's a choice, I'm finding in my own quest for clarity. My own spirit friend and life coach, Grandfather (see previous answers for clarity) has shown me that his life is very much the same even after death. He lives here, he loves the land, and he says he won't leave. My best friend Jay went \u201chome\u201d, but comes back often, and he helped me learn, at my advanced age, to drive a motorcycle. He was my mentor and co-rider, behind me all the way, encouraging me, and calming me down when things got tricky. One thing I hated ( and still do!) is bumpy dirt roads. For what seemed like hours, he'd repeat \u201c these are called whoop-de-dos. People pay good money to ride these. This is fun\u201d Until, one day, they WERE fun! In conclusion, I am not a scientist, but this is what I could logically explain to myself. Hope it helps. ",

Are you referring to the spirit or soul of a once living being trapped on this plane? or, are you referring to purported visual and auditory sightings that resemble people? My theory is that the first probably do not exist.

However, \u201cGhosts\u201d are different than the aforementioned consciousness/spirit et al. It\u2019s my supposition that ghosts are \u201cpsychic snapshots\u201d. When something very traumatic happens to someone, a part of their psyche gets left behind. It\u2019s not a sentient/sapient thing. It\u2019s just a psychic recording of that trauma. ",

So if one can classify \u201cghosts\u201d as objects that posses some fundamental properties and if there is a scientific way to probe these properties, then we can design an experiment to test whether a given object is ghost or not. If among the objects we test, some produce evidences of satisfying those \u201cghost\u201d-properties, then we can conclude that \u201cghosts\u201d exist. Otherwise not. To answer your question more clearly, you should provide those fundamental properties that an object must satisfy to qualify as a \u201cghost\u201d. ",

I am sure that one day we will discover it.For some reason or the other though, science is pretty much anti ghosts, spirits and gods. I guess its probably because no one has seen it yet. Or maybe science does not really care about what the public has to say.I will just assume that science is the primary life-guidance system for the materialistically inclined.And of course the materialistically inclined does not recognize that there had to be a \"\"before the big bang\"\" and they also ignore that there has to be \"beyond the physical universe\".Silly actually if you ask me. But according to science nothing exists beyond Newtonian physics.So I guess the answer is no. Science has its limits. ",

Electromagnetic fields can be identified by a EMF meter. ",

There\u2019s been no discovery that points to a \u201cspiritual\u201d component of the human body; quite the opposite, every discovery regarding consciousness has shown that much of what makes up our personalities are just the hard-wiring of our brains and the chemicals inside our bodies.

Paranormal activity is phenomena which are claimed to occur, but for which there is little or no substantial evidence. You can\u2019t explain what you can\u2019t prove. Current examples include ghosts, poltergeist (which is kind of a ghost, I guess) and the afterlife. Sometimes studies _do_ identify and explain phenomena which were previously considered to be paranormal or superstition, in which case the phenomenon stops being considered paranormal activity and is considered a _natural phenomenon_ instead (unless it doesn\u2019t occur in nature; phantasms in photographs where thought to be ghosts, but they were really just defects). Examples of paranormal activity which is no longer considered paranormal are will\u2019o the wisps and ball lightning, which have both been observed and in the case of the former explained as well. A will \u2019o the wisp is just a methane (or similar) flame that sometimes occurs in cemeteries or rivers due to the expansion and spontaneous ignition of putrefaction-related gases (as I understand it, anyway).  will \u2019o the wisp  I couldn\u2019t find a good picture/video of ball lightning so here\u2019s a drawing instead ",
