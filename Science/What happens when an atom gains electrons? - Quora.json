            "answer_text": "What happens when an atom gains electrons? The atom becomes an anion (a negative ion), and can be attracted to positive charges (such as those of atoms that have lost electrons and become cations).If these charged atoms are allowed to combine, the electron transfer can be essentially complete, forming an ionic bond; or the electron(s) can be shared between the atoms, forming a covalent bond.

            "answer_text": "An atom is in general neutral ie the total amount of positive charge inside the nucleus and the total amount of negative charge of the electrons outside the nucleus is equal and it makes the atom neutral. When a neutral atom gains electrons ie it has more negative charge than positive charge, the atom becomes a negative ion, an anion, which under the action of an electric field moves to the anode. ",
