            "answer_text": "There is significant semantic overlap but science of AI can be said to be the knowledge of how to do it while it becomes technology once implemented. AI paper is a piece of science while a device is a piece of technology. But you can say that a civilization has a certain technological capability which essentially refers to the science with which they do devices. The general capability. And you can say that a research paper represents a significant technological breakthrough. So there is significant semantic overlap in practice. ",
