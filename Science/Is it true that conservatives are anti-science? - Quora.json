            "answer_text": "Conservatives are a pretty diverse group, so its hard to generalize. If \u201cconservatives\u201d is meant to primarily describe staunch Republicans (which are a subset of conservatives), then the answer is that such Republicans will sacrafice science for political expediency. That does not literally make them anti-science, as they like science that does not create political issues. But any respect for science vanishes if science requires them to adjust their politics. Then they happily trash science in favor of propaganda. In a sense, such people are anti-science. Believing in science does not allow you to abandon facts and reasons in favor of political dogma, but they do it easily. Put another way, you are hardly pro-science if you can dump it whenever expedient. The better description is that they are agnostic about science, and willing to embrace anti-science if dictated by political dogma. Currently, scientists identify far more with Democrats than Republicans, and that is a more recent phenomena (in the past, they were somewhat conservative as a group). I would ascribe that trend to the willingness of Republicans to trash science in favor of political dogma. Its hard to attract a group when their core value is treated like dirt. A data point on this trend was Scientific American endorsing Biden. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Is it true that conservatives are anti-science? No. It is exactly the opposite. Climate alarmism is a perversion of actual, valid scientific persuit. Being 100% pro-science, forced me to the conservative side. Democrats would do well to learn how gravity works first, and make claims of impending climate apocalypses second. As is, they are gonna be just another entry on the list: List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events - Wikipedia  \u201cScience\u201d\u2026 as brought to you by the US Dept of COMMERCE.  Human behaviour. Increased rain frequency and intensity and length. Increased flooding. Sea level rise. Predicting swamping of low lying islands and coastlines. This message bought and paid for by NOAA., and the US Dept of Commerce. In God We Trust. IS NOT SCIENCE.  THIS is science (well, attempts, anyways, since at least 23 of them are causally and or mathematically inaccurate)\u2026  You know, the \u201cbendy-4-dimensional magical force, that causes infinitely densely centered black holes, universes with start dates, and can only be considered accurate if the claimed \u201cDark Matter and Dark Energy\u201d that supposedly makes up 95% of existence is not just a contrivance. Neither are detected or confirmed, despite considerable effort. So there is no \u201cscientifically confirmed cause\u201d as to why Earth has an atmosphere, and barometric pressure. If you want to show a conservative how \u201cscientific\u201d progressives are, that would be a very good starting point\u2026. Address climate alarmism being considered \u201csettled\u201d when there is no settled science with regards the nature of gravity? Address why there are TWO standard models, not ONE standard model. And why the two do not reconcile. Match. Belong in the same \u201cscience\u201d together. The apply to different scales, and are not interchangeable. The the \u201cCosmological Constant Problem\u201d. The next \u201cscience\u201d that would need addressing before climate \u201cscience\u201d could be considered diligent.  Then get measurements of fluctuation in the average spatial volume being occupied by the atmosphere, over time. Measure the fluctuations, DILIGENTLY. Since, every single calculation of temperature, includes the variable V. And calculations of delta temperature, includes the variable V. Or. V is assumed constant and ignored. Left out. Which is not \u201cscientific\u201d. Not at all. Every experiment quantifying the theoretical \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d, were done in fixed volume containers. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is not contained, it is attracted. Not by a force, by an emergent phenomenon. An effect caused by \u201csomething\u201d. Foam, or loops, or nets, or fields, or entropy, or pilot waves, or H, I, J, K, L, etc\u2026 The greenhouse effect in an attraction held body of gas, that can vary in volume occupied, has never been measured. Models are not experiments. They are guesses. Bought and paid for guesses. And at the granularity being examined, the claims of sureness are unscientific. Not diligent.  Thus, Conservatives get my support. Until such time as the climate \u201cscience\u201d industry becomes more diligent and less emotional and alarmist. The current push of \u201cfuture despair\u201d into the mindset of a generation, I find a disgusting modus operandi. Considering the lack of actual science to support it. ",
