All content below from a 2003 SMU meta-study reviewing various d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu studies*. All emphasis and organization is mine. General Facts About D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu:67% of people have had a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience (a median of 41 surveys). The most consistent finding in the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu literature is that the incidence with which it is experienced decreases with age. Two sets of outcomes suggest that belief in, or acceptance of, the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience has increased across recent decades. Gallup and Newport (1991) found that from 1978 to 1990, the amount of people who believed in the de\u00b4ja` vu experience nearly doubled from 30% to 55%. A positive relationship between the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience and both education level and socioeconomic class has been noted in both anecdotal and empirical evaluations... Palmer (1979) noted the lowest incidence of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (48%) at the bottom rung (grade school only) and the highest incidence of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (81%) among those with a graduate degree, ... [and] found the highest incidence of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu among professionals (80%) and the lowest incidence among blue collar workers (50%). Logically, those individuals who travel should have more opportunities to experience a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because they encounter objectively new physical locations more often than those who do not travel. Several investigations support this speculation. 4 Types of Explanations:1. Dual Processing Explanations The first category of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu explanations is based on a disruption in the normal operation of two separate but interactive cognitive processes. At the core of each speculation, two mnemonic processes that generally operate in concert occasionally become asynchronous, or one process becomes activated in the absence of the other.Gloor (1990) proposed that retrieval and familiarity are independent cognitive functions that usually operate in a coordinated manner, with recall accompanied by a sense of familiarity concerning the information retrieved. However, these two processes occasionally operate independently of each other. Thus, retrieval can be activated in the absence of familiarity, which causes an ostensibly familiar setting to become momentarily unfamiliar (jamais vu). Conversely, a familiarity response may become activated in the absence of retrieval (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu)Another dual-process interpretation, proposed by Bergson, is that perception and memory are simultaneous events and that \u201cmemory is never posterior to the formation of perception; it is contemporaneous with it. Step by step, as perception is created, the memory of it is projected beside it, as the shadow falls beside the body\u201d (as cited in Carrington, 1931, p. 303; cf. Tulving, 1968). People\u2019s cognitive resources are generally focused on the perception of an ongoing event, but distraction, inattention, or fatigue can lead to memory and perception momentarily enfolding in on each other. Bergson likened this to two soldiers marching in tight formation: If the first one pauses for a moment, the two will bump into each other. Thus, if storage of information occasionally occurs the moment it is perceived, it could give rise to inappropriate recognition or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.2. Neurological Explanations A number of researchers have suggested that a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience results from a neurological dysfunction involving seizure or a change in the speed of normal neural transmission.Because d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is part of the preseizure aura in some TLEs, a logical extension is that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in nonepileptic individuals results from a small temporal lobe seizure.... Halgren et al. (1978) used brain stimulation procedures to du- plicate a number of components of the preseizure aura in TLEs, among them the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience. They speculated that during a typical seizure, a similar type of increased electrical \u201coutflow\u201d from the hippocampal gyrus, an area so intimately involved in encoding and retrieval, may be misinterpreted as a sensation of familiarity.... However, the weight of evidence argues against d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu being more common in people with epilepsy or being diagnostic of seizure pathologyAnother class of neurological interpretations assumes that the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience results from a momentary delay in neuronal transmission from the perceptual organ to the higher order processing centers of the brain. In one version, there is a slight increase in the normal time taken to transmit the message, due to a synaptic dysfunction, and this slight slowing in the routine processing time (several milliseconds) is misinterpreted as representing that the information is old3. Memory Explanations Speculation concerning implicit familiarity as a foundation for a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was originally proposed more than a century ago by Osborn (1884), who suggested that individuals process a considerable amount of information without paying full conscious attention to it and that the subsequent reprocessing of this information may occasionally give rise to a sensation of subjective familiarity in the absence of recollection.Osborn (1884) suggested that it may not be the content of the memory that is duplicated in a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu but rather the particular cognitive processing that occurred on a prior occasion: If at any time in our past lives we passed in actual experience or in imagination over a mental track, say a b c d e, and if to-day [sic] this track is again traversed, although the former experience itself may have been long forgotten, we have a sense that it has been through the mind before.... If the mind passes over only part of the former track, say b c d, we sometimes, in the dim recognition which arises, believe we have been over the whole before.A d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience may be triggered by one element of the present setting that is objectively familiar but unrecognized because it is experienced in a new and changed context. The familiarity elicited by the one unidentified object is misinterpreted as a response to the entire setting, resulting in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. To illustrate, suppose that you visit a friend\u2019s home for the first time, and the grandfather clock in the corner is identical to one in your aunt\u2019s home. While you experience a familiarity reaction to this element, you are unable to connect your response to the\u201cold\u201d object and misattribute the familiarity to the entire new setting, resulting in a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Another framework for interpreting a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is that some aspect of the present situation triggers an affective response which then elicits a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Under this interpretation, the strange feeling accompanying a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is not elicited by the unsettling contrast between implicit familiarity and explicit source memory failure. Instead, the feeling is evoked by a conditioned emotional association to a particular stimulus. Under most circumstances, a person can identify the particular stimulus (seeing a person, hearing a name, smelling a perfume) that elicits an emotional reaction. When this implicit emotional reaction cannot be connected to its source, the person misidentifies the emotional arousal as familiarity to an unfamiliar setting and a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu results4. Attentional Explanations The fourth framework for interpreting d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is that an ongoing stream of perceptual experience is divided into two separate perceptions through distraction or inattention. A brief initial perception of a scene under diminished attention is followed immediately by a second perception under full attention.You are about to cross a crowded street, and you take a hasty glance in both directions to make sure of a safe passage. Now your eye is caught, for a moment, by the contents of a shop window; and you pause, though only for a moment, to survey the window before you actually cross the street... . The preliminary glance up and down, which ordinarily connects with the crossing in a single attentive experience, is disjointed from the crossing; the look at the window, casual as it was, has been able to disrupt the associative tendencies. As you cross, then, you think \u201cWhy, I crossed this street just now\u201d; your nervous system has severed two phases of a single experience, both of which are familiar, and the latter of which appears accordingly as a repetition of the earlier. Methodological Difficulties In Studying D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu:The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience lacks any clearly identifiable eliciting stimulus or verifiable behavioral response, and these lacunae have presented impediments to systematic re- search efforts. The infrequency of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences presents problems for remembering the specific physical and psychological details surrounding the d\u00e9j\u00e0` vu.  Unrepresentative samples are frequently used in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu research. In many instances, a sample of convenience is used. Leeds (1944) queried individuals in a shop where he worked, Zuger (1966) surveyed patients undergoing therapy from him, and Kohr (1980) polled members of the Association for Research and Enlightenment, which studies paranormal experiences and of which he was also a member. ---- * A review of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience.

            "answer_text": "If you simplify the definition of deja vu into a false familiarity with a current situation, sometimes linked to feelings of uncertainty, then the cause (and effect) may be quite simple. Your brain is constantly monitoring your surroundings at a level of which your conscious mind is unaware. As sensory inputs are processed in the appropriate parts of your brain, those parts are themselves being monitored by other parts, which have an input into the ongoing process. Memory is applied to the ongoing experience to make sense of it. The amygdala is keeping a wary eye out for danger. The brain - again, at the subconscious level - is collating all this information and may, or may not, present it to your conscious mind. Now, we have all experienced the effect of the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d. Something is familiar but somehow disconcertingly different. The classic must be the robot that is very, very lifelike but not quite, and triggers uneasiness. Your subconscious mind takes in the image, applies memory to it but finds tiny discrepancies leading to uncertainty. The amygdala identifies this uncertainty and waves the \u201cbeware\u201d flag. What your conscious mind gets is \u201cIt\u2019s a robot. Isn\u2019t it lifelike!\u201d but tinged with apprehension. The same process is behind deja vu. Your brain takes in the data, compares it to what it already has, runs it past other bits of your brain for their input and throws the result at your conscious mind. Perception and memory are not perfect and your brain may make mistakes along the way: so a false link may be made between the two and may even trigger the uncertainty leading to the caution flag being attached to the thought as it is presented to you. Hence: deja vu, and the disquiet frequently associated with it. Two additional notes. Deja vu is commonly linked to the onset of an episode of temporal lobe epilepsy in some unfortunate people; id you accept my explanation above, the subconscious mind is in the process of failing and may be presenting distorted memories and sensations to the conscious mind as the episode progresses. Deja vu is also more prevalent in younger people than old fogies like me. Well: the brain is still young and making new connections at a high rate when you\u2019re young, there is less memory to call upon and perhaps a more active amygdala monitoring this new world for dangers. So it would not be surprising for errors in perception to be presented to the conscious mind at a higher rate, on occasion triggering deja vu. ",

            "answer_text": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a startling mental event. The phenomenon involves a strong feeling that an experience is familiar, despite sensing or knowing that it never happened before. Most people have experienced d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at some point in their life, but it occurs infrequently, perhaps once or twice a year at most. Although d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu often feels supernatural or paranormal, glitches in the brain might be to blame. One possibility is that a small seizure occurs in brain regions essential for memory formation and retrieval\u2014the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, areas deep in the middle of the brain. When you see your grandmother, for example, spontaneous activity in these regions creates an instant feeling of familiarity. With d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, a brief synaptic misfiring might occur in these areas, creating the illusion that the event has occurred before. In support of this idea, studies show that some individuals with epilepsy have a brief d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episode prior to a seizure, with the focal area of the seizure often falling in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Other phenomena might also help explain d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, such as inattentiveness. Because we often navigate the world on autopilot, we take in much of our surroundings on an unconscious level. People who text on their cell phones while walking are only superficially aware of the shops and pedestrians they are passing. Perhaps an episode of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu begins during such a moment. When we emerge into full awareness, we might do a perceptual double take. We are struck by a strange sense of familiarity because we saw the scene just moments before, unconscious. A third possibility is that we have forgotten the prior experience. The psychology literature is replete with stories of adults visiting a notable place, such as a castle, and becoming overwhelmed by an uncanny sense of having been there before. Our brain is always searching for connections. As a result, we can sometimes make links that simply aren't there. Science and the paranormal ",

            "answer_text": "Emile Boirac introduced this French term that means \"Already seen\". Over  40 theories have attempted to explain this phenomenon. Gratefully to  the advancements in cognitive psychology and neuro-imaging, the  scientists have been able to shortlist 3 most relevant theories. Assume a restaurant setting for understanding these theories. You are  sitting at a table with a table cloth having a design of square patches  and a waiter is coming at the table with the food in his hand. 1st theory is Dual Processing. Assume that the waiter is falling with  the plates of food. As the scene unfolds, the brain processes numerous  information. The waiters arms, the falling food, the aroma of the food,  the way the spoon goes, and so on. Within milliseconds, this information  is passed through your brain and is processed as only 1 event, i.e. all  these events are recorded in your brain in sync. This theory proposes  that when there is delay in processing one of these activities, then the  brain processes it as another event all together. Thus, when it plays  over the already happened moment, it feels like it has happened before. 2nd is the Hologram theory. When you notice the table cloth with a  pattern of square patches, a distance memory swings up in the brain of  having seen the cloth before. This is because memory is stored in form  of holograms, and in holograms only one fragment is need to be able to  see the whole picture. The brain calls upon your old memory of having  seen this cloth before, rather than identifying it. Thus your brain is  stuck in familiarity but no recollection. The 3rd theory is Divided Attention. This happens when you are in a  place but your attention is devoted to only one object. Your brain  actually records all the events happening around you below your  conscious level. Thus your focus remains on that object, but the brain  knows your surroundings also. When you are pulled back from this focus,  you are brought back to the conscious level, you feel like you have been  in such a situation before and that is because you have and this is  happens only because you were not paying attention. All these three theories, however, are not conclusive proofs of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu phenomenon. ",

            "answer_text": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is French and it means \u2018already seen\u2019. Deja vu is when you go somewhere new and think you have been there. As if you\u2019ve predicted the future. There are several hypotheses on why it occurs, or how. Some argue that deja vu occurs when there\u2019s a synchronized neural firing between the rhinal cortices and the hippocampus or amygdala. Deja vu can occur because there\u2019s an error in the timing of our brain. When we receive an information, typically it gets stored in the short-term memory. Sometimes this information can \u2018leak\u2019 out and takes a shortcut to the long-term memory, skipping most of the memory storage mechanism. Then, when we receive a new information, which is stored in our short-term memory, it feels as if we're recruiting some memory from a distant past. Another thing is the deja vu can be due to \u2018cryptomnesia\u2019, it\u2019s where a learned but forgotten memory is stored. When we experience something that invokes the forgotten information, we\u2019d feel as if we have been there. More studies need to be done. ",

If you are sitting in a park and someone runs pass you and then suddenly you get the feeling that you\u2019ve seen the exact experience before in exactly the same manner. You take in the experience through your senses but there\u2019s a delay in processing it to your awareness. You are unaware of the delay and therefore think and feel that you\u2019ve seen it before.

One of your options right now is to pick your favorite theory and go with that.  Another option is to wait and see. ***To date, we collectively know virtually nothing about time - most physicists will freely admit that fact.  In a sense, deja vu is a particular brand of temporal perception - apparently one nowadays common to much of the human population, at least fleetingly so.  Perhaps when we discover what time really is, we'll understand deja vu a bit better.  Who knows?  In the meantime, we're (figuratively speaking) \"living in the stone ages.\"   The research and theorizing currently going on concerning the deja vu experience are necessary stepping stones to a greater understanding of human consciousness, the concept of free will and the construct of time, as well as adding to our still-limited knowledge as to the actual make-up of our neurological biology.

These include confusions between what\u2019s happening now and something similar, but not identical, that happened in the past. There is a study based on virtual reality that shows that when a previous experience has occurred that you forgot about, having a similar experience can elicit d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. There are also experiments that used posthypnotic amnesia that seem to support this view. Another thing that is suspected to lead to the effect is related to the fact that our brain is made up of two hemispheres. The signals from both of these are thought to be processed by the temporal lobe, and a larger-than-usual delay between the times when the signals reach the temporal lobe from the two hemispheres could lead to a feeling that the same experience had been had before. These are just arguments about the plausibility of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, not a full explanation. A full explanation of the phenomenon is not yet available because we do not have a very thorough understanding of how memory works.

            "answer_text": "Deja Vu is basically an illusion, or a polite description of lucid daydreaming. The mind is and always be a mystery and a tricky thing. When we sleep, out brains go through waves of activity. It is processing collective information that was gathered by all of the sensors, mostly sight and sound. During this process, bits, pieces, and snippets of this information get tossed into the REM blender just before the times you awaken and creates dreams. Dreams can be fleeting or vivid. Otherwise dreams can fade as you become more conscious and then they are gone, so they are fleeting. Then the ones that stay with you and have that surreal reality to it are vivid dreams, and stay long enough that if you make the effort, you could and maybe should journal them. Some amazing concepts have developed out of dreams. The feeling of Deja Vu does not appear before events, they are only active while the events are happening and again it is just a feeling of a surreal reality, as if you are remembering it from a time before. So in most cases it is nothing more that your mind reacting in a similar mode as vivid recall of a dream. It can be attributed to as simple as being tired, stressed, or having other matters on your mind. You even could have momentarily lapses in a brief half second of sleep, which does not always give you a knee jerk jolt. There are also medical conditions where Deja Vu is more common than it is for normal folk, and that is in such the case of those who suffer from Epilepsy. And no, just because you experience Deja Vu, it is not a symptom that you are an Epileptic, so all of you hypochondriacs should not get all exited. cheers ",

In other words, the things that we consciously make a mental note of, are stored in the conscious mind and rest everything that we perceive in a by-the-way form is stored in the subconscious mind. Now, the subconscious mind stores the information in the form of fragments. As mentioned earlier, the information stored in the subconscious mind is perceived in a by-the-way form, it cannot be stored as clearly and accurately as it is stored in the conscious mind. Hence, it is stored in the form of fragments and our subconscious mind joins these fragments by imagining the most obvious occurrences that might have happened in order to form a link between the fragments.  Because of these 'links' that are stored in the subconscious mind, we tend to experience the feeling of 'deja vu' when they actually happen for real. So in short, deja vu is nothing but the obvious connecting links (Our brain tries to connect these fragments by imagining that \"this might have happened\") that our brain forms between the fragments. That is why, if you notice, the deja vu occurrence seems quite simple and  obvious to us whenever it happens.Hope this was easier for you to understand. :) ",

The brain at the subconscious level appears to be searching stored patterns and then interpolating, extrapolating, and combing those patterns into conscious meaning. Since you are relatively unaware of much that surrounds you -- a survival and threat detection mechanism to filter stimuli -- you may have experienced elements that resulted in stored patterns -- which when subconsciously interpolated, extrapolated, or combined may present as a conscious vague, familiar feeling of experience.

To make things even more complicated, it depends on which form of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experience you are wishing to explain (event-related, location-related, epilepsy-related, brief, extended, rare, frequent, and so on). Which theory you favor also tends to depend on which field of study you are interested in: psychology, neurology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, or parapsychology.  His book provides the best overview of what we think we know and the questions that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu research are confronted with that I know of and I highly recommend it.  There is also quite a lot of information provided here: https://deja-experience-research.org but a some of it is now a bit out-of-date.

When that memory is picked up then a signal is send to the brain and we visualize that memory.Now consider at a particular moment our mind is in  a subconscious state and at the same time we visualize something so that memory gets stores immediately in our subconscious mind state which means that  particular memory gets stores temporarily..Now when we visualize the same thing again in our consious state of our mind (since subconsious state  just remains for a very very short period of time)..then just  before storing that  memory  our brain permanently our brain first pick that temporary piece of memory and process it first and replace it with permanent piece of memory.Due to  processing of that  piece of memory in our brain we experienced deja vu..

            "answer_text": "Here is what causes d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu according to Chris Moulin, a Lecturer in Cognitive Neuropsychology at Leeds University: \"Our view is that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is caused by disruptions to brain functioning in the temporal lobe, the area of the brain behind the ears.  We know this area to be important for memory function, and our view is that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is just a brief memory error.  The exciting thing about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is that it is the results of two opposing evaluations, the knowledge that something hasn't happened before, but the feeling that it has.  We believe that one of the functions of the temporal lobe is to produce these feelings of memory.  Sometimes, when this area is overactive, or 'tricked' into thinking something is familiar, we get a brief sensation of feeling something is old, but knowing it is new.  Our view is largely based on the work we've done on people with chronic d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (actually d\u00e9j\u00e0 vecu, or recollective confabulation), a rare memory disorder caused by cell loss in the brain which leads to almost constant d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - especially for novel events.\"  (Source: https://elgg.leeds.ac.uk/psccjam/weblog/1226.html).

All humans have two compartments to their memory , conscious and subconscious . Conscious memory is the everyday store of memories that we can access at will. The subconscious acts in the background and is kind of a recording of all we see and hear. One way of accessing the subconscious is through hypnosis , there are numerous documented examples of people under hypnosis recalling long \u201cforgotten \u201c details from their past. Occasionally when we are having an ordinary day that feeling of deja vu overcomes us ,the reason being that things reach the subconscious a nano second before we comprehend the the present therefore we experience it as a memory . this occasional glitch in our wiring has led many outlandish and sometimes hilarious theories.

The feeling of you may have already experienced or met someone before is reported to occur on an occasional basis in 60-80% of people.

According to Wikipedia, science approaches and rejects the explanation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as \"precognition\" or \"prophecy\", but rather explain it as an anomaly of memory, which creates a distinct impression that an experience is \"being recalled\".

In the case of both actual neurons (as demonstrated by many psychological memory studies) and artificial neural networks which behave similarly, the human thinking apparatus has strengths and weaknesses.  The brain is not good at things like precision memory (in fact, the idea of \"photographic\" memory has been largely discredited) or algebra.  It is excellent at pattern recognition and association.  When you are presented with a set of  inputs, the brain takes and compares them with associations and patterns it has seen before and attempts to make sense of them.  It's not an explicitly logical process, and so I imagine the feelings of similarity are caused by observing patterns similar to ones you have seen before. I hope that's correct. ",
