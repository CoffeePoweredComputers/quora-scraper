            "answer_text": "In Wikipedia there is a very interesting table showing how electromagnetic waves propagate according to the frequency.  Tab. 1 - Radio frequencies and primary mode of propagation  Fig. 1 - Layers of the atmosphere The ionosphere is a shell of electrons and electrically charged atoms and molecules around our planet that is ionized by solar radiation and influences radio propagation to distant places.  Fig. 2 - Ionosphere  Fig. 3 - Layers of the ionosphere  Fig. 4 - Night and day structure of the ionosphere  Fig. 5 - How the ionospheric layers reflect different frequencies Lower frequencies (between 30 and 3,000 kHz) have the property of following the curvature of the earth via groundwave propagation in the majority of occurrences. Medium wave signals (300\u20133,000 kHz) use ground propagation only during the day. The D region will absorb any signals it meets. At night the D region becomes invisible and the waves pass through to the E region. The E region reflects the signal back to the ground. Higher frequencies are not reflected by the E region. As frequency goes up, reflection goes down. E region reflection tends to make for shorter hops, meaning shorter distance DX. DX (short for DXing) is the hobby of receiving and identifying distant radio signals. Short waves (3\u201330 MHz) can hop more than once. They can be bounced back to the ground, then reflected back up to the ionosphere once again for another hop, sometimes several more times. This is how DX is achieved from the other side of the globe. Water (the ocean) reflects the signal much better than land. The surface of the Earth and the D layer will weaken signal strength during each hop. VHF signals are generally direct waves, but they can still have some refraction. From UHF up, signals propagate with direct waves only. This means that to achieve long distance transmissions on the ground with VHF and UHF signals it is necessary to use repeaters. Radio propagation ",

            "answer_text": "The reason is that EM radiation at higher frequencies are more susceptible to reflection. If the wavelength of a wave is smaller than the dimensions of the obstacle it faces, it will get reflected by the obstacle.  On the other hand, when the dimensions of the wave are larger than the dimensions of the obstacle, the wave diffracts i.e bends around the obstacle.  This is one main reason, that longer wavelength waves are able to travel longer distances. On the other hand, in guided wave propagation, which works on the principle of total internal reflection, it is advantageous to use high frequency waves to keep the waveguide dimensions small. See my answer here: Nikhil Panikkar's answer to Why can a waveguide not be used at low frequencies? ",
