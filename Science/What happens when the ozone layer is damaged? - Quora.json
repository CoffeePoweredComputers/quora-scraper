            "answer_text": "What happens when the ozone layer is damaged? Ozone in the upper atmosphere serves to absorb ultraviolet light from the sun. This is important to us and many other life-forms because UV light causes sunburn and skin cancer. When the ozone in the upper atmosphere is broken down by some of the chemicals that we emit, it changes into a form that no longer blocks UV. For various complicated reasons, so far, our damage has been limited to the areas above the North and South poles\u2026and not much lives in those places, so it hasn\u2019t caused too many horrendous side-effects. But we have to be careful with substances such as chloroflorocarbon that are notorious at destroying ozone. Ozone is actually just oxygen. Normal oxygen molecules have two atoms bound together - that\u2019s the oxygen we breathe down here at ground level. But up in the upper atmosphere, oxygen can be bound into molecules with THREE atoms together - and that\u2019s what we call \u201cozone\u201d. This isn\u2019t a very stable molecule - and it doesn\u2019t take much to make it convert back into regular two-atom oxygen - which doesn\u2019t absorb UV light so well. Ozone is not good stuff to breathe - so it\u2019s fortunate that it mostly only exists at very high altitudes. Here at ground level, there are processes that create ozone - lightning storms and electrical arcs being good examples. That tangy smell in the air after a big storm - or if something makes a big spark for some reason - that\u2019s ozone. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is \u201cWhat happens when the Ozone (O3) layer is damaged?\u201d You can\u2019t really \u201cdamage\u201d the Ozone layer per se. Ozone is natural, it gets \u201ccreated\u201d every day, and, although most people don\u2019t know it, all around us. It\u2019s mostly created by a reaction of UV light from the Sun with Oxygen. If YOU are getting sunlight around you (why you wear POLARIZED(anti-UV) sunglasses), you\u2019re also getting BRAND NEW OZONE! (Anti-Ozone experts hate to admit this) Ozone is either there or it\u2019s been reverted BACK to Oxygen, so there\u2019s no inbetween. There can be MORE Vs less, depending on the pollutants around. \u201cEveryone agrees\u201d: O3 is very volatile and reacts whenever it can with organic materials in the air or on the ground. It \u201cquickly\u201d throws it\u2019s 3rd O molecule to the material it\u2019s encountered and changes its \u201cmolecular\u201d structure, it keeps doing this until it\u2019s neutralized. (It\u2019s what I coined/trademarked in 2007, a \u201cSanitizing Air Technology\u201d (SAT)) Anti-Ozone \u201cExperts\u201d ignore: Odors and chemicals are very quickly neutralized by relatively low amounts of Ozone! Ozone machine WOW tests include pouring Ammonia on a paper towel and eliminating the odors and toxic chemicals in less than 2 minutes. Ozone (O3) reverts BACK into O2/Oxygen. Nice, right? \u201cExperts\u201d don\u2019t mention: Every day the Ozone \u201clayer\u201d is re-created by more UV rays. The reason the media \u201creports\u201d damage\u201d or elimination\u201d of the Ozone layer is because, 1) they don\u2019t have a CLUE what it really is, and 2) the Oil Protection Agency (EPA) under Pro-Oil presidents has made Ozone a \u201c POLLUTANT\u201d! Notice we \u201csmog/pollution\u201d test for \u201cOzone\u201d during polluted days? But it\u2019s actually Ozone and Ionization that ELIMINATES the pollution, second by second\u2026 during daylight hours. No sun = no ozone or ionization! Notice that Asthmatics have most of their Asthma attacks at night? Indoors? No ozone or Ionization! Another \u201cgreat SAT\u201d anti \u201cnasty\u201d is Hydroxyls, and the latest and greatest SAT, \u201cHydroperoxides\u201d, is Hydrogen Peroxide Plasma Gas, which is completely safe and HUGELY effective against viruses, bacteria, mold etc! After all, like our Microbiologist, Dr. Al Brenner PhD. said, \u201cWe\u2019re only killing single-celled organisms! Indoors, it doesn\u2019t take pouring chemicals, alcohol, and HEPA filters to neutralize and kill chemicals, viruses, and microbes!\u201d (Just an Air Purifier with SATs like the ones engineered and sold at GET-GreenTech. com) Recently Cannabis growers have been testing the HPGP SAT tech since \u201ctoo much\u201d Ozone is bad for everyone, including plants. Ozone is like a Hot Water tank. You can adjust it too high or too low. BUT\u2026 like with Ozone, you try to keep it as LOW as you \u201cneed it\u201d. New cannabis \u201ctrimming\u201d machines and rooms, and dispensaries Like Magnolia Wellness of Oakland, Ca. are eliminating odors with GET air purifiers in them. \u201cDamage\u201d would seem to imply a \u201cdaily\u201d injection of toxic/polluted air getting \u201cneutralized\u201d by atmospheric Ozone, and it\u2019s concentrated in certain places by the spinning of the earth and areas that spew it out. If people knew that ANY pollution kills our Ozone layer(s) and our protections \u201cagainst toxic and deadly pollution and UV rays\u201d, then there would be a mass call to CHANGE our energy production and auto MPG\u2019s. (Why Obama jumpstarted renewables and increased (doubled the last 100 years) Auto MPG so quietly) People would ALSO demand Ozone and other SAT technologies be mandatory in all schools and government buildings to cut illnesses and costs of education and government! As for the GOOD UP THERE, but BAD DOWN HERE \u201cOzone myth\u201d, the other way Ozone is created tons at a time, is by rainstorms. Hurricane Katrina had 2/3rds of the USA covered with DEEP PURPLE OZONE on the Weather maps. Yet there were ZERO instances of Asthma attacks! Asthmatics LOVE Ozone! Especially during thunderstorms with all the extra ionization! It kills mold, chemicals, pollution, and odors, and the ionization knocks particulates out of the air! All things that attack and \u201clower\u201d the immune systems of every living thing. Asthma after all, is simply allergies and your constantly attacked and lowered immune system saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to breathe this any more!\u201d I actually studied \u201cevery\u201d study the EPA posts about OZONE = BAD. Not a one (including the Consumer Reports articles) has ANY HUMAN TRIALS (or pollings), yet the USA has over 30,000,000 \u201cOzone machines\u201d in use at any one time for over 20 years now! Each \u201cEPA\u201d study is a \u201cpaper\u201d study that copies and pastes (C&P) another\u2019s findings. A circle jerk in effect. All the studies love to C&P the same flawed EPA study with kids that used Rush-Hour Stoplight Exhaust air pumped into a room full of asthmatic kids (CRAPPY ethics), then INCREASED the gasses in the room by adding Commercial Grade Ozone! The kids started coughing harder immediately, and PRESTO! The Study was STOPPED and \u201ccalled\u201d Completed! If they had allowed the room to be evacuated, then added the Ozone and waited for 5\u201310 minutes to reintroduce kids, the result would have been \u201cOZONE IS CHEAP MEDICAL MAGIC\u201d! Many hospitals from the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s had Emergency Ozone Rooms to stop emphysema and asthma coughing attacks. Found stories on the Net. But then the AMA and DRUGS ONLY came into use. Hope this gives you a clearer understanding of what Ozone really is and does. It\u2019s actually GOOD everywhere, \u201cas needed\u201d! Even in pools and it\u2019s almost mandatory in hot tubs! ",
