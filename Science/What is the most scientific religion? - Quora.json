            "answer_text": "\"Scientific\" means knowledge generating.  In this sense, the most scientific religion isn't a long lived, stable, psychological or metaphysical religion like Buddhism, Hinduism, or high church Christianity. They've made whatever contribution to science they were going to make a long time ago, and now mostly just curate it and teach it to further generations. That makes them historical, not scientific.. No, the most scientific religion would be some sort of short-lived cult which makes actual, testable predictions about miraculous and uncanny phenomena. It doesn't last long, but you learn a lot from it while it does. Its very existence is an experiment brough to its inevitable conclusion. There's a fundamental disconnection between scientificness and the things we value in religion. Science isn't one final state that's the same today, tomorrow, and yesterday. It's constantly in flux. The largest, most popular, and best known religions aren't; they are stable and convey an impression of certainty about things which we can't, properly speaking, ever be certain of. These qualities are opposites, but they're complementary. Long lived stable religions like Buddhism owe their longevity to the fact that they are not scientific: they are metaphysical, internal, subjective, psychological... These are qualities which complement science, but they are not scientific in themselves. Scientificness isn't necessarily something you'd want in a religion. A scientific religion is like a wrist watch with a built in toaster. It can tell you the time and toast bread, but it can't do either particularly well. A scientific religion isn't likely to do particularly good science, so we shouldn't expect it to.  Something can't be scientific without being testable. The more testable claims a religion makes, the more likely it is to be wrong about those claims. When you set out to make a scientific religion, you wind out with something like \"scientific creationism,\" which is bad science and even worse theology. ",

            "answer_text": "its islam with no doubt.there are many and many proofs1. Origin of LifeWater is essential for all living things. We all know that water is vital to life but the Quran makes a very unusual claim:We made every living thing from water? Will they not believe? [21:30]In this verse water is pointed out as the origin of all life. All living things are made of cells. We now know that cells are mostly made up of water [4]. For example, 80% of the cytoplasm (basic cell material) of a standard animal cell is described as water in biology textbooks.The fact that living things consist mostly of water was discovered only after the invention of the microscope. In the deserts of Arabia, the last thing someone would have guessed is that all life came from water.2. IronIron is not natural to the earth. It did not form on the earth but came down to earth from outer space. This may sound strange but it\u2019s true. Scientists have found that billions of years ago the earth was stuck by meteorites. These meteorites were carrying Iron from distant stars which had exploded [5].The Quran says the following on the origin of Iron:We sent down Iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for humankind [57:25]God uses the words \u2018sent down\u2019 for Iron. It is clear from the verse that Iron is not an earthly material, but was sent down for the benefit of humanity. The fact that Iron came down to earth from outer space, is something which could not be known by the primitive science of the 7th century.3. Sky\u2019s ProtectionThe sky plays a crucial role in protecting the earth. The sky protects the earth from the lethal rays of the sun. If the sky did not exist then the sun\u2019s radiation would have killed off all life on earth. It also acts like a blanket wrapped around the earth, to protect it from the freezing cold of space. The temperature just above the sky is approximately -270oC. If this temperature was to reach earth then the planet would freeze over instantly. The sky also protects life on earth by warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night [6]. These are some of the many protective functions of the sky.The Quran asks us to consider the sky in the following verse:We made the sky a protective ceiling. And yet they are turning away from Our signs! [21:32]The Quran points to the sky\u2019s protection as a sign of God. The protective properties of the sky were discovered by scientific research conducted in the 20th century.4.MountainsThe Quran draws our attention to a very important characteristic of mountains:Did We not make the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes? [78:6-7]The Quran indicates that mountains have deep roots by using the word stakes to describe them. In fact mountains do have deep roots [7], and the word stakes is an accurate description for them. A book titled \u2018Earth\u2019 by Geophysicist Frank Press explains that mountains are like stakes, and are buried deep under the surface of the earth [8].Mount Everest (pictured below), the height of which is approximately 9 km above ground, has a root deeper than 125 km.The fact that mountains have deep \u2018stake\u2019 like roots was not known, until after the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the beginning of the 20th century [9].5. Expansion of the UniverseAt a time when the science of Astronomy was still primitive, the expansion of the universe was described in Quran:And it is We who have built the Universe with [Our creative] power and keep expanding it. [51:47]The fact that the universe is expanding was discovered in the last century. The physicist Stephen Hawking in his book \u2018A Brief History of Time\u2019 writes, \u201cThe discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.\u201d[10].The Quran mentioned the expansion of the universe even before the invention of the telescope!6. Sun\u2019s Orbit In 1512 the astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forward his theory that the Sun is motionless at the centre of the solar system, and that the planets revolve around it. The belief that the Sun is stationary was widespread amongst astronomers until the 20th century. It is now a well-established scientific fact that the Sun is not stationary, but is moving in an orbit around the centre of our Milky Way galaxy [11].The Quran mentions the orbit of the Sun:It is He who created night and day, the Sun and the Moon, each floating in its orbit. [21:33]The Quran would have been wrong according to astronomers just a couple of decades ago. But we now know that the Quranic account of the Sun\u2019s motion is consistent with modern Astronomy.7. The OceanThe Quran uses imagery to covey its deep meanings, here it describes the state of the unbelievers as:Darkness out in a deep ocean which is covered by waves, above which are waves, above which are clouds, layers of darkness, one upon the other. When one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it. Those God gives no light to, they have no light. [24:40]It is commonly thought that waves only occur on the surface of the ocean. However oceanographers have discovered that there are internal waves that take place below the surface of the ocean. These waves are invisible to the human eye, and can only be detected by specialist equipment [12]. The Quran mentions darkness in a deep ocean above which are waves, above which are waves, then clouds above that. This description is not only remarkable because it describes the internal waves in the ocean, but also because it describes darkness deep in the ocean. A human being can dive no more than 70 metres without breathing equipment. Light is present at that depth, but if we go down 1000 metres it is completely dark [13]. 1400 years ago there were no submarines or specialist equipment to discover internal waves or the darkness deep inside the oceans.8. Lying and MovementThere was a cruel oppressive tribal leader named Abu Jahl who lived during the time of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). God revealed a verse of the Quran to warn him:No Indeed! If he does not stop, We will seize him by the forehead, his lying, sinful forehead. [96:15-16]God does not call this person a liar, but calls his forehead (the front part of the brain) \u2018lying\u2019 and \u2018sinful\u2019, and warns him to stop.This verse is significant for two reasons. The first is that the front part of our brain is responsible for voluntary movement [14] .This is known as the frontal lobe. A book titled \u2018Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology\u2019 which includes the results of research on the functions of this area states: The motivation and the foresight to plan and initiate movements occur in the anterior portion of the frontal lobes, the prefrontal area [15]. The part of the brain that is responsible for movement is said to be seized if the man does not stop.Secondly, numerous studies have shown that this same region (frontal lobe) is responsible for the lying function of the brain [16].One such study at the University of Pennsylvania in which volunteers were asked questions during a computerized interrogation, it was found that when the volunteers were lying there was significantly increased activity in the prefrontal and premotor cortices (frontal lobe region) [17].The front part of the brain is responsible for movement and lying. The Quran links movement and lying to this area. These functions of the frontal lobe were discovered with medical imaging equipment which was developed in the 20th century.9. Pain Receptors For a long time it was thought that the sense of feeling and pain was dependent on the brain. However it has been discovered that there are pain receptors present in the skin [18]. Without these pain receptors, a person would not be able to feel pain.Consider the following verse on pain:We shall send those who reject Our revelations to the (Hell) Fire. When their skins have been burned away, We shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to feel the pain: God is Almighty, All-Wise. [4:56]God tells the people who reject his message that when they are in Hell and their skins are burnt off (so they can\u2019t feel any pain), he will give them new skins so that they continue to feel the pain.The Quran makes it clear that pain is dependent upon on the skin. The discovery of pain receptors in the skin is a fairly recent discovery for Biology.we conclude that:These are just some of the many scientific facts found in the Quran. It is important to note that the Quran is not a book of science, but that it is consistent with science. To claim that scientific facts in the Quran are due to coincidence would be irrational. The best explanation is that God revealed this knowledge to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).Just like the Quran contains knowledge about the natural world, it also contains information about the inner dimensions of our souls. It relates to our feelings, wants and needs. The Quran informs us that we have a purpose in life, and that following God\u2019s guidance will lead us to inner peace in this life, and Paradise in the hereafter. And that rejection of his message will lead to depression in this life and Hellfire after death. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, religion says almost nothing about science (literalists who say it does are doing it wrong), and science says almost nothing about religion (because science is tied to the observable, measurable universe and can thus never answers questions about anything beyond it). I think the only way to look at the question objectively would be to ask \u201cWhich religion has people doing the most science?\u201d, and the answer to that has changed over the course of history. By \u201cdoing science\u201d I mean taking measurements, drawing up hypotheses, testing them, finding the best one, and using that theory to explore further. The ancient Egyptians certainly did some, measuring the size of the Earth and building simple steam engines. The ancient Chinese did a lot of work, especially with chemicals and materials. The ancient Greeks thought a lot about it, but tended towards philosophy rather than true experimental research. The early years of Christianity were a bit of a scientific wasteland it\u2019s true, and the west fell well behind the Islamic world in science. Islamic scholars made great progress in mathematics, astronomy, chemistry and medicine. However, once we reach the Age of Enlightenment, Christians clearly take the lead in scientific research. While the Enlightenment certainly included a large chunk of scepticism about religion, it also saw religious people having the freedom to move away from blind adherence to Scripture, allowing them explore the natural world around them, and they saw this as exploring God\u2019s creation in an honourable way. Sponsoring scientific investigations became fashionable among the wealthy, and the results were widely shared and disbursed. Today, the field is more balanced again, with faithful people of all religions (and none) doing amazing scientific work. You should never take the noisy anti-science stance of a few American (or ISIS) nutjobs as representative of most people of faith. Throughout the centuries, religion has often (not always) been more a driver than a barrier to science. ",

            "answer_text": "Any religion where the results of what it teaches can be measured and applied in a practical way by anyone who follows a prescribed method fulfils scientific principle. Usually, 99% of the time, people are not willing to follow the prescribed method properly. They talk about it and claim it is not scientific without actually fulfilling the requirements to prove or disprove it. We need evidence. If a certain teaching prescribes a method or technique and claims that by following this method carefully you will receive evidence, unless you actually follow that method to conclusion you cannot pass judgement on it. That is like a scientist who disses a scientific experiment without actually undertaking research of the experiments explained in the paper. That usually happens when the scientist making the judgement has preconceived notions about the subject. Scientists are really good at that. They claim logic and intelligence about one thing but diss another because it doesn't fit into their system. Pasteur's research into bacteriology and germ theory rocked the boat, especially of theories of spontaneous generation of living organisms which was widely accepted then. Then you have Semmelweis who suggested doctors wash their hands before they operate. He was also dismissed as a fool as his observations conflicted with established scientific opinion of the time. His theories were widely accepted only years after his death.  The science of both Pasteur and Semmelweis are just examples of how the greatest scientist of the era would not accept anything outside of their field of vision, yet just a hundred and fifty or so years later, their science is regarded and plain common sense. So scientists themselves are the very best at denying scientific fact if it offends their own vision. This is often the case with scientists when it comes to applying scientific principle to religious/spiritual results. A sound religious teaching will prescribe a method, a technique by which, if carefully and accurately observed, guarantees results. The method will usually take more effort and discipline than many are willing to apply, so instead they simply dismiss it. That is very unscientific. As an example, the practice of something like the yogic technique of kriya yoga is very scientific. To do kriya the follower must follow a prescribed and very exacting method. Available to anything but requiring tremendous concentration and application over a long period of time. By applying this method, the student is told, you will experience certain events. If you do not experience these events, you should question your application to the prescribed technique.  So the method fulfils scientific requirements: it is predicted that by following the method precisely and for long enough one observes certain outcomes. These observations provide evidence as predicted which is the same for all who follow the method as prescribed. That is very scientific.  The method has been applied and proved perhaps countless times by thousands of people. Including some of the world's most highly decorated and recognised scientists. It could be said to be the highest religious and spiritual teaching and removes the notion of simple 'belief' as the basis of argument, even though belief is also good (no scientist worth his title undertook long periods of experiment without a belief in what he/she was seeking to achieve).  The method is also beyond being falsifiable, which is important to consider, because by following the technique accurately, the outcome is guaranteed. An alternative outcome is not possible, although many alternative outcomes have been claimed, always by people who have not undertaken the exact prescribed experiment or have not undertaken anything at all. Anyone can test it as it is no secret. However to receive the technique does require some preparation. Just as a child needs to graduate from high school before he can enter college, certain prerequisites need to be fulfilled before being taught the kriya technique. So to dismiss a particular religious teaching or method merely because one is not willing to undertake the prescribed method based on nothing more than a cynical and arrogant disrespect for religion is about as baseless as a religious person saying the world is only 4000 years because that's what my preacher told me.

            "answer_text": "None. Science in itself is vague in totality though in innumerable specifics it is quite accurate. We are yet to go a very very long way in science. That is about understanding everything, the why of everything and the ability to apply it for whatever goals we are yet to discover. Science changes its standards and updates itself every moment. So science is as such not absolute. As per science we are not sure whether creation and destruction are a part of the same source. We are not sure if there is any big bang or there are multiple con-current big-bangs. Whether big-bang is a cycle etc. Why big-bang is a mystery. But the theory works for quite some scientific observations and learning but not everything or all that is observable and not observable. There are various scientific observations which are not satisfied by the big-bang model. Let us try examining religions by current science standards: Base of all abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) is that God revealed himself to Abraham. What is God? What is the meaning of God revealing? In human form, in some light form, or in the form of voice? Why only male form for God? Why only to Abraham? Why believe what Abraham tells us? Whatever, no scientific base.Hinduism based on \u201cadvaita\u201d philosophy claims all living and non-living things are a part of same source responsible for creation and destruction. Called Brahman, the awesome. Sounds very scientific as per current tenets of science. But has no specifics or ability to recreate at least small parts of the philosophy in to material achievements like astronomy, medicine, physics or chemistry. \u201cAdvaita\u201d is a very very top level philosophy that works on spirituality or psychological level but not at scientific levels.Hinduism of Gods is all mixed up with history, faith and fables. No scientific base.Buddhism and Jainism are off shoots of Hinduism. Hence not close to science.Pagan, Norse Gods, Roman Gods not scientific in the sense that there is no physical evidence.So religions are not scientifically possible. Religions are a matter of faith. People need faith till science can absolutely solve any problem. Religions are here for good till then. Keep praying that at least God can save us. Science is proving us everyday, every minute that it cannot save us as long as it is handled by politicians and capitalists. Even religions cannot save us long as they are told to us by fanatic believers. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is both ambiguous and makes assumptions that are not rational and scientific in itself. First, religion usually deals with the metaphysical and spiritual issues whereas science deals with the natural world. So followers of many religions would claim that their beliefs are outside of scientific inquiry. Second, what does \u201cmost\u201d scientific mean? Do you mean a religion which is most compatible with modern scientific findings? To answer your question or more accurately rephrase it, you should be asking: Is there a religion that does not contain anything which is against scientifically proven facts? To this I would answer there is no such religion. All religions contain material that are incompatible with today\u2019s understanding of the natural world. This is mainly due to the fact that religions were the ideas of people who lived before recent scientific discoveries and therefore had no idea about what we know now. It is usually their followers now that try to interpret their religious texts to match recent scientific findings. The same followers would reinterpret (and have done so in the past) the same text to match newer discoveries. As someone who believes in God but is secular and does not follow any religion I am very critical of attempts to frame any religion as being \u201cscientific\u201d and have criticized the main religions practiced today both from rational and scientific perspective in my book (available for free): The Kashfence Philosophy (Discovering through Rational and Scientific Analysis).

Thus, as stated by Soma Thera, the Kalama Sutta is just that; the Buddha's charter of free inquiry: The instruction of the Kalamas (Kalama Sutta) is justly famous for its encouragement of free inquiry; the spirit of the sutta signifies a teaching that is exempt from fanaticism, bigotry, dogmatism, and intolerance.

Groeneveld (Institute for Animal Breeding, Federal Agricultural Research Center) of United Nations, Under Technical Issues for SCCC section, It's clearly written that \"....but somatic cells from ear clippings will be much easier to obtain and are therefore preferable.\" Source: Animal genetic resources information  According to a report by Reuters dated 1 May, 2002, a research veterinarian at the University of Sao Paolo in Brazil, Jose Visintin, produced cloned embryos for the first time in the country by using cells taken from the ear of an adult cow. Source: Scientists oppose Bt cotton/Anger grows over failure to stop GM crop test  BBC report said that a new clone had been produced using ear cells from an adult cow in research carried out by Dr. Jean-Paul Renard et al. at the Institute National de la RechercheAgronomique in France. Source: Cloning may damage long-term health  A report by Associated Press, dated 24 January, 2000, announced that Japanese scientists had cloned the clone of a bull for the first time. In the re-cloning, skin tissue samples from the first generation cloned bull\u2019s ear were taken when it was four months old. These cells were then fused with an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus had been removed. Source: GE - cloning/animals/fish/humans  \u25c7Iron Sent Down: \"We sent down iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for humankind.\" Quran 57:25 Before the Iron Age, Most Iron Came From Space  \u25c7Darkness in the seas and internal waves: Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are clouds - darknesses, some of them upon others. When one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it. And he to whom Allah has not granted light - for him there is no light. Quran 24:40  Measurements made with today's technology have revealed that between 3 and 30 percent of the sunlight is reflected at the surface of the sea. Then, almost all of the seven colours of the light spectrum are absorbed, one after another, in the first 200 metres, except for blue light. Below a depth of 1,000 metres, there is no light at all.  \u25c7Sex Determination of Child: Was he not a drop of ejected semen? Then He created an embryo out of it! He made it into male or female! Quran 75:37&39  This proves that the sex determination of the child depends upon the chromosomes of the father. A recently-discovered fact, mentioned centuries ago in the Quran.  \u25c7Sky's Protection Ozone layer: \"We (God) made the sky a protective ceiling. And yet they are turning away from Our signs!\" Quran 21:32  \u25c7Relativity of Time: The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day whose length is fifty thousand years. Quran 70:4  Today, the relativity of time is a proven scientific fact. This was revealed by Einstein's theory of relativity during the early part of the 20th century. Until then, it was not known that time was relative, nor that it could change according to the circumstances.  \u25c7Orbit of planets and stars: It is He who created night and day, the Sun and the Moon, each floating in its orbit.\" Quran 21:33  \u25c7Life of Stars: So, when the stars will be extinguished, Quran 77:8  This verse suggests that Stars are not everlasting, which came into the light after Conservation of energy theory in 1840.  \u25c7Creation of Men: Proclaim, in the name of thy Lord, Who created - created man from `alaq. Quran 96:1-2  `alaq is anything that sticks or hangs. As recently as the 18th century, the prevailing notion in human embryology was preformation: the idea that semen contains an embryo \u2014 a preformed, miniature infant, or \"homunculus\" \u2014 that simply becomes larger during development.  \u25c7Mixing of Seas: He has let loose the two seas, converging together, with a barrier between them which they do not break through.\" Quran 55:19-20  A physical force called surface tension prevents the waters of neighbouring seas from mixing, due to the difference in the density of these waters.  \u25c7Creation of humans: Now let man but think from what he is created! He is created from a drop emitted - Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs:\" Quran 86:5-7  Sperm is produced in the testes and is then transfered to the seminal vesicles awaiting ejaculation, is accounts for 5 % of the ejaculate, the rest of the ejaculate comes from the seminal vesicles (46-80%),with the prostate gland and the bulbourethral and urethral glands producing the rest of the ejaculate.  \u25c7Weight of clouds: It is He Who shows you the lightning, striking fear and bringing hope; it is He Who heaps up the heavy clouds. Quran 13:12  According to scientists, the weight of an average cumulus cloud is 1.1 million pounds!  This proves that Qur'an is God's word because only god can give 100% correct information (that too 1400 years ago) ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there, when you're talking Religion and Science, you'll usually find the 2 are about as far apart as you can get without leaving the universe behind in both directions if you get that analogy. Can't think any two disciplines could be further apart. However, if you are looking for the closest blending of the two being that one deals entirely with faith. And the other, science, deals completely with what's observable, measurable, and what can be repeated in an experimentation over and over again, with reproducible results. if you are looking for the blending of the two oh, then you are interested in the theory of intelligent design. It's a small sub-sect of scientists that also, despite any measurable evidence existing to support the existence of a god oh, except for one small scientific fact they cling to. and that is\u2026 That when the universe was in its infancy. When the universe was just billionth of a second old there was a billionth of a second when the universe existed in a completely balanced state. Please allow me to explain. if you look at a map of the universe, especially other than visible light spectrums, you will see areas of cold and hot unevenly distributed. it's the most common picture of the universe most of us are used to seeing. There was again however a literal billionth of a second where's the heat that was distributed was entirely even. These scientists postulate that the chances of that occurring are so astronomically High oh, that there must be an intelligent hand at play. I'm not an expert on it but I choose to answer these questions because for some reason, likely an eidetic memory, that has throughout my life served me the fashion that I remember and retain just about everything I read see or hear. please do some research into the theory of intelligent design oh, and I'm sure you will find a plethora of more detailed information. perhaps this is the religion for you oh, there's really not that much to it, you don't have to go to church or anything. To be a member one must simply believe or accept the general theory that something is huge and is complex as the universe could not have spawned itself, without a greater hand involved and it's making. Good luck, and if there is a Church? Let me know if there's any good looking girls there. I hope you appreciate the irony of my humor. If your religion is simply that something exists greater than ourselves, but they haven't passed down any rules Commandments, or terms that one must live under? I would think some pretty hot intelligent girls might be there. all humor aside the theory of intelligence design is the theory you are looking to investigate. Thank you KSG ",

            "answer_text": "No religion is truly scientific. Religion is about subjective experience and faith divorced from and often contradicted by external evidence. Science is about mechanisms of reality that we can measure and test in a repeatable way no matter who does the experiment. When considering the origins of both Biblical and other religions, it is well to remember that many of the writers of these books never traveled more than a few days journey from the places they were born. And it is absolutely necessary to understand that many of the texts that have survived to modern times have been rewritten by authors more recent than the original. For example, there were three authors of the book of Isaiah, spread out across several hundred years. With the exception of the books of James (the brother of Jesus), the Christian new testament was written almost entirely by Paul and his disciples, beginning about 20 years after the Crucifixion. None of these authors ever heard Jesus of Nazareth speak. The essence of psychiatric neurosis is the ability to hold mutually contradictory concepts in mind at the same time and to demand that both should be accepted as true. ",

There is a phrase, \u201cthe true aspect of all phenomena,\u201d a line from the distant past, that pretty much sums it up. The point, and purpose, of Buddhism, is to learn how to relieve or eliminate suffering in our daily lives. It is unusually psychological (for a religion), and lays out the specific human behaviors that lead us into suffering. Denying reality - in this case, the findings of science - can only lead us into delusion, the source of so much personal pain and suffering. It is a religion, because it is socially organized and has a ritual - usually some form of chanting - that is designed to enable us to be in touch with our inner nature in our pursuit of peace and tranquility. Chanting is a way of finding out how function as human beings by searching our thoughts and feelings. However, Buddhism does not study science, but accepts the findings of the experts. ",

Why would God (Who is perfect) create an irrational system for the physical world? Secondly, the Catholic Church has sponsored practically ALL western modern science. We owe the scientific method to the Church. Who thought of the Big Bang? A Catholic PRIEST! What about genetics? Gregor Mendel was a Catholic monk! Universities are also a Catholic work. One could bring up Galileo, but many have a modern misunderstanding of him and the relationship with the Church. The Church has NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER with heliocentrism, but Galileo preached it as truth before it could be proven. Secondly, he also made theological arguments. He was out of his place in that regard. The Church did have a problem with his unwarranted theological rhetoric. Most people believe that the Church was against heliocentrism, but that is a misconception (in fact, today if you were openly a geocentrist you\u2019d probably be the only one there). ",

            "answer_text": "Christianity as if one studies the Bible one will find when it speaks of anything on a scientific level, it is always totally accurate. A scientist must comprehend the language of scripture to see the truth. The Bible says to Study to show they self approved before God. So if you want to know God you have to study about Him and know Who He is before you can figure out what He is saying. I love science and science fiction and since I was a child I have seen science fiction become science fact. I was born in 1950. Can you imagine what I have seen become fact from fiction since that time and yet what I have studied from scripture has not contradicted science fact. I will tell you theory is different from fact so don\u2019t quote theory ask fact such as the theory of evolution because you wind up in a mouse trap. Even Darwin through the theory out later in his life when he realized he had made an enormous error so why can\u2019t the idiots today realize what he realized? All matter had to have a beginning from an energy source, as energy can neither be created nor destroyed. What is spirit but an intelligent energy being. Why is it so hard to fathom that we are created by a superbly, magnificent energy being who is a trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Pure Goodness and love. It is much easier to comprehend that then to believe the universe started from nothing at all as that doesn\u2019t make any sense with the laws of physics. Matter can only be created from energy and not vice versa. When destroyed, it reverts to energy and residue or completely back to energy. Think about it. We have spirit in us and a soul in us which keeps us alive, and when we are called home when our time ends in the physical world, that spirit and soul returns to the Creator who made us for judgement of our lives on earth. Did we obey Him or were we out for ourselves? We forget our physical bodies are only one part of us. In the Bible God says Let us make man in OUR IMAGE AND OUR LIKENESS. I have a thought on this. God is the word ELOHIM in this passage which is plural and masculine with a feminine ending. We are Body, soul and spirit, and male and female. Well if God is Triune or a Trinity and has the characteristics of both masculine and feminine as we see both displayed in scripture, this is one way we are like God in His image. I am sure He as even greater meaning than my simple explanation, but just this simple explanation proves a point that we are special beings in the universe to Him and should love and seek Him in His word. I have found in scripture no discrepancy in discussion with real science as long as I have read scripture and that has been over 50 years now. I hope you will highly consider delving into the Bible, but read either King James Version or New KJV, but KJV is the best. And if you can, get one printed around 1950, as it hasn\u2019t been tampered with too much by interpreters who don\u2019t know what they are doing. I wish you good studying and searching for the truth. The Lord says if you seek the truth, it will make you free. If you need any assistance, I\u2019m on Facebook. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a valid question seeing that the western world places immense value on science. However, science by definition is the study of the natural, physical world. Religion, on the other hand, deals primarily in the metaphysical or supernatural nature of things. This distinction is important in that it helps us recognise the limitations of science as it pertains to religious beliefs. Science, while it can lend evidence one way or the other, ultimately cannot make any definitive statements about the existence of God of the validity of certain belief systems. That said, it is my personal opinion that Christianity falls in line nicely with modern science. In fact, I would go as far to say that almost all of modern science can fit into a biblical worldview, seeing as, contest to popular opinion, the processes that modern science studies are not necessarily naturalistic.

I think that Judaism fits the category. The difference between Judaism and other religions is that Judaism starts with the story of the Jewish people and not necessarily with most of the philosophical principals of Judaism, which don\u2019t really have to do with the religion in practice and aren\u2019t agreed by everyone. And disagreements don\u2019t, (or aren\u2019t supposed to) turn communities against each other. So, some Jewish philosophers can explain how Judaism coordinates with science, while other philosophers might start arguing about why dinosaurs didn\u2019t exist. I don\u2019t think that there are many religions like that. ",

In a certain sense (and I insist, ONLY in a certain sense) the most logical and \"scientific\" religion is animism. Effectively all living beings (not just animals) have a \"spirit\" and these are \"interconnected\". It\u2019s quoted because it\u2019s not magical, life is intrinsically related and all living beings depend on others to stay alive, if a species disappears its absence causes damage to the rest of species, which have to adapt if they can or also they will extinguish. The obligation of humans, as rational beings, is to maintain the balance with nature and help it so that balance prevails. Of all religions, animism is the only one that has focused on the natural world, and through observation has reached correct conclusions even though they have been dressed in magic. ",
