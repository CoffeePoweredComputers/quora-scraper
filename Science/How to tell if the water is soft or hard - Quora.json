            "answer_text": "1. Are You Noticing a Lot of Soap Scum? Soap scum is another stain hard water\u2019s notorious for. These come in the form of white spots, usually found in the shower or on your dishes. These stains are the result of water evaporating, leaving calcium residue behind. Yuck! 2. Showers Are No Longer Relaxing Unfortunately, the minerals found in hard water don\u2019t react well with soap. This can make it difficult to get a good lather when you shower. Plus, hard water often leaves limescale on your shower head which reduces water pressure. 3. Are Your Clothes Fading? The magnesium and calcium found in hard water doesn\u2019t react well to laundry detergent, either. Consequently, your clothes will feel harder and colors will begin to fade with every wash because it\u2019s difficult for the washing machine to wash away all the soap. It\u2019s proven that hard water makes your clothes wear out faster and can make towels feel rough. 4. Is Your Family Suffering from Skin Irritation? Hard water can take its toll on sensitive skin. This is because when you clean yourself with hard water, it\u2019s often difficult to wash all the soap away. When this residue is left, it can irritate the skin and cause it to dry out. 5. Are Your Appliances Breaking? This is the most expensive issue. Limescale can cause home appliances to deteriorate rapidly. We\u2019re referring to everything from the kettle to the dishwasher. This buildup also makes your appliance less efficient which means needlessly expensive utility bills.
