            "answer_text": "About 70m assuming that there is no temperature rise. But assuming that there is no temperature rise is a bit daft because the temperature rise is what makes the ice melt. Realistic temperature rises would give another +10m from thermal expansion, giving 80m, but there is no upper limit on thermal expansion until the oceans boil into the atmosphere. BTW it takes several millennia for this to occur even in extreme scenarios because there is an awful lot of ice and some of it is at altitude, particularly in Antarctica. ",

            "answer_text": "The volume of land mass is not that important (and would not vary that much). What matters is the population that lives close to the water level. Because sea transportation has been so important for a long time, many large cities grew near sea level, and these will have to be relocated. ",
