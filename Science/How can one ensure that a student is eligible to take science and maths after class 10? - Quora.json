            "answer_text": "The best person to answer this is solely you. No one else can ensure it. Now comes the question of how to ensure\u2026 Just after clearing your board exam you will have to make a choice which is perhaps the most valuable decision one takes in the early stages of their career. You may have scored 90% in all your subjects. The best analysis to this is to be honest to yourself. If you think your success with a subject is driven more by hard work rather than your talent , then that subject is not for you. You are the best judge. You may be a hard worker who wakes up every morning and solves 20 maths questions. And you score a 100 in your exam. Kudos to you but ask yourself is that your passion !!! Sometimes people get fooled by their own judgements. In our society science has been portrayed as a domination over other fields. But that does not take away the significance of arts or commerce. And especially we require talents in such fields too. Conclusively never judge or take decision based on how much you have scored but on how much effort you had to put to get through. And just as a reminder , 10th is just a pool to the ocean which remains ahead. The syllabus is huge and time is less. Efficiency is the only key to excellence ! And it's hard to achieve excellence in a field which isn't your passion or talent. So go for the one which doesn't make you feel bored , rather you would love to do it. Effort should be Effortless. Hope my answer helps. Good luck ! ",
