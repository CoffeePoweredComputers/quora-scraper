            "answer_text": "\u2018Actual colour\u2019 has no meaning, because colour us a sensation and hence cannot be separated from vision. Maybe you mean frequency? A sodium vapour lamp produces yellow light of almost a fixed frequency (2 close frequencies mainly). However, a yellow object reflects quite a few frequencies around yellow. The eye can also play tricks and what we perceive as colour may be far removed from the pure \u2018textbook\u2019 frequencies. Again, there is no way of knowing what exactly is the sensation in different individuals on being shown the same coloured object. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no colour as such, it depends on what conditions matter is in and what conditions it is exposed with. Just like we see different colours of things with different coloured spects and different colour of matter at different level/state ( like gold os golden in normal state but it\u2019s pink at atomic level. ) For sake of convenience and at normal daily conditions we assign coloures to different matters but remember its not fixed just like every other thing in this world.
