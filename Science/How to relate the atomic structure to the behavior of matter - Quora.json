            "answer_text": "This is a very important factor in the recycling ring of the universe and every molecule has atomic structure that is not at all well researched. We do not even have a good idea why neutrons exist or what they do. We are so proud of what little has been discovered and yet we do not know much we do not know and there is a universal ignorance in our humanity that some times blinds us to even simple truth. We have a lot of unexplored and even unknown truths that can and will be explored in the fullness of time just like ideas we now find clear and obvious were amazing new discoveries to our ancestors. Atomic structure does not evolve and only exists in a proper environment. ",
