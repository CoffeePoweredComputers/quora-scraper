            "answer_text": "Atoms aren\u2019t really empty in the sense you imagine. Most of the mass is in particles that are predominately in the nucleus, while less than a tenth of a percent or so is in the electrons that are predominately outside the nucleus. So in that sense the part outside the nucleus is rather empty. But those electrons are not tiny dots separated by empty space. Rather they behave something like spread-out clouds that resist being squished. So they act kind of like extremely taut balloons and generally keep atoms from overlapping and falling into each other. (In neutron stars, the gravity is so strong it can overwhelm this ability of electrons to repel each other and matter does dramatically collapse in size.) As for visibility, when photons go past a molecule there is a chance that the energy of the photon will be transferred to it, making an electron move to a more energetic state (maybe expanding the space it inhabits), or making the molecule rotate or vibrate, etc. Any such match needs to be rather precise to the wavelength of the photon, otherwise the photon sails right on through and the material is transparent to that color. If there is a match, that color will be absorbed. In general, solid materials have a lot of potential matches, so they tend to absorb a wide variety of photons, making them generally visually opaque. But they tend to not absorb radio waves \u2014 the walls of your house, for example, are transparent to those photons, allowing your cell phone to work indoors. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer to this can't be direct ... So I tried to explain indirectly ..  Things don't fall through other things because they are levitating on an electrostatic field! I am not kidding! When you sit on a chair, you are not really touching it. You see, every atom is surrounded by a shell of electrons. This electron cloud presents a rather negative face to the world. Remember that like charges repel each other. When two atoms approach each other, their electron shells push back at each other, despite the fact that each atom's net charge is 0. This is a very useful feature of nature. It makes our lives a lot easier.Now the question you should be asking is, if atoms push away from each other, why doesn't the entire universe just blow away from itself? The answer is that some, actually most atoms' electron shells are not full. When two atoms come together and have empty spaces in their electron shells, they will share electrons to fill in the spaces in both of their shells. Yes, the electrons really do go back and forth between atoms and they do so pretty fast. Electrons tend to be kind of mobile, which is also a very nice feature of nature, since without it your walkman would not work. Once both atoms' outer shells are full due to this electron sharing, they go back to their usual repulsive behavior. This, by the way, is how we get molecules and the secret to understanding Chemistry. It's all about the electrons! Source : books, internet , common sense ",

Atoms have vast empty space between the neutrons and electrons ( you can compare neutron as a small dot in centre of a football stadium ) .So 99.9\u2105 is actually empty!  But you cant simply neglect the remaining 0.01% mass in an atom! Simply multiply that with a million, do you get my answer?  A human body weighing 154 pounds (70 kilograms) is comprised of 7 billion billion billion atoms, which is a 7 followed by 27 zeros. Multiply 0.01% with 7\u00d710^24 you approximately get the human mass! This was my understanding but there is also another debate,  Despite the vast number of atoms in the human body, we are still surprisingly full of empty space. If all this empty space were squeezed out of the people who make up the human race, our bodies would become so compact that they could be contained in a box the size of a sugar cube. Even more mind-blowing, the stars, planets and everything they contain, including humans, make up only 4 percent of the mass of the known universe. The remainder, scientists believe, is comprised of dark matter and dark energy, which are, as of yet, not well understood. ",

They are just useful. The center of mass of an object can be a point, but you cant have any mass really at any point except in a statistical sense. Atoms are invisible in the common sense of the word, not because they are empty, but because most of their contents are much smaller than the ripples made by visible light. What we can see is the effect on light when thousands of them are bonded together. ",

For a better view you would have to climb a building high enough so that complete drawing could materialize. The dots are the atoms and the man is the body. Similar things happen in our body . Yes the atoms are too small and have nearly 99% free space but yet they make a solid body. That i amm sure is visible. ",

A small change can make everything.99.9 % of an atom is empty but not 100 % right ?In this Universe Everything is nothing and nothing is Everything. ",

As the frequency of vibration increases, we define that region as solid-substantial. In fact, all the basic particles are consist of energy packets (quantum) that come together in different ways at superposition.    If a lower frequency of another vibration is wanting to enter this field, which one of vibration fields would be easier to allow according to you? ",

Most of the mass is in particles that are predominately in the nucleus, while lessthan a tenth of a percent or so is in the electrons that are predominately outside the nucleus. So in that sense the part outside the nucleus is rather empty. ",
