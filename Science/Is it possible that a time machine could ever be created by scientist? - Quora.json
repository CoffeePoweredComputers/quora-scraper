Were it another site those two words would suffice but I don\u2019t want to be Reddit-Riot-style down-voted into oblivion so let me add a little garnish to make the extra click worthwhile, here\u2019s the immediate follow-up Q and A which my mind always yells: \u201cIf someone did surely they would come back and bequeath the device to earlier generations?\u201d >>Fair point, but one need only watch the transcendently entertaining Back to the Future Franchise to note the concept of such a quantum decision inevitably then creating an immediate logical anomaly - change previous events and logically the future would be a different one, from the one which \u201calready occurred\u201d and had culminated in the eventual successful engineering of said time travel device. So the chicken and the egg sit and stare at each other over the debate mediator having both just, honestly, having yelled \u201cI CAME FIRST!\u201d So, do we assume that with the likely eventual invention of such a seemly impossible science future leadership also successfully legislated, and enforced, rules and boundaries regarding where (or perhaps WHEN) time travellers might journey, and managed to curate said restrictions successfully? Given there cannot be a single law in history which hasn\u2019t been violated regularly by multiple criminals one would say that unlikely, which leaves many other possibilities but here are the 3 most satisfactory in allowing me to let my mind wander to other things, like cheese: Once time has occurred and a version of life has occurred it can never be reached and kept untainted from the very second an anachronistic) or perhaps post-anachronistic) intrusion appears. Simply the arrival of an entity would have a Butterfly-Tsunami effect and a new version of reality would exist, but as the past is purely documented through record or recollection it would only be a cognitive entity to those who had already experienced the first version of that human-labelled \u201cdate\u201dTime travel is in fact a concept beyond human-comprehension and no matter the quality of such movie triumphs such as the BTTF and Terminator collections ultimately we will need a more evolved or enlightened conceptual conscious reasoning to become able to genetically birth the thinker capable of inventing the necessary mechanism which can outwit light-speed and human logic.I\u2019m wrong, and the answer is \u201cIndeed, No.\u201d",

We haven't seen any time machines coming to us from the future which undoubtedly we would have. That's as well as the various problems and paradoxes a time machine places on us. For example, a time machine that went back just ten minutes, would find that the earths rotation and movement means you\u2019ve just found yourself underground, in a wall or hundreds of feet up in the air. Or how about you take your time machine back, to the day before you invented time machines, in order to save yourself the trouble of inventing or making one at all - and you gift yourself the time machine. Now nobody made it. Time travel is not possible. ",

But there are many scientist who said time travel is possible and it is well known by special realativity as it is said that time is relative so we can travel to time but we need to travel with speed of light and by today's technology we can't do that. If you are interested in this then you should see michal berne , ran mallett time travel research . So we don't know that if we can make time machine or not but it is said if there is hope then we should try for best. ",

There are every once and then articles in the newspapers saying it is either theoretically impossible to achieve on the one hand or that a certain experiment was able to send a subatomic particle to the future. In all practical sense we shall not see time travel happen in our liftime (unless someone comes back from the future with proofs of his travels, plus an explanation of the science\u2026). ",
