            "answer_text": "A pressure drop is the pressure disparity that exists between points in a liquid carrying network.This occur when flow resistance ensuing in frictional forces acts on the fluid while it is flowing through a tube.The chief identifiers of the resistance include fluid viscosity and fluid velocity in the pipe. Pressure drop elevates the similar way as shear forces inside the piping network. ",
