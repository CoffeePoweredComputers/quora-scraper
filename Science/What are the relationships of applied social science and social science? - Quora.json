            "answer_text": "The question I think being asked here is how does pure science translate into practical application. In physical sciences, chemistry, physics, etc perform experimental research that expands basic knowledge in form of theory which engineering and medicine use for practical application. In Social Sciences, Psychology and Economics dominate the quantitative experimental and pure research of human and market behavior. The ideas, models, theories, measurement procedures, and jargon developed at the University and published in professional journals are adopted by practitioners in Education, Criminal Justice, Social Work, Business Marketing, Political Science, etc. The applications are sometimes quantitative (statistical survey for political polls), but more often the general principles are used for specific problem solving with qualitative analysis. So, for example, modern cognitive psychology theories for aggression and depression help improve applications in law enforcement and social services beyond the old fashioned moral traditions or Freudian principles from the past. The more practitioners understand how people actually think and behave, the better the prediction and chances for improvement. There is also an increasing success with complex data driven statistical analysis in modern applied social sciences within business marketing, advertising, and social services based on modern cognitive psychology model applications. Needless to say, modern economic theory has gone a long way toward allowing the government, through Federal Reserve and other institutions, to flatten the business cycle and reduce recurring recessions compared to boom and bust cycles of the past century. One major difference between hard sciences, which are 100% math dependent, and applied social sciences, which still require human judgement to solve human problems, is that practitioner age and experience is more important in applied social sciences. There are few young geniuses is the social arena because besides ample depth of social theory, practitioners must be deep in individual case study and history in order to be effective. Also, some gain is still made in a purely qualitative way. Historians and sociologists must read large volumes of literature from the archives of libraries before developing the generalized models of understanding about which they write. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cSocial Science\u201d is the entire area of scientific endeavor related to discovering facts (i.e. very strong theories) about humans and other social animals; in this latter connection it is part of a continuum from biology and ethology. As you can see, it is a very broad field that includes ethology, anthropology, sociology, economics, psychology, linguistics, and several other more specialized fields. Any \u201capplied science\u201d researches how the particular science can be used in the real world for beneficial results. Thus, \u201capplied social science\u201d explores how the notions of theorists and the findings of experimentalists in any of the social science fields can be used in the day-to-day world. This is the realm of ethics and the sweet/scary potential of such knowledge. And it is not a \u201cpie in the sky\u201d concern. Marketing, advertising, and the legal system are principal users of this kind of knowledge. Those Russian hackers who influenced the 2016 election? They were using social science principles to sway voters en masse. So, too, the daily advertisers that you hear on radio, and see on TV or the social media. Similar principles are used to make products, services, and values appealing to any who may be influenced, whether it\u2019s by \u201cbig pharma,\u201d a government, or your local church. ",
