            "answer_text": "Thomas Edison is usually credited with the invention of the light bulb, But he wasn't the only one who contributed to the development of light bulb. The story of light bulb begins long before Edison thought of inventing bulb. In 1800 Alessandro Volta and Humphry Davy tried to make earliest manifestation of incandescent lighting. After that in 1840 Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb. But the cost of the batteries used to power those bulb was very high. Then in 1850 Joseph Swan tackled the cost-effectiveness problem of previous inventors and by 1860 he developed a cost efficient light bulb using carbonized paper filaments. Unfortunately the vaccum pumps of those days were not that good so his prototype worked for demonstration but was impractical in actual use. Edison realised the problem with Swan's bulb and made some changes in filaments (made it thin and replaced it with high electrical resistance material) and demonstrated his light bulb in dec 1979. So in invention of light bulb tesla contributed nothing. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Nikola Tesla did not invent the light bulb. Thomas Edison did and has always been credited with it. Tesla did work for Edison for a very short time as an electrical engineer. The big rivalry between Tesla and Edison was over Tesla\u2019s alternating current and Edison\u2019s direct current. Of course, Tesla eventually won the \u201cWar of the Currents\u201d. Guglielmo Marconi had been given credit for the invention of the radio since the early 1900\u2019s, but in 1943, the Supreme Court of the US overturned Marconi\u2019s patent and awarded it to Nikola Tesla. The sad thing was that Tesla had died 6 months earlier. ",
