            "answer_text": "Food Science is the soul whereas Food Technology is the body of Food Processing Industry. The terminologies themselves make it clear, Food Science deals with the Sciences, the principles attached with the Food Processing, to determine various aspects of the Food Processing such as the quality of Food product and also the behaviour of the food item when exposed to certain variables, such as Pressure, Temperature, Moisture, etc . It is necessary for the Quality Analysis and Quality Control of the food products. It helps in developing new products.It helps in increasing the shelf life of the products.It helps in improving the quality of food productsIt enables us to design a food product as per our requirement. whereas Food technology deals with the technological aspects of processing the Food items at a larger scale. It enables us to make the designed product marketable by use of the technology. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe food science will deal with the chemistry part of food. Which will include aroma, flavors, color, chemical composition etc. It will deal with quality of the food. While food technology will be less of the chemistry and more of the technical side. Like production in industry, packaging, management, mechanics and thermodynamic studies of the setups in which the food is to be prepared industrially. In layman\u2019s term. If you are eating a packet of chips, the shape , size, taste, crispiness, freshness , aroma, nutritional value of the chips will be dealt in food science studies. While the size of the packet, the chips:air ratio, quality of the packet, printing, manufacturing of bulk chips, price, labels , force required to tear the packet will be dealt in food technology. Both these subjects are integrative. ",
