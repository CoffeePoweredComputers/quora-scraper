            "answer_text": "Are you asking if we found (intelligent) life on Earth? (Please excuse the humor, lol) A bit more seriously ... If we found life (of any level of development) elsewhere in the universe; it would REVOLUTIONIZE human-kind's thinking. Why? 1) We wouldn't be alone - this would both make us feel a lot less lonely; but also a lot less unique and/or special - helping to put our attitude towards life on Earth in a much better perspective. 2) It would tremendously challenge Earth-based religious belief - how could some god(s) create Earth-life, especially in regards us humans) in \"his\" own image - if he/she/they/it had created life in other places too? 3) It would be a HUGE spur to scientific investigation - I do not believe that huans have ever gone into space far enough to make it thru the Van Allen Radiation Belts (we haven't been using all-lead covered ships, yet!) But we'd sure aim telescopes at them; and much sooner than is planned now; send space probes their way. AND IF THE EXTRA-TERRESTIAL LIFE WAS INTELLIGENT? Then ALL three of the above would come even more into play. P.S. I don't believe that alien intelligent life would ever be war-like towards us. Why? Because to travel to here from there, they'd have to be light-years ahead of us technologically. In such a case, anything they might think that they needed to take from us; they could find on other planets; planets without intelligent life. They'd be advanced enough to not want to harm other intelligences; especially because there is always the risk that the intelligences could put a hurt on them. Meanwhile, there'd be a universe, or at least our galaxy full of planets just waiting for them to make use of. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot would depend on the circumstance of the encounter. Particularly on their proximity to the earth i.e are they in some distant star system communicating with us via radio waves or laser flashes, or have they just landed on the white house lawn, climbed out of their space craft and requested an audience with the president? If the latter was the case then the world would be on high alert and the question of which of our two species had the upper hand militarily (probably them) would be the most pressing one. If they had technology that was clearly far in advance of ours as would likely be the case then I think the human race would view that state of affairs with great anxiety. After all how have we humans acted almost every time we encounter another tribe of humans that is less technologically advanced? Usually not well. The less advanced tribe generally comes off a lot worse from the interaction. Regardless of the aliens intentions we would probably react towards them with suspicion, suspecting them of wishing to enslave, exploit or damage us in some way simply because that is how he would probably behave towards them if the roles were reversed.

World leaders would most likely have a massive debate about how to deal with it. Cults would probably be formed. Current religious groups would have heart attacks. Information exchange. Or, one of us decide that all of that isn\u2019t necessary due to the lack of mutual benefits and declares war. Most likely us (we\u2019re not really good at trusting). ",
