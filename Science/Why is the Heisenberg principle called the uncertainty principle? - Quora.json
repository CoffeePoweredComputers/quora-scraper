            "answer_text": "Because that's its most startling conclusion: that there is a limit to how much we can find out about a system. Experiments consistently suggest that a particle cannot be pin-pointed, at sub-atomic scales, in 6-dimensional phase-space (x,y,z,\u1e8b,\u1e8f,\u017c) because it does not have a specific location in that space. Any attempt to plot a particle's position in such a phase-space, results in its position being a blurred one. Unfortunately, all our current methods for solving the equations of motion, from Newton, Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi, have, at their roots, the concept of this phase-space, so our ability to use these to work out the movements of particles at the sub-atomic scale is somewhat hampered (in effect, any attempt at using dead-reckoning to predict a particle's future position is doomed to failure, one way or the other). Specifically, the HUP says (and Bell's Inequality confirms) that if you can find out very accurately where a particle is in the x-direction, the less you can find out about its velocity in that direction, \u1e8b (and vice versa, and similarly for y and \u1e8f, and similarly for z and \u017c). (The HUP actually talks about momentum, but this mass times velocity in each of those dimension.) Curiously, it is not the only uncertainty principle in town. In effect, Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem does the same for deductive logic in mathematics as HUP does for quantum particles in physics. Then Turing's Halting Problem does the same for computability on computers *of* *any* *type*. Even for theories in philosophy, Berkeley notes that they cannot be both constant and consistent, and that they cannot be both completely informative and completely certain. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s because it prescribes limits on what we can know about the state of a particle. A particle\u2019s state (or a state in general) consists of those things that can change with time; things like position, momentum, spin state and so on. With \u201cnormal\u201d sized objects we imagine that we can measure different aspects of the state of the object simultaneously as finely as we want to. But quantum mechanics says that there are \u201cincompatible\u201d properties which we cannot measure simultaneously to any desired degree of accuracy. A good example, simplifying the technical language and concepts a bit, is that we can\u2019t measure both a particle\u2019s position and speed at the same time with arbitrary precision. We find that measurements of position mess up measurements of speed, and vice-versa. So we cannot be \u201ccertain\u201d about a particle\u2019s position and speed at the same time. ",
