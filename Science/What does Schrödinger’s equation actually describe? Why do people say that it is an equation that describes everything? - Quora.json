            "answer_text": "Schrodinger\u2019s Equation tells you how to calculate the properties of any particle at the atomic level, for example, an electron or a photon. Particles at this level of size have a limited number of properties. They include position, momentum, a quantum property called \u201cspin,\u201d and a few others. Physicists answer in different ways the question of what in physical reality the equation describes. There is no consensus yet.  The main answers are: \u201cnothing in physical reality, only a trick for calculating what we will detect when measuring a particle\u201d (Copenhagen interpretation) ;\u201ca physical wave on which a particle is being carried along\u201d (Bohmian interpretation); and \u201cseparate waves in innumerable separate physical universes\u201d (Many Worlds interpretation). There is no consensus yet.  The equation can be used to calculate the properties at a moment in time and, in another version of the equation (the time-dependent version), how the properties change over time.  Schrodinger\u2019s Equation is the key equation of quantum physics. It\u2019s a parallel to Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion in classical physics but it is not deterministic in the same way Newton\u2019s Laws are. In classical physics, if you know the position and momentum of an object, you can use Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion to calculate the future position and momentum of the object. Given knowledge of the exact initial position and momentum and the measurements of all the forces acting on the object, Newton\u2019s laws are deterministic \u2013 they tell you how the forces will interact and so, where the object is going to be at a next point in time.   Schrodinger\u2019s Equation will not tell you the position (or other properties) of an individual subatomic particle at a future point in time. It will tell you only its possible positions and the probabilities of its being in each of those possible positions. For example, if you used a laser to shoot a lot of photons towards a photographic plate, Schrodinger\u2019s Equation could be used to calculate the overall pattern of pixels that would form on the plate, but not the position of which pixel any particular photon will light up. So, Schrodinger\u2019s Equation is deterministic but at the statistical level rather at the individual particle level. Another difference with a classical physics equation is that Schrodinger\u2019s Equation is open to considerable interpretation as to the nature of the physical reality that it describes. Physicists differ considerably on this issue.  The \u201corthodox\u201d Copenhagen Interpretation was the consensus physics view from the 1930\u2019s to, maybe, 2000. It holds that the equation is a mathematical statement only. It does not represent anything in physical reality because, according to this interpretation, particles DO NOT EXIST until they are measured (that is, detected). In other words, when the photon is emitted from the laser, in the example above, Schrodinger\u2019s Equation appears to describe it as a wave progressing towards the photographic plate. The problem is that the numbers in the equation actually calculate all possible waves that could characterize the photon (called a \u201csuperposition\u201d of waves), not a particular wave. This is the source of the lack of ability of the equation to tell you the exact position where the particle will be detected on the photographic plate.  But when the photon is detected on the photographic plate, it lands on one specific spot\u2014you can see that bit of the plate has been exposed to light. So, it\u2019s not that the particle travels as a wave and lands as a particle. It\u2019s that the particle has no physical reality of any kind, it\u2019s not part of the physical universe, until it lands as a particle and exposes a spot on the photographic plate. Schrodinger\u2019s Equation, in this interpretation, is a trick for calculating where the particle will land, and that\u2019s it.  In fact, this interpretation devolved in the 1950\u2019s into what is sometimes called the \u201cShut up and calculate,\u201d interpretation. In other words, don\u2019t ask what in physical reality the equation is describing.  Nevertheless, without understanding what the equation really describes in physical reality, physicists have been hugely successful using Schrodinger\u2019s Equation in their calculations. The electronics that we use today\u2014computers, lasers, MRI machines\u2026--depend on calculations using the equation (plus a lot of other math and measurements). So, \u201cShut up and calculate\u201d has worked very well for us technologically.    There are other interpretations of the equation which hold that it refers to things in the physical universe. Briefly, here\u2019s the Bohmian interpretation developed by David Bohm in the middle of the 20th Century: there\u2019s always a wave and always a particle. The particle is guided in its motion towards a particular location like a surfer on a wave. An earlier version of this interpretation was called De Broglie\u2019s \u201cPilot Wave\u201d interpretation.  The Many Worlds interpretation, which is held by a growing minority of physicists is as follows: Every wave in the superposition of waves that the equation gives occurs in some universe. There are new universes forming all the time and the reason that the equation tells you about all possible waves that the particle could be traveling on is that each wave happens in a different universe. The particle DOES land in all possible positions, each in a different universe. This gives physical reality to the equation but at the cost of requiring we believe that there are innumerable universes.  There are other interpretations as well.  I\u2019ve been focusing on position as one property that the equation can describe, but it can be used to describe all the other properties of atomic-level particles.  ",

            "answer_text": "When I took undergraduate quantum mechanics, I was told that Schroedinger's equation was the central tenet of quantum physics, whose form could not be derived from classical physics, and was the cause of all the quantum weirdness in the theory. I now think that's totally wrong, and let me tell you why. What Schroedinger's equation really is is this. We have a system described by a collection of degrees of freedom, or state, [math]|\\psi_0 \\rangle[/math], sometimes incorrectly called the wave function (the wavefunction is the set of amplitudes of this state on to eigenstates of some operator [math]X[/math], [math]\\langle x |\\psi_0\\rangle[/math]). This is the state of our system at some time [math]t = t_0[/math]. Like always, we want to know the state of our system at some later time [math]t \\ne t_0[/math], a state we'll call [math]|\\psi(t)\\rangle[/math]. Since [math]|\\psi_0\\rangle[/math] contains all the degrees of freedom of our system, we know that [math]|\\psi(t)\\rangle[/math] must live in the same space as [math]|\\psi_0\\rangle[/math], and just represent a different set of values for those degrees of freedom. If you think of [math]|\\psi_0\\rangle[/math] as a vector, then [math]|\\psi(t)\\rangle[/math] must be a vector in that same space, just pointing somewhere else. What this means is we can assign an operator [math]U(t)[/math], which is just a mapping of the old values for the degrees of freedom to the new ones, that takes us from [math]|\\psi_0\\rangle[/math] to [math]|\\psi(t)\\rangle[/math]: [math]|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t) |\\psi_0\\rangle[/math]. Here again, if we think of [math]|\\psi_0\\rangle[/math] and the like as vectors, [math]U(t)[/math] is just a square matrix. But we want to know more about what [math]U(t)[/math] is for particular systems. To figure this out, we employ a common trick of physicists (and anyone else who loves calculus), and think of the infinitesimal case, when the two times are very close to being the same, and only separated by some infinitesimal amount [math]dt[/math]: [math]|\\psi(t_0 + dt)\\rangle = U(dt) |\\psi_0\\rangle[/math]. Why do this? Now we can expand [math]U(dt)[/math] in a Taylor Series in [math]dt[/math], which is a calculus trick that says when the argument is small, any smooth function looks just like a polynomial: [math]U(dt) = 1+Jdt + Kdt^2 + Ldt^3 + ...[/math]* Now, if [math]dt[/math] is really small, then [math]dt^2[/math] is even smaller, and so on; for any values of the operators [math]K \\text{ and }L[/math], etc, we can pick a [math]dt[/math] small enough that the only (not totally inane) term that matters is [math]Jdt[/math]. So, we write [math]\\lim_{dt \\rightarrow 0}|\\psi(t_0 + dt)\\rangle = \\left(1 + J dt\\right) |\\psi_0\\rangle[/math], or, rearranging, [math]\\lim_{dt \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{|\\psi(t_0 + dt)\\rangle - |\\psi(t_0)\\rangle}{dt} =J|\\psi_0\\rangle[/math]. The LHS is just the derivative[math]\\frac{d |\\psi\\rangle}{dt}[/math] evaluated at [math]t = t_0[/math], and so we\u2019ve successfully turned our statement about time evolution into a differential equation. To go further we have to insert some (classical) physics. The super brilliant Emmy Noether taught us that time translation invariance corresponds to energy conservation, and by extension, time translation invariance (like going from [math]t[/math] to [math]t + dt[/math]) related to the conservation of the energy function known as the Hamiltonian [math]H[/math]. More generally, any changes to the state of the system with time (the meaning of the left hand side of the above equation) is governed by the energy of the system at that time. This means the right hand side of the equation, through our operator [math]J[/math], must be some multiple of the energy operator [math]H[/math]: [math]J \\propto H[/math]. Since the LHS is an anti-Hermitian operator and has imaginary eigenvalues (a technical point pertaining to operators on vector spaces that isn't too hard to show[1] ) and the energy operator (which corresponds to an observable) must have real (and therefore observable) eigenvalues, this proportionality constant must be imaginary; and since the units have to match up, this number must have units of [math]\\frac{1}{\\text{Joules} \\times \\text{seconds}}[/math]. Let's call it [math]\\frac{-i}{\\hbar}[/math] (the negative is from the choice as to which root of [math]-1[/math] we take [math]i[/math] to be). Then we have (moving the proportionality constant over to the other side), [math] i \\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} |\\psi\\rangle = H |\\psi \\rangle[/math], which is Schroedinger's equation, and is the only equation I could have written down (if classical mechanics is to result from a limit of the theory), modulo the value of the constant [math]\\hbar[/math], which is really just a conversion factor from Hertz to Joules. Since it's the only equation I could have written down, I'm of the opinion the (quantum) physical content of this equation is basically nothing; quantum mechanics follows directly from what Heisenberg called matrix mechanics (linear algebra), plus two laws that have physical content: Planck's Law: [math]p = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} k[/math], which relates the wavenumber (Fourier conjugate of position) with momentum, and Born's Rule, which tells you how to interpret the wavefunction (set of projection amplitudes) [math]\\langle x |\\psi_0\\rangle[/math] in terms of observations of the observable associated with [math]X[/math]. *Note that I took the first term of the Taylor series to be one (really, the identity operator in the space in which [math] |\\psi \\rangle [/math] lives, the operator which does nothing). That's not generally true of Taylor series, but it is in this case, because we know that for [math]dt = 0 [/math] we should get [math] U(dt)|\\psi \\rangle = |\\psi \\rangle [/math]; that is, to zeroth order in time, [math] U(t) [/math] should do nothing.
