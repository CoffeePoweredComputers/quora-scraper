            "answer_text": "What Is Loan Against Property?  Loan against property is a type of secured loan. Availing loans by pledging your property as a security or collateral with a lender is called mortgaging or loan against property. Loans against property are a viable option, especially when the property rates are appreciating. The rate of interest on loan against property is low as they are secured loans. With loans against property, you get funds with not having to sell a property. Your property documents would be handed over to you on repaying the loan in full. You are allowed to pledge residential properties, commercial properties and even a piece of land to avail loans against property. The main advantage of availing loans against property is that the funds received can be utilized for any purpose; there are no restrictions as such like in home loans where the funds can be utilized only on housing related activities. This factor coupled with low interest rates; results in loan against property being a preferred option over personal loans. Loan Amount The first question that would arise when applying for a loan is \u2018what is the amount that I would receive as loan?\u2019 Generally, lenders offer up to 60% of the property\u2019s market value as a loan against property. This percentage is referred to as the loan to value ratio, LTV. The maximum tenure for repayment of LAP is 10 years. The rate of interest offered on LAP would be higher than that of home loans but lower than that of personal loans. The repayment tenure of 10 years offered on LAPs is much longer than the tenure offered on personal loans which is likely to be up to 5 years. The combination of low interest rate and long repayment tenure results in low EMI payable and hence makes LAPs a more attractive option than a personal loan. The funds received as LAP can be used for short term financial requirements like a marriage, tuition fees, hospital expenses, expansion of business, going on a vacation and so on. Few lenders offer LAPs for up to 15 years which makes it even more comfortable for the customer to repay as EMIs would be low. Loan against property are issued to both salaried and self employed applicants.

            "answer_text": "A Loan Against Property (LAP) is a product that is designed keeping in mind the property as a backup. Your property can be a deal breaker as well as deal maker in your loan application. Primarily loans against properties are provided on Residential property \u2013 plot or built up, Commercial property \u2013 like office, shop, hotel, hospital, education institution etc., Industrial property \u2013 plot or built up and Warehouses. The different types of properties, on the basis of planning, on which loans are provided are: (1) Registered properties with Map \u2013 A registered property with proper maps and clear sanction plan by town planning authority is one of the best mortgages considered in banking industry. Virtually all banks and NBFCs provide loans for this kind of profile. These properties are considered to be a best bet as there is a clear and legal title of the property along with the sanction plan provided by town planning authority. (2) Registered properties without map \u2013 A second kind of property is a property that is registered properties without maps. In these kinds of properties banks usually look for risk mitigation factors like proper sale deed and ATS. These properties have an inherent risk of no clear plan by town planning authorities. If you want to get a loan for these properties then, you should provide additional comfort to bank in form of additional income or co-applicant. (3) GPA \u2013 GPA stands for general power of Attorney. It is a legal instrument that grants authority to one person to act on behalf of another person. This instrument doesn\u2019t give any ownership on immovable property to a person being granted the authority. Banks and NBFC don\u2019t provide a loan as GPA holder doesn\u2019t have any legal ownership over the GPA property. In this case, you have to rely on certain Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) that lend to GPA holder. Other option could also include external financiers, but they would charge exorbitant rate of interest. (4) Lal Dora land \u2013 Lal Dora villages are integral part of Delhi property landscape. There are in total 360 villages in Delhi under Lal Dora. Lal Dora areas are that part of village that is left for livestock and residential purposes. Usually, no banks or NBFCs provide loan for these properties. Traditional loan lenders like banks would not usually provide loans on such properties. But new age lenders like P2P platforms can help to fulfil your dream of getting a loan on your Lal Dora land. (5) Agricultural land \u2013 Agricultural land are specifically put under agricultural purposes only. You cannot get a loan for your agricultural land. They are under several restrictions and cannot be easily converted into non-agricultural land, hence loans are difficult to get. Adding to above points, banks usually don\u2019t lend to a property that is above 3rd floor and an empty plot. Banks also look for properties which are self occupied like HDFC Loan Against Property. These are the properties, on the basis of use, against which loans can be given: Self-owned residential property Self-owned and self-occupied residential property Self-owned but rented residential property Self-owned piece of land Self-owned commercial property Self-owned but rented commercial property There is another form of secured mortgage loan that is allowed where a residential property is used as collateral but gets transferred to the lender only after the death of the borrower. Here the possibility of the lender gaining the property is absolute, it is a certainty. This is known as reverse mortgage. ",
