            "answer_text": "No. Paradoxically (or maybe not) the gravitational gradient is MUCH lower in a big bh. In a stellar bh you would be ripped apart by tidal forces 1000 km before you hit the event horizon, whereas in a SMBH you won\u2019t even notice when you pass the event horizon. This means that a small bh close to a big bh will be largely unaffected (of course they will orbit each other and give off gravitational waves/energy and soon merge) ",
