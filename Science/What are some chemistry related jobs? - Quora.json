            "answer_text": "A master distiller at any liquor distillery; a teacher/professor; and on a more inventive side of things, a chemist could create a new polymer of plastic that is cheaper/stronger for a manufacturing company, create a new form of fuel for cars to run on, and finally work on the medical side of things to develop drugs that will interact with specific receptors in the brain or body. There is a high demand for chemists in the medical field right now, especially as we learn more about the mechanisms underlying the brain and neurodegenerative diseases. ",

            "answer_text": "Pharmacist- A respectable job, really. There are different kinds of pharmacist, depending on one\u2019s working area. One could be a pharmacist in the hospital, which administer drugs while those working in a mall practically owns the store and promotes them. Petroleum Engineer- Depends on which country you wish to work in. I highly suggest oil-rich countries like Malaysia or Dubai which provide better job opportunities in this field. You will get a chance to visit an oil rig, which is pretty amazing (unless an explosion occurs, which is highly unlikely). These are the two careers involving pharmacy which I would suggest. Other jobs such as a real chemist, which I don\u2019t encourage as it involves lots of chemicals which in the long run, detrimental to one\u2019s health. Unless of course, you are highly passionate in chemistry and wish to contribute to the world of science, then go for it! ",
