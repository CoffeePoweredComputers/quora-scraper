            "answer_text": "It is fairly easy to guess the answer if you look at the Lorentz force [math]F = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v}\\times \\vec{B})[/math] Where q is the charge of the electron, [math]\\vec{v}[/math] is the velocity of the electron, [math]\\vec{E}[/math] is the electric field and [math]\\vec{B}[/math] is the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field is antiparallel to the velocity of the electron, so the second term will not contribute to the Lorentz Force. So the contribution to the Lorentz will come from the first term. If the electric field is zero then the Lorentz force is zero. But, if the electric field is not zero then the direction of the Lorentz force will be same as that of the electric field (the present case). Remember the magnetic force can\u2019 t accelerate the electron but can change the direction of the electron. As the direction of the magnetic field is antiparallel to the motion of the electron, the electron will continue to travel with constant velocity without altering its path. ",

            "answer_text": " As the direction of electron ( -e ) is towards North,so the direction of the current ( I ) is towards South. So the direction of the Magnetic field ( B' ) due to the electron or current is towards East ( by the right hand rule). And the another magnetic field ( B \u201c ) is towards South direction. So the resultant magnetic field ( B ) is in East-South direction. ",
