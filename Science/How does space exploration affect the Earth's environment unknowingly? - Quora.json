            "answer_text": "There is a relatively minor carbon footprint when NASA or their contractors uses hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene or methane in their launch vehicles. The Shuttles and other heavy lift vehicles used liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen which only produces water as a combustion product. However, much of the hydrogen is made from methane, so there is a carbon footprint. The solid boosters used on Shuttle, Atlas. and the heavy lift vehicles use hydrocarbon fuel with ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, so they not only have a carbon foot print, but also put chlorine into the stratosphere where it destroys the protective ozone layer. However, all of the effects are so small compared to the carbon produced by automobile, trucks, and coal fired power plants, that their effect is imperceptible. ",
