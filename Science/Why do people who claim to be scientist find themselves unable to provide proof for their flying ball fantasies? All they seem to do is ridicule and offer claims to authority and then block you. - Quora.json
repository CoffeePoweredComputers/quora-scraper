            "answer_text": "There is no proof when you simply choose to reject all of reality. No one can prove anything to you when your only argument is that what they are saying is not true. Your denying that something is true does not make it untrue, except in your own mind. Arguing with you and trying to convince you that what you choose to believe is not fact, is futile, it is a waste of time and effort. It is understandable that once a person realizes that they are arguing with someone who rejects reality they will give up and stop wasting their time. ",
