            "answer_text": "Imagine a big plane sheet of rubber, stretched out, and then you drop a steel ball in its centre. As expected, the rubber sheet will vibrate. This vibration, kind of a ripple, is like a wave moving outwards from the centre of disturbance (the point where the ball was dropped). You can easily see and feel such mechanical vibrations. The above cliched example is used to explain the space-time fabric, which can get disturbed when a huge mass (or masses) move through that fabric. To understand this better, you need to know that gravity is caused by curvature of space-time by presence of mass. So a heavy mass will curve more space around it, and any object within that space-range will automatically fall towards that mass because \"space\" will be \"bent\". But now imagine a massive object moving fast in space. Just like our rubber  sheet, the space will be \"disturbed\" and ripples will move out spreading away from the source of disturbance.  These ripples in space-time were first postulated by Einstein as Gravitational Waves.  Because these waves are ripples in space-time fabric, it means as they move along they will compress/expand space. These waves travel with the speed of light but are hard to detect because gravitational wave interacts do not interact with matter like other waves. An object in the path of such a wave will change its length (as length is a dimension in space) but such a change might be as big as the width of a proton, making observations too hard to detect. Another example: \"..a supernova explosion in our own galaxy would emit pretty strong gravitational radiation, yet a 1 km ring would deform no more than a one thousandth the size of an atomic nucleus.\" Now to detect such extremely minute change in dimensions, scientists uses interference of laser waves to find out if anything changed due to interaction with a gravitational wave. Two waves can be made to interfere normally to give a pattern of alternate dark and fright fringes. But if the space between the waves fluctuates, then the resulting interference pattern would be \"different from normal\". What LIGO, Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory, did was to use an extremely sensitive apparatus using lasers, and notice the differences in interference of the laser waves. From ScienceMag: \"LIGO watches for a minuscule stretching of space with what amounts to ultraprecise rulers: two L-shaped contraptions called interferometers with arms 4 kilometers long. Mirrors at the ends of each arm form a long \u201cresonant cavity,\u201d in which laser light of a precise wavelength bounces back and forth, resonating just as sound of a specific pitch rings in an organ pipe. Where the arms meet, the two beams can overlap. If they have traveled different distances along the arms, their waves will wind up out of step and interfere with each other. That will cause some of the light to warble out through an exit called a dark port in synchrony with undulations of the wave. From the interference, researchers can compare the relative lengths of the two arms to within 1/10,000 the width of a proton\u2014enough sensitivity to see a passing gravitational wave as it stretches the arms by different amounts. To spot such tiny displacements, however, scientists must damp out vibrations such as the rumble of seismic waves, the thrum of traffic, and the crashing of waves on distant coastlines.\" With the success of LIGO, scientists are excited for LISA pathfinder, a precursor to eLISA, to be launched in 2034.

            "answer_text": "The LIGO ( Laser Interferometry Gravitational-Wave Observatory ) is the best detector of gravitational waves our scientists (Kip Thorne and others) have developed. Gravitational waves causes contraction and expansion of space and this change in spatial dimension is what measured in the observatory. Imagine a buoy floating in the ocean. When a disturbance pass by, the buoy goes up and down on the surface of the water. Gravitational waves are similar, except that the disturbance is of space-time. This mean, all dimension of space should contract, expand, contract, expand periodically. Such variations are extremely small, orders in magnitude smaller than a proton. The detectors are LIGO are capable of detecting changes in length of about 10E-18 mtrs, which should provide us satisfactory results. So, how does it work?  Image from Einstein's gravitational waves found at last - article from Nature Publishing Group : science journals, jobs, and information It's an L shaped tube with mirrors at the two end stations. Each length of the tube is approx 4 km long. A laser light is shot towards the mirrors at both ends. A detector is situated at the corner station to capture the reflected beam. The pattern of laser light which is received is recorded continuously. When a gravitational wave passes through, one arm of the tube is elongated, and the perpendicular arm will be compressed. The elongation/compression of the arm will shift the mirror slightly, which is reflected in the patterns recorded by the detectors. The detector is so sensitive, that traffic at a distance of 10 km can also affect the pattern which is recorded by the detector. Thus, two such instruments are kept at two ends of the United States - one at Hanford nuclear complex in Washington and the other in Louisiana - 3000 miles away. If a pattern recorded in one place exactly matches the other, then it can be confirmed that the variation is due to disturbance of space-time by a gravitational wave.  Gravitational Wave signals recorded by the twin LIGO stations at Hanford and Luisiania. Image from Einstein's gravitational waves found at last - article from Nature Publishing Group : science journals, jobs, and information The idea is simple, pretty much analogous to a floating buoy. The sensitivity and precision required to execute is perhaps the pinnacle of advanced technology in recent times. The discovery of gravitational waves by the LIGO team on 11th Feb 2016 marks a major achievement in our endeavour to understand our reality. It may turn out we're not that very different from a simple buoy in an infinitely vast ocean!  EDIT:  The incredible achievement of LIGO detector is it's successful isolation of the waves from seismic waves. It uses an active and passive damper to isolate all terrestrial signals. The answer to this demanded a more detailed description, thus I've answered it here: Alok Bharadwaj's answer to How were the LIGO detectors designed to be completely isolated from terrestrial vibration sources?
