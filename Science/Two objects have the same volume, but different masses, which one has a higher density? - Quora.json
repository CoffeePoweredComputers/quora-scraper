            "answer_text": "If the two objects have the same volume but different masses, the one with has a greater mass will have a higher density. For example each liter of gasoline and water don\u2019t have the same masses. The mass of water is 1.00 kg per liter while the mass of gasoline is 0.66 kg per liter. The density of water is higher than the density of gasoline. ",

            "answer_text": "One with the heavier mass, as both occupy the same volume, more amount of mass has to be present in unit volume to accommodate for the extra weight. Hence the object with higher mass has a higher density Denisty = (mass/volume) i.e Density is Directly proportional to mass of the object ",
