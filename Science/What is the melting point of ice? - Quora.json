            "answer_text": "0*C Water freezes and melts at 0 centigrade. It just depends on whether, at the 0 point, you are giving it energy, or taking it away. The energy you need to melt (or fuse) the 0 degree ice is 79 calories per gram of water. This is known as the 'latent heat of fusion' Similarly, you can have 0*C water and it can be liquid. To convert water into ice, take away those 79 calories to change the state. To give you some context, the energy necessary to raise one gram of water 1*C is one calorie. To lower, just minus that energy. Now you might be wondering what all this energy is, and the energy I'm mainly talking about is heat - and heat is measured in energy terms, ie calories or joules. Temperature (different thing, describes amount of collisions of molecules per second, in other words how hot it is) is measured in degrees. Example - an iron sphere the size of a basketball at, say, a warm 35 degrees, would contain infinitesimally more heat energy than a 1g iron nail at 1000 degrees. The nail is at a higher temperature - but the iron basketball, weighing maybe 15 kilos has so much more thermal mass, to harbour more heat. In fact, even an iron tennis ball would contain more heat than the same nail. Think about this - put a white hot (1500*+) nail in some lukewarm water, along with a very hot 300 degree iron tennis ball. Which will bubble and boil longer? Which one would cause you more damage to touch? The ball. The nail would dump its small energy volume and cool. (It would just melt a small bit of your skin and then get over it. It'd hurt - and give you short term damage - but not nearly as much as the sphere) The ball, all 1 kilo of it, would bubble, and lose its heat quickly, boiling the water. But because there is so much iron at a lower temperature, it has more heat than the small amount of solid sun nail. (And it would give you massive skin burns, could even kill you with long term exposure.) So to raise the temperature of 1g of water one degree, you need to give it one calorie. You're a piece of ice(1g) at -5*C. You're given 5 calories and heat up to 0*C. That 0*C ice is given 79 calories, and it doesn't change temperature but goes liquid. All this could happen on a hot plate, or even in open air, very quickly. Hope the answer helped!
