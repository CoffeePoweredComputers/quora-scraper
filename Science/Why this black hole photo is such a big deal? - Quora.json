            "answer_text": "A Big deal? Huh. It is an achievement to be celebrated. You ask why? I\u2019ll give you a brief idea.  It has almost a century since Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity being published. It predicted that the force of gravity arises from the curvature of space and time, a conception which many didn\u2019t even dare to think of. Scientists have diligently tried to verify his thesis for many years. Because not all theoretical predictions turn out to be of any physical significance. When the scientists fumbled on to the concept of the black hole, there was some potential in it. Now coming back to your question, this image came out to prove the fact that gravity, space and time are intertwined. This is a rare feat for science. Now you may say, \u201cBut I have already seen many black hole pictures on the internet. The clarity of the black hole in the interstellar movie was great, and comparing this picture it looks like a doughnut taken in a phone from the \u201980s.\u201d Now I see a logic in your question, you have already seen photos like these I suppose   Actually, all these images are created by artists. The movement of the celestial objects around the black hole and the effects of the gravity of the black hole on surrounding debris made the artists to draw a convincing image. And the graphically engineered black hole in the interstellar movie was near perfection.  But still is it such a big deal? Obviously, the science community is exuberant. But not all people celebrate science. True, not all people celebrate science but I think if science is hard to get to you, then the numbers will probably help you get the gravity of the situation. This wasn\u2019t just a normal click of something lying around you. This black hole is 250,614,750,218,665,392 kilometers away from Earth \u2013 that's the equivalent of traveling from London to New York 45 trillion times. It is like trying to take a picture of an orange on the surface of the moon. And the black region in the picture corresponds almost to the diameter of the black hole. The real diameter of the black hole is nearly 120 million kilometers( million is 10 with 5 trailing zeroes). That is the magnanimity of this picture.  Moreover to take a picture which is at such a distance we need a telescope as big as Earth itself. But scientists managed to get 8 telescopes around the globe to work in unison. They were calibrated with the precision of an atomic clock( It loses one second per hundred million years). Now the next obstacle was to get a picture beyond the cosmic bodies and the cosmic dust in between. The final obstacle was to produce an image after analyzing nearly 5000 terabytes of data collected. Truly it is a feat to be celebrated! This also means that we might finally be close to the fact of cracking the question \u201c What is gravity?\u201d. First gravitational waves, now an image of the black hole, these things corroborates the fact itself. ",

            "answer_text": "AS we did What is a black hole? A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escapeDespite the name, they are not empty but instead consist of a huge amount of matter packed densely into a small area, giving it an immense gravitational pullThere is a region of space beyond the black hole called the event horizon. This is a \"point of no return\", beyond which it is impossible to escape the gravitational effects of the black holeProf Falcke had the idea for the project when he was a Ph.D. student in 1993. At the time, no-one thought it was possible. But he was the first to realize that a certain type of radio emission would be generated close to and all around the black hole, which would be powerful enough to be detected by telescopes on Earth. He also recalled reading a scientific paper from 1973 that suggested that because of their enormous gravity, black holes appear 2.5 times larger than they actually are. These two factors suddenly made the seemingly impossible, possible. After arguing his case for 20 years, Prof Falcke persuaded the European Research Council to fund the project. The National Science Foundation and agencies in East Asia then joined in to bankroll the project to the tune of more than \u00a340m Each is located high up at a variety of exotic sites, including on volcanoes in Hawaii and Mexico, mountains in Arizona and the Spanish Sierra Nevada, in the Atacama Desert of Chile, and in Antarctica. A team of 200 scientists pointed the networked telescopes towards M87 and scanned its heart over a period of 10 days. The information they gathered was too much to be sent across the internet. Instead, the data was stored on hundreds of hard drives that were flown to central processing centres in Boston, US, and Bonn, Germany, to assemble the information. Katie Bouman a Ph.D. student at MIT developed an algorithm that pieced together the data from the EHT. Without her contribution, the project would not have been possible. Prof Doeleman described the achievement as \"an extraordinary scientific feat\". \"We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago,\" he said. \"Breakthroughs in technology, connections between the world's best radio observatories, and innovative algorithms all came together to open an entirely new window on black holes.\" The team is also imaging the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Odd though it may sound, that is harder than getting an image from a distant galaxy 55 million light-years away. This because, for some unknown reason, the \"ring of fire\" around the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way is smaller and dimmer as wor as been done for 2012 to April so as this s a conflict for 2 decades we solved it ",
