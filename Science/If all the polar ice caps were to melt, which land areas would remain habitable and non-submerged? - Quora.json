            "answer_text": "Two different questions. Melting polar ice would mean sea levels will rise upwards of 25 meters higher than present, but there will still be big parts of the earth that are above the new sea level. That doesn\u2019t mean that any of the earth will be \u2018habitable\u2019 at least for humans. melting of the icecaps would cause the release of hundreds of gigatons of methane currently kept in place by the polar ice-caps. Methane is a far more effective greenhouse gas than mere c02, and best guess of organizations like the Arctic Methane Emergency Group is that temperatures could go up to 10 C above baseline. That\u2019s a temperature too high for most food grains to propagate, and ocean temperatures would be high enough to wipe out the phytoplankton, which supplies half our planet\u2019s oxygen. When Habitat packs it in ",
