            "answer_text": "The Short Answer You can\u2019t stop your skin from aging However, you can protect your skin and help it look as youthful as possible.Main causes of skin aging is smoking and sunlightHere are six tips to help you to protect your skin from aging. 1. Moisturize your skin Never hop out of the shower and into your clothes without moisturizing your skin. Use a skin moisturizer, good body oil, or thick body cream to seal in moisture, soothe the skin, and prevent dryness. When shopping for skin moisturizers, look for skin moisturizer and face oil contain like rosehip oil, jojoba oil, camellia oil, vegetable glycerin, or hyaluronic acid. These ingredients moisturize and nourish skin, to help skin looks and feels its best. Get a moisturizer for your face based on your skin type. You can also add a good face oil to your moisturizer for optimal effect. 2. Protect your skin Excessive exposure to sunlight will damage your skin and cause it to age prematurely, hence, the need to shield your skin from the sun whenever you go out. You should get an SPF 30 and above sunscreen for your skin, especially the one that falls within the UVA and UVB protection spectrum. You can also resort to using hats and sunglasses if the situation supports such. Sun damage promotes wrinkles and fine lines, so protect your skin to avoid it. 3. Use Mild Skincare Products When you shop for skincare products, avoid those that contain alcohol and strong fragrance as they can further dry out your skin. If you want to use anti-aging products, ensure you apply sunscreen when using products contain alpha-hydroxy acid and retinoids. These ingredients are damaging and can cause skin irritation without proper care. 4. Use Hand gloves While you are getting hats and glasses for your face, consider getting gloves to protect your hands from dryness and wrinkling, especially in the middle of winter and when driving long distance expose your hands to UV rays. Exposing your hand to harsh weather conditions and sun rays will speed up the skin aging process. 5. Avoid Smoking It might come as a surprise, but smoking causes premature skin aging and wrinkling by reducing blood flow, leaving the skin with a patchy appearance. Smoking also causes other diseases that can negatively affect the skin. 6. Reduce Water Temperature Hot water is bad for your skin because it sheds off the natural oil from your skin. If you don't like a cold bath, always make the water temperature warm. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A, Syeda. You asked: \u201cHow can I prevent my skin from aging? What are the main causes of skin aging?\u201d Unfortunately, you can't prevent your skin from aging. But, there are things you can do - and avoid doing - to prevent premature aging of your skin and ensure it looks its best well into your golden years. What causes skin to age? Genetics, for one. That's not something you can control. (Science is working on it \ud83d\ude09). Sun damage. Always, always, ALWAYS use sunscreen and reapply it according to package directions (usually every 2 hours). Don't smoke. Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide, which displaces the oxygen in your skin, and nicotine, which reduces blood flow, which dries the skin. Don't drink alcoholic beverages to excess. Like smoking, drinking alcohol likewise dehydrates skin. Eat healthy. Research indicates a plant-based diet rich in vitamin c, linoleic acid (which is found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, almonds, edamame, etc.), protein - and low in sugar - can help preserve both collagen and elastin in your skin. Try and maintain your weight within the limits according to your height. When you gain weight, your skin stretches. Lose it, the skin retracts - to an extent. Yo-yo dieting leads to skin losing its elasticity resulting in sagging, wrinkled skin. Healthy skin needs both oil and water - which come from within. Keeping them balanced is the trick! A skincare regimen doesn't have to be expensive. Regardless of your skintype, you need a cleanser, a sunscreen, and a moisturizer. Unless you're out doing something that gets you dirty, washing your face twice a day - morning and evening - is plenty. More than that and you risk stripping your skin of its natural oils. If you have dry skin anyway, it will get even drier and may begin peeling. If you have normal or oily skin, stripping away the natural oils will cause your skin to begin overproducing oil to replace what was lost. If you do have oily skin, instead of washing your face several times a day, use blotting paper to soak up the excess oil as needed. Look for a basic cleanser according to your skintype. Instead of removing the cleanser by splashing water on your face, use a washcloth - preferably 100% cotton. It will remove dirt and oils - and makeup* if you wear it - much more effectively than just splashing water on your face. Bonus: the texture of a 100% cotton washcloth will also offer light exfoliation. Although it's best to apply moisturizer to damp skin, after washing your face in the morning, the next step is to apply sunscreen - which must be applied to dry skin. Moisturizer doesn't add moisture to the skin; it creates a barrier that slows the evaporation of moisture from the skin. If you apply moisturizer first and then sunscreen, the moisturizer will prevent the sunscreen from being absorbed into the skin. In the evening, though, apply your moisturizer while your skin is still damp. The most effective nighttime moisturizer is also the least expensive - petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Of course there are other skincare products you may need, such as toners, serums, etc. - depending upon your skintype and any specific skin issues you may have. But\u2026do your research and don't get taken in by the hype. You don't have to spend a lot of money to take good care of your skin. Follow these recommendations, and with any luck you may look as fabulous at 70 as Maye Musk:  HTH! *Wearing makeup does not age or damage the skin. Not removing your makeup at the end of the day, and/or not keeping the tools you use to apply your makeup clean is bad for your skin. ",

            "answer_text": "You maybe able to slow the aging process by diet and skin care, however the rate at which we age can can be entirely down to genetics, feeding the body all the nutrients it needs enables the skin to function at its optimum causing less stress on the body. People who have more melanin tend to age slower, there is a saying \u2018black don't crack' meaning if you are of African origin the skin retains its youth for longer. Aging skin can appear older than your years if you smoke, don't cleanse the skin correctly - going to sleep with makeup on, and dehydration are the main factors aside from anything medical which could cause the aging process to accelerate. Avoid dragging the skin, after showering/bathing pat the skin dry. Hope this helps ",

(That\u2019s when the UV levels are low. Choose skincare products that are gentle on your skin, like the Cerave or Cetaphil line . (both found at drugstores, markets, and are affordable and dermatologist recommended). Have a healthy relationship with food, sticking to a plant based way of eating as much as you can, while avoiding processed foods, and limiting sugar. Try to eliminate stress in your life. . .Find ways of decompressing, do things that bring you happiness. For me, it\u2019s having plants in my living space, and a nature themed decorating scheme.

You can delay changes associated with aging by staying out of the sun, covering up, wearing a hat, and making a habit of using sunscreen. This is all because of the skin's elasticity. The younger we are, the easier it is to support the elasticity of the skin. With age, the skin becomes thinner and it stretches. This is why when facial lines are uneven or unclear, people think that the person is older than they are. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Acne Cure and Treatment. ",
