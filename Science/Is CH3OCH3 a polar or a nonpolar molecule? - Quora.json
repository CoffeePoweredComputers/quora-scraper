            "answer_text": "It is a polar molecule . Though it might seem that it is non polar because the dipole moment will be cancelled due to symmetry but actually it has no symmetry . Let me explain . It has got a tetrahedral geometry and 2 lone pairs so a angular shape .A dipole moment is there between ch3\u20130 and because of angular shape it is not cancelledthus because of this it has a dipole moment  The picture might clear things even better ",
