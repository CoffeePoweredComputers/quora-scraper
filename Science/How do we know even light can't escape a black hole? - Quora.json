            "answer_text": "If you stand on a mountain and throw a ball in the air, it'll fall onto the ground finally. If you throw it harder, it'll fall on a further place. Therefore, a certain power gives the ball a certain initial velocity and then a certain route with a certain curvature.   Our Earth is a globe and our ground is curly and has its own curvature. If we throw a ball with an appropriate velocity, the curvature of the ball's way will be the same as our Earth's. On our planet, we know this \"appropriate velocity\" is about 7.9 km/s, as known as \"first cosmic velocity\". And on a star(or a planet) with a greater density, this velocity will be higher. For example, the \"appropriate velocity\" of sun, which is known as \"third cosmic velocity\", is about 16.7 km/s.   Light can be considered as some balls flying at the speed of 3*10^5 km/s. So we imagine that there is a star or something like that with high density, and it curve the space so hard that the \"appropriate velocity\" become larger than 3*10^5 km/s. I have mentioned that the greater the density, the higher the \"velocity\". And \"black hole\" is known as a star that collapse into a point, without any volume. This point is called \"Singularity\" and it has a infinite density, and at that point, the \"velocity\" is infinite too. However, in the area around singularity, though the \"velocity\" is not infinite, it's still higher than the velocity of light.    There is a line(or a spherical surface more exactly) called \"event horizon\" around the singularity. On that place, whatever direction you choose to beam the light, the light won't come out from the black hole. Photons are more like the ball we have thrown in the air.   However, there is a surface larger than event horizon on which the orbital speed is the same as light( Thank Dmitry Popov for pointing out my mistake). On that radius, the light can escape from the black hole if you beam it perpendicularly,(outwards). If you beam them horizontally, the light will cycle around the singularity like satellites around the Earth.   However, according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light is the highest speed. Nothing can come out from a \"black hole\" and nothing can be detected as the signal of its existence. Black hole is invisible and that's the problem, we don't know whether they exist in our universe. However, there are something like \"gravitational lens\" that can help us to find black hole. And some scientists also believed that there will some \"message\" comes out from it in some different way (I don't know it clearly :( ). In a word, \"what can capture light is a black hole\" has already been defined, the real question is \"whether it exists\". ",

            "answer_text": "Light cannot escape a black hole based simply on the fact that light can be manipulated by gravity just as time can. Being that time can be manipulated by gravity and we perceive the transfer of light in time, light can be bent and manipulated by black holes. Black holes, as we all know, act as massive consumers, they can swallow up everything they are surrounding, includin light and time. If you look at a black hole on a graphical representation of the space-time continuum you will notice that a black hole creates a massive hole in the fabric, it punches all the way down. The denser the object the greater the effect it has on space-time, the deeper the \u2018hole\u2019 the greater area it consumes, including light. ",
