            "answer_text": "Very hot water under very high pressure dissolves gold. That\u2019s why gold is discovered in veins laid down in cracks in rock. It\u2019s normally found intimately mixed with quartz, which is laid down with the gold because quartz also dissolves in very hot water under pressure, and comes out of solution at the same temperature and pressure as gold when the water rises from deep in the earth through faults in the rock and cools off. Almost everything dissolves in water if it\u2019s hot enough, even \u201cinsoluble\u201d minerals like sulfides. Gold doesn\u2019t form a sulfide so it\u2019s usually found native, but silver sulfide, lead sulfide and iron sulfide are laid down in veins the same way, and in that order - gold, silver, lead, iron. Hence silver ore usually contains some gold, and lead ore usually contains some silver. An old prospector\u2019s trick was to look for a brown stain of iron on a mountain and dig there for silver and gold. Ed Schieffelin located the rich silver lode at Tombstone by the great rusty fan of iron oxide on the face of the mesa. Aqua Regia reacts with gold to form soluble gold chloride, and a 5% solution of sodium cyanide reacts to form soluble sodium gold cyanide - 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O2 + 2H2O \u2192 4 Na[Au(CN)2] + 4 NaOH .. but that isn\u2019t dissolving, like sugar dissolving in water. It\u2019s a chemical reaction, and requires another reaction to recover the gold. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course aqua regia is the most used solution to dissolve gold, but there are others. Chlorine solutions, even chlorine bleach will dissolve gold, though slowly. Gold will dissolve in sodium or potassium cyanide solutions, not as quickly as in aqua regia, but this is the primary method used in mining and refining. It will also dissolve in very high pH solutions of sodium or potassium hydroxide. Though rather impractical for the uses I assume you seek, the best solvent of all for gold is molten lead. Gold will dissolve in lead at the temperature of lead\u2019s melting point, barely more than a third of gold\u2019s melting temperature. This is an easy way to remove gold from most impurities if melted in a crucible with litharge, then separated from the resulting lead button by cupellation. ",
