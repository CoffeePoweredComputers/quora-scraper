            "answer_text": "I really appreciate the sheer idea of doing independent research without aiming for a degree. With the state of present international research, thanks to internet, there is a whole lot of things you can do. You might like to start off with reading through the literature (published research materials) to have a fair idea of what all have been done in the field of your interest. These are available through several open source journals or you might even get a free copy of the article by sending a personal email to the corresponding author. Once you settle on a defined topic you can get in touch with peers in that domain through various social networks (Share and discover research , facebook or even twitter). This will help you in defining a problem statement which is the most vital part of research. Once you have a clearly defined problem statement, you are going to stick to it and avoid wasting time and resources in reiterating it throughout the course of research. The core part of research begins after this. You get on the task of collecting every bit of information available which is related to your problem statement. Create a repository with clear labels and structure to organize all the information. Delve into the details and go on to create a dent in the universe based on the collected information and you imagination. Both the fields that you mentioned require a great deal of mathematics and I suppose you are well versed with all the required basics. Also, a great deal of imagination is always involved in research to think of new ways to address a problem or to define a theory from a complete new frame of reference.  I would like to add the end that research never has a defined path. Each step will decide the course of next steps. At various stages you will feel like this is the dead end but there is always a way out if you are ready to think a little deeper and see the unseen. Research as such doesn't have a defined time limit and when you are not aiming for a degree this sets you all the more free. Take your own sweet time but always remember that whatever you do should come from your heart else there is no way you will be able to make it big. ",

            "answer_text": "Research in any field does not require you to be an expert in the area unless it is too technical and pure scientific research. You need to understand what exactly do you need to understand and find answers to. For instance, you may work on a building information modelling research but you may not require to create the architectural designs but only understand the current trends or challenges. In a similar manner, you may study on the web security aspects but not go deep into programming aspects of it. What exactly do you want to find out? In case you need some pure mathematical skills, you can easily outsource a part of your project to a mathematician ",
