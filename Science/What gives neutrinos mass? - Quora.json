            "answer_text": "This is one of fbe hardest and ultimately meaningless questions in Quanum Mechanics. It meaningless because utimately Mass is is not a fundamental quantity. The structure of neutrinos is similar to Photons and generally each has three generations similar to Leptons which relate to number of oribitals or shells. Both have pairs of Energy Quanta in Square arrays which are bound to each other with force fields which represent components of Energy Quanta. Light exhibits half of its Energy as linear velocity. This represents a drag on the Aether which is best conceptualised as entantanglement with its past/source. Neutrinos do similar but their arrays are oriented perpendicular to the djrection of travel rafher tban tangential to an orbital as the Photons. With Photons the other half of fheir Energy is devoted to the Strong Force which is manifesfed through distortion in space or Aether in a similar manner to that described by Einstein but Space does not have a Time dimension as described in GTR. It is simply non-linear in the radial direction due the impact of Kinetic Energy on the Euclidean lattice of the Aether. The Strong Force in Photons is not attenuated by interaction with other forces other than Entanlement or the Strong Nuclear Force. With Light Photons such entanglement only occurs with Valence Electrons. It therefore does not exhibit Gravity. The arrays of Neutrinos, however, because their axis of rotation is parallel to the direcijon of travel do generate anomalous field which detracts from tbs binding Strkng Force. Thjs Field manifests itself as Gravity and js hence interpreted as Mass. Note that this does not impact the Energy Component associated with the linear velocity of the particle and therefore creates the apparent paradox of mass travelling at the speed of light. But this only breaks an absurd \u201dLaw\" dsrived from eqhally absurd STR. This brings us to the magnitudes of such masses. It is assumed that these are analogous to second moments and a parallel axis theorem applies but that the power involved is the fifth power. The contribution to gravity comprises that relating to the orbitals of the Energy Quanta about each other plus their individual Spins. This then explains why the Electron Neutrino with its first generation 1x1 array generates so little Gravity compared with the sscond and third generations which are 2x2 and 3x3. The first generation lacks the oribital component and therefore jusf relies on the Quantum Spin of a Single Energy Quanta which is tiny by comparison. ",
