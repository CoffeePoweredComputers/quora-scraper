            "answer_text": "Alchemy is the mother of chemistry. Unfortunately, it came to have a bad reputation, mainly because there was a period of European history in which rich patrons would pay \u201cpuffers\u201d (or those whose job was to transmute lesser metals to gold). Due to this disillusionment, some wanted to come up with a science that was divorced from alchemy\u2019s baggage. Chemistry is nothing but alchemy minus the soul; the main purpose of alchemy is that personal transformation in tandem with affecting change in the outer world. How ironic is it that modern alchemy is tied to money (pharmaceuticals, anyone). In the quest to avoid taint and disbelief that comes from being aligned with alchemy, in its popular sense, modern chemists have created prosperity without taking the soul or spirit into account (as alchemists do). Read Alchemy for Dummies, or sign up for Alchemy Study courses. If you\u2019re truly interested in alchemy, then you won\u2019t regret it. ",

            "answer_text": "Today we recognize alchemy as a pseudoscience, and give chemistry its rightful place as a serious scientific field, but the two terms initially overlapped in meaning before separating by the 17th century, just as astrology and astronomy did during the same period. Alchemy and alchemist are in fact older words than chemistry and chemist in English. Alchemists believed that lead could be \u201cperfected\u201d into gold, that diseases could be cured, and that life could be prolonged through transmutation, or a change of some essential element into a superior form. Their secretive experiments, usually involving heat and the mixing of liquids, led to the development of pharmacology and the rise of modern chemistry. The long route to English for alchemist began with the Greek word ch\u0113meia, which probably came from the word chyma (\u201cfluid\u201d), derived from the verb chein, meaning \u201cto pour.\u201d It then passed to Arabic, which added its definite article al- (\u201cthe\u201d) to the Greek root. The word then passed from Latin to French before coming to English. Some other words derived from Arabic also retain the al- in English, such as algebra, algorithm, and alcohol; in fact, the transformative liquid that was constantly being sought through experimentation by alchemists is another word with the Arabic al- prefix: elixir. This power to transform things for the better, real or imagined, led to figurative meanings for alchemy and alchemist. ",
