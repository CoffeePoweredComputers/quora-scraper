            "answer_text": "\u2026First, a few words about the speed of light, which is indeed the fastest speed attainable through space. How fast is it? The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. That works out to about 186,000 miles per second. Trying to go at or faster than light through space requires inventing exotic new mathematics that permit real number answers to equations that involve division by zero and square roots of negative numbers. If you can figure out how to do this sort of math, a Nobel prize is yours for the asking\u2026.So if nothing is faster than light, than how can a black hole \u201ctrap\u201d light? All objects with mass curve the space around them. Objects with little mass, such the Earth and Moon, only curve space a tiny amount, while objects with the mass of stars curve space a lot more. For a really massive object, like a black hole, the curvature of space they create in their vicinity is so severe that space is wrapped completely around itself. Here\u2019s a way to create a model of a black hole: Take a sheet of paper. That\u2019s the universe. To keep things simple, let\u2019s declare that this is a one-dimensional universe, in that objects within this universe all exist along a single mathematical line and they can move in one direction only \u2013 left and right along that line. In this 1-d universe there is no such thing as moving up and down on the paper, nor can you be anywhere except on the paper. To get from the left side of the paper (we\u2019ll call that point \u201cA\u201d) to the right side of the paper (we\u2019ll call that point \u201cB\u201d) you have to move in a straight line on the surface of the paper. Without massive objects being present, the 1-d universe lies completely flat, and the shortest route (indeed, the only route) between A and B is along that flat straight line. So far so good. The shortest path between two points in flat universe is along a straight line. But what if you introduce a massive object, like a star, into your 1-d universe? The mass of the star bends space itself. You, living on the paper in this simplified universe, don\u2019t see this curvature because your line of sight can only follow the line through space. Seen with the benefit of having extra dimensions (as you are when you hold the paper) you see a straight line traveling on a curved piece of paper. Is the line still straight? YES. It\u2019s the space itself that\u2019s curved. In this 1-d universe imagining a jump from A to B without following the straight line is the equivalent of imagining a science-fiction jump through \u201chyperspace.\u201d What if the object on the line of your paper is so massive that it curves space completely around on top of itself? What if point B were inside the region where the curvature of space exceeds 360 degrees? Then you\u2019d have a black hole. Traveling along a straight line from A to B (as you must in this 1-d universe) you\u2019d encounter a place where space had wrapped around itself and once you enter this region, no matter how fast you go, even at the speed of light, you can never leave. That\u2019s a 1-d black hole. Now try imagining a point in space where space itself has been curved on top of itself in all dimensions \u2013 left-right, up-down, forward-backward, and time itself. Black holes capture light (thus making them \u201cblack\u201d) because light is trapped within a region of infinitely inward-curving space\u2026\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is true to the greatest extent, but let\u2019s leave the \u201cat all\u201d aspect for now, as I will explain later why. Once light, any electromagnetic wave, particle, or matter in any form enters the event horizon it can not come back ! Its destination will be the singularity of the black hole. Having said that light can escape from just outside of the event horizon, from gravity wells showing the Einstein red shift. Light will be slowed down during escape from outside of the event horizon causing the red shift as noted above. Situation is different for light that already entered the event horizon. For light or anything as noted above to get out of the black hole and retrace its path back and get out of the event horizon to the accretion disc again and beyond, light will have to exceed its own speed, and any particle or matter will have to exceed the speed of light as its escape velocity to get out of the black hole. It also has to move back in time from the future which entry into the black hole will cause. Anything moving past the event horizon and entering the black hole enters our future !! In a fascinating way you can think of the black hole\u2019s picture with the central dark area as a hole into the future also ! It allows no light to escape, as the light can not retrace itself back with an escape velocity greater than its own speed in vacuum, and neither can it travel back in time from the future ! The only exception is the Hawkin radiation which is believed to consist of gravitons, some massless neutrinos, and scattered photons that leaks extremely slowly from the outskirts of the event horizon, causing evaporation of black holes over 10^67 to 10^100 years !!! You may also ask semi-philosophically and physically : how can we see any light at all if it has entered the future, exists in our future, or exists in future space-time compared to us, and can not return back to the past where we are with respect to the black hole\u2019s gravitational domain in essence\u2026 Kaiser T, MD (Life long, physics, math, cosmology, and science proponent).
