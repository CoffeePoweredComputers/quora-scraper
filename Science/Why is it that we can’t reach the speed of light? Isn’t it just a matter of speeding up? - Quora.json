            "answer_text": "The thing is, it is natural to think of \u201cspace\u201d and \u201cvelocity\u201d as two separate things. And then you think \u201cwell there are all these velocities that have numbers - physicists tell us some velocities are hard to reach, but surely there is a way past that specific number\u201d. The thing is, with velocity, when it comes to the speed of light there is no number that's bigger. Well, there are numbers that are bigger, but, fundamentally, in the way that the universe defines how far two things are separated - there is literally no higher speed. Its not that the universe has some special rule that prevents things reaching higher speeds, its that the higher speeds literally don\u2019t exist. So now, here's the trick - we have this very very absolute maximum speed. And it doesn\u2019t matter how you try and trick the universe: Hop on a rocket travelling 0.9c and fire a laser forwards, and you see that that laser is not going 1.9c - its simply going the speed of light relative to you on the rocket. Fly another rocket straight at you as .9c and measure the speed of that oncoming laser. Its not going 2.8c (the naive approach speeds of the two rockets plus the speed of the beam), its not going 1.8c - its going 1c. You can get on a rocket going at 0.9c that launches a rocket that goes 0.9c relative to the first rocket, which fires a laser beam, and that laser beam is still measured by *everyone* - the people on earth, the people on both rockets - as going at 1c relative to the rulers and clocks on each of the rockets and planets. And none of the rockets (that accelerated to 0.9c) that launched rockets (that also accelerated to 0.9c) ended up going faster than 1c. Instead the universe stepped in and squashed all the lengths and even screwed with the rates of time on all the rockets to ensure that no one measures anyone else going faster than c, and everyone measures that laser going at c. Why the weirdness tho? Why didn\u2019t the universe just set a hard cap to c? The first rocket could accelerate to 0.9c, and launch a 2nd rocket, which would accelerate to 0.1c (relative to the rocket) but now it would be going 1c relative to earth so it would just burn fuel but go no faster? Because one of the ways we measure speed is to count how much kinetic energy something has. And when we accelerate something we add kinetic energy to it. But, if \u201cc\u201d could be reached, by normal objects, and they could keep their engines turned on, then they\u2019d be adding kinetic energy that wouldn\u2019t be changing their velocity. So that energy would be lost. And the universe doesn\u2019t like losing energy: you can\u2019t create energy, you can\u2019t destroy it, you can just move it around. So, you can\u2019t reach the speed of light, because space, time and velocity are not actually the straightforward things we\u2019d like to think them to be - they exist the way they do because the infinite universe needed to synthesize some finites so it could make a universe with cause and effect and something that looks kind of like a large 3D \u201cspace\u201d in which things can have positions at certain absolutely defined times, and move between those positions over time. The disturbing truth is its all really a lie. Or at least its just the emergent properties of a different configuration. And thats why you can\u2019t reach the speed of light. ",

            "answer_text": "You can keep accelerating forever, using up a constant amount of energy, and never reach the speed of light. To prove this, you don\u2019t need to know practically anything whatsoever about physics. You only need to know the following: For any observer traveling at a constant, sub-light speed, the laws of physics are exactly the same (i.e. the outcomes of experiments will be precisely the same).Any observer traveling at a constant, sub-light speed will observe light as traveling at a constant speed [math]c[/math].Now, let\u2019s do the following thought experiment. I\u2019ll be coasting in my rocket, traveling at some constant speed. I\u2019ll then turn on my engines and accelerate, until I am traveling at [math]c/2[/math] meters per second faster to what I was before. I then turn off my engines, measure the energy that my engines used (let\u2019s suppose that it was [math]E[/math]), and reassess my situation. I am once again coasting at a constant, sub-light speed. Therefore, I still observe light traveling at a speed [math]c[/math] away from me. In fact, the situation, from what I have observed, hasn\u2019t really changed at all, other than perhaps that I am traveling faster with respect to distant stars. I shrug my shoulders, turn the engines back on and accelerate, again until I am traveling at [math]c/2[/math] meters per second faster to what I was before. I then turn off the engines, which have once again used up [math]E[/math] units of energy (because, remember, the outcomes of experiments don\u2019t change). Once again, I am coasting at a constant, sub-light speed, and therefore light is still traveling [math]c[/math] meters per second faster than I am. I can keep going like this forever, and it won\u2019t make a single bit of difference. It\u2019s counter-intuitive, I know, but that is because velocity isn\u2019t actually additive, the way you assume it is. In fact, a lot of the physical intuition that you have, which works just fine as long as speeds aren\u2019t too high, has to be carefully pruned for it to be useful in the context of special relativity.
