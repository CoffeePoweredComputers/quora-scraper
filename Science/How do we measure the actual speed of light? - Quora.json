            "answer_text": "Cheese on toast. Put it into your microwave (without the revolving bit) and leave it to cook. Now measure the distance between the peaks of cheese on the toast. Have a look at the microwave particulars on the back. This will tell you the microwave frequency. Multiply that by the distance between peaks (aka the wavelengths) and you will get the speed of the microwaves in the oven. Now, because all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same speed, this is ALSO the speed of light. Of course in 1676 they didn't have microwave ovens. Instead Ole Roemer had to work it out by measuring how long celestial light took to get to us. He noticed that, depending on the Earth\u2013Sun\u2013Jupiter geometry, there could be a difference of up to 1000 seconds between the predicted times of the eclipses of Jupiter's moons, and the actual times that these eclipses were observed. He correctly surmised that this is due to the varying length of time it takes for light to travel from Jupiter to Earth as the distance between these two planets varies. He obtained a value of c equivalent to 214,000 km/s, which was very approximate because planetary distances were not accurately known at that time. In 1728 James Bradley made another estimate by observing celestial events. Bradley measured angles for starlight, and knowing the speed of the Earth around the Sun, he found a value for the speed of light of 301,000 km/s. The first measurement of c that didn't make use of celestial bodies was by Armand Fizeau in 1849. He used a beam of light reflected from a mirror 8 km away. The beam was aimed at the teeth of a rapidly spinning wheel. The speed of the wheel was increased until its motion was such that the light's two-way passage coincided with a movement of the wheel's circumference by one tooth. This gave a value for c of 315,000 km/s. Leon Foucault improved on this result a year later using rotating mirrors, which gave the much more accurate value of 298,000 km/s. His technique was also good enough to confirm that light travels more slowly in water than in air. Nowadays we link c and distance together. Since 1983 the metre has been defined by international agreement as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. This makes the speed of light exactly 299,792,458 m/s and it can no longer change! ",
