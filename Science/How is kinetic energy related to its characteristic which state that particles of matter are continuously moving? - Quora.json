            "answer_text": "Particles move perpetually, even in a relative state of rest (producing a field of potential energy) Particles are at rest when they spin and vibrate or move within a particularly limited body, field or region. When such moving particles interact with things other than that which exists within their field of resting motion, whether something comes into that field or the field comes into something, they become disturbed, agitated or excited into more motion having an affect upon that which they come in contact. This is then called kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is potential energy put to work or at work. Another way of expressing it is that kinetic energy is potential energy having an affect or producing an affect, or even an effect while being agitated, excited or disturbed. So with particles continuously moving having potential energy they produce kinetic energy as they move more vigorously, whether within or outside their region of rest motion. ",
