            "answer_text": "detect is difficult as it is a passive infrared sensor so there is no indication of it other than seeing the camera. blocking depends on the sensitivity of the camera, my one will detect a rabbit at 150 ft. The one on a police helicopter can detect a human under thick undergrowth/trees or through the wooden wall of a shed. you might block it if you covered yourself in a blanket soaked in ice cold water or were under water in a swimming pool. If you could find a large heat source that was much hotter than your body, something like the hot air outlet of a large air conditioning plant, it might work. ",

Detection is more difficult since they have made them smaller and smaller, they even have a \u201dcircuit board sized\u201d one to be installed in a \u201dspy camera\u201d. So they can be literally hidden in an air vent or any appliance. So if your idea is to rob your employer who may use heat-detecting security cameras, odds are the loss prevention booth will have you on \u201dtape\u201d doing it. ",
