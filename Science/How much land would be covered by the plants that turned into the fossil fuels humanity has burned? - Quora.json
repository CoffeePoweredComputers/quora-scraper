            "answer_text": "Here are the numbers: (Sorry for the American units, but that\u2019s what I grew up with.) The atmospheric pressure is 15 pounds per square inch. Oxygen makes up 21% of that, so 3.2 pounds of oxygen exists above every square inch of the globe. If we wanted to remove all that oxygen, we\u2019d need 1.2 pounds of carbon to react with those 3.2 pounds of oxygen. (12 weight of carbon reacts with 32 weight of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide \u2014 perhaps American units make things easy on us;-) So, if we use anthracite coal, which has a density about that of water, we\u2019d have to cover the world, ocean and land, with about a meter thickness of carbon to oxidize all the oxygen in the atmosphere. Oh, wait \u2014 you only wanted the fossil fuels we burned. We\u2019ve added about 200 ppm of carbon dioxide since the industrial revolution, so we\u2019ve only burned about a thousandth of the buried carbon. So, a millimeter layer of carbon across the globe represents the plants that made those fossil fuels we burned. ",
