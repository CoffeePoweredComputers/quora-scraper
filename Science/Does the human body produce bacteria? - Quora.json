            "answer_text": "Short answer is NO. Human body does not produce bacteria but it can maintain the bacteria that are already present in the human body. Bacteria are prokaryotes and they have been in existing for billions years even before the existence of humans. Human body infests bacteria beginning at birth. After birth babies acquire bacteria when they breath, breast feed, put toys in their mouth, or from mother\u2019s skin etc. There are harmful bacteria and helpful bacteria. Harmful bacteria are the bacteria that causes sickness whereas helpful bacteria helps humans in numerous ways. For instance, bacterias in the human gut are responsible for simple tasks such as bile tolerance, acid resistance to complex functions such as host nutrient metabolism, xenobiotic and drug metabolism, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, immunomodulation, and protection against pathogens. In fact, Gut flora or bacterial presence in the intestine is so important that fecal transplant is performed from a normal person having good flora to a person that is suffering from Clostridium Difficile infection. According to numerous research it has been shown that after a fecal transplant from normal person to the intestine of the patient suffering with C. Difficile, the success rate of curing the patient is around 95- 100 percent which is far better compared to antibiotic such as Vancomycin, Metronidazole and others. I am not saying that antibiotics do not have a good success rate. The problem with antibiotics is that the chances of reoccurrence of C. Difficile are higher compared to fecal transplant. There is also an increasing trend of taking probiotics- dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial microbes or eating diet that further enhances the growth of the these gut flora, which in turn helps us. We cannot make bacterias in our body, however, there are bacteria that may undergo mutation and make entirely a different species of bacteria. However, that does not mean that we can make bacteria in our body. It should be noted that a child comes to contact with bacteria while in the womb of his/her mother. Baby\u2019s first bacteria arrive sooner than we thought http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(11)00891-3/fulltext http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528021/ ",

            "answer_text": "The bacteria produce themselves. Hopefully only good ones in the correct places, like your intestines. But some usually harmless ones on skin, in vagina, eye, nose. Body is on guard to set limits, managed by white blood cells and healthy skin plus mucous secretions. Generally there are always some bacteria in mouth, thus regular mouth hygiene is helpful. There should not be any significant number in your bloodstream, else you have septicemia, and likely fever. Otherwise infections (containing bacteria) are localized and such wounds, scratches, whatever require care \u2014 by doctor at first sign of worsening. Pus is dead white blood cells containing bacteria. Obviously they ate the bacteria, migrated to nearest exit and expired. ",

They go from intestines to the chest cavity and they activate others that dissolve the flesh since out of death comes life. They are waiting in us all. ",
