            "answer_text": "You don't have to shoot for the moon to make a difference. High school science projects aren't about finding the next Nobel prize winner, although some such projects can be very good. You mentioned \u201cfinding a cure for Zika\u201d. That's probably way too advanced\u2014maybe start from another angle. How about\u2014 Examining transmission patterns of disease (in general), and finding simple regulations or changes that can address the most important issues in Zika\u2019s spread? I don't know what those are, but you might discover them.What makes Zika different from other, less serious diseases? Is it something to do with the symptoms, the effects on pregnant women alone (and their fetuses), or the number of people that can be rapidly affected in close proximity? Something else?What are the strengths and weaknesses of the countries most likely to be affected by Zika? Weather patterns? Infrastructure? Temperature? Migration of insects? Standing water with low runoff?Now, what interventions might minimize those weaknesses, while leveraging those strengths to the greatest degree?List examples where these interventions have been used, at least in part. Use news article searches for this. Maybe get access to DowJones Factiva at a university library, or even use Google News. Where did these interventions work most effectively? Where did they not really work at all? What were the differences?With a public health problem like Zika, TRUE information may be hidden behind the rampant spread of MYTH and RUMOR about the disease. Finding the nuggets of scientific fact and verifiable observational data can be INVALUABLE, and this certainly merits a worthwhile science project. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The point of research is to understand an idea better. Assuming your project doesn't need a physical example/demonstration of your final topic, you could research anything you'd like so long as it shows your newly found knowledge as a result of research. If you have a question, say for instance \u201chow do I find a cure for the Zika virus, simply research how one finds a cure for the Zika virus.\u201d however, the answer to this question, I'd imagine, would be structured with an immense amount of questions and knowledge. When dealing with big questions like these, dissect it. Analyze smaller questions that you should be expected to know when answering this question: what are the current measures being taken to find a cure or to prevent the spread of the virus? Can a virus even be cured, why or why not? What makes a virus? How do viruses interact with a persons body? Ask questions that break down a bigger question and focus on those smaller pieces - the smaller pieces that you are uneducated about. No matter how big or small the topic may seem, you are nonetheless researching, and every bit of information you find is vital to a bigger question ",
