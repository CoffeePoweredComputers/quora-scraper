            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways depending on the properties of the gases that you are trying to separate. 1 Method) by liquifying one of the components the gas and liquid will easily separate under gravity. Example:- A pressure drop of a hydrocarbon gas of say 10 bar will be enough to condense some of the gases into liquid form, they can be drawn off in a 2 phase separator (or simpler drain if practical) 2nd method) Same principle except temperature is used to reduce the gas such that liquids condense out of the gas. pass a pipe through a chiller, reduce the temperature by 30degrees and some of the gas will condense and again can be extracted by simple gravity separation (the gas cant hold the liquids) 3rd Method) Combination of both above; drop the pressure significantly such that the pressure drops and the gases cool together. Gravity separation will also separate condensed liquids from the gas phase. 4th method) Distillation - Drop the pressure and temperaure so much that you liquify all of the gas components. Collect these liquids in a distillaiton column, adjust heat and pressure such that you separate the gas phases component by component a 5th Method) Using a solvent such as TEG (GLYCOL) water in vapour form in a gas phase will be stripped from the hydrocarbon gas by mass transfer from gas phase into liquid glycol phase through a stripping column a 6th method) A molecular sieve can be used as an adsorbent to stip gases such as CO2 and water from a hydrocarbon gas phase. The sieve is made of nano particles which capture the larger molecules letting the smaller particles pass and retain the larger ones Those are a bunch that I thought off from the top of my head, hope that helps ",

            "answer_text": "From a practical standpoint, using a solvent that selectively absorbs the component you want and not the other, or vice versa. This is usually accomplished in an absorber tower filled with packing material or trays to promote good mass transfer. The solution containing the removed component is usually heated and/or steam or inert gas is injected to release the absorbed component(s) but in a separate \u201cstripper\u201d unit for collection or disposal. The other gases, those that do not absorb in the solvent, are sent as desired product from the top of the absorber column. An industrially important example would be removal of CO2 from natural gas by absorption in an amine such as Diethanolamine (DEA). It is the CO2 which reacts with the DEA in solution and is then liberated by heating and steaming the solution. Another example is removing water from natural gas by absorption in tetraethylene glycol (TEG). The absorbed water is driven off by heating the glycol in a separate still column/regenerator unit to over 300 F. By this means natural gas with a dewpoint of 25 F or even lower can be produced which is acceptable to transportation pipelines and avoids formation of gas hydrates or water ice both of which can block even large transmission lines. Another way is to use membranes. For the same example as above, cellulose acetate polymer membranes are used to effect the separation of CO2 and CH4. The CO2 absorbs in the membrane and then diffuses through it and is collected (as \u201cpermeate\u201d whilst the residue gas goes along out of the membrane unit, partially freed of the CO2 which is more soluble in the membrane. In practice, some methane is unavoidably diffused through the membranes as well but there is still substantive enrichment resulting. Yet another way is adsorption, wherein a material such as a zeolite is used to selectively adsorb certain components of a gas mixture to a larger extent than others. These are usually used in a cyclic manner with multiple beds. Once all the adsorption that the material is capable of has occurred, the bed is switched to regeneration mode using a hot regeneration gas which does not contain the material adsorbed, which then flushes it out to get it ready for another cycle. Meanwhile a fresh bed has been put in service to emulate a continuous process. Sometimes quite a few beds are used that are in various stages of adsorbing, cooling, regeneration, heating so there is always at least one bed in an adsorbing state. This can be used for gas drying to very low levels but also CO2 removal and many other separations. Sometimes the regeneration is accomplished via pressure-swings as the adsorbed component will release accordingly to the pressure. Yet another way is to liquify the gas in its entirety, or practically so, and then distill the liquid, effecting the separation by the difference in vapor pressures of one or more of the liquids. This is most commonly seen in air separation to produce nitrogen and oxygen. LNG is liquid natural gas, but there is little or no separation of components done in the liquefaction process as the entire natural gas as LNG is wanted. ",
