            "answer_text": "In the semiconductor and consumer electronics industry, South Korea is beginning or already has overtaken Japan in terms of technology. To give you an example, Samsung is the only company in the world as of now that can mass produce the latest OLED displays. In fact, Apple just ordered nearly 100 million OLED displays from Samsung to be used in their new Iphone 8 this year. Furthermore, South Korean scientists have recently discovered a way to mass produce micro-LED displays which is far superior in quality and efficiency than OLED and will eventually replace OLED displays in the future. South Korea has a very dynamic economy and Koreans do a solid job in predicting the direction of the market and the direction of technology which allows them to quickly capitalize on those opportunities before the rest of the competition catches up. That is probably one of South Korea\u2019s greatest strengths.  Method-2 Robot Also, the South Korean government is preparing for the 4th industrial revolution which is marked by emerging technology breakthroughs in a number of fields, including AI, Robotics, Iot, etc. Billions of dollars have been invested in these fields and now South Korea leads in robotics and has the most robots per-capita in the world. South Korea also tops the list in terms of technological preparedness in Iot which is said to become a half-trillion dollar industry by 2020. Overall, in my opinion, South Korea is definitely a powerhouse when it comes to technology and can easily rival Japan\u2019s technology.  Robot density per 10,000 employees Sources: DARPA Robotics Challenge South Korea has the highest concentration of robots in the world South Korea tops IDC APAC's 2017 IoT Readiness Index | Networks Asia ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak to South Korea as I\u2019ve only visited there for brief periods. But Japan isn\u2019t as technologically advanced as many people believe. Yes, we\u2019ve got awesome toilets and the shinkansen is a great way to travel, but not so much in other areas. For example, do you still use a fax machine? It\u2019s considered an outdated\u2014if not dead\u2014piece of technology in most countries. But in Japan, it\u2019s still SOP. Every time I\u2019ve tried to email documents, I\u2019ve been told to fax them instead. Japan\u2019s still very much a paper-based society. The smartphone came to Japan late. Japanese cell phone companies believed there was no need to compete in the smartphone market at first because they thought the Japanese people would be satisfied with the Japanese flip-phones (which were advanced for their time, but completely blown away by the smartphone). They were wrong. Same goes for ereaders. The Japanese publishing companies managed to successfully delay the release of the Kindle and other ereading device by a few years. Even still, Japanese readers overwhelmingly prefer print to digital books. Credit cards and debit cards are still a rarity as opposed to the norm. Online banking is something only practiced by a few of the big banks. There are ATMs that still have operating hours. And don\u2019t get me started on home insulation. Japan has barely caught up to the latter 20th century on that front. In recent years, Japan\u2019s actually been stymied by a lack of innovation and creative thinking. Part of the reason for that is the seniority system of promotion, where people are promoted not because of merit or because they have the best ideas, but because it\u2019s their turn in line. Now you have companies run by old men who aren\u2019t willing to adapt to the changing times and it\u2019s causing Japan to be left behind. ",
