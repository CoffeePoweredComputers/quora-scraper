            "answer_text": "If you remove a coup of marterial from a neutron star it would no longer be stabilized by gravity, immediately some neutrons would be transformed into protons and the cup would fly apart faster than the weak gravity of earth had any observable effect on it. Even though a free neutron has a considerable half life, the enormous number of neutrons would cause a significant amount to decay almost immediately. ",

            "answer_text": "The cup of material would explode as the neutrons, free of gravity, became protons and electrons. The neutron flux of the remaining unconverted neutrons would sleet through the earth causing massive radioactivity. Everyone on the planet would be dead of radiation poisoning in seconds before the explosion tore the earth apart. ",
