            "answer_text": "The root cause of the \u201907 Real Estate market crash is one big ethical dilemma, known as \u201cmoral hazard\u201d in economics circles. It\u2019s a great case study. I can break it down a little bit, but the scenario as a whole is quite a lot to explain: Firstly, one must be familiar with the nature of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE), Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC). Mostly one must know that HUD had certain regulatory controls over these GSEs and that due to their government sponsored status, these GSEs had long before monopolized the secondary mortgage market, by driving out all other competition. With that setup in mind, let\u2019s pretend you own a bank that lends money so that people can buy houses. As a bank, you can only lend so much money you don\u2019t have to lend, up to your fractional reserve limit. So let\u2019s pretend you lent out all the money in the bank so that people could buy homes. Well, in order to continue earning money for your depositors\u2019 savings accounts, you must still make new loans. You can\u2019t wait 30 years for all the mortgages you made this year to mature. You need more money to lend out in the meantime. You could try to entice more savings by offering a higher interest rate on deposits, but then you won\u2019t make any profit, considering the rate of the mortgages you already made. Since increasing deposits is a no go, there\u2019s another option. You can sell the mortgages you have made to a secondary mortgage vendor. These vendors will pay you cash for the mortgages you\u2019ve already set up, and that will give you the liquidity needed to make new loans, and keep your depositors, investors and board happy. You approach the secondary mortgage market, and find that the only players left in that market, the GSEs, have a monopoly. So you go to the GSEs, and tell them you have several loans you\u2019d wish to sell them. The GSEs say they\u2019d be happy to buy the loans, if and only if, a certain percentage of them are sub-prime or sub-A. They tell you that HUD is mandating that lower income, higher risk, people must be a certain percentage of FNMA/FMCC\u2019s portfolio. They have no way around this. If you want to be able to sell off your existing loans, so that you can make new loans, you must be selling what the GSEs are buying. So you are able to sell off a few loans to the GSEs, but the majority of your loans have been made with the highest underwriting standards. You wanted to to make sure that almost everybody you loaned money to can and will pay it back, and has a history that agrees. You know that if you continue like this, the GSEs won\u2019t buy your loans if you can\u2019t provide them with a certain amount of low-income, higher risk loans, in the mix even though you know your depositors and shareholders don\u2019t want to make these riskier loans. Now you have the moral hazard, the ethical dilemma. If you do not choose to make riskier loans, you wont be able to make enough loans to be competitive. You\u2019ll fall behind the competition which is bad for your depositors, shareholders, board, etc. You\u2019ll end up holding the loans you\u2019ve made for 30 years, while not being able to make new loans. If you want to make new loans, you have to take on a level of risk your depositors, shareholders, and board do not want to take on, in order to ensure you can sell off these new loans to the GSEs. You are in a catch-22. You either twist your underwriting standards until you can sell what the GSEs are buying, knowing full well the default rate on these loans is going to be high, or you abandon your stock holders, depositors, and creditors and go under. If you wish to discover more on your own, I highly recommend reading the 2007 10-K reports filed by FNMA & FMCC, before the crash even occured, which is public record. In these reports you\u2019ll find FNMA & FMCC patting themselves on the back for meeting HUDs low-income housing goals, while at the very same time, you\u2019ll find them freaking out about the amount of risk currently in their portfolios. Of course, we now know that the end result of this moral hazard had far reaching consequences, the attempts to insure against this extra risk were futile, as the insurance companies didn\u2019t have enough money to cover the chips in play. This spilled over into the stock market, and just became a real mess. It all started with government trying to make policy out of good intentions, and led to an ethical crisis in banking. ",

            "answer_text": "An ethical dilemma is when you\u2019re faced with making a decision between two courses of action that make you question where you truly stand on the moral spectrum. If you\u2019ve been faced with this before, you can probably say that it sucks a lot. You would be accurate. Here are 3 examples of ethical dilemmas: #1 Samantha & Her Lover You and Samantha have been friends since birth. No\u2026since conception. Your mothers were friends. You were raised under the same set of moral code and have different taste in men and same taste in shoes. (Both beneficial things.) Once, in high school, you shaved your head in an act of defiance and regretted it immediately. You called Sam, bawling like a drugged hyena. Samantha came to school the next day bald. She smiles as you pick up your jaw from the floor. \u201cTime to go wig shopping,\u201d she says. She\u2019s always had your back. Now it\u2019s your turn. Samantha, now happily married to Joe, calls you up one day to say hello. \u201cHow are you and Joe?\u201d You ask. \u201cThanks again for his help watching the kids last week. Remember how I set you two up for your first date five years ago?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine. Also,\u201d she says, dropping her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know who to tell\u2026but I need to tell somebody\u2026um, I have a boyfriend.\u201d \u201cYou mean a husband,\u201d you correct. \u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m cheating on Joe.\u201d Your couch looks different all of a sudden as the blood leaves your brain. \u201cBut you have a husband,\u201d you repeat. \u201cSamantha\u2026\u201d She\u2019s quiet. \u201cWho is it?\u201d You finally ask. Do you tell Joe about this? You love Joe. But do you love Samantha more? And you are disappointed right now. But it\u2019s not your business. At least, it\u2019s not your place to be the messenger. Right? \u201cWho is it, Samantha?\u201d You\u2019re slightly irritated now. Of course you can\u2019t tell Joe. That\u2019s between them. Also, Joe owns a gun. You know he\u2019s got anger issues. It\u2019s possible he would pick it up in a fit of rage and kill the guy. But if you don\u2019t tell, and he finds out, would he turn around and direct that anger on you for failing him as a friend? Samantha finally tells you. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping with your little brother.\u201d Now you have an ethical dilemma. What do you do? #2 Meredith Grey and Her Big Fat Heart WARNING: Grey\u2019s Anatomy (Minor) Spoiler Alert! When Meredith Grey, in her position as an acting member of an Alzheimer\u2019s research trial, wanted to help save the depleting memory of her mentor\u2019s wife, what did she do? She had just lost her mother to Alzheimer\u2019s too. It was a difficult time. Dr. Grey had authority and stakes in this research, and also managed to get more access to the medicine than anyone expected. What did she do with the heightened access? She interfered with the trial. She secretly switched the drugs that were declared NOT to be tampered with. She jeopardized the whole thing. However, she did this with the hope that if Adele (her mentor\u2019s wife) took the test drug instead of the placebo, maybe her memory would be saved. And one less person in her life would lose themselves to this debilitating illness. And, Meredith did this while fully aware of the consequences of her actions: risking the continuation of the trial itself and inhibiting future access to a potentially life-saving drug for millions of patients. She put her husband\u2019s reputation on the line. And, of course, and the hospital\u2019s. But Meredith had two awful choices to make here: her loyalty to her career and her co-workers telling her to behave according to society\u2019s wishes, versus her desire to care for the important people in her life leading her to commit an illegal act of love. This was her ethical dilemma. What would you have done? #3 Crowning Glory You are selected to be Head Judge in a business competition. It\u2019s for a grant of $10,000. You have co-judges, but it\u2019s been made clear they will turn to you. Your best bud Yaris just happens to be starting an amazing company. It\u2019s a revolutionary idea. It could help reduce the environmental damage of six out of seven continents on the planet in a rapid timeframe. \u201cI could use the money,\u201d he says. \u201cSo join the contest,\u201d you say. \u201cBut I cannot let our friendship interfere with my final decision.\u201d \u201cI understand of course,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see your presentation.\u201d Presentation day comes. The hours are 10\u20136. It\u2019s been made every clear. Everybody shows up at 9am to register their time slots. Then they wait around to present. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been done for years. You want to make it more efficient, but that\u2019s been tabled for 2018. Yaris doesn\u2019t show. You worry. You made it very clear. At 5pm, nothing. You surreptitiously call him. You\u2019ve been leaving texts all day, but none of them go through. At 5:55pm, he shows up. Your co-judges are all still there, but they are packing up. His name isn\u2019t on the list. He looks dejected and tired. You feel the same. You haven\u2019t seen a good presentation all day. None of the kids today had prepared pitches that deserve the amount of money you\u2019re granting. You know Yaris would have killed it. He would use the money to do something incredible and life-changing, unselfish and humane\u2026 But he didn\u2019t follow the rules. Your co-judges are watching you, wondering what you\u2019re about to say\u2026 This is your ethical dilemma. Do you let him present?  As you can see, even if you are absolutely sure that there is a right or wrong in any of these situations, there is no answer that cannot be justified from the other side. There is no decision that allows you to be 100% comfortable. This is why we call it a dilemma. All use of names are completely fictitious and entirely coincidental\u2026except the Grey\u2019s one. ",
