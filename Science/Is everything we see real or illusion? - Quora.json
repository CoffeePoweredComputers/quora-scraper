            "answer_text": "The Universe is made up of two main components i.e. real & imaginary. According to us, whatever things we can sense its real. Your reality is not what you think. Its the reality created by your brain after taking data from each senses. A blind man can never understand what is blue colour because his vision is the only source for the mind to create the reality of colors. For him everything is black but he can feel & sense through other senses by which his brain will create reality accordingly. What about things which our senses cannot perceive? Air exists but we can only feel it. What if your sense of touch suddenly stopped & then you will say there is no Air. In the same way, there are many other things which are beyond our normal perception & senses which we may not sense & we question its existence. So our body rely on our senses to conclude that things are real but there are many things which our senses cannot perceive. So our world is mixed reality. It consists of real as well as imaginary things. There is also a theory which states that matter is just an energy of vibration. So matter is just vibration of energies? Weird right. So, for body whatever things it can sense is real but actually everything is vibration of energies. \u201cThings are unreal until we discover or feel it.\u201d ",
