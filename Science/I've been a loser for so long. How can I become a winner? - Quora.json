            "answer_text": "TIME FOR A SCIENCE LECTURE! Every time you have a thought a series of things happen in your brain. Firstly an electrical signal fires at a neuron and that travels down through an axon into another neuron and this leads to a chain of them firing through your cerebral cortex (see Figure 1). It is one of the most recently developed parts of our brain and its brought us to where we are today as conscious creatures.  Figure 1. Mid Sagittal View. The more often you think something the stronger the path (axons) between those neurons get. The axon \u2018walls\u2019 grow in thickness and width allowing a bigger faster reaction to happen. The more often you have to remember something the faster your recall time will be (i.e. 1 + 2 = 3). If you live your life thinking you\u2019re a loser you will continue being what you think you are because you have allowed yourself to think this over (and over) again. World class athletes don\u2019t think they are slow. Why? This is counterproductive. If you want to run fast then allow yourself the mental capacity to do so first. Ask yourself every time you\u2019re about to have a deprecating thought: \u201cWould a winner think this?\u201d Then when you\u2019re successful at NOT thinking like a loser and start positioning yourself as a winner you can start asking yourself something different: \u201cWould a winner do this?\u201d Would a winner play League of Legends all day? No. They would practice what they\u2019re good at until they\u2019re great at it.Would a winner browse Facebook when they\u2019re bored? No. They would pick up and read a book about success or something field related.etc.Eventually the neurons that you used before eventually become redundant and will be seen as a cautionary story. ",

            "answer_text": "I wonder if you have ever reflected upon yourself to reaffirm your status. For one, everyone here in quora, or on this earth as a human, is a winner. Conception is a competition of survival. Imagine millions pf sperms swimming blindly looking for ONE egg to stick their head into. You won that race cos here you are. You won yet another battle growing up where many have failed due to illness, accidents, abuse or just plain unlucky. You grew up. So how do you become a winner? Firstly, believe it when everyone tells you \u201cits in your head\u201d. Attitude determines your lattitude. Of course, thinking like a winner WON\u2019T make you one but starts you strategizing, planning, organizing, controlling..- in short, you have to manage success for it to materialise. Start with little tasks. Example, if you want to save a million bucks, it helps if you can plan how to save your first thousand. If you want to graduate top of your class, it makes sense you do it one subject at a time. Winning small gives you the confidence and motivation to gun for bigger successes. Next, dealing with failure. Dont take it too personally. Everyone has failed one way or another. If you did not fail, you wouldnt know how failure or success feels. Try to think, \u201ci failed 100 times, but that only tells me i wont use those 100 ways that dont bring me success. But i am still looking for the way to success\u201d. You know if you think that way, you would have beaten a jerk like me (i consider myself a jerk) who hasnt even tried 10 ways and failed. So much for the experience factor (sigh). Lastly, we are social animals. So hang around positive, never-say-die people. They may seem nerdy or square to you but that sure beats a self-composed wailer who has nothing but grouses and self-pity for oneself, forgetting all the great successes he has ever tasted in living life till this day. Cheers! ",
