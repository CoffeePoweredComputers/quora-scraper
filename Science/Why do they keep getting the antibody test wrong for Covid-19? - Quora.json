            "answer_text": "I can think of several factors. Some companies aren\u2019t doing the necessary quality control to be sure their tests are accurate and some might even be fudging results of quality testing.All coronaviruses are similar and it takes extra care to distinguish which or the viruses someone has had this costs more money.People have been put under stress to do more than reasonable so samples can/do sometimes get contaminated.The test for the antibodies has to be done with a sufficient time for the numbers to be readable. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s like a pregnancy test (especially the older ones) you had to wait till first missed period to get a positive test because the hormones had to reach a certain peak much as the antibodies would have to for the Covid-19 antibody tests. And like those pregnancy tests you might test negative because of timing but turn out positive.There is the possibility that there is political pressure in some places for certain results whether they are true or not. (This question wasn\u2019t country specific to my knowledge).",

            "answer_text": "The antibody test if run on one of the bigger platforms by one of the bigger manufacturers is very good. The bigger labs like Quest and LabCorp will run the tests on these machines. It has a high sensitivity and specificity. The other testing platforms are iffy at best. The antibody tested is an IgG and they tend to develop about 14ish days after infection for most people. So if you test to early then it will not show up. And, some people are late on making the IgG. The antigen test is tougher and can have a pretty significant false negative rate. ",
