            "answer_text": "There are three lung fishes in the world occurring at far away places exhibiting the discontinuous geographical distribution. The well-known lung fish Neoceratodus of Australia stays in stagnant pools all the year round. In this fish both lungs and gills work together. It comes to surface occasionally and breathes air by making spouting sound. When the water becomes foul or polluted , the lung respiration gets pronounced. On the other hand, the African lung fish Protopterus breathes by gills when the water is available in the wet season. However, it occasinally comes to the surface for air breathing. If it is prevented from breathing air, it would die. In summer, when the swamps dry, it hibernates in the wet or soft mud by construction a cacoon in the mud. During this time it gets covered by slime in order to keep its skin moist. The third lung fish living in Paraguay in South American continent, is more air breathing than the Protopterus. Interestingly, when this fish lays eggs during the rainy season it aerates the water in which the eggs are laid. Its pelvic fin acts as gills. By moving its fins, it also aerates the water for its youngones. ",
