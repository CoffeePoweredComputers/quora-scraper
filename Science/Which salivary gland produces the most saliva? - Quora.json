            "answer_text": "Simple Answer: Submandibular salivary glands produce the most saliva (around 75%). The sublingual salivary glands produce 5% saliva. The parotid salivary glands produce 20% saliva. Now, let us contemplate the science of salivary glands.  Types of Saliva: 1. Submandibular (submaxillary) Salivary Glands: These produce mucus-thick saliva. 2. Sublingual Salivary Glands: These produce mucus-rich saliva. 3. Parotid Salivary Glands: These produce water-rich saliva.  The Nervous Control: Cranial Parasympathetic Nervous System: 1. Submandibular (submaxillary) Salivary Glands: Chorda Tympani branch of the Facial Nerve.  2. Sublingual Salivary Glands: Chorda Tympani branch of the Facial Nerve.  3. Parotid Salivary Glands: Glossopharyngeal Nerve.  Now, let us raise a few questions and find the right answers. Why Facial Nerve supplies submandibular and sublingual salivary glands? The Facial Nerve also supplies the anterior two-thirds (61.8034%) of the tongue. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is responsible for good tastes, like sweet, salty, and sour. These tastes need thick mucus saliva for chemical reactions. Why Glossopharyngeal Nerve supplies the parotid salivary glands? The Glossopharyngeal Nerve supplies the posterior one-third (38.1966%) of the tongue. The posterior one-third of the tongue is responsible for bitter taste. The bitter taste can be poisonous. It should be eliminated immediately with vomiting reflex. The water-rich saliva from the parotid salivary glands helps in vomiting reflex. The vomiting reflex is called a single segmental reflex. The Essence: The human body is an example of perfect Divine Design. Another Spiritual Statement: The perfect and most beautiful objects of the universe and Nature follow Divyank, the Divine Constant. Divyank: ((22/21)10.34419)=1.618034. 1.618034 is the most economical algorithm of Nature. 1:1.618034 (38.1966: 61.8034) is called Divyank Ratio or Golden Ratio. According to Akhand Sutra, the perfect percentage of water on the earth, inside the human body, and the cells are 61.8034%. The Conclusion: The human salivary glands follow Divyank. For detailed knowledge, please download and read Akhand Sutra from Akhand Vidyashram. The eBook is free. ",

            "answer_text": "We have 3 pair of major salivary glands and minor salivary glands as well. The major salivary glands are SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND (LOCATED IN THE SUBMENTAL SPACE WHICH IS A PART OF SUBMANDIBULAR SPACE) PAROTID GLAND (LOCATED IN THE ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF PARAPHRYNGEAL SPACE) SUBLINGUAL GLAND (LOCATED IN THE SUBLINGUAL SPACE WHICH IS A PART OF SUBMANDIBULAR SPACE) Per day we produce 1\u20131.5L of saliva. It is found that under basal condition that is when there is no stimulation externally SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND accounts for about 69% of the saliva secretion followed by Parotid 26% and sublingual 5% However when stimulated PAROTID GLAND produces major amount of saliva contributing upto 66%. Minor salivary glands, independent of stimulation, contribute 7\u20138% of total saliva. P.S : If you are asked about the question without mentioning about the state of excitation, consider it to be basal. **Mnemonic to remember the answer to this question: Submandibular gland is drained by Duct of Wharton. Remembering this you can recall Submandibular gland produces tons of saliva** ",
