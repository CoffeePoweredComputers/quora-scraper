            "answer_text": "1 No, the electrostatic charge is the inherent property of a proton. Same for electron. No electrostatic charge = not a proton, or not an electron. 2 Some models have elementary particles, but very limited if separable. A few nanoseconds at CERN does not seem a way to build atoms stable for centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, when we discharge hydrogen gas electrochemicaly: 2H(+) + 2 e- \u2013> H2(g) we are doing precisely that, this is a cathodic reaction, this you must couple with an anodic reaction such as 2Cl(-) \u2013> Cl2(g) + 2e- this is achieved in a cell with hydrochloric acid and a current (counterflow of electrons) supplied by a DC power source.
