            "answer_text": "The question is quite tricky. It says \u201cIf nothing exists, does nothing exist?\u201d Logically, the answer would be yes, but it is a qualified yes, an affirmation based simply on the given assumption, supposition, if. In short \u201cif x, therefore x\u201d where x= \u201cnothing\u201d. But if we remove the assumption, the hypothetical supposition, and simply ask \u201cDoes nothing exist?\u201d, then the answer needs another premise, a premise other than the assumption that it exists. For us to be able to answer the question, we have to define or have a more or less common understanding of what nothing and what existence mean. Hence, the answers would depend on the definitions of what these two terms mean. (Actually we may also need to define or have a more or less common understanding of what do means, for in its declarative form the sentence would not only be \u201cNothing exists,\u201d but could also be \u201cNothing does exist\u201d or it can even be \u201cThere is nothing which does the [act of] existing.\u201d) Anyway, I read some answers here, which I find confusing or confused. Big Bang Theory (at least the present so-called standard model) does not assert that everything came out of nothing. What it states is that the present notion of space and time must have begun around 13.6 million years ago, beyond which the current understanding of science is not yet able to explain (FYI: I am not a \u2018fan\u2019 of BBT, I am just trying to clarify.)Zero is not necessarily nothing. For instance, it is a specific point in the number line from which positive numbers follow to the right and negative numbers to rhe left. Zero degree celsius is not the absence of temperature nor of the Celsius measuring unit, it is in fact a specific amount of temperature or a specific point in the thermometer at which liquid water turns to ice.In philosophy, i.e., in materialism, matter is the substance of all things, which includes the non-matter physical entities in physics. Meanwhile energy can be construed as a property of matter.In physics, \u201cnothing comes out of nothing\u201d is but an expression of a law of thermodynamics, the conservation of mass and energy.Now, I know I have not answered the question, but I hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "nothing is a compound of no and thing. so we enter the debate on fundamental nature of\u2026. noumena is a state \u201cwhere\u201d no \u201cthing\u201d exists. This statement assumes that thing = matter and that no-thing = no-matter. We know from Einstein that matter is equitable to energy and represents some form of it. So Noumena can be seen as a state of quiescent energy not producing but capable of producing any-thing. This puts your question of, \u201cDoes nothing exist?\u201d as a oxymoron if we accept that \u201cexist\u201d equates to matter as opposed to no-matter (doesn\u2019t exist). If we can accept that all matter and the observable cosmos are a mixed bag of matter and energies, perhaps the analogy of Phenomena and Noumena are graceful binary and define the two states of matter and non-matter (energy). Therefore nothing, (Noumena) is by virtue of not existing, extant. Threefold Lotus Kwoon Core Teachings of Buddha ",
