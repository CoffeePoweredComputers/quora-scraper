            "answer_text": "Your  quote is highly out of context.  The full quote is: Belief is the death of intelligence. As soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort, or assumes certitude, one stops thinking about that aspect of existence.\u201d Robert Anton Wilson quotes What he is saying is that absolute certainty that you know the right answer stops you from thinking creatively and intelligently about the question. Note that its not religous belief, in specific he is talking about. His critque extends to those who believe with absolute certainty in scientific answers to questions:  Wilson also criticized scientific types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in theirfanaticism. In a 1988 interview, when asked about his newly published book The New Inquisition: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science, Wilson commented: \"I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I wrote this book because I got tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them. They're actually dogmatically committed to what they were taught when they were in college...\"[24] Robert Anton Wilson SO yes.  HE is absolutely right. But what I suspect you thought the quote was saying, no, is quite wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "I think he's touching on something Marcello Truzzi mentioned about dogmatism in all of its forms, whether it's religious or secular-based. Truzzi is the person who made the famous statement 'extraordinary beliefs require extraordinary evidence', but he later recanted this after he felt that many self-described sceptics and orthodox intellectuals were nothing more than debunkers and not the truth seekers all people should be. I think both people here were criticizing a phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance, where people with dogmatic beliefs reject information that makes them feel uncomfortable.  I have my own issue with belief being criticized regardless of the reasons behind it. Ultimately all information we process, and all knowledge we obtain results from our metaphors. By restricting our thought process we're in a sense hindering our own development. I think the key here,  and what Wilson was touching on, is to be open-minded enough to accept that we all could be wrong about anything since to claim one has absolute knowledge is an irrational concept. Even agnosticism should not be immune to scrutiny either since I find the notion of never being able to know something is a form of absolutism itself. ",
