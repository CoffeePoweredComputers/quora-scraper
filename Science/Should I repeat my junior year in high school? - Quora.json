            "answer_text": "That would be a question for your guidance counselor to answer. It depends on what your junior year has been like that makes you consider it and what types of laws your state has regarding credits and attendance to allow you to graduate. Schools want you to graduate with the class you started out with and so should you. Sometimes that simply isn\u2019t possible and you just have to roll with it. If you failed classes, you may only have to make up a semester to get enough credits to straighten out those failed classes, you don\u2019t necessarily have to do the whole year over\u2026 just the semester for the class(es) that didn\u2019t meet the mark. Perhaps summer school is an option? If Attendance has been an issue, ask about credit recovery, find out if it is part of your school district\u2019s policy. You might be able to stay after school, work at fund raisers, do community service to get that time made up. Again, depends on the district\u2019s policy. There\u2019s also the standardized tests\u2026 those lovely fill in the bubble tests that make everything scream to a halt for one week. Pass those as soon as you are able so you are allowed to graduate. You don\u2019t have to re-do a school year, you just have to retake the tests if you don\u2019t score high enough. Please make an appointment Monday with your guidance counselor so you can come up with a plan. Don\u2019t just sit back and let things happen to you. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to ask a counselor in your high school about this because they know or can find out about your circumstances and why you're asking about this. They should be able to give you a good response to this question because that's why they are there, to guide and direct students in their school life. ",
