            "answer_text": "Water and air, or liquid and gas, are similar by their property of fluidity. They have no fixed shape on their own. They take on the shape of the vessel they fill. A difference would be that gas fills it's container completely, but liquid (at a fixed pressure and temperature) has a constant volume, so it only fills that volume of it's container. ",
