            "answer_text": "In our chemical reactions we have heard about the catalysts which are known for their supernatural powers which can make any reaction faster or slower without changing its own chemical properties\u2026 In biochemistry also there is a protein which can also act like catalyst are called the enzymes..the enzyme has similar properties as like the catalysts and one thing to be remembered catalysts are selective as like the enzymes which means that a particular type of enzyme/catalyst can catalyse only one type of reaction.. In enzyme catalysis there are two parts for obtaining the product.. one is substrate and another one is enzyme..at the initial step the enzyme and substrate forms a intermediate ENZYME-SUBSTRATE compound which then degrades to give the desired product and the enzyme back..in this case enzyme helps to decrease the energy of the activation of the transition state for product formation.. The kinetics of the enzyme catalysis are studied from which is known as the MICHLES-MENTEN\u2019s equation.. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of different enzymes and they have different mechanism. Generally, organic reaction is involved. This may include nucleophilic addition, electrophilic addition , Nucleophilic substitution etc. Here is a proposed mechanism of how Aspartic protease work. Protease basically cleave the amide bonds that is present in protein. In this mechanism, the carbonic acid abstracts hydrogen from water molecule. The hydroxyl ion can then perform nucleophillic attack on carbonyl group. The proton that was initially abstracted from water then protonates the amine group. This causes the amine to split from the carboxyl group.  Here is another example In TCA cycle, there is an enzyme called aconitase that catalyzes citrate to cis-aconitate and subsequently to isocitrate. The enzymatic action is done by the following amino acids:- 1) His-101 (Histidine at position 101) - abstracts and holds the hydroxyl group (OH) and hydroxylate substrate after substrate is flipped. 2) Asp-100 (Aspartic acid at position 100) - stabilizes His-101 2) Ser-642 (Serine at positione 642) - interacts with carbonyl group (COO-) thereby holding the substrate in place. 3) Arg-580 (Arginine at position 580) - abstracts proton from substrate and protonates the substrate after substrate is flipped The enzyme aconitase basically rearranges the position of hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen group in the substrate to a less sterically hindered position.   For other enzymes in TCA cycle, read here http://crystal.res.ku.edu/taksno... Here is some available from wikipedia.. This one is on action of ricin on ribosome:RicinPyruvate dehydrogenaseOxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexLanosterol synthase",
