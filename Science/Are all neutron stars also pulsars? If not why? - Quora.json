            "answer_text": "A neutron star is the result of a huge star collapsing. So, imagine a star as large as Earth\u2019s orbit, suddenly being compacted down to the size of a large city - from millions of miles across, to 30. Like an iceskater pulling in her arms during a spin, the star\u2019s rotation speed increases as it shrinks - from perhaps 1 rotation every 30 days, to dozens or hundreds per second. Neutron stars have intense magnetic fields (in fact, some are called \u2018magnetars\u2019 when they first collapse because of the intense field\u2026) the poles of the star\u2019s magnetic field may not lie on the rotational poles of the star - and, that field accelerates ions and creates a sweeping beam of radiation as it spins. Then, like a light house, the beam of radiation can sweep past the Earth - and, we detect it as a very regular, fast pulse of electromagnetic energy. The first pulsar was found by Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who was analyzing radio telescope data; she named it \u201cLGM-1\u201d for Little Green Man, because it was thought that such a regular pulse at exact timing could only be from an artificial source. But - as it turns out - it\u2019s a former star, about 30 miles across, spinning *very* rapidly\u2026 Not all neutron stars appear as pulsars; if Earth isn\u2019t in the sweeping radio burst range, then we wouldn\u2019t hear the rapid beeping of pulses. If the neutron star\u2019s pole were pointed at or near the Earth, the magnetic fields creating the pulses wouldn\u2019t push that energy toward us. ",

            "answer_text": "Beware, all pulsars are neutron stars BUT all neutron stars are not pulsars! We refer only those neutron stars as pulsars whose electromagnetic beam points towards the Earth. Pulsars are neutron stars emitting electromagnetic radiation along their magnetic poles, which manifest themselves as periodic pulses observed by us using ground based observatories or satellites. There may be many such neutron stars whose electromagnetic beam does not point towards the Earth at all!  Another, possibility is that some of them may emit very weak electromagnetic signal and still point towards the Earth but cannot be detected as their signal is much weaker than our current instruments can detect!

Here\u2019s why: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that produce electromagnetic radiation in beams that emanate from their magnetic poles. As the neutron stars rotate, If these beams are pointed towards Earth, they seem to \u2018pulse\u2019 \u2013 as seen from Earth - and hence the name. So it depends on which way the energy beams are pointing. ",
