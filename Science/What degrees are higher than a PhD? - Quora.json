            "answer_text": "There have been a bunch of good answers on here, but I feel a need to write a compact summary. So here it is: There are different systems of what degrees are called, which ones come after which others, and what\u2019s involved in earning each one. These vary between different parts of the world, and sometimes between universities and fields. As I read it, they mostly seem pretty similar in spirit, but I can only speak from direct experience about the U.S. system, especially in the sciences. Unless I say otherwise, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.It depends what you mean by higher. In the sense of \u201cwhat degree can a person go to school for after getting their PhD to learn and demonstrate an even greater mastery of their subject?\u201d the answer is none. The basic progression (for a PhD) in the US goes \u201cBA/BS \u2192 MA/MS \u2192 PhD\u201d and then there\u2019s no further to go. It\u2019s a terminal degree. That doesn\u2019t mean you know all there is to know about your field at the end of your PhD, but in your particular precise area(s) of interest you should be the world\u2019s leading expert. You\u2019re expected to be able to figure out what you don\u2019t know, find whatever answers are out there, and learn them. \u201cHigher\u201d might also mean the most prestigious, the most qualified, in some sense \u201cthe best.\u201d In that case, there will often be higher degrees. The PhD is a research degree. A person with a PhD is (supposed to be) good at creating new knowledge. They\u2019re good at learning, they\u2019re good at analyzing the world and what we know about it, finding things we don\u2019t know (or things we think we know, but there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re wrong about) and finding the answers. They\u2019re good at evaluating, communicating, critiquing, and verifying ideas. They\u2019re good at figuring out what the important underlying phenomena and issues are in a lot of situations. Not everyone with the degree is as good at all of those things all the time as they might like, but they\u2019re representative skills (according to me). I think that\u2019s all awesome. I\u2019m pro-research and I\u2019m pro-PhD. But those are not the only skills that matter, and in non-research settings, other skills and knowledge can be really important. One of my doctors is an MD/PhD, and the MD is definitely the degree that matters the most to me.There are some \u201chigher doctorate\u201d degrees that are more like lifetime achievement awards. Examples are Doctor of Science (DSc) and Doctor of Letters (DLitt). You donI\u2019ve never encountered any of these in memorable way in a decade+ in academia (in the US and US-centric, English language, international research), but it sounds like they\u2019re more common in Europe.In a similar vein, there are a variety of forms of recognition bestowed by other organizations in one\u2019s field. For example, I\u2019m a computer scientist, and our primarily research organization, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), awards the title of \u201cFellow of the ACM\u201d to particularly impactful researchers [About ACM Fellows]. It\u2019s not a degree, but if someone\u2019s e-mail signature says \u201cProf. Something, PhD , ACM Fellow\u201d that definitely suggests a higher level than just the \u201cPhD\u201d part.Some professions follow completely different sequences. In Law, the Juris Doctor (JD) is the standard \u201cpractitioner working in the field\u201d degree, and the Master of Laws (LLM) is a higher, more specialized degree. The most PhD-like degree is Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) (according to Types of Law Degrees).That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the terms used in describing a PhD (or other designation for a doctorate, such as EdD, DM, DBA, etc.) is terminal degree. This does not mean that it\u2019s the end of your education, but it does mean that you\u2019ve mastered a body of knowledge, and what\u2019s left is research, consulting, and expanding the body of knowledge in the field of study. This means that there is nothing \u201chigher than a PhD\u201d other than recognition for discoveries, a body of work, or admission to societies that promote common interests. In some fields, licensing or certification may exist, but these are also available (generally) to those with bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees, too. In the latter category, I am thinking of licensed professional engineers. On the other hand, there are bar exams for lawyers and medical boards for medical doctors that allow those professionals to practice their chosen career. In these cases, the doctorate (JD and MD) are required for admission to that club. ",
