            "answer_text": "The green skin of banana contains a gaseous plant hormone, ethylene, which diffuses into the fruit and hastens the process of ripening. It is yellow when the fruit is ripe and turns black with the production of more and more ethylene. The large number of enzymes of Kreb\u2019s cycle convert citric acid, mallic acid and oxalic acid into glucose in a banana, to make it sweet during the process of ripening. When the banana is kept in the refrigerator, the enzymatic reactions are stopped by the cold but the production of ethylene hormone continues. This turns its skin black. ",

This enzyme also know as PPO, polymerises the naturally occurring polyphenols present in the banana skin. This is a chemical reaction that takes place in the presence of oxygen. ",
