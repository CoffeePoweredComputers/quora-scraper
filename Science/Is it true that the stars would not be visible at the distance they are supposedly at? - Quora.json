            "answer_text": "Nope. The apparent magnitude of the Sun is -26.74. The apparent magnitude of the brightest star seen from Earth other than the Sun, Sirius, is -1.46. This is an apparent magnitude difference of 25.28. Brightness increases by [math]\\sqrt [5] {100} = 2.51188643151 [/math]times for every decrease in one magnitude. Therefore, the Sun is [math]2.51188643151 ^ {25.28} = 12941958414.6[/math] (~13 billion) times brighter than Sirius in Earth\u2019s sky. Now, light\u2014along with other electromagnetic forces and gravity\u2014decreases in its intensity by the square of its distance. This variance is called the Inverse-square law.  The Inverse-square law in action. Sirius has a luminosity of 25.4 times that of the Sun, so at a distance of 1 AU\u2014that is, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun\u2014it should be 25.4 times as bright as the Sun. So, how far would the star have to be in order to be [math]12941958414.6 \\times 25.4 = 328725743731[/math] (~329 billion) times dimmer than seen at 1 AU? Simply square root that number in order to find the (approximate) answer. [math]\\sqrt {328725743731} = 573346.094197[/math] (57 thousand) AU, or 9.066039362881796 (9.1) light-years. This value is extremely close to the measured value of 8.6 light-years. Repeat the same procedure for pretty much any other star, and you will get similar results. And we know those stars really are that far away. This is because that stars have a parallax, like any other object in the universe. Shift your position, and you will see a corresponding shift in the object\u2019s location.  Parallax on an astronomical scale. Obviously, this is greatly out of proportion. Only for stars, we\u2019re not talking about shifting your head and seeing a noticeable change, we are talking about waiting up to a year to have the Earth swing hundreds of millions of kilometers around its orbit and detecting, with precision telescopes, mere fractions of an angular second of change. Think of that\u2014traveling hundreds of millions of kilometers and having an object only change in position by less than 1/3600th of a degree!!! This can only be explained by stars being that far away. ",
