            "answer_text": "First of all, according to Thermodynamics, heat transfer takes place only if there\u2019s a temperature difference and heat transfers from higher to lower temperature. When an object is cooled, what is actually happening is that heat is transferred from the object to the surrounding medium, So, consider a fixed volume vessel, with gas molecules present in it. The gas is at a high temperature. Now let the vessel be brought in contact with a lower temperature medium, the molecules lose their kinetic energy in the form of heat energy to the surrounding medium. ",

            "answer_text": "Cooling is nothing but the reduction in the temperature of a body. Temperature is the measure of internal energy which comprises the sum of the kinetic energy , potential energy, rotational energy, transitional energy as well as vibrational energy of the constituent particles/molecules/atoms or ions. So the cooling of the system can be done by withdrawing energy from the system either in the form of heat or in the form of work which comes from the above mentioned internal energy(energy can be converted fron one form to another). AS you are subtracting(withdrawing) some energy, the internal energy reduces and by the law of conservation of energy the withdrawn internal energy converts into the heat(transfered to another body or surroundings) or work (expansion, to run motor, to lift some weight etc). Hence as per ur question, the kinetic energy along with portions of all other molecular energy, gets converted into the heat or work and leave the body and gets transfered to another body or surroundings.
