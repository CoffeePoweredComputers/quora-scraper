            "answer_text": "This is a way that helped me win more at love, work, school, and life in general I focused on myself, always improving, and getting validation from myself, not others. In early High School, I saw and met a lot of people. Some tried to get girl and focused on that, but always seemed to come up short or have the relationship fail. Some people wanted to get good grades, but once they got the marks they wanted, they stoped trying to get smarter and their grades slipped, or they only did it to impress people, but once they found out people didn't honestly care, their grades reverted to not so good. People either focused on something, but couldn't put in enough energy to it 24/7 and failed, or did it for the validation from others and when they didn't get it immediately or at all, they gave up, since they had no motivation. The people I knew who had healthy relationships, good grades, or were good at something all had two traits: They always wanted to improve and they got motivation and joy from themselves, not others. I decided that I wanted to be better than I was, and once I got it rolling, I kept it rolling. I almost always got all A\u2019s while taking the honors and AP classes, I went from a reclusive person to a socialite, and I even got girls, which I honestly didn't see myself doing before. TL;DR; I put my effort into improving always and learned to seek validation from myself, and not others. That made my life seem to be more manageable and easy. ",
