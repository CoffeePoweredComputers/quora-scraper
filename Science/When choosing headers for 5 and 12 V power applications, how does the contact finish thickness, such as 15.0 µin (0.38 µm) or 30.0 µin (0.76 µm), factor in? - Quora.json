            "answer_text": "It depends on how many times the connector with be plugged and unplugged. The contacts have a spring tension that keeps the material in contact with the mating piece (usually a solid post). Each time the contacts wipe against each other under force, some of the material is rubbed away. Contacts with 15 uin or 30 uin implies gold flash. Gold flash is somewhat hard, but can still rub away. Having a thicker finish thickness will allow for more mating cycles. Another concern with connector contacts is fretting. This the wear that occurs between two contacting surfaces during vibration. Having more gold will allow the contacts to have more durability to fretting. Why not make all contacts thick with gold? Gold is expensive. So if your application does not require many mating cycles or has low vibration, a lower thickness saves money. ",
