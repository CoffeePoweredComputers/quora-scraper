            "answer_text": "I'd say it really depends on the field and the associated learning curve. I'm majoring in chemical engineering and biotechnology. That sounds like it would take a lot of learning to get started, but I was emailing professors asking about research the week before I started my freshman year. By a mix of luck and persistence, one of them accepted me right off the bat on my high school credentials (national merit scholar, AP tested out of my entire freshman year coursework) and I've been working with him for two years now. My first year was almost entirely training, and it was slow going. The grad students didn't really take me seriously, but as long as I stayed attentive to sterile technique, they let me culture the cells they needed. This last year the PI gave me my own project, improving a biomaterials process that had partially failed before. I've been working on it ever since, putting in 40 hours a week this summer and at least 10 a week during the last semester. It's been slow, occasionally frustrating work, but I've learned a lot as an undergraduate student pursuing a relatively independent research project. I'm confident that I want to do research as a career. ",

            "answer_text": "I say it's best to start as soon as possible and learn as you go. The worse that could happen is to see that you just haven't learned enough yet to keep up. On the other hand, this is a great chance to learn what research is like and to challenge yourself to see how well you can understand advanced material and self-study. I have a similar experience in that I was asked by a mathematics professor to work as a research assistant  for his research on mathematical fluid dynamics. I had only linear algebra under my belt at that time, but my linear teacher vouched for me as a bright student and landed me this great chance to see what math research was like and to see how my skills would fare. At first, pretty much everything went over my head, as we were working with partial differential equations. Even after studying a textbook on the necessary material for a week, it was really hard to understand even just what the equations modeled. However, with continual work, I eventually came to understand his research and became capable of conducting independent inquiry. It was kinda breathtaking when I was able to show the results I had discovered to him without any errors or misunderstanding of the mathematics or physics involved. So I would definitely give it a try! It showed me what research was like and greatly advanced both my knowledge of mathematics and my appreciation for it ",
