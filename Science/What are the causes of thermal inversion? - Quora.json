            "answer_text": "Thermal inversions occur when a warmer air or water mass moves over a cooler one. Since warm air is less dense than cool air, this condition restricts the vertical mixing of the air due to any cooler air not being able to rise through it (It inhibits convection). Even hot exhaust gases near ground lever will cool as they passes through the cooler air, and will/may not penetrate into the warmer air. An example of this can be seen in Denver, Co and Los Angeles California. In L.A., one of the causes of this condition is when the warm desert air rides over the mountains and above the cooler coastal area and essentially put a lid on top of the city. Meteorologically, high air pressure aids in this process as well. This is not to be confused with the famous Santa Ana winds that can blow off the desert into the L.A. Basin, and flush out the area. The mountains that surrounds much of the L.A. basin are a major contributor to this condition as well. They help lock in the stagnant air, much as valleys can do in other areas. Or, this condition can occur when the cooler air just above the ocean water rolls into the hotter city area and creates a thermal inversion layer. Just as an interesting side note, the already hot air off the desert can be compressed as it drops into the lower altitudes of the coastal areas. This causes further heating. The highest recorded temperature in the U.S. is 134 degree (Death Valley, CA). However, before that, the record was 133 degrees\u2026. and it was in the coastal area of Santa Barbara, California. It was due to the hot compress air coming off the desert and flowing out to sea. That record had stood for 75 years. ",
