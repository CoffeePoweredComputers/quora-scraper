            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a key point that ought to help people understand the other answers. Molecules of different gasses take up the same amount of space at typical temperatures and pressures. That\u2019s why you can compare their masses. I\u2019ll repeat that two ways: First, if you have a liter of oxygen, and a liter of carbon dioxide, both at room temperature and pressure, they will have the same number of molecules in them. Second, in chemistry, the number of molecules of a compound are counted in moles. A mole is 6.o2 x 10^23 (that last part is 23 zeroes). One mole of carbon dioxide has 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of CO2. One mole of oxygen has 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of oxygen. One mole of either gas takes up 22.4 liters at room temperature at sea level. when scientists were first figuring out that there were many elements, and that the difference between elements had to do with atoms, some of the first work was done with gasses. Hydrogen was the lightest element, so it got an atomic mass of one. Oxygen was 16 times heavier, so it got an atomic mass of 16. ",

            "answer_text": "In Chemistry we usually equate the \u201cheaviness\u201d of something by it\u2019s mass. Just know that the concept of heaviness includes gravity and mass. Since I assume you are on earth, I am going to ignore gravity and assume what is meant by your question is mass. In short \u201cheaviness\u201d = mass.   Above are the Periodic Symbols for the following calculations. Carbon Dioxide\u2019s formula being CO2 I am therefore going to use the Atomic Mass of Carbon as 12.011 + the Atomic Mass for Oxygen 15.9994 twice, because you have 2 atoms of Oxygen in CO2, 12.011 + 15.9994 + 15.9994 your total mass for CO2 would be 44.0098 For Atmospheric Oxygen, formula being O2, I only need to multiply the Atomic mass by 2 and I get 31.9988 Your answer is therefore CO2, the \u201cheavier\u201d of the two molecules.
