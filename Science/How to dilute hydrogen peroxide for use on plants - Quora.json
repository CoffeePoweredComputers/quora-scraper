            "answer_text": "For use on plants in what way? If you are using H2O2 on an aquatic plant, the common drugstore dilution of 3% can be used as is, but only for a short time, perhaps 60 seconds of soaking at most. If you diluted 3% H2O2 by half with water, you could soak plants for two minutes instead of one, but many aquatic plants will melt away to nothing if exposed to H2O2 even for a few seconds. It can be useful but, there are risks because it is a powerful oxidizer. If you\u2019re talking about terrestrial plants, I\u2019ve never heard of using H2O2 on them, for any reason, though it might well kill mould or mildew. If it\u2019s for mould or mildew on some plant\u2019s leaves, I\u2019d use baking soda instead, which is safer and I know it works well for this. Mix one teaspoon baking soda with one quart water and spray on affected leaves. Knocks down the fruiting bodies of many moulds, including powdery mildew, and does no harm at this strength. ",
