            "answer_text": "For one, the over-consumption of space to create a computer!But he was the pioneer computing, starting with the creation of Difference Engines and Analytical Engines. Difference engines are so called because of the mathematical principle on which they are based, namely, the method of finite differences. The beauty of the method is that it uses only arithmetical addition and removes the need for multiplication and division which are more difficult to implement mechanically. Difference engines are strictly calculators. They crunch numbers the only way they know how - by repeated addition according to the method of finite differences. They cannot be used for general arithmetical calculation. The Analytical Engine is much more than a calculator and marks the progression from the mechanized arithmetic of calculation to fully-fledged general-purpose computation. Aside from a few partially complete mechanical assemblies and test models of small working sections, none of Babbage's designs was physically realized in its entirety in his lifetime. Many of the small experimental assemblies survived, as does a comprehensive archive of his drawings and notebooks. The designs for Babbage's vast mechanical computing engines rank as one of the startling intellectual achievements of the 19th century. It is only in recent decades that his work has been studied in detail and that the extent of what he accomplished becomes increasingly evident. ",

            "answer_text": "Babbage developed a machine called the difference engine (part of which is actually working at the computer museum in California). It was, by today\u2019s standards, a very simplistic computer operated mechanically rather than electronically and thus MUCH slower than today\u2019s computers. He actually had a programmer named Ada Lovelace, who is recognized as the world\u2019s first software developer. The programming language ADA was named after her, but the language was not used for very long, mainly because it came to be associated with the department of defense during the Vietnam war and anything associated with the military at that time tended to be shunned by a lot of young people. It was actually quite a good language. ",
