            "answer_text": "Good answer, Mike! The only thing I would add is that many people outside of engineering fields do not realize that the ozone layer is not a \"static\" thing.  Ozone is constantly being created by ultraviolet light striking O2 molecules, and constantly being destroyed by the same process. There is a certain concentration of oxygen at the upper altitudes, and a certain level of UV coming in. The two interact, creating ozone and reducing the UV that gets through in the process. Thus, there is an \"equilibrium\" set up. But it is not simply this static \"ozone layer\" that just \"stops the ultraviolet rays\". There is a dynamic process or \"dance\" constantly going on, where ozone is constantly being used up and replaced, while UV rays are constantly being absorbed by ozone in the process.  What chlorofluorocarbons (CCF's) do is to drift into the upper stratosphere, where they become participants in the complex chemistry that forms ozone and absorbs UV rays. This accelerates the decomposition rate, and thus reduces the \"equilibrium ozone concentration\", even with the same amount of UV rays hitting the upper atmosphere. With lower concentrations of ozone, more of the UV radiation is able to penetrate deeper into the lower atmosphere. More of it will thus reach the surface (and us).  So, people need not worry that there is this static \"ozone layer\", that is being damaged so that, once it's gone, we will all get scorched by ultraviolet light. The ozone is made from atomic oxygen. (O3, instead of O2). But when we stop using CCF's (in our deoderant, and as coolant in our cars, etc.), then it will eventually be flushed out of the upper atmosphere. When it's gone, the \"equilibrium concentration of ozone\" should eventually climb back up to its previous levels. ",

            "answer_text": "First we need to know the reason for Ozone depletion. Ozone depletion occurs when chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\u2014formerly found in aerosol spray cans and refrigerants\u2014are released into the atmosphere. These gases, through several chemical reactions, cause the ozone molecules to break down, reducing ozone's ultraviolet (UV) radiation-absorbing capacity. While the vast majority of Ozone depletion substances usage is either industrial or commercial, there is no \u2018EASY WAY\u2019 we can prevent this. At the government level, there are international treaties aimed at saving the ozone layer. Like - in September 1987, an international treaty known as the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, was signed in Montreal, Canada. The Protocol requires the phasing out of the Ozone depletion substances in accordance with agreed schedules. Just a few months ago (in March 2017) India launched the second stage of its plan to phase out Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), greenhouse gases that damage the earth\u2019s ozone layer. It is estimated that with this plan, there would be a net direct CO2-equivalent emission reductions of about 8.5 million metric tonnes annually from 2023. Notwithstanding all that, you and I can help in the following ways: Buy air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment that do not use HCFCs as refrigerant. Buy aerosol products that do not use HCFCs or CFCs as propellants. Conduct regular inspection and maintenance of air-conditioning and refrigeration appliances to prevent and minimize refrigerant leakage. Dispose of pre-1995 refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioning units properly. These devices use chlorofluorocarbons to function, so leaks release the chemical into the atmosphere. When your car\u2019s air-conditioners needs servicing, check with the workshop and make sure that the refrigerants are properly recovered and recycled instead of being vented to the atmosphere. (If the mechanics do not know, we need to educate them) If you are an industrialist or in business, you may be using fire-extinguishers. Check to see if \u201chalon\u201d or \u201chalogenated hydrocarbon\u201d is the main ingredient, if so, find a hazardous waste center at which to dispose it properly. Replace it with a model without this harmful ozone-depleting chemical. Do not buy or use any product that is treated with Methyl Bromide - some fancy furniture makers use this for treating the wood used. Go ORGANIC! Chemical fertilizers are by far the largest human source of nitrous oxide production, and this gas is now the prime culprit in depleting the ozone layer. Organic farming works two ways - better quality food is produced, and reducing nitrous oxide production. Even if you are not a farmer, you can look for organically grown food stuff - and when the demand increases, more and more farmers will go \u2018green\u2019. If you get an opportunity to talk to farmers, enlighten them about organic farming. Most people do not know about the dangers of ozone depletion; if you are in a Rotary Club or Lions Club, arrange for lectures on the subject. You can talk on the subject in schools. Only when more people know about this will there be any support for any plans the state has for ozone depletion. Further reading: Ozone Layer Protection ",
