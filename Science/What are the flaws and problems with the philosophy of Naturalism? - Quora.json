            "answer_text": "Naturalism does not have many problems. Whatever Naturalism opposes, is only very vaguely defined to begin with - ghosts, fairies, gods. If we had a good physical, medical and taxonomic definitions of these, they would be accepted by naturalism! Yet, naturalist position is not unshakable. Naturalism can reject self-contradictory entities, such as divine consciousness that does not contain any matter, because consciousness can only be observed in matter. But if an entity is non-contradictory, there is a physical way that ghosts can exist for example in dark matter, then naturalism is wrong to say that such thing can never exist. It is a mistake, because we can almost never prove a negative like that. The weakness of Naturalism is scientism. Science changes all the time and pushes boundaries of what does \u201cnatural\u201d mean. A few centuries ago, relativist and quantum claims or even radio technology and computer simulation would be considered supernatural, because it would be impossible to describe them within the framework of what passed for science back then. This makes Naturalism philosophically uncertain - less certain that two plus two equal four. This is why Naturalists usually say that the burden of proof lies on whoever comes forward with the claim for or against the existence of ghosts, etc. If you want to oppose Naturalism, you\u2019d better assume the position of Hylozoism, Panpsychism or even Pantheism.

            "answer_text": "The inherent problem (which leads to more problems) I can find is that rather than just state that God doesn\u2019t exist, it also denies the possibility altogether. As a logical atheist, I find this a bit heathenistic. There has actually never been enough evidence to disprove God. The notion is logically ignored due to its arbitrariness, as anyone can come out with something that has no evidence and simply say \u201cProve me wrong.\u201d The result of this denial can and logically will eliminate reason and rationality from society, mainly scientists. Rather than leave it to the individual scientist to use his reason and rationality to prioritise how much time he spends on nature and how much he delves into the unknown, takes away part of his thinking for his individual life. This can create a type of collectivism. By premise, as I\u2019ve read that naturalism encourages, this leads to altruism (sacrificing the self for the good of the collective, being immoral to yourself, and therefore, contradicting itself.) By thinking collectively, other collective ways of thinking are going to occur subconsciously if not consciously, like racism and shyness you can argue that shyness in itself is not a problem worth mentioning, but it actually is because of the ripple effect a collective way of thinking has). One leads to all the others. As you can\u2019t think collectively and individually at the same time, as this is a contradiction, and therefore, wrong (right has no contradictions). You may achieve it consciously, but subconsciously your actions will show otherwise. On a good note. It\u2019s anti-subjectivism which I will never argue against being an Objectivist. But I find its objective ethics misbegotten. ",

            "answer_text": "The supernatural is not allowed by naturalism unless we have some means of detecting it (which we don\u2019t). At the same time, absolute certainty is not warranted by naturalism because humans are not privy to physical reality. These are not \u201cflaws\u201d or \u201cproblems\u201d so much as (regretable) realities. All human experience and knowledge is empirical in origin: we can only experience through our senses. Perceived reality is merely a facsimile of physical reality. Not only do we not have direct access to the supernatural (if it exists) . . . we don\u2019t have direct access to the natural either. Everything is filtered through our senses. We can\u2019t see telescopically or microscopically. The humanly visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum is ridiculously limited; as is our auditory and olfactory senses. And to top it all off, our brains create mental constructs for the sake of convenience instead of accuracy. When human perception is so capricious, we can\u2019t rule anything out. But we shouldn\u2019t rule anything \u201cin\u201d without valid evidence. After all, if the supernatural exists but is undetectable, it\u2019s really irrelevant to us. Naturalism\u2019s reliance on empirical evidence is the essence of intellectual integrity and lies at the heart of agnosticism and atheism. There\u2019s no reason or need to accept claims without empirical evidence. Or, put another way, discernment is not possible without empirical evidence: therefore, faith, by definition, lacks discernment and is antithetical to naturalism. ",
