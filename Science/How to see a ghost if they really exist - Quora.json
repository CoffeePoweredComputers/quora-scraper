See, our field of vision is on visible light range only and these energies manifest or produce apparition in region which aren't in visible range!. Research shows they mostly show them or show apparition in ultraviolet region! So to see in ultraviolet region we need full spectrum camera! We have got many many apparition and pics of ghost and other stuffs which are paranormal! We have shared them either on our website or on our fb page! So yeah! this is how you can see them! Use a full spectrum camera! We got many pic on this case also! We have solved many cases one of them are - One of such cases are as follows :- We have got a summery of a case solved by us, A short summary of a case solved by IPTA client claimed some paranormal activities at their residence. The IPT members went to investigate the place. The spiritual department member went in and investigated all the rooms, the upper floor and the balcony. They sensed the presence of a spirit in the upper flat of the building. The spirit was influencing the lower flat where the resident lived. The upper flat was empty and unsold for many years, subsequently, the IPT members stated it in their report along with some other minor issues like energy stagnation and the hotspots where the energies were found. Later on, the scientific department went in. The scientific department Used gadgets like EMF meter, also known as cell sensor Motion sensor, EVP recorders, Infrared thermometer along with cameras to get some apparitions.The IPT members got a spectacular class B-EVP in the recording. The data submitted by the spiritual and scientific department was verified and it was found that the reports written by both the departments were almost 95% identical. The motion sensors were activated at many places and they got tonnes of evidence and thus, the case was analysed, which brought IPT to a conclusion that as the place was haunted, It was affecting the residents. Consequently, there it was necessary to perform cleansing operation Consequently, there it was necessary to perform a cleansing operation in that area and thus meditation was performed by the team members. As reported by the team, there were a lot of distractions that tried to interrupt the process. They sensed a very tainted smell spread into the surrounding but even under such dire circumstances, the team managed to get through with the cleansing and kept their focus intact. At the end, there was a pleasant shift in the ambience of the place. They felt relief as the surroundings seemed much lighter and they didn\u2019t feel a looming pressure around them. In the final rung of the investigation, the team re-examined the place and to confirm the effects of the cleanse. It was concluded that the place wasn\u2019t haunted anymore. It was one of the many houses we solved cases of! so ghost do exist and you can find them everywhere ! many are allegedly many places are not but ghost or i can say there type of energies rather do exist !

            "answer_text": "This are the signs that your house could be haunted. The first step is to determine, as best you can, whether or not you truly have a legitimate case of a haunting. Not all hauntings are alike, and they may exhibit a variety of phenomena. Some hauntings feature a single phenomenon - such as a particular door slamming shut that occurs repeatedly - while others consist of many different phenomena, ranging from odd noises to full-blown apparitions.Here's a partial list of phenomena that might indicate that your house is haunted:  Unexplained noises - footsteps; knocks, banging, rapping; scratching sounds; sounds of something being dropped. Sometimes these noises can be subtle and other times they can be quite loud.Doors, cabinets and cupboards opening and closing - most often, these phenomena are not seen directly. The experiencer either hears the distinct sounds of the doors opening and closing (homeowners get to know quite well the distinctive sounds their houses make) or the experiencer will return to a room to find a door open or closed when they are certain that it was left in the opposite position. Sometimes furniture, like kitchen chairs, are perceived to have been moved. Very rarely will the experiencer actually witness the phenomenon taking place.Lights turning off and on - likewise, these events are seldom seen actually occurring, but the lights are switched on or off when the experiencer knows they were not left that way. This can also happen with TVs, radios and other electrically powered items.Items disappearing and reappearing - this phenomenon, which we have dubbed \"the DOPler Effect\" (DOP = Disappearing Object Phenomenon), has been examined in the article \"The DOPler Effect.\" Others have called this \"the borrowers\" phenomenon, and it's the familiar experience of not being able to find a regularly used item - say, your set of car keys - which you believe you placed in a spot you routinely place them. But they're gone and you look high and low for them with no success. Some time later, the keys are found - in exactly the place you normally put them. It's as if the object was borrowed by someone or something for a short time, then returned. Sometimes they are not returned for days or even weeks, but when they are, it's in an obvious place that could not have been missed by even a casual search.Unexplained shadows - the sighting of fleeting shapes and shadows, usually seen out of the corner of the eye. This phenomenon has also been discussed in some detail in\"Shadow People.\" Many times, the shadows have vaguely human forms, while other times they are less distinguishable or smaller.Strange animal behavior - a dog, cat or other pet behaves strangely. Dogs may bark at something unseen, cower without apparent reason or refuse to enter a room they normally do. Cats may seem to be \"watching\" something cross a room. Animals have sharper senses than humans, and many researchers think their psychic abilities might be more finely tuned also. (See \"Animals and Ghosts\" )Feelings of being watched - this is not an uncommon feeling and can be attributed to many things, but it could have a paranormal source if the feeling consistently occurs in a particular part of the house at a particular time.Those are some of the most common experiences of those who think their houses are haunted. Yet even stranger things can happen... to know if your house is haunted : The following phenomena are more rare, but could be stronger evidence of a haunting: Mild psychokinetic phenomena - hearing a door open or close is one thing. Actually seeing it happen is quite another. Similarly, actually seeing a light go on or off by itself is greater proof that something unexplained is happening. Do you see the TV or radio turn on? Or perhaps you're present when a child's powered toy begins to operate on its own. Doors and windows are locked or unlocked. Some people report that when they are in bed they can feel and/or hear something sitting on the bed.Feelings of being touched - the feeling of being watched is one thing, and actually feeling like you are being touched is quite another. Some people feel something brush past them, something touching their hair or \"a hand\" on the shoulder. Some feel a gentle poke, push or nudge.Cries and whispers - on occasion, muffled voices, whispering and crying can be heard. Sometimes it's music from some unknown source. People hear their names being said. This phenomenon, as is true for the one above, gains more credibility if more than one person hears or sees the same thing at the same time.Cold or hot spots - cold spots are classic haunting symptoms, but any instance of a noticeable variance in temperature without a discernable cause could be evidence.Unexplained smells - the distinct fragrance of a perfume or cologne that you do not have in your house. This phenomenon comes and goes without any apparent cause and may accompany other phenomena, such as shadows, voices or psychokinetic phenomena. Foul odors can happen in the same way.Moving or levitating objects (severe psychokinetic phenomena) - dinner plates sliding across the table; pictures flying off walls; doors slamming shut with great force; furniture sliding across the floor.Physical assault - scratches, slaps and hard shoves. This kind of personal assault is extremely rare, but obviously highly disturbing.Other physical evidence - unexplained writing on paper or walls; handprints and footprints.Apparitions - physical manifestation of a spirit or entity. These phenomena are also very rare and can take many forms: human-shaped mists or forming mists of some indistinguishable shape; transparent human forms that disappear quickly; and most rarely, human forms that look as real and solid as any living person, but that disappear into a room or even while being viewed.Source - 16 Signs That Might Prove Your House Is Haunted ",

            "answer_text": "Pictures.honestly I have had many paranormal experiences. One night, I was with my dad\u2026 we were going to the store, and I have a tendency to keep staring out of the car window . I looked behind us while my dad was driving away from the apartments (where we live) and under the hallway light to enter the apartment complex I clearly saw the shadow of a little boy holding some sort of toy . Then I turned around \u2026. 2 seconds from looking at him I quickly looked back at the place I saw the little boy\u2026. But he was gone by the time I looked back. I also have strange things happen in my house \u2026when my mom and I are alone the kitchen light turns on and off on and off 3 times and then the light goes back to normal. When I'm alone in my room things move and my puppy keeps staring and every door in my room as if she was seeing someone . I sometimes stay up at 3 to 6 in the morning and I hear tapping sounds in my walls I hear creaks in the house, and I start hearing noises outside of my window . I feel someone caress my face sometimes when I'm half asleep . And I feel some one breath on my neck when I'm laying down in bed as if someone were cuddling up behind me, but the thing is the presence doesn't feel dangerous. It feels almost as if it were the presence of a little kid. It feels warm, light and calm . I usually feel something cold touch my stomach when I'm about to sleep. At this point I have kind of gotten used to it \u2026 does anyone care to explain what it is or what it wants? ",

            "answer_text": "You can increase your chances of having a personal (subjective) experience by, first, concentrating on your intention or desire to see Spirit. It helps to be in a location that is known to be frequented, or inhabited, by an active energy (Spirit will find YOU, but an active, VERY TANGIBLE energy is easier to catch a glimpse of). A shadow figure is the Spirit form people see most often \u2014 that and \u201cSpirit Lights,\u201d or orbs, as they\u2019re commonly known. Skeptics are always \u201cde-bunking\u201d orbs on camera as being \u201cdust motes,\u201d but it\u2019s also quite common to actually SEE them in an active location (and sometimes the appearance of an orb will be followed by SPEECH and/or A SPIRIT SOUND \u2014 Think \u201cknocking,\u201d \u201crapping\u201d or \u201cfootsteps\u201d) \u2014 If you can\u2019t get to an active location (if nothing else, might try an overnight in a haunted hotel or B & B) \u2014 Be aware of any solid-looking, readily apparent faces you see when just settling down to sleep (note the person\u2019s features; As soon as possible, if you CAN, draw the face \u2014 or use one of the \u201cface builder\u201d apps (available for phones) to achieve the closest likeness) \u2014 Another good time to see Spirit is after first waking early in the morning, just before dozing into \u201csecond sleep,\u201d as it\u2019s referred to. **TIP FROM A LONG-TIME AUDIO RECORDING MEDIUM: If you visit a haunted hotel, do something that might be considered \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d Spirits LOVE to comment on things they find UNUSUAL!! Think of something to do that a living person would find \u201ceccentric;\u201d It\u2019s almost as if they can\u2019t KEEP themselves from BLURTING comments about odd situations (much like the living!)\u2026 If you\u2019re LUCKY, you might encourage a momentary materialization \u2014 just to give you THAT STERN LOOK OF DISCONTENT!!

In fact anyone can see a ghost unless they are blind. \u201cHow can we see them???\u201d Just go outside on a summer night and look up. You see a sky full of twinkling stars.Like this\u2026.  But the fact is some of those stars are ghosts. \u201cwhat the heck are you talking about???\u201d Yes, some of those stars died thousands of years back , but we still see them You saw a thing that don\u2019t really exist anymore in this world. You saw an apparition of a dead star. You just saw a ghost. Light from stars that are far away away takes years to reach earth. What we see everyday night is the light produced by the stars thousands of years ago. Every day you see the image of sun but it actually is how sun looked like 8 minutes ago. If a star 1000 light years away from earth died ,we wouldn\u2019t know about it until another 1000 years. So, all the stars that we see every day are not alive they died long time ago but they continue to linger around for a while as ghosts. Ohh\u2026 Did you ask about these ghosts???  Nah, I didn\u2019t see any of them. But I believe we can see them but there are certain conditions to be met. 1 > The person should completely stop being logical for the moment. 2 > He should become mentally vulnerable. 3 > He should love his life and didn\u2019t want to die. 4 > He should go to a haunted place alone.

Some equipment used by ghost hunters to see and catch ghosts are -  Still photography and video: using digital, night vision, infrared, and even disposable camerasTablet PC: to record data, audio, video and even environmental fluctuations such as electromagnetic fields.Ambient temperature measurement: using thermographic cameras, thermal imaging cameras, infrared thermometer, and other infrared temperature sensors.EMF meter: to detect possibly unexplained fluctuations in electromagnetic fields.Digital and analog audio recording: to capture any unexplained noises and electronic voice phenomena (EVPs), that may be interpreted as disembodied voices.Compass: some ghost hunters use a compass to determine the location of paranormal spots, similar to EMFsGieger counter: to measure fluctuations in radiation.Infrared and/or ultrasonic motion sensors: to detect possible anomalous movement within a given area, or to assist in creating a controlled environment where any human movement is detected.Air quality monitoring equipment: to assess the levels of gases such as carbon monoxide, which are thought to contribute to report paranormal activity.Infrasound monitoring equipment: to assess the level of sound vibrations.Dowsing rods: usually constructed of brass and bent into an L-shape",

            "answer_text": "If there was a simple, reliable way more people would believe in ghosts. Your best bet may be to look for groups that either collect local lore or actively visit supposedly haunted locations. That's still no guarantee. Some people simply never can see for whatever reason. I rarely see anything with my actual eyes. I expect to see things and many times those who can see confirm it is what they see. Most often the air just feels thicker and like there's an electric charge to it. Others feel cold or heat or tingles. Much of the time ghosts are unaware of their state so even if you find one if will be incapable of acknowledging you. While nothing is scientifically proven, there are a lot of people who have noticed seeming patterns that imply different types of ghosts. It may be wise to look into this and collect some information on the jargon before you do much more looking. What you want to meet is a sentient ghost but most of what you'll find are imprints. Not really ghosts so much as projections of past habitual behavior. Someone walking down a hall or sitting in their favorite chair. The theories behind all of it are fascinating and make for good reading. A local ghost hunting group will likely let you tag along if you're serious about it and not just looking to make fun of them. They should be able to help you find out whether you are capable of seeing anything. ",

When you\u2019re looking for ghosts, or spirits, you may very well see one. There\u2019s alot of room below our ceilings, and above our heads, where they seem to have the space to hang out. But it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule. I\u2019ve seen the golden orbs, as have been documented in pictures. They kept me awake all night one time. I wondered if my brass bed, with the round globe-type finials around on my bedposts, eight of them, had maybe attracted them. Or maybe that\u2019s what I was lookin\u2019 at! All night! Sometimes there\u2019s no getting rid of ghosts. Other times they show up when you least expect one. Indoors, a ghost can be clearly observed, and if they take human form, rather than that floating misty manifestation, then it\u2019s truly difficult to assimilate. Has one helped you in a dire moment of need? Was that an angel? Definitely, we have more questions than answers. This picture of me is teeming with \u2018em! I don\u2019t think I have the only haunted house around. After I saw this picture, I realized that you and I can just assume there are ghosts around us, anytime, anyplace, perhaps all the time. I don\u2019t like them; I wish I had never seen one. I don\u2019t look for any. In fact, I try not to see them. I sure hope there\u2019s not one behind you! ",

            "answer_text": "Drop the term poltergeist, and also every other term that gives an emotional slant to ghosts. If you just refer to them all as ghosts, then we can concentrate on the matter and not the term. There are ghosts all around us, all the time. It is just that they exist on a parallel plane to us. So, to see a ghost, you need to cross that line and enter the plane where ghosts reside. Pick a day when you have lots of time. Turn off all electronic devices. Make a cup of tea or coffee. Relax. Close you eyes and think of a recently departed person you know. Let your mind just float around and do not try to find anything. What ever comes to you is relevant, but you might not connect it right away. After some time, go about your normal business, but keep a little space inside you to receive messages or just to think. Repeat this process many times. The key is not to rush and not to expect anything to happen. you will realise that your own perception starts to change. This is all i can tell you without meeting you. ",

Waverly Hills Sanatorium. Ever hear of it? One of the most haunted places ever. It was an old hospital for tuberculosis patients and a few other types of patients. Not much variety though. My brother and mom went on a tour here without me once. When they got home, we went through the pictures. Scrolling through dozens, one made us stop dead in our tracks. You probably won't believe me, I don't blame you, but there was a ghost of a little girl in this picture holding a stuffed animal bunny. She had on a little bonnet and it was hard to things out, but I SWEAR I thought I saw her mother of father standing behind her. I know my brother didn't do that because he didn't have the type of tech on the way home in the car that day. His phone was dead- he showed me- and the photo was taken on his camera and he didn't have his laptop. Mom has no idea how to call a person on an iPhone, let alone use photoshop. ",

It's much more likely for a living person to experience phenomena related to spirits, such as unexplainable noises, feelings of being watched (especially when no one else is around), and even disembodied voices. However, there are many places around the world that claim paranormal activity. You can always save some cash and travel to any of these places. If allowed, take videos and pictures - a lot of them, and you may be lucky enough to capture evidence of your own, possibly even a full-body apparition! As for seeing ghosts as a matter of course, that honor is reserved for a select few. ",

With a smartphone record under 2 min of the natural sound around you.It should be quiet in terms of people talking but fans and TVs can be left on so the spirit has some sound to manipulate. Just be sure they are light background noise.You can ask any questions of the spirit being sure to leave ample response time in between questions. I suggest asking max 3 questions for your first time but the answer is most important so ask quickly and then be silent.Email the audio file to my Quora inbox or request my personal email from there for review.I guess I am not allowed to refer you back to my website for more info on the subject but you can google my name.

The energy acts like all other energy in that it is amplified when it encounters matching waves. I believe those who naturally experience spirits emit those waves. Or,perhaps, they are tuned into those wave lengths. When the wave lengths are encountered either way, they are amplified and become easier to be detected. I believe that the cold spots experienced by experiences is actually a result of the energy waves in our perceptible area being \u201cused\u201d to amplify the waves the spirit uses to make its own energy perceivable. Bottom line: Use of a device to amplify the energy of \u201cghosts\u201d should result in the ability of those unique waves to be interpreted. For info: Introduction to waves Amplification of Sound Waves at Extreme Frequencies This shows our brains do have waves - just too weak for interferance with a radio. But the concept is there for potential amplification. Can brain waves interfere with radio waves? ",

This is why people who can sense spiritual beings, myself included, rarely discuss it with others. We are often just labeled as crazy\u2026 even by people who know that we are not. ",

For I have read in some science  magazine that such low below auditory range audio gives the hearers a sensation of feeling a ghost's presence. (Of course, it does not help you to  see one.) ",

Other times they will move things only, or there is a sudden unexplained drop in temperature in a room. Or you do not see a thing, but the EMF (electromagnetic field meter)meter shows readings which are cannot accounted for. Sometimes, they will appear as smoke, fog a mass, or apparition. Other times they will feel sort of like a static electrical charge. ",

These correspond to hearing with the mind\u2019s ear, feeling/sensation with the mind\u2019s body, and seeing with the mind\u2019s eye. No one mode is superior to the others (and I listed them alphabetically). If you develop mediumship, you become more sensitive to the energies and spirits that are nearby. You may perceive spirits via any or all of these modes, at any time. ",

We even used to specially roam around at nights on weekends from 12-4 to specifically see ghosts but never successful. As I live in a place far away from city which was a type of village earlier, I used to hear many such stories form villagers too, been to every place they told but never seen a ghost once. I have even been to India's most haunted place \"Bhangarh fort\" twice but never seen one. So, if you ask me, No I have never seen or felt a ghost but many have.
