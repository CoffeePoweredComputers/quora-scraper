            "answer_text": "Great question! First, you will find nitrogen, oxygen, and argon in the very air you breathe, it surrounds the globe. Your house may have a feature constructed of wrought iron. The wiring in your house is likely made of copper, with some parts being aluminum. On your stove or grill, though it will likely be mixed with other things, you will find carbon. If you have an old thermometer or thermostat, you will find a few drops of mercury. It is also used in some flourescent light tubes. If you have fancy headphones or audio equipment, their connectors may be plated in gold. Your computer\u2019s CPU is made of the purest silicon. If you dig really deep in there (tearing components apart), you might be able to find some gallium, germanium, and selenium inside of transistors, mixed with silicon. (Not pure, I know, but I am trying to be inclusive) You may have some iodine in your medical cabinet, though it is in a mixture and not seperable - this is because it exists elementally as a volatile crystal that will evaporate. If you have some ancient red-tipped matches you may have some red phosphorus. Some older homes were made with tin roofs or wall coverings. Older incandescent light bulbs were sometimes made with tungsten, and some more argon. Older automobiles, and newer motorcycles often have parts plated in chromium. And depending on your level of wealth, you may have jewelry made of gold, silver, platinum, or iridium. In some areas of the country, uranium-rich soils break down into radon gas (among other things). If you have a high-tech bike, it likely has components made of carbon fiber, and possibly titanium. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is pure. Even very pure 24k gold may be .999 pure. I assume you mean Native elements? most likely your silver is sterling, you gold is less than 24k graphite is generally carbon. Diamond is generally carbon. nitrogen is floating around in your air, with oxygen. You likely have lots of aluminum, including foil. It is covered in oxide layer but generally pure Al underneath that invisible layer. your pennies are copper coating over zinc interior. Anything galvanized is coated with zinc. you may have some electronics with silicon wafers, but you probably can\u2019t see that. lots of copper, like pipes. you may have cast iron around. Most of your iron is in the form of steel, though, mixed with carbon and other elements. It is not pure. you may have a noble gas in neon light bulbs. maybe a helium balloon. you may have lead bullets or weights. any pure mercury in switches and thermometers is likely long banished. maybe some oddities like radium on old watch hands.
