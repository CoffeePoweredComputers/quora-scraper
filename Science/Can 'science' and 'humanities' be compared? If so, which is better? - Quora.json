            "answer_text": "These are two different subjects and both covering different aspects. For example Political science talks about the political background of the world and country and on the other hand a subject like biology talks about human body. I believe these subjects can\u2019t be compared but definitely there is a link between the two. Each subject is somehow related to each other. Just like without understanding the population of the country(Geography) you can\u2019t predict the number of people who have suffered from heart attacks in a year (Medical). Which is better? It depends on what you like. If you like to learn about how society changes, reasons for terrorism, role of United Nations in helping developing countries etc then you can choose humanities.But if you like mathematics, eager to learn about chemical reactions and how such reactions cause something new then you are intrested in science.It\u2019s basically your mindset which makes you believe which is easy for you and what is difficult for you. For me it was humanities as I was interested to learn about aspects of our country, world.If you feel confused just flip a coin and when the coin is in air you will know which side to choose. That\u2019s your intrest. When you are intrested and keen to study then you will definitely do well and make things easy be it humanities or science.Cheers :)",
