            "answer_text": "Not by us humans!! No higher animal has the enzyme cellulase. So how do cows eat grass? How do termites eat wood? They have gut bacteria and other symbiotic micro-organisms. Cows have a \u201crumen\u201d which is a fermentation chamber. The single celled organisms that DO have the enzyme cellulase have a symbiotic relationship with several herbivorous species. Just as a side note \u2014 the Panda eats only leaves, and yet it is related to the raccoon. It has the digestive tract of a carnivore, with no rumen etc. As a result the panda only gets a few percent of the nutrition (like 4%) from leaves that other animals do (cow, goat, termite). And as a result \u201cpanda poop\u201d looks green and clean, and pandas have to eat a whole lot of leaves every day to stay alive! ",

            "answer_text": "Quick answer: We cannot. Humans lack the enzymes necessary for breaking down cellulose; we also lack the symbiotic gut flora that contain those enzymes. If you are asking a hypothetical question concerning how humans can gain the ability to digest cellulose, then I would state that a mutation of our current gut flora would be one method. Hypothetically, one could also take the enzyme with a meal (say a pill or drink). But again, humans cannot digest cellulose because neither they nor their microbial partners have the enzymes. ",
