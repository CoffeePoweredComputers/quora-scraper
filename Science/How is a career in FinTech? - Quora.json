            "answer_text": "The global FinTech ecosystem is growing fast, and there has never been a better time to start a career in FinTech. As the industry is new and growing fast, most companies currently value attitude and willingness to learn above paper qualifications. Of course, you\u2019ll stand a better chance of getting your foot in the door if you have FinTech certification or qualification. There are a few good ones that you can take a look at, such as the Oxford FinTech Programme, HKU FinTech course, and the CFTE FinTech Foundation course. However, it\u2019s not the be all and end all if you haven\u2019t taken a course or have the best FinTech qualifications. The most important thing is that you have the right attitude and are willing to learn \u2013 there are many FinTech startups out there where you can prove your talent. Once you\u2019ve made a name for yourself, it should be easier to secure higher ranking jobs at reputable companies. It\u2019s just like climbing the corporate ladder, just with the possibility of climbing it faster due to the rapid growth of the FinTech industry. Current finance professionals run the risk of their skills becoming obsolete if they don\u2019t upskill themselves, but on the flip side, fresh graduates have a golden opportunity to make their mark with the right skills and attitude.

            "answer_text": "Simple. Just get involved and meet people already in this ecosystem. That is how I did it after taking the MIT Fintech course. I then started a meet up group called the MIT Fintech Connector that eventually became a global community of fintech enablers and innovators connecting, collaborating, and cultivating fintech ideas for impact. All this started because I got involved and started connecting with people in the industry. The rest will evolve over time. Hope this helps!!!
