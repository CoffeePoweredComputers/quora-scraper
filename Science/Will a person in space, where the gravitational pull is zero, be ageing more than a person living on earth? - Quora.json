            "answer_text": "Yes. time will dilate more due to the gravitational force of earth. This effect can even be seen in the satellites. As they are far from the Earth, they will experience less time dilation and thus time will flow faster for them. Although this effect is very less, after some amount of time they will become noticeable. One such example is that GPS satellites may show you location which will be 1 km away from the place you searched for. So people from Earth changes the time of satellites to solve the problem caused by time dilation. ",
