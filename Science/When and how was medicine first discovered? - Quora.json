            "answer_text": "Let me answer this briefly with three points. Various animals practice some sort of medical practice. Anyone living with dogs or cats know that when they are injured or hurt, these animals would lick the area where pain is felt. When there are wounds, the damaged area is usually licked in order to clean it (disinfect) and to boost healing via enzymes and proteins in their saliva. Our close primate cousins, the orangutans, have even been observed to crush the leaves of Dracaena cantleyi in their mouths to mix the pulp with their saliva. They then apply this mixture on their wounds. It has been found out that the plant contains anti-inflammatory properties that promote healing. So it is almost impossible to answer who started medicine and when did it start since our animal lineage informs us that various other species have started a rudimentary form of doctoring even before we came into the scene.Our history as an agricultural species enabled us to discover the medicinal properties of various plant species. Our lucky discovery and development of agricultural practices provided our ancestors with an intimate opportunity to familiarise themselves with the different plant species in their immediate environments, either for cultivation or experimentation. The story of the Chinese deity Shen Nong (\u795e\u8fb2) is instructive of this dynamic. Shen Nong, whose name means \u201cagriculture god\u201d is said to have journeyed for years to acquaint himself with the plants that reside in the mountain where he lived. He then catalogued them into what is now considered the first Chinese herbal text, The Classic of Herbal Medicine (\u795e\u8fb2\u672c\u8349\u7d93). Although in the mythological mode, this story surely depicts the relationship between farmhands and plants, as farmers are usually the ones working closely with plants, allowing them to know what plants can and cannot do.The Ancient Greeks were the first to codify the practice and a theory of medicine. Textbooks and academics credit the Ancient Greeks for the birth of medicine, and Hippocrates is widely considered as the father of medicine. This distinction is not without reason. While not the first to write about medicine, what the Ancient Greeks did was to codify a set of standards on what a practitioner of medicine should be. We know this today as the Hippocratic Oath. As the examined life was integral to Ancient Greek culture, they also incorporated philosophy in their study of medicine. They used the idea of the four humours to make sense of what they discovered from their empirical observations.So there you have it. No one can really be credited for having discovered medicine. No one can really pinpoint to the exact time when medicine was discovered. What we can read from history, however, is that the professionalisation of the medical practice had its early roots in Ancient Greece. ",
