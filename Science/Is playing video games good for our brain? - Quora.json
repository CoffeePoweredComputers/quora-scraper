            "answer_text": "It isn't. I began playing a strategy game 13 years ago, and I started to have the same question as you after days of feeling more irritated and super sensitive to some stumula, even to people's voices. I ignored the issues because I read video games were far healthier than harmful. Bullshit! I was gullible, I uninstalled and reinstalled the game about 15 times, honestly. I made a research about gamification and according to Jane Mcgonigal video games made us happier. That just made me relapse. I told myself the only way I could prove this was not playing that game which was highly addictive, and being self aware of the changes. Believe me this is not so entertained but I do have a more empowered life. Before I was pretty shy and unsocial but now at least that's not true I think video games are good as far as you play them not for repetitive times, I swear the psychosis that you may experience when someone is battling you in the game can be transferred to real life situations. I only suggest playing games that are nor so stimulating as crossword, word search etc. I think video games that are addictive are so because they are short term gratification systems which is similar to sex (I mean the thing people do with the computer when nobody is watching), drugs and alcohol. So we better watch out, and protect our sons. I think there are some kind of population proner to be affected by the content of video games. Some people are more sensitive to them and definitely can develop mental problems than other groups of people, plus video games hinder your social skills that's for sure, don't be gullible as me believing what the research said. Research can actually say both things, that they are good and bad. Believe your hunch before it is too late. Game anxiety can become or worsen real life anxiety trust me. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Video gaming is clearly a popular form of entertainment, with video gamers collectively spending 3 billion hours per week in front of their screens. Due to their widespread use, scientists have researched how video games affect the brain and behavior. Are these effects positive or negative? Video games and brain changes Scientists have recently collected and summarized results from 116 scientific studies to determine how video games can influence our brains and behaviors. The findings of their review were published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. \"Games have sometimes been praised or demonized, often without real data backing up those claims. Moreover, gaming is a popular activity, so everyone seems to have strong opinions on the topic,\" says Marc Palaus, first author of the review. By looking at all research to date, Palaus and team aimed to observe whether any trends had emerged with regard to how video games impact the structure and activity of the brain. A total of 22 of the reviewed studies explored structural changes in the brain and 100 studies analyzed changes in brain functionality and behavior. Results of the studies indicate that playing video games not only changes how our brains perform but also their structure. For example, video game use is known to affect attention. The studies included in the review show that video game players display improvements in several types of attention, including sustained attention and selective attention. Furthermore, the regions of the brain that play a role in attention are more efficient in gamers compared with non-gamers, and they require less activation to stay focused on demanding tasks. Evidence also demonstrates that playing video games increases the size and competence of parts of the brain responsible for visuospatial skills - a person's ability to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects. In long-term gamers and individuals who had volunteered to follow a video game training plan, the right hippocampus was enlarged. Researchers have discovered that video gaming can be addictive - a phenomenon known as \"Internet gaming disorder.\" In gaming addicts, there are functional and structural alterations in the neural reward system - a group of structures associated with feeling pleasure, learning, and motivation. Exposing video game addicts to game-related cues that cause cravings, and monitoring their brain responses, highlighted these changes - changes that are also seen in other addictive disorders. \"We focused on how the brain reacts to video game exposure, but these effects do not always translate to real-life changes,\" notes Palaus. The research into the effects of video gaming is still in its infancy and scientists are still scrutinizing what aspects of gaming impact what brain regions and how. \"It's likely that video games have both positive (on attention, visual and motor skills) and negative aspects (risk of addiction), and it is essential we embrace this complexity,\" POSITIVE EFFECTS Problem solving and logic \u2013 When a child plays a game such as The Incredible Machine, Angry Birds or Cut The Rope, he trains his brain to come up with creative ways to solve puzzles and other problems in short burstsHand-eye coordination, fine motor and spatial skills. In shooting games, the character may be running and shooting at the same time. This requires the real-world player to keep track of the position of the character, where he/she is heading, his speed, where the gun is aiming, if the gunfire is hitting the enemy, and so on.Quick thinking, making fast analysis and decisions. Sometimes the player does this almost every second of the game giving the brain a real workout..Accuracy \u2013 Action games, according to a study by the University of Rochester, train the player\u2019s brain to make faster decisions without losing accuracy.Perseverance \u2013 In higher levels of a game, the player usually fails the first time around, but he keeps on trying until he succeeds and move on to the next level.Memory \u2013 Playing first person shooter games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield series enables the player to effectively judge what information should be stored in his working memory and what can be discarded considering the task at hand,Management \u2013 Management simulation games such as Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zoo tycoon teach the player to make management decisions and manage the effective use of finite resources.",
