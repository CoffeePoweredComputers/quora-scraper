            "answer_text": "Atoms are the smallest part of matter which cannot be divided further into parts. They contain subatomic particles called as Electrons, protons, neutrons. The negatively charged electrons revolve around the nucleus in separate paths called as orbitals.The basic structure of an atom includes a tiny, relatively massive nucleus, containing at least one proton and usually one or more neutrons. Outside of the nucleus are energy levels, which contain one or more electrons. I would recommend you a video lecture I hope it will help you with more understanding concept   ",
