            "answer_text": "The answer is very simple, it's Carbon. Know that, and element is iidentified by its atomic number, which is equal to the number of proton it has. Since the no of proton in this case is 6 the atomic number is also 6 and we know that 6 is the atomic number of Carbon.  Now the additional information given by the question says it have 6 neutron and electrons also, though no of electron and neutron do not change the element they can be very useful for determination of element's physical and chemical properties. since this atom in question have 6 neutrons and 6 protons, it's atomic mass will be 6+6=12. therefore, this is a Carbon-12 isotope of Carbon. Now what job do the electron play? see, no of electron and no if proton for this Atom is equal therefore it's neutral in charge(+6e if proton -6e if electron). Summary of all this can be said to be, the particle in question is a nuetral C-12 Atom. ",

            "answer_text": "You would have an isotope of carbon called carbon-12. The 12 is called the nucleon number and indicates the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Any atom with 6 ptotons in its nucleus is carbon, by definition. Most elements have isotopes, which have varying numbers of neutrons in their nucleus. The isotope of carbon you asked about is the most common isotope found in nature, so if you picked up apiece of carbon it would be mostly carbon-12.   Carbon-14 is a useful isotope of carbon. As in all carbon atoms, it has 6 protons, but this isotope has 8 neutrons. It is radioactive and has a half-life of about 5,700 years. It can be used to date artifacts, especially those that were once living. ",
