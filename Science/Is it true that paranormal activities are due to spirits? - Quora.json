            "answer_text": "No, not always. Research ought to be done to determine if there's any medical cause, environmental cause, or psychological cause. Exorcisms, for instance, aren't conducted without first ruling out a psychological cause first. And research continues in places such as Skinwalker Ranch for environmental causes. And sometimes ghost stories are merely urban legends. Other times, events are yet unexplained.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Very much. What we call paranormal is actually not the work of divine. Rather it is anti-divine. There are lot of myths or deliberate mis- representation of the concept of paranormal. All that is para-normal is actually work of dead spirits or anti-God elements. Its other name is black magic! ",
