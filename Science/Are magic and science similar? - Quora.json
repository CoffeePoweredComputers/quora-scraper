            "answer_text": "Magic and science are by no way similar. We can actually say magic and science are opposites. Google gives the meaning of science as - the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. and magic as -the power of apparently influencing events by using mysterious or supernatural forces. And if you don't believe in supernatural forces, magic is basically cheating people, making people believe that some supernatural has happened in front of your eyes. In science you want people to show you how things are done. Whereas in magic, if know how it is done you lose the thrill. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers explain the meaning. However sometimes its the perspective.Sometimes Science can be seen as magic of another.For e.g. born of a baby from mother's womb is also consider as nature's magic Geographical beauty is consider as nature's or god's magic. Lastly I want to say this.One of my favorite character's quote in Anime Naruto (creative franchise), Naruto Uzumaki (Naruto character)'s quote is really well for this definition of magic   ....people live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true... that is how they define \"reality\". But what does it mean to be correct or true? Merely vague concepts... their reality may all be an illusion. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world shaped by heir beliefs? So it basically says that one's illusion can be reality for other. ",
