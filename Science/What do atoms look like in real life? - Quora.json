This is the copper atoms photographed by the aperture grating microscope\uff0cI am sorry for my poor English and software translation  \u00a00:00-0:30 What is aperture grating microscope? It is an instrument that USES the principle of coherent scattering to observe the micro world. If after the collision incident coherent photons electronic, electronic can firmly to keep in the original position of electronic (atomic force binding is very strong), the photon will produce rigid collision, the radiation effect is the electromagnetic wave scattering wave. The scattering wave has exactly the same wavelength and frequency as the incident wave.Aluminum atoms   0:00-0:30 0:00-0:30 ",

            "answer_text": "If i am not wrong, atoms look like clouds of gas. I mean that is as far as i've seen pictures on Google and YouTube. So, atoms might even be just empty space-nucleus is too small to be observed, electrons too are pretty fast and so cannot be observed(Uncertainty Principle)-which is why you can think that they look like clouds with a dense center. The cloud-electrons.The dense center-nucleus. ",
