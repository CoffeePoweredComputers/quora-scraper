We call \u201csynthetic\u201d any product that has been produced by human beings, and in the case of elements, that do not actually appear in nature (that we know of). However anything \u201csynthetic\u201d is equivalent to its \u201cnatural\u201d form, just as 5 is 5, regardless of it being the result of 2+3 (nature) or 1+4 (humans, which, by the way are part of nature anyway) .
