By the word space one can understand your living environment such as your room, your room is also a space. But if you are talking about \u201couter space\u201d \u201cempty space\u201d things get diffferent. So short answer of your question is, yes space can exist without a vaccum! By the word vaccum one can interpret a space which we are trying to get things (solids, liquid or gases or atoms etc) out of that given volume by desire. Or a volume which existentially lack of things (solids, liquid or gases or atoms etc) in it, such as \u201couter space\u201d or so called \u201cempty space\u201d But is empty space is really empty as called ? There are hydrogen atoms and cosmic dust in an empty space, but the distribution of those particles and atoms are not homogeneous so it is vary from part to part in a given volume of space. Here a link for further understanding. Density of Outer Space ",
