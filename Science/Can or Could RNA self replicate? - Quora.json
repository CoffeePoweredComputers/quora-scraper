            "answer_text": "RNA should in theory be able to self replicate without the help of proteins however this is not seen in nature. There are RNA molecules catalyse chemical reactions, a role usually carried out only by protein enzymes, these are     called ribozymes.  Ribozymes can facilitate the creation of both peptide     bonds in proteins, and the bonds between phosphate and ribose in RNA.This  means that under the right conditions some RNA sequences could both store information and implement the information. RNA is considered an attractive candidate as a primordial catalysis in the origin of life. There are some plant parasites called viroids.Viroids are small, circular,  noncoding(they do not code for protein) RNAs that infect plants. They  replicate in the nucleus or chloroplast and then traffic from cell to  cell and from organ to organ to establish systemic infection. Viroids directly  interact  with host cellular enzymes. Their replication mechanism involves RNA polymerase II, an enzyme normally associated with synthesis of messenger RNA from DNA, which under the influence of the viroid instead catalyses \"rolling circle\" synthesis of new RNA using the viroid's RNA as template. Parts of the long RNA strand produced then fold into ribozymes that cleave the RNA into viroid genome unit length strands. ",

As it had the strength to withstand high reducing environment of Earth it survived.For survival it should increase its number of copies . Finding suggests that RNA could self replicate as possessed both catalytic & information storage property.Similar simpler biopolymers like: TNA : Threose Nucleic Acid having 4 Carbon sugar unit contrast to RNA which has 5 .PNA:Peptide Nucleic Acid having peptide backbone world.RNA enzymes called Ribozymes have self catalytic property.Involved in post-transcriptional modifications like splicing of newly synthesized mRNA transcripts.
