            "answer_text": "I am a Christian. And I rely on science to inform me on the material world (which possibly is the only world there is). But forget the Christianity part. Just classify me as a \u201cbeliever.\u201d I believe god exists. There you go: flat out and ugly; I believe. Christianity is just the fine tuning; that\u2019s how I believe, how I connect. Everyone on board, here? Good. Now, do I BELIEVE in science? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Science is not to be believed, and the reaction of scientists to people who DO believe in science would range from suspicion to abject horror. The deal with science is that anything that is proposed as true cannot be so proposed unless it is subject to test in accordance with methods and procedures upon which scientists are in general agreement. That is, the results of any theory or proposition must be repeated by others; if they can\u2019t be, the theory looks weak. Need more tests. And if the results are upheld, then they STILL must be tested by others. Prove it, prove it again, and then prove it again. That\u2019s not belief. That\u2019s an actual demonstration. And once anything has been proved enough times, it becomes a \u201ctheory.\u201d That is, something which is tentatively accepted as true until shown to be otherwise. The \u201cacceptance\u201d may carry with it the weight of great evidence. Even so, there is no \u201csure thing.\u201d Everything is open to question, doubt and change. THAT\u2019S how science works. Bottom-line: science is not based on belief, OK? Now, the Bible. Applying my scientific mind, to it, I realize immediately that it is not a scientific work. It is, rather, a collection of independently written stories, myths, reports and opinions from many writers who were widely separated by geography and time, and who did not know each other and none of whom knew all their work would one day be assembled in a single work which people centuries or decades after their time would call a \u201cBible.\u201d No science here, folks. And probably not much belief, either. There are so many contradictions in the Bible that it is, in my opinion, impossible to believe in all of it. It is, however, possible to be INFORMED by it, and draw from the text such guidance as we may apply to our own lives. If I gave you a stack of newspaper written during the US Civil War, you would notice a bias based on where the papers were written, and who wrote the articles. And you would evaluate all this in accordance with how much you knew, or thought you knew, about everything else. But you would not reasonably form a belief on any of it. If you HAD a belief, it would be informed by more sources other than the newspapers. So, to answer the question at hand, as a Christian, I neither believe in science, nor the Bible. I look at everything, and make up my own mind. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "This Questions goes in a loop because if you believe in the Bible then you can\u2019t believe in Scientific theories like Darwinism. You\u2019re either believing in the Bible or believe in Scientific theories. Believing in the Bible is based on it be the true inspired Word of God. It hoping in what is not seen, having a faith that trusts that what the Bible says is true. The original autographs are 100 % true to what we have today. There are no errors and the Bible is inerrant and infallible. You can also believe in Science but not the theories that contradict what the Bible says. The Bible is the standard for truth because it is God\u2019s Word revealed through the prophets. Based on the Word of God, beliefs are formed which result in Biblical Convictions. Biblical convictions drive action and are based on a strong belief that what the text says is God\u2019s Word. God\u2019s Word contains truths and commands for how to live a righteous live for God\u2019s Glory. Being a Christian means you have been saved by God\u2019s Grace through Faith. You now desire the things of God and his will for your life. There\u2019s nothing you can do to gain entrance into heaven. Being a Christian means that you acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of God\u2019s Grace. Galatians 2:20 says that Christ is in us and we now live for Him. Christians acknowledge that Jesus is the atonement for our sins and that he paid the penalty for our sins on the cross. Because of him and our saving faith Christians now desire to obey in righteousness for God\u2019s glory waiting for the glorious day to come when Christ returns. Being a Christian isn\u2019t merely just believing in something. It\u2019s a transformation of life turning from your sin and repenting. It\u2019s about being a man after God\u2019s own heart pursuing what he wants for your life. Christianity isn\u2019t a forced thing. God gives Christians the desires to go to church and be in the word. In Ephesians 2 there\u2019s the doctrine of predestination which states that God chose the elect before the foundation of the world. 100% elect would be a Calvinistic point of view. Here are some helpful questions: How does one become a Christian? Believe in Jesus and the Gospel John 3:16 New International Version (NIV) 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. What is the Gospel? That Jesus, the God-man died for our sins and by his Grace, we can have eternal life and live for God's Glory (1corinthians 10:31) Evidence of salvation are repentance from sin, hunger for God's word, fruit in one's life (Galatians 5). The Father predestined salvation, Jesus made salvation possible, and the Holy spirit effects Salvation. 1 Corinthians 15:2-4New International Version (NIV) Part of the Gospel 2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. 3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance [a] : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind on this Journey! (Sanctification) Romans 12:2 New International Version (NIV) 2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God\u2019s will is\u2014his good, pleasing and perfect will. Application and doing! Conforming to Christ's Character 1John 3:2 2 Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears [a] we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is Obedience 22 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror 24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 25 But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it\u2014not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it\u2014they will be blessed in what they do. 1 John 2:5- But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. God's Grace through Faith Ephesians 2:8 and Romans 1:5 Ephesians 2:8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- Romans 1:5 Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name's sake. Election Ephesians 1:4- just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, what we should be holy and without blame Him in love, having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth-in Him. In Him we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.  deity of Christ  Philippians 2:5- Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming to the likeness of men.  Exodus 3:13-15 Moses said to God, \"Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?\" God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'\" God also said to Moses, \"Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has sent me to you.' \"This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation. John 8:58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am. God Grants us Repentance 2Timothy 2:25 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, New Nature 2 Corinthians 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! Reconciliation and Justification Romans through faith, we [a] have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we [b] boast in the hope of the glory of God. 3 Not only so, but we [c] also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 4 perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 And hope does not put us to shame, because God\u2019s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. Salvation Through Christ 1 Thessalonians 5:9 For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. Illumination through the Holy Spirit 1 Corinthians 2:10-But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes , the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. The Greatest Gift  1 Corinthians 13:13 And nowt abide faith, hope love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. All for God's Glory 1 Corinthians 10:31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Isaiah 42:8 8 I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Hungering for God's Word 1 Peter 2:1 Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious. What is Faith? Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.

            "answer_text": "Do Christians believe in science? Of course they do. Every technology used by us to ease our lives is the proof that science is true. However please note that human science is not final yet. What was thought to be legit once, might not be so later on, when new discovery comes up. For example, once Pluto was deemed to be the ninth planet. But now, not anymore. Once Milky-Way thought to be the center of universe and the only one, but now there are so many galaxies, and each galaxy has so many stars, that scientists compared the stars as many as the sand of beach. Interestingly, the Bible come up with similar comparison: \u201cI will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies.\u201d\u2014Genesis 22:17 (ESV) Please note that the Bible writer of this account lived about 3,500 years ago. There was no telescope at that time. The number of stars seen with naked eyes are only about 3,000 - 5,000 only. So, how did the writer know this fact? Once people believed in abiogenesis or generatio spontania (that life emerges by itself from anorganic matters), but Louis Pasteur gave a lethal blow to that theory, and scientists followed him and believed in biogenesis (that life emerges from previous life). And now, some scientists want us to believe in a new-face of abiogenesis called evolution. These are not the only examples. There are so many human-shifting theories. So you see that human science keeps changing. Why do we defend on the theory that keeps changing? We can hold to the provable theory and science, but we should not do that on an unproven theory and human-shifting science.  ",

            "answer_text": "To christians: If you believe in science, how can you also believe in The Bible? \u2026science states that the earth is 2.5 billion years old, while The Bible states it is 4,000\u2026 A2A. Your assertion is in error. The Bible does not \u201cstate that the world is 4,000 years old.\u201d There have been some Bible scholars who have interpolated what the Bible DOES say, using genealogies and such, to calculate the age of the earth. Most of these estimates have put the age of the earth at somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years. That\u2019s still a wide disparity with 2.5 billion, but not all Christians believe in this view (called \u201cYoung Earth Creationism\u201d). In fact, the majority of Christians do not. Even some who do, explain it by saying that Adam, the first man, was created as a young man, not an infant. So if God can create a man with an apparent age of, say, 25, why could he not create a universe already in progress, including an earth with an apparent age? I do not necessarily agree with this line of reasoning, but it\u2019s one way those who do can reconcile science and the Bible. More Christians believe in Old Earth Creationism, which includes the view that evolution is one of the mechanisms the Creator God built into the universe. To \u201cbelieve in the Bible\u201d does not require suspension of scientific belief. It only requires a degree of interpretation of some passages as more literal than others. This is the same way pretty much all readers evaluate all literature. For example, when a news report says \u201cThe whole town came out to greet their winning team,\u201d this is called \u201chyperbole.\u201d We do not generally take that to mean every single human in that town. We take it to mean \u201ca lot of people.\u201d The fact that there is some disagreement among Christians regarding some passages which may be interpreted as hyperbole, parable, or any other literary device, does not mean that all Christians cannot \u201cbelieve in the Bible\u201d and still believe in science.

            "answer_text": "Questions similar to this have come up elsewhere on this site, so I\u2019m just reproducing an answer I gave to a similar question elsewhere on this site. Remember first of all that the Bible is actually a collection of dozens of books that were written (if you accept the concept of Divine Inspiration, then say \u201ccollaborated on\u201d) over many centuries for many reasons. Even the three synoptic Gospels were written for different audiences to grind a different ax. So, let me ask you, do you take a library literally? Of course not. If you\u2019re reading Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, you know you\u2019re reading fantasy, that there are really no such things as wizards, and elves, and hobbits, etc. If you\u2019re reading fiction that is based more on technical accuracy, like a police procedural or a novelized account of the Battle of Gettysburg such as Shaara\u2019s The Killer Angels, or the French Reign of Terror such as Dickens\u2019s A Tale of Two Cities, you\u2019ll still know that it\u2019s fiction, but you might have faith in the underlying technical details. If you read a biography, or a history, or a journalistic account of a crime, you might take those literally, because they\u2019re meant to be taken literally. Doesn\u2019t mean mistakes don\u2019t get made. That\u2019s why the details in one account of the Battle of Leyte Gulf might be different from the details in a different account. In the Bible, you\u2019ll find historical accounts of the early days of the Hebrews, and the Hebrew peoples\u2019 evolution from a society ruled by a group of Judges to a Monarchy. You\u2019ll also find fantasy stories that give a lesson, like the Book of Job. You\u2019ll also find collections of prayers for almost any occasion, as in Psalms. You\u2019ll also find biographies, like the Gospels, sermons, like the Epistles of St. Paul, an erotic romantic poem called the Canticle of Canticles (or the Song of Solomon), and all kinds of other books. In each case you have to put the individual book, and the individual chapter and verse in context. For example, is God literally a shepherd, or is that a metaphor to help us understand how He cares for us? Is God literally a King, or is that a metaphor to help us understand His great power? Is God literally a vine and all of us branches, or is that a metaphor to help us understand our interconnectedness with God and with each other? And, if science, which God is also the author of, seems to indicate that parts of the Bible that were once routinely taken literally are not literally true, then maybe, with our improved scientific understanding, we can come to view those passages metaphorically. If the Bible is Divinely Inspired, it can\u2019t be wrong. And if God is the Creator of all things, nature and science can\u2019t be wrong. Therefore, if there seems to be a conflict between Science and Scripture, then it is our understanding of either Scripture or Science that\u2019s in error. Not God\u2019s Word. And not His Works. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is exceedingly important to me. Science is one of my passions and was foundational to my career for 35 years. My Bachelor's and Master's degrees are in engineering but most courses were science. Science has contributed immeasurably to my comfort, security, leisure and education. Science brought my ancestors out of the stone age. I love learning about science and always have. And science helps shape my world-view. When I find a well-substantiated scientific observation that conflicts with what I believe, I need to change one or the other. If the new science is documented well enough, I will change my world-view, including religious beliefs. But so far, I have never heard any science that conflicts with the most basic premises of the Christian faith, including the inspired Bible. Science does not conflict with the Bible, unless you take the Bible as 100% literal. Then you have a problem, particularly in the numerous places where the Bible contradicts itself. But I believe that some of the Bible is literal history and some is metaphor. However, the Bible is not primarily a science book, it was written to teach people how to relate to God. So for instance, the parables told by Jesus were intentionally fiction, and the value of them lays in their moral. The books of Job, Daniel and Revelation are also highly allegorical - they teach important truths whether or not the actual events happened (or will happen) as reported. ",

I believe in chemistry. I believe in physics. I believe in evolution. I believe that everything God does is within the physical laws of the universe. The main difference between us and Him (which is also the reason so many choose to disbelieve God or science) is because he understands those laws perfectly and we don't. \u201cBut the Creation?\u201d you ask? God's six-day creation is symbolic of six divisions of time, each one taking perhaps millions or even billions of years. When you are an eternal being, what does a day even mean? Maybe his day is much, much longer than ours. \u201cWhat about Christ's miracles?\u201d They're only miracles to us, because we don't understand the physical laws employed. Bring anyone from the 15th century into our world today and they will witness miracles all around them as well: cell phones, televisions, automobiles, airplanes, electric light! All pretty darn miraculous to that person. As long as you study the scriptures, pray, and seek guidance from the Holy Ghost, God can give you answers to your questions and concerns. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of us say we do. A quick visit to the Creation Museum in Kentucky, however, taught me that some don\u2019t understand science, and may not understand faith. Science means looking at the evidence and forming a theory based on that evidence. If new evidence makes the previous theory untenable, one changes the theory. Discoveries that challenge accepted wisdom are welcomed because they lead to greater knowledge and understanding. Picking and choosing \u201cevidence\u201d to support your beliefs while ignoring anything that contradicts it, while calling it science (as many \u201cChristians\u201d do), is simply fraud. Faith is belief in something that can not be proved, because the creator is always greater than the created. An example of faith is believing that God created everything. It is not antithetical to science, which only shows the person of faith deeper knowledge of how God created everything, thus giving a deeper awareness of the incomprehensible mystery we call God. This kind of faith views science as a tool of faith, not an enemy. For some of us, science deepens faith. For others, science challenges faith. Personally I think a faith that requires its believer to deny reality is at best delusion, and at worst spiritual abuse. ",

This verse was written during the Bronze Age, not the most scientific of times. Yet, this verse is completely accurate. Indeed, the universe has been discovered to be expanding, and, as we all know, the earth is indeed a sphere. I doubt that whoever write that verse would have unless he or she had imperial proof it was so. The only imperial proof would be being told by God. Suggesting this was so without being told so by God is out I the question. Suggesting so would have brought mockery and ridicule upon whoever dared claimed so. There is no reason to claim so other than being told by God. In Genesis, the Bible talks about underwater valcanos. How does anybody in the Bronze Age know about that? Being told by God only makes sence. Christians have every reason to believe science, and do. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I believe so. It\u2019s quite simple. God created universe. There was method in the madness. The sheer vastness, unbridgeable distances, unimaginable long times, incredible temperatures and densities, everything was against the possibility of any kind of biological life, which is generally quite fragile, to exist. Yet it does. Maybe only in one little spot in the whole wide universe: a tiny, humble planet called earth. Where conditions are exactly, precisely right to make it possible. And only just. Everybody\u2019s life constantly seem to hang by a thread. It\u2019s the precision in nature that makes science possible. There are enough patterns, rules, or laws in nature. There is something in nature making it predictable and understandable to some extent. It can be described as follows: every system acts according to its nature. That nature is inherent to all systems. Even chaotic systems have a nature. What makes science possible: if you know the nature of a system, you can predict it\u2019s behaviour (like farmers and fishermen learned to predict weather - their lives depended on it). If you don\u2019t know it\u2019s nature, you can study it\u2019s behaviour, and from that make hypotheses about its nature, which you use to make testable predictions, which you check in systems behaviour, which you use to adjust hypotheses to better fit reality, until it becomes as good as general relativity or quantum physics in describing and predicting behaviours. There you have it: the scientific method - based on systems, their nature and their behaviour. Science is about observation, measurements and reasoning. Science observed the magnificence of God\u2019s works and described it in an objective way. Thus it is. Things are this way, not another way. It has certain very specific characteristics. It could have had any number of possible different characteristics. But it is as it is. That\u2019s the reality we have to deal with. Genesis states that God created everything according to their nature, or kind. It is this nature that makes science possible. I believe all of the above to be true. This believe is not the same as my belief in God of the Bible. My belief in science is the conclusion that on the balance evidence indicates that the scientific conclusion (not consensus - that\u2019s popular vote) is the best explanation available, currently. It\u2019s by no means permanent or perfect. It stands to be corrected, as soon as new evidence becomes available. Scientific conclusion are essentially temporal, always waiting to be refuted, or confirmed by new evidence. God, on the other hand, is not subject to such faith. He needs no evidence. He is evidence itself. I believe God on his authority. I don\u2019t believe scientific journals because they have any authority. I read what\u2019s in it, and judge for myself. It\u2019s like a poker player putting his cards on the table- they speak for themselves (I borrowed this idea from another Quora writer - W. Hoffmann). You put your hypothesis on the table. Other scientists investigate it and pronounce it dead or alive. We never say something is so because it\u2019s in science books. We see for ourselves. Seeing is believing. When it comes to God believing is seeing. You have to believe before you see. Is it possible to hold such conflicting ideas in one brain? Why not? We can\u2019t function without belief. Most beliefs are implicit, hidden in our behaviour. We drive cars at 120 km/h on one side of the road while other cars are being hurled our way at the same speed from the opposite side. We pass each other by a few centimeters. We do it calmly, matter of factly, as if it\u2019s nothing. We assume the other driver will act rationally, predictably and reasonably. One mistake and oblivion. How do we do that? Faith, brother, faith. We trust all the science behind it. So why shouldn\u2019t I trust God?

After all, most will drive cars, use electricity, see a doctor, and they do not believe that any of these things are magical or God-powered devices. Evolution is the thing that most commonly clashes with Christianity but even then there are many Christians who are not strict creationists and have no problem accepting scientific evidence. Likewise, there are non-Christians that refuse to accept things like vaccines and non-Christrians that accept all of the commonly-accepted theories within the scientific community. Of course even for people that reject certain things, that doesn\u2019t actually mean they don\u2019t believe in science. Science is a process. Disbelieving something commonly accepted in the scientific community isn\u2019t a rejection of all science, it\u2019s usually a belief that information or processes are flawed or have been misrepresented. It may be a misguided belief and I think many of them have been misled themselves, but it still doesn\u2019t mean that the person doesn\u2019t believe in science at all. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cTo christians: If you believe in science, how can you also believe in The Bible? For example, science states that the earth is 2.5 billion years old, while The Bible states it is 4,000.\u201d Like others have said, The bible doesn't state that the earth is 4000 years old. Also, science doesn't state that the earth is 2.5 billion years old. Some biblical scholars believe that there is enough evidence in the bible to believe that the earth is about 6000 years old. Some scientists believe that there is enough scientific evidence to believe that the earth is billions of years old. They now think it is about 4.4\u20134.5 billion years old. That number is constantly changing. A theory that the earth is old, is needed to support the theory of evolution. This is enough motivation to cause some people to make assumptions that compromise the theory. Scientific evidence that the earth is young is overlooked or disregarded because it doesn't aid the theory of evolution. If there was enough evidence to refute the theory of an old earth and support the theory of a young earth, the theory of evolution would have to be reworked or compleatly thrown out. This is simply unthinkable to many scientists. Scientists used to think that the earth was flat. Scientists used to think that the Earth was the center of the universe. Scientists have a long history of being wrong. There is nothing wrong with doubting scientists. To believe in science, is to believe in the scientific method. To believe in the bible, is to believe in God. There is no contradiction in believing in God and the scientific method. There is no scientific evidence that proves the earth is 4.5 billion years old. There is scientific evidence that is consistent with the theory of a 4.5 billion year old earth but there is also scientific evidence that is consistent with a young earth. ",

For doctors it is another thing. So science explains the how. If I want to know, how the engine of my car works, I would need Science. If I want to know, why I we are here in the first place, I might go to a silent place by myself and hope for spiritual inspiration to give me some insights. Sometimes, consulting old scripture will do, or even getting together with likewise searching persons. ",

Sadly, many atheists and agnostics (and even some Christians) try to argue that science and Scripture are in conflict when in reality, they are separate disciplines, each with its own focus and methods. Science, by its own definition, concerns itself with the natural world\u2014with what can be observed and measured. Theology\u2019s focus is the supernatural\u2014that is, everything that lies beyond the scope of science. To expect either discipline to effectively do the work of the other is illogical. Theology specifically studies what happens when God transcends the boundaries of human science, and science describes what happens in this observable world. ",

The problem is not with \u201chow we think,\u201d because our cognitive skills work in the same way: We take raw data and input it into our headsWe analyze the data with the known algorithms we were taughtWe come to conclusions.The ONLY difference between someone who believes the Bible to be accurate and one who rejects the Bible are \u201cpresuppositions\u201d. That\u2019s it. Everything else, literally, everything else is the same. Those presuppositions are so effective, they radically alter the outcome. For instance, I spent some time in the Grand Canyon. It\u2019s a beautiful place! When I go there, I see a lot on how the Great Flood impacted the landscape, produce the massive wash off to the West, and the deep cuts of the canyon. I can take professional scientific geologists (who are creationists) and they can show clear and scientific evidence of a flood. All of this is based on empirical evidence PLUS presuppositions. On the flip-side, I have seen evolutionary scientists to the exact same thing and using the exact same empirical evidence, come to completely different answers! Why? Were they \u201cless educated\u201d? No. They had differing presuppositions. The problem isn\u2019t intellectual (of the soul), but rather a matter of faith/ belief (of the spirit). One party chooses to believe one set of parameters, while the other side chooses to believe another opposing set of parameters. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer might find disagreement in both camps. I'm using evolution as an example. Christianity and science can agree on just about everything that science is able to prove. If science is right, it's right. Some scientists make assumptions about God, and/or the nature of God, based on what they have learned about the natural world. Some of these assumptions haven't been proven. One example is the assumption, or belief, or at least way of describing, how species seem to experiment with different forms as they guide their own evolution. How (or whether) evolution is guided is something Christians and scientists can argue about. But whether evolution happens and whether or not the world is billions of years old is another. The science seems settled on the age of the world and whether species evolved from one form to another. A thinking person has to acknowledge this. I believe the guiding mechanism hasn't yet been fully discovered or proven, and that particular thing is treated as settled science but isn't. Believing that evolution disproves God is a mistake, in my opinion. If I were God, I would experiment with different forms too. But if the Bible or man's religious traditions disagree with proven fact, they must be wrong. ",

This seems to be a misunderstanding of some very dubious calculations by Archbishop James Ussher, who claimed the world was 6000 years old, not 4000. The Bible does not give the age of the earth. Secondly the Bible has never been read as a literally true document by serious theologians. Saint Augustine was pointing out the error of doing so in the fourth century, and a century before his time Origen was noting how silly it would be to consider the story in Genesis as literally true. The Bible is not a history book; it is a library of documents written over a thousand years containing books with many different motivations, conventions and genres. The truths people find in the Bible are not, in many cases, historical ones. I have no problem believing in the Bible or accepting that it contains historical and scientific errors. I believe it contains important truths, not that every word of it is true in the literal sense, a sentiment I share with educated Christians throughout history. ",

In the US fundamentalists and evangelical christians are a reliable voting block and as such have a larger share of voice in our media and our electoral activities and political messaging but these fundamentalists are by no means a majority of American christianity! Most Christians believe that the bible is a collection of prose and poetry meant to teach fundamental concepts in philosophy and moral reasoning. It\u2019s not a text book. Most Christians believe that God reveals his plans in the time mankind is able to comprehend the plan and science is the method by which that plan is revealed.

One last one to add, and possibly the most controversial (although, in a purely intellectual world, it wouldn\u2019t be). I can reject the conclusions drawn using foundational assumptions with which I disagree, without rejecting the science or the facts of a matter. Almost anything \u2018scientific\u2019 that deals with past events that cannot be repeated, must rely on assumptions about either the past events, the nature of the environment in which they occurred, or the nature of the environment that the physical evidence occupied in the intervening years. If even one assumption is incorrect, the conclusions that are then extrapolated from those foundational assumptions will end up diverging from the truth of what happened by an exponential order. The theory of evolution, radio-carbon dating calibration, etc are the best tools for explaining what we see IF we accept a number of foundational assumptions BEFORE we examine the evidence. Granted, many people that disagree with these things (evolution, extremely old dates, etc) are ignorant and biased. So are many of the people that agree with them. If I disagree with one or more of the foundational assumptions of a theory, I can disagree with the validity of that theory, without having to disagree with any scientifically established facts. The theory of evolution has some major problems. The theory of Creationism has some major problems. Ultimately, whichever one you choose to accept is going to most likely come down to which set of foundational assumptions you are most comfortable with. And both of them will require you to accept certain contradictions which they do a poor job of explaining. In closing, I believe that there is enough reason (not belief) to doubt either theory without requiring ignorance or a lack of rational thinking. That doesn\u2019t prevent many people on both sides of the issue from employing no rational thinking whatsoever in considering the matter. These are simply my thoughts on this subject, I am not a scientist, but this stuff interests me. I tend to investigate things that interest me. I hope it is of some help to someone. ",
