            "answer_text": "I am sorry, but hydrogen peroxide (35% or any other concentration) cannot cure cancer. I wish it could. You also need to know that anyone who tries to treat cancer this way is, at best, misinformed, and at worst, a con man exploiting patients to get money. If you or a loved one has cancer, you will be vulnerable to criminals who do this sort of thing. Cancers are treatable conditions. Medical treatment can bring about remission in most patients. The sooner the patient gets medical treatment, the better and longer their life is likely to be. Delaying treatment by going to people who recommend things like hydrogen peroxide delays initiation of effective treatment. I wish you well. ",

That can lead to a perforation and subsequent mediastinitis. You can die from the mediastinitis instead of cancer, which is a sort of cure, I suppose, if you don\u2019t mind that minor inconvenience of a painful and miserable death from another cause. ",
