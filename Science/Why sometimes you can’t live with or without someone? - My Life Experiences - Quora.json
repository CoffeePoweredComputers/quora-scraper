            "answer_text": "After reading the question,I wasn't able to control myself for writing it's answer because I am encountering indistinguishable feelings at the moment. Being an over thinker (I consider it as a positive trait of my personality -\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c),I am in always dilemma that why is some person so important that you can't survive either peacefully with him or remain escatic without him\u2026 Before anyone judges, coming straight to the topic,I have recently been in friendship with a boy(so clich\u00e9,I know) which is nothing indifferent, so what's special in it?? The special thing between him and me that we share an epic bond between us which I haven't with anyone yet among my friends..(We talk rubbish, fights with each other,at times judge each other, makes each other understand our perspective and what not..) and *\u201dYES!!! WE ARE NOT IN RELATIONSHIP..\u201d*  My status with him \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46or maybe I am thinking this way\u2026\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02(Silly mind..) But every time we seriously fight with each other,we are in a state that \u201clook this friendship is not going well, we should Stop talking or bonding with each other\u201d. My experience when I face such situation..In the conversation, being touted as egoist/ having attitude, I agree to the point that yes,we won't ever talk and let everything be finished.. I try to keep peace with it for a day or two..In the back of my head my mind rambling \u201cThat, I don't need to talk and it's ok if we are not talking, maybe it's good for both of us\u201d and then I started missing him miserably and I end up calling/messaging him sometimes, which even he sometimes do\u2026 He always ask me for the matter \u201c What do u want??\u201d but my mind is sure of the thing that I don't wanna loose this Friendship of ours and because of this reason only, I feel that I can't live with or without him as *ABSENCE OF FRIENDS DOESN'T HURT YOU THE MOST BUT THE PRESENCE OF THEIR MEMORIES CERTAINLY DO...*  Legitimately,I know this point beyond doubt that getting attached to some one is extremely lethal for my own self but right now going with the flow and keeping my blunt mind & heart out of the way\u2026 Peace \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Why you can't live without someone?? Answer is simple and that is you love that person or you are addicted to that person. You think that no other person can take or fill the place of that person. So your addicted mind will tell you that you should have that person so that you can be happy, and if you don't have then you'll never be happy. So this feeling makes our life miserable. That's why we think that we can't live without that spacial one. Why you can't live with one?? If take above situation where you have to leave your special one behind and have to live your life without him or her then you'll not able to live with new person as you still have feelings for old one.and there's might be another scenario in which you hate that person. Your feeling of hate won't gonna live you with that person. I hope this Will help you to understand sister. ",

            "answer_text": "When someone says I can't live without him Maybe it's because we imagined our entire life with them and all of a sudden we have to face life without them.. It takes times to get habituated to their absence in our life. It's really a tough task but almost every person faces these kind of things in their life. We get attached to people without knowing that if they too really feel same towards us or not.. And when someone says I can't live with him it's because they have expected something from that person which is not fulfilled or they may be interested in some other person. It's our attachments make us live with or without a person Think before you get attached to someone, take care of your mental health ",
