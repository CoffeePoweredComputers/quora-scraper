            "answer_text": "There are more than 4 types of orbitals; this is a common misconception in atomic and molecular physics. The orbital corresponds to the value of L (total orbital angular momentum, typically written as lowercase L for atoms but I will use uppercase for clarity in typewritten font). When solving Schroedinger\u2019s equation for any central potential system (including\u2014but not limited to\u2014Hydrogen), the kinetic energy due to angular momentum results in an angular distribution that is the spherical harmonics. The lower bound for L is 0. You can observe one component (only) of L, conventionally the z component (but this is due to choosing spherical coordinates where z is easier to compute\u2026it is a central potential, there is no inherent directional preference!) So, for a given L value, m ranges from. -L to L in integer steps. Larger L values have more m values. When using the potential for Hydrogen (Coulomb potential), then a total energy quantum number, n, also appears, with a lower bound of 1, and L can be no larger than n - 1. So, L ranges from 0 to n - 1 in Hydrogen. However, all of this is \u201cbackward\u201d. When spectral lines were first observed, scientists could describe only what they saw. Some lines were sharper (s) than others, some lines were more diffuse (d), and some were the principle (p) lines that were \u201cnormal\u201d (as a baseline to judge sharper or more diffuse). We now know this is due to the number of m states that are possible: larger L has more possible m states, each differing very slightly in energy, so in an emission spectrum if the lower state is sharp, L has its minimum value, 0. If it is the baseline (p), L = 1. If it is more diffuse, L = 2. I skipped over \u201cfundamental\u201d (f) for clarity, but early scientists also saw some lines were even more diffuse than d\u2026f is L = 3. For n > 4, it is possible to go even higher still, though, to g (L = 4) (if n > 4), h (L = 5) (if n > 5), etc. It goes alphabetically, but skipping over used letters and reserved letters at that point. So, why are these less commonly used? Because for stable atoms with all electrons in the ground state, they are not needed. However, if all electrons are not in the ground state, then these other higher states can in fact arise! The orbital shapes are given by the spherical harmonics in all cases, though. ",

            "answer_text": "Strictly speaking, only monoelectronic atoms have orbitals; for many-electrons atoms, orbital model is used as an approximation. When Schr\u00f6dinger Equation for monoelectronic atom is solved, each solution is labeled by three quantum numbers: n, l and m. What you call \u201ctype of orbital\u201d is the l quantum number, and some of them have special names: s (l=0), p (l=1), d (l=2), f (l=3), g (l=4), h (l=5), i (l=6), k (l=7), l (l=8), m (l=9), n (l=10), o (l=11), q (l=12), r (l=13), t (l=14), u (l=15), v (l=16), w (l=17), x (l=18), y (l=19) and z (l=20). The Schr\u00f6dinger Equation has infinite solutions, thus there are l greater than 20 (21 to infinite) but such orbitals have no special name. Despite inaccuracies, orbitals are also employed to describe electronic configuration of many-electrons. When excited atom are not concerned, i.e. only ground state matters, s, p, d and f are the only orbitals populated by electrons. Some predictions state that g orbitals will be populated in a atom of element with atomic number 121, but this element has not been synthesized so far. ",

            "answer_text": "You are presumably thinking about s, p, d, and f orbitals. Actually, the list doesn\u2019t stop there. Each time n goes up, another possible value of l is added, and another kind of orbital becomes possible. Thus when n=5, you can have g orbitals, and when n=6, you can have g and h orbitals (after f, we just go alphabetically). However, you don\u2019t often hear about these orbitals because they are empty in the ground state of all elements; no element has enough electrons to start filling the 5g subshell. So the existence of these orbitals plays a role in excited states but not in ground states. ",

            "answer_text": "There are four type of orbitals namely s,p,d,f. The s orbital is the smallest and can accommodate 2 electrons. The p, d, f orbitals can accommodate 6, 10, 14 electrons respectively. The f orbital is the largest. The shape of the s orbital is spherical. While the shape of the p orbital is dumb bell, and that shape of d orbital is double dumb bell. The shape of the f orbital is leaf like structure. ",
