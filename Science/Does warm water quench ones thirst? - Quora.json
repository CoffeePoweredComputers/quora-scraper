            "answer_text": "Any water does when your really thirsty. Actaully I\u2019ve had moments when I would have prefered luke-warm or even warm water to cold. When i was climbing or mountain-walking for instance and out of water and very thirsty with only an ice-cold spring available: you can\u2019t drink much. Not only you know it can be dangerous to drink too fast but it actually hurts. So you need this water and still you can only drink a few sips at the time, not very quenching. While - if you have still left some - the water in your backpack can be heated by the sun but it will be better than any red wine you\u2019ve ever tasted. \u2018Warm\u2019 water doesn\u2019t taste very good but it\u2019s thirst-quenching all right.
