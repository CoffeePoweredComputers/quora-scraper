            "answer_text": "Generally, the size of an atom decreases as we move from left to right in the periodic table due to increase in nuclear charge. For the first transition, series starts from Sc to Zn. The size of ionic radii decreases from \u201cSc to Cr\u201d but as we move further size remain constant. This is due to the fact incoming electron occupy d subshell and \u201cdiffused\u201d d orbital electron not able to shield the outer 4s electron. As a result, the outer electron experiences a pull towards the nucleus as the nuclear charge increases and the size decreases. Order of shielding is as s>p>d>f. As we move to copper and zinc size increases because the force of repulsion caused by added electron becomes greater the attractive force (nuclear charge). So that electron cloud expands and size increases at the end of the first transition series Here is the atomic size of the first transition series (in A\u00b0) Sc \u20141.44Ti \u20141.32V \u2014 1.22Cr \u2014 1.17Mn \u20141.17Fe \u2014 1.17Co \u2014 1.16Ni \u2014 1.15Cu \u2014 1.17Zn \u2014 1.25",
