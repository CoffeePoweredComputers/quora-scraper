            "answer_text": "This is a question which many people with acne wonder about. The reasons for some people not having acne are: Age over 30 years- Usually people over the age of 30 seldom have acne since the acne prone age group is 13\u201326/27years, where hormonal stimulation of sebaceous glands occursDry skin type: People with this type of skin type are less prone to getting acne, there is less stimulation of the oil glands which usually leads to less occurance of acne in them.Patients on anti acne treatments or long course of isotretinoin also do not have acneform eruptions at one point in time.It's better to book a consultation with your Dermatologist if you are suffering from acne.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s just a spin of the genetic roulette wheel. I was born with the gene for very oily skin so I began being plagued with acne when puberty hit. My younger sister was born with the gene for much less oily skin, so she rarely if ever got a pimple. As an adult, after treatment with isotretinoin (Retin-A) plus antibiotics, I finally got rid of my chronic acne and my skin looks good now, but my younger sister has had trouble as an adult with her dry skin, which needs extra moisturizing frequently, and tends to be more wrinkly.
