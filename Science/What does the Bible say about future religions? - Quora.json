            "answer_text": "It says \u201cthou shalt have no other gods before me\u201d\u2026or rather, all other religions are wrong. That\u2019s why Jesus spends so much time in the New Testament saying (effectively) \u201cI am the new and everlasting covenant.\u201d Jesus is trying to appease that little bit of the Old Testament by saying he is God, and so he can re-write the Bible. Muhammed does much the same in the Quran. The problem, of course, is that the teachings of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Quran often contradict and disagree. Don\u2019t get me started about the Book of Mormon. So what does the Bible say about future religions? That they are right\u2026and wrong. They they are true, and false, that you should follow the old ways or leave the old ways behind. They babble for your money and obedience. This is why Penn Jillette (and others) have said that the fastest way to become an atheist is to read the Bible. ",

            "answer_text": "Universal & Eternal Religion In the history of religion a universal religion is the one which is prevalent all over the world and its followers are found in various nations and countries thus, Islam, Hinduism and Christianity are classified universal religions. However, by using the term universal religion we mean a religion that existed from the beginning of the creation of man on earth and will continue its existence insomuch as man exists on this planet. In this sense Islam was the only, is the only and will be, the only universal religion. Islam is the religion taught in its fundamentals by all the prophets. It is the religion first introduced on Earth for mankind to follow. It is the religion of Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad and all previous prophets from time immemorial. The universal religion has a universal name, and that name is ISLAM. The End of Prophethood The religion of Islam was completed and perfected at the end of the mission of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w). The Almighty God states in the Holy Quran in the last chapter revealed to the Prophet of Islam \u201cThis day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\u201d [5:3] Thus, Muhammad (s.a.w.w) was the last Prophet sent to mankind and his Message was the last divine message and since then prophethood ceased to continue. \u201cMuhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything.\u201d [33:40] In the terminology of the Quran a messenger of God is the one who brings a message and the canon law, and a prophet is usually the one was sent to man to inform them of the divine news (Naba\"). When the office of Prophethood comes to an end, it means there will be no more news and revelation, including the fact that there will be no more messengers either to give the news of their coming. The Meaning of the End of Prophethood Some Muslim thinkers such as Iqbal Lahoori and later, Dr. Shari\"ati, assumed that the meaning of the end of Prophethood is the end of divine leadership and the rise of the rational guidance. They further assumed that man\"s intellect had reached a status where he no longer needed divine guidance. His intellect has been replaced with revelation. The above interpretation of the seal of Prophethood is very misleading and results in nothing other than secularism. The actual meaning of the seal of Prophethood is that the package of the religion of God was completed and perfected and God did not need to send any more revelations to man. The perfected religion, i.e. Islam, is sufficient for all the needs of man forever. Man will not face any problems relating to his wellbeing for which the answer is not found in the teachings of Islam. http://www.islamportal.net/tags/first-and-last-religion and you can see The Holy Quran and Religion in the Last Era ",
