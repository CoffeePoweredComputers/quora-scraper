            "answer_text": "Definitely Yes! Covid - 19 can land on our clothes, shoes, hair or any other surface and survive for good period of time. Experts have given us heads up that we could find viability of virus Covid-19 on Fabrics/Clothes for hours, upto 24 hours. Although most of the clothes we wear are generally porous, making it harder for the virus to be transmissible, that does not rule out the possibility of contamination. Let\u2019s have a look on how long COVID-19 can fight for its life and stay alive on our different surfaces? On Copper: 4 hours (Note: SARS-CoV-1 lived for 8 hours)On Cardboard: 24 hours (Note: SARS-CoV-1 lived for 8 hours)On Stainless Steel: As many as 72 hoursOn Plastic: As many as 72 hoursOn Glass: Upto 96 hours So we gotta watch out if our outfit has zipper, buttons or some designs made of metals or plastic. The best thing to do is: once we\u2019re exposed outside, remove our outer-wear and shoes before entering our house/apartment/room without removing the mask. Keep those clothes just outside for more than 24 hours, much preferably in sunlight OR, wash them in temperature of 80\u00b0F or 30\u00b0C and above. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it could but you still have to somehow transfer Covid-19 on those contaminated food or clothes into your nose or mouth if what you\u2019re concerned about was getting infected by Covid-19. For your information, coronaviruses such as Covid-19 can\u2019t survive without a live host. Though, they could endure without a live host for a certain limited of time before they\u2019re dead. The amount of times that they could survive without a live host depend on the surface that they\u2019re on and the environment (e.g. temperature, humidity and etc). Covid-19 are also not one of those heat resistant virus. If you cooked your food well done and dry your cloth before you wear it, you\u2019ll be alright. If you need more guarantee, wipe or wash your stuff with alcohol or bleach. As for food, unless someone who is infected cough or sneeze on your food which is cooked well done, it is unlikely for you to be infected from those food. ",

But bear in mind that only a very small amount of the virus is likely to last that long; so,etching which is not conveyed by the charts shown in one other answer (based on the top charts below which have a log scale). Whilst I will continue to wash or quarantine my shopping, I am aware that the half-life of this virus on the various surfaces is a few hours rather than days (see violin plots at the bottom).
