            "answer_text": "Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is a tool to determine the most cost-effective option among different competing alternatives to purchase, own, operate, maintain and, finally, dispose of an object or process, when each is equally appropriate to be implemented on technical grounds. For example, for a highway pavement, in addition to the initial construction cost, LCCA takes into account all the user costs, (e.g., reduced capacity at work zones), and agency costs related to future activities, including future periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. All the costs are usually discounted and total to a present-day value known as net present value (NPV). This example can be generalized on any type of material, product, or system. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess \u2026 Life cycle costing, or whole-life costing, is the process of estimating how much money you will spend on an asset over the course of its useful life. Whole-life costing covers an asset\u2019s costs from the time you purchase it to the time you get rid of it. Buying an asset is a cost commitment that extends beyond its price tag. For example, think of a car. The car\u2019s price tag is only part of the car\u2019s overall life cycle cost. You also need to consider expenses for car insurance, interest, gas, oil changes, and any other necessary maintenance to keep the car running. Not planning for these additional costs can set you back. The cost to buy, use, and maintain a business asset adds up. Whether you\u2019re purchasing a car, a copier, a computer, or inventory, you should consider and budget for the asset\u2019s future costs. ",
