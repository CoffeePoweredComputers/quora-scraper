            "answer_text": "I would argue that Meprobamate is the closest currently legal drug to Quaalude. Quaalude (Methaqualone) is a non-barbituate, non-benzodiazepine sedative and anxiolytic medication, with barbituate-like effects, and a formula of C16H14N2O. Meprobamate is also a non-barbituate, non-benzodiazepine sedative and anxiolytic medication, with barbituate-like effects, and a formula of C9H18N2O4. While Meprobamate is still sold in the US, it has been pulled from the market in Europe and Canada due to concerns about the abuse potential and lack of therapeutic efficacy. Meprobamate was also widely abused in the US and is thought to be the \u2018little yellow pill\u2019 referred to a \u201cMothers Little Helper\u201d in the Rolling Stones song. Valium, on the other hand, is a benzodiazepine, and does not have barbituate-like properties , and contains CL, unlike Quaalude and Meprobamate. While it also has substantial abuse potential, its therapeutic efficacy is much higher. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question and one that, despite my healthcare background and substance abuse training, I had to research a bit... Quaaludes, also known as Methaqualone, were widely available in the 1970s, and as you already know, they are illegal in U.S. now, and have been for decades. That said, benzodiazepines (such as valium) have replaced quaaludes and is the closet legally available drug to them in the U.S. I hope that answers your question:) ",
