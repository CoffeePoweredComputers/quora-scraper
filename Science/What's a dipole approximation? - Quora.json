            "answer_text": "This is an approximation made in the context of light-matter interaction where the electric field associated with light(EM wave) is assumed to be a function of time alone i.e. no spatial dependence when considering its effect on the classical motion of an electron bound to an atom. In other words, spatial variations of the electric field are neglected in the vicinity of the electron. Mathematically,if  denotes the wavevector of the oscillating electric field while represents the(classical) separation between the electron and the nucleus of atom,then the dipole approximation reads: and since the magnitude of  is inversely related to the wavelength of the incident light(),it follows from this condition that . This is essentially what the dipole approximation is. ",
