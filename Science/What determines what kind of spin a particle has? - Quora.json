            "answer_text": "It\u2019s determined by what kind of particle it is. There are two kinds of particles - fermions and bosons. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half integer spin. All the stuff that makes up matter is fermions - electrons, protons, etc. (except for some composite particles which are bosons because they\u2019re made up of a number of fermions, just as twice 1/2 makes one). The stuff that makes up light is bosons. This can be derived mathematically from symmetry laws, but what determines that a particle has to obey symmetry laws? I just read a chapter of Weinberg\u2019s book on Quantum Field Theory where he tries to write down the only possible term to describe a field (or particle), and he seems to show it has to have integer / half integer spin because that\u2019s the only way it can be consistently defined, in accordance with the symmetry laws we observe (primarily Lorentz invariance; the fact that the laws of physics are the same no matter what coordinate system we choose as frame of reference.) But why does this symmetry exist? Why do particles have to behave in accordance with it? I\u2019m pretty sure nobody knows that. See also Spin\u2013statistics theorem - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The determination of the allowed spins comes from relativistic quantum mechanics and solving of the dirac equation. The dirac equation is the schrodinger eq of relativistic quantum mechanics. From the solution we recover four spinors. These four spinors consist of a spin up and down particle, as well as an anti particle pair with spin up and spin down. For the electron the four spinor is made up of 4 entries. 2 entries make up the spin up and spin down electron state, and the other 2 entries make up the spin up and spin down positron states. In classical quantum mechanics we use spinors to represent the electron spin states, as long as we restrict ourselves to non relativistic speeds, then the anti particle portion of the four spinor can be ignored, and we can treat the electron spin state alone ignoring the anti particle part of its wave function. The spin seems to be intrinsic, it naturally arises as the solution to the dirac eq. answer: spin is intrinsic, in the same sense some particles carry charge and some dont some carry spin and some dont.
