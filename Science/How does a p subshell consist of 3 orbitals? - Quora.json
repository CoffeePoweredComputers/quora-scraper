            "answer_text": "To better understand this you need to have some understanding of quantum mechanics. An electron is not a particle that orbits around the nucleus like the Earth does around the Sun. It can be viewed as a state dependent standing wave with some particle-like properties such as charge and spin. Of course quantum mechaniscs teaches us that only certain states are permitted that mathematically can be described by only some permitted integers. These states can be explained as energy, angular momentum and spin. Quantum mechanics also teaches us that these states can be described by wave functions that are found when solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. For the hydrogen atom an exact mathematical solution has been worked out. When we observe the l=1 energy state we are looking at the wave function which we call the p subshell. These wave functions have 3 representations described by the intergers m(l) of +1, 0, and -1, which are the orbitals of the p subshell. If you are going to plot these functions you would see polar coordinates (described as cosine an sine angle functions) in respectively x, y, and z-axis. To these plots a density representation can be added (also a quantum property) which represents the probability that the electron can be found at that particular position. Then you would see the well-known lobes of the 3 orbitals. ",
