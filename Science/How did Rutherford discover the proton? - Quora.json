            "answer_text": "\"After the discovery of the electron, it was realized that there must be positive charge centers within the atom to balance the negative electrons and create electrically neutral atoms. Rutherford's discovery of the nucleus demonstrated that these positive charges were concentrated in a very small fraction of the atoms' volume. In 1919 Rutherford discovered that he could change one element into another by striking it with energetic alpha particles (which we now know are just helium nuclei). In the early 1920's Rutherford and other physicists made a number experiments, transmuting one atom into another. In every case, hydrogen nuclei were emitted in the process. It was apparent that the hydrogen nucleus played a fundamental role in atomic structure, and by comparing nuclear masses to charges, it was realized that the positive charge of any nucleus could be accounted for by an integer number of hydrogen nuclei. By the late 1920's physicists were regularly referring to hydrogen nuclei as 'protons'. The term proton itself seems to have been coined by Rutherford, and first appears in print in 1920\".

            "answer_text": "The experimental setup was something like this.He took thin gold foil (micron thickness). He then proceeded to bombard the gold foil with alpha particles (helium nuclei). At that point of time, it was assumed that most of the atom was empty space (which is true). However, no one knew that there was positive charge at the center of the atom. When he got a film of the resulting alpha particles passing through, he found that some of them didn't pass through and were reflected right back. Some of them were reflected at very obtuse and some at acute angles. And the remaining (a vast majority) had passed through without deflection. Hence he came to conclude that there must be positive charge inside an atom. And this is how the proton was discovered. ",
