            "answer_text": "Albert Einstein built an entire theory, called special relativity, around the idea that the speed of light is the same for everyone who measures it, no matter how fast they are moving in relation to the light. In order to accommodate this behavior for light, Einstein\u2019s theory predicted that time and space would have to stretch or contract as someone traveled with increasing speed. And out of special relativity popped a cosmic speed limit: nothing could ever exceed the speed of light.Relativity is a cornerstone of all of modern physics, and we have no reason to doubt it \u2013 no one has ever observed an object moving faster than light. There\u2019s actually a minor clarification necessary here: Einstein\u2019s speed limit is the speed of light in a vacuum. Light slows down when it moves through a material like water or glass, and then it\u2019s perfectly possible to exceed this reduced speed of light \u2013 up to its speed in a vacuum, of course. Anything moving faster than light in water or glass produces the luminous equivalent of a sonic boom, called \u010cerenkov radiation. It\u2019s what gives underwater nuclear reactors their attractive blue glow.But About that Warp Drive\u2026 Of all of the attempts to wiggle out of Einstein\u2019s speed limit, probably the most plausible is theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre\u2019s \u201cwarp drive\u201d. Alcubierre\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t violate the cosmic speed limit \u2013 it goes around it. Try filling a greasy frying pan with water and then put a drop of soap into the pan. The grease will fly away to the sides of the pan.  Alcubierre\u2019s warp drive does the same thing with space itself. Alcubierre showed that by a suitable distribution of matter, you can shrink space in front of your spaceship and stretch it behind the spaceship, creating a small bubble around the ship that moves as fast as you like. Because space is contracting in front of the ship, the ship wouldn\u2019t officially be moving faster than the speed of light. In fact, the ship would actually be at rest relative to the warp bubble, and the people inside the ship wouldn\u2019t even feel any acceleration. Talk about a smooth ride! ",

            "answer_text": "If you travel at 99.5% of the speed of light, departing on 25 December 2015 for 5 years in a circular route and return to Earth, you will only have aged 5 years, but everyone else on Earth will have aged 50 years and the date will be 25 December 2065. You have therefore traveled into the future. If you traveled in a straight line, you will have reached a point 50 light years away from earth. For the crew on the space ship, they would have experienced travel at 10 times the speed of light. So according to them, they traveled faster than light. You cannot reach the speed of light since you have mass, as explained hundreds of times on Quora in different posts. Unless we develop technology like the Alcubierre drive, we will always have relativistic time dilation effects and large discrepancies between the time experienced by our space ship crews and the rest of humanity remaining on Earth. Look at it this way: When you travel in space, the faster you go, the more energy you have to exert on your space ship to increase your speed. Approaching the speed of light, your relativistic mass (or momentum) increases quadratically. For you as an observer on your space ship, you are stationary and the rest of the universe is flying past you at close to the speed of light. To accelerate faster, you have to increase the speed of the entire universe, with its mass, to go faster. That is clearly impossible. That is why, for velocities to ever approach c (light speed), you will have to create a bubble around your space ship that is totally removed from the rest of the universe and that bubble will now be your entire universe. Then it becomes more feasible to consider accelerating that small portion of space by bending space around that bubble, but your space ship inside it actually remains stationary. Therein lies the problem. To \"bend space around your bubble\" by contracting the space in front of and expanding space behind your private space bubble to create a wave to then race into the future, will require an incredible amount of energy. The best current models require an engine and ship manufactured from exotic matter with negative mass as well as energy equivalent to the 100% efficient conversion of 700 kg of mass directly to energy. Those two factors alone require technologies that are possibly still centuries away from being developed, managed and controlled. I wish it was not so. I am as passionate as you seem to be about the possibility of the human race upgrading to a true spacefaring species. The technological hurdles are vast though. I will cheer with you as soon as an alternative method of traveling to the stars is found and our first interstellar space ship is launched. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret that scientists have known for years. It is not a conspiracy theory, there is no cover up, all the information is publicly available and if you walk to any science teacher and show them what I am about to tell you they will confirm it. Not only are we able to move faster than light, it is being done everyday by a substantial quantity of people. In fact the answer is so simple that not too many people talk about it outside classrooms. I\u2019ll explain the details later. But before you can pack your bags you have to ask the question What for? Do you want to go for a weekend getaway to Mars? Or go around the solar system just to check how it looks like? How about taking off a sabbatical year to visit Alpha Centauri? For some reason along millennia of evolution our brains got wired in such a way that we are never satisfied. We are always looking for the fastest car, the cheapest price for the most luxurious item. We scan magazines to see who is richer, who works less, who broke which record, you name it. Let\u2019s say you like to run, and you want to be the fastest man alive. Through excersise, will power, sacrifice and discipline you manage to run the finals of the 100 meters in the Olympics and not only do you win, you shatter the record by two seconds. After the anti-doping test you are awarded the Gold Medal. The next day your name is in the cover of every newspaper in the world. Three months later most people won't really care about the broken record. The same would happen if we discovered that pi is a rational number after all, or that a billionaire managed to build a beautiful, sustainable, affordable hotel orbiting one of Jupiter\u2019s moons. It would be a headline in the news for a few days, maybe a few weeks. Remember the Higgs boson? I may be wrong but traveling faster than light doesn't have that much appeal. You will have to squeeze in a small spacecraft for several years, recycle every little molecule of supplies, burn through staggering quantities of fuel to go to a place where you don't know what you are going to find only to come back and find out that anyone you knew is already dead and you are rushed through an evolved society that you don't know anything about and explain to scientists what were your findings. After that, a few headlines and the whole thing is tucked in a drawer in a few months. The only way that humanity will make faster than light travel a common household is if we find a way to monetize it. Now back to the issue. I have a car that travels at 1600 km an hour. Very safely, I don't even have to put my hands on the wheel and I could take a nap at that speed. When I wake up I can push it a little bit more and get it up to over 1800 km an hour. The secret is knowing what to measure the speed relative to. Compared to a point 13.8 billion light years away, the age of the universe, we are moving at about 340,000 km/s. That is 13% faster than light. Not much we can do with it but that's ok. There is still plenty of fun stuff to do around here anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans will indeed travel at the speed of light - digitized.  You are not the same atoms you were years ago - many get replaced over time, while you remain.  \"You\" are a pattern written in atoms, not the atoms themselves, just like this website is magnetic and electrical patterns stored in electrical devices, or photons speeding through optical fiber, or photons spilling off a screen.   How many bits does it take to faithfully copy a human?  A bunch.  How much energy is needed to represent all that?  The greatest possible energy amount is the food energy you've consumed over your lifetime, since that was sufficient to make all your cells and make all your synapses and memories.  2000 calories a day for 50 years is 50 kilowatt hours, about $5.00 worth of electricity, or enough energy to move a 70 kilogram person up to 20% of earth escape velocity at 100% efficiency. It is more complicated, of course - a neural \"bit\"  is about 20,000 electron volts (a very small unit of energy), while a bit at room temperature can be transmitted with about 20 milli-electron volts.  We can  (in principle) move the bits in your brain a million times more efficiently with technology rather than with meat.  While you have more than one genome in your body (the genes get modified and methylated as you grow, and there are vastly more chromosomes and genes in the bacteria in your gut), these data sets are mostly alike and can be \"compressed\".   Probably all that data can be compressed without losses by another factor of a billion.  The result could be used to build a molecularly accurate copy of you.   On the other hand, if we transmit your bits to a distant star, we will need some very large, very accurately made, very accurately pointed transmission and receive dishes - and even with those, we must transmit quintillions of times more power than will be captured by the receiver at the other end.  So we are back to needing \"lots\" of energy - perhaps thousands of dollars worth.    But how much energy would it take to send you surrounded by a minaturized biosphere to keep you alive to the stars?   Your fraction of the global biomass (plants and animals and microbes) is about 80 metric tons of carbon - assume your share of starship biomass and water and air and equipment support is about a thousand tons (much smaller than your Spaceship Earth support mass of about a trillion tons).   Assume you have a 100% efficient electromagnetic accelerator launching you towards the stars at 90% of the speed of light.   That will require about 20 billion gigawatt hours, about 200 years of global production at current rates;  quite a bit more than thousands of dollars worth of electricity.  For just you, not your crewmates (though most of the \"crew\" will be frozen zygotes).   A one gee accelerator would need to be 4 trillion kilometers long - about 0.4 light years - and it would have to be aligned to within micrometers, or the sideways vibrations would smash you to jelly.  And of course, you will need a slowdown track at the other end. I won't even bother to compute the energy needed for a rocket (presumably powered by matter and antimatter) constrained by the Tsiolkovskii exponential rocket formula - my calculator only does 2 digit exponents. So yes, if we go at all, we will go as bits, probably preceded by a wave of slow von Neumann replicator robots building receivers at the far end.  Meat bodies are fragile, and few survive past a century - you die with a fraction of the neurons you were born with, few or no replacements (we know this because of neuron DNA isotope ratios of autopsied human brains born before, during, or after the years of above-ground nuclear testing).  So if you want to live long enough to go to a distant star with a shirtsleeve planetary system (unlike the thousands of hellholes imaged by Kepler) you must recopy your brain digitally, one way or another.  You may want to store your mind as bits for a few kiloyears anyway, while all the equipment is built and deployed. ",

            "answer_text": "Having mass, humans can never travel at the speed of light, nothing with mass can. However, there is nothing in the laws of physics which prevents an object with mass, including us, from traveling as close to the speed of light as we can technologically manage it. The most important technological barrier to such travel is of course the development of a power plant capable of achieving those speeds. There is also a problem of induced radiation by free protons in the depths of space. These free protons would be traveling at 99.9999% the speed of light relative to the spaceship. There would have to be some kind of shielding required to keep those protons from zipping through the spaceship and the bodies of the crew, which would kill them. Questions like this often generate answers which describe near lightspeed travel and how much a person engaged in that travel would age compared to those people that were left behind. For further information you can read about the Twin Paradox. It is a thought experiment in which there are two twins, and one of them goes on a near lightspeed journey out into space and returns to Earth. The traveling twin has aged very little while the earthbound twin has aged very much. This thought experiment takes into account the acceleration of the spacecraft departing, turning around, and slowing down to get back to Earth. But rarely have I seen this acceleration accounted for in a way that deals with the health of the crew, as regards the acceleration forces upon the them. So here is what a near lightspeed journey would actually require to preserve the health, even the life, of the crew. Acceleration in a vehicle is measured as G forces. The force of gravity here on the surface of the Earth is 1G. It is what we live with, it is what we are accustomed to, and it is what our bodies have a evolved to live with. A force of two G\u2019s, for example, would cause your body to feel as though it weighed twice as much as it actually does on the surface of the Earth. That\u2019s not a problem for limited periods of time, in fact human beings can withstand seven or eight G\u2019s for limited periods of time. But a force of two G\u2019s, over an extremely long period of time, would most certainly be detrimental to the crew of a spaceship accelerating enough to create that strength of force. This means that a space vehicle intended to travel at very close to the speed of light, would have to accelerate up to that speed so that the crew experienced 1G, in other words the same force experienced here on earth. Let us assume that a vehicle is capable of traveling 99.9999% the speed of light. The vehicle departs and begins the long, slow process of acceleration up to the its near lightspeed capability . It would take about 12 years to accelerate up to that very great speed while maintaining a force of 1G on the crew. By the time that 12 years has gone by, the ship will have traveled about 113,000 light years. The vessel would already have exited the Milky Way galaxy. Let\u2019s assume that deceleration occurs very soon after the ship reaches its top speed. It would take another 12 years to decelerate to a speed which would make reentry into a planet\u2019s atmosphere feasible. That means another 113,000 lightyears has been traveled by the spaceship. The crew would have aged approximately 24 years. Those left behind on earth are long gone, as 126,000 years will have passed. If the journey was a round-trip, the vessel would require the deceleration from near light speed down to a speed in which a turnaround could be executed without having to describe an enormous half circle to do so. It would then take another 12 years to accelerate, and finally another 12 years to decelerate down to a manageable speed in order to re-enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The crew will have aged a minimum of 48 years during such a journey, while the Earth would have aged a total of approximately 252,000 years. An interesting thing will have happened while the vessel was gone: the earth would\u2019ve made one complete revolution around the center of the Milky Way galaxy during the time the spaceship was gone, because it takes approximately 1/4 billion years to make that revolution. Have a safe trip. ",

Not to bore you with the scientific \u2018facts\u2019 that \u2018prove\u2019 we can\u2019t, allow me to list a few conditions that would easily enable mankind to travel at or faster than light. ***Disclaimer: Truth is different from Fact. Truth never changes, but human Facts usually change with advancement in our understanding of the fundamental principles that describe the patterns of our universe. Notice my use of the word principles instead of laws. Laws die or change periodically, but principles generally do not. Laws restrict, but principles guide you to the truth. *** We need to be able to understand Gravity, especially Gravitation, it\u2019s principles\u2026and how it works, down to the last variable in the equation. Gravitation is as much a Constraint, as it is a State of movement-related being, as well as a pointer to an invisible medium and a Principle! Once we understand what it is and how it works, that knowledge will have dramatic effects on our understanding of how every object is \u2018kept\u2019 in position relative to each other in the Universe. Motion is a relative thing, because if the object you are attempting to approach constantly moves at the same rate of speed as you are, you will either feel like you are vibrating in place, stationary, or still, everything else apart from you and the object you wish to approach appearing to move, which, of course would make your motion appear like non-motion. Mankind has used Gravity in calculations for centuries. \u201cAcceleration due to Gravity\u2026Gravitational Potential Energy, etc\u201d are some of the calculations that run in mission-critical space explorations. However, we barely understand what Gravity is! The day we do, our civilization will come closer to being able to roam the stars at will\u2026in reasonable man-time.To achieve light speed, we need machines that can move through air and vacuum without perturbing the molecules of air, or the Ether itself. Perturbation must be reduced to less than 0.02%, or movement at that speed will cause many miniature explosions to build up into a fire that would burn the craft. When we find a way of moving through space-time with crafts that move while leaving molecules of air and space in general 3-dimensional position, the direct result will be almost limitless capacity for acceleration, because the natural barriers to movement would have been bypassed. Focus on movement with the aid of atoms and molecules, instead of against them, and many propulsion miracles will reveal themselves. We must master the Ether, and Nikola Tesla came closest to bringing us to a Space-Time travel Epiphany.We must stop combusting air or other fuels in order to gain enough propulsion force. Instead, we need to focus on energy conversions, since that would keep natural principles of energy (everything is energy) inviolate, and the side-effects of propulsion clean or near zero. Real-time transmutation of energy, while harnessing some of it for propulsion and converting the by-products into clean, non-destructive forms would make us travel through space-time with near-zero constraints.We must understand the relationship that Time, Space and Gravity have with each other. Time as we know it will make it impossible for us to travel as far as we would want to, even in our own galaxy. We need to see Time differently. It\u2019s like a limiting cage\u2026amorphous in attributes (we can only measure one dimension of it right now, which is odd given the fact that we live in a 3-dimensional world at the very least.If science has discovered that two or more exact copies of a sub-atomic particle can exist simultaneously in space, which is also explained at this website, and we now know that everything in space-time is quantum-level connected, then all we need to do is figure out how to use that knowledge and the principles involved to pin-point two positions (or co-ordinates in space), and move from \u2018origin\u2019 to \u2018destination\u2019 and back, in a matter of seconds, no matter the \u2018distance\u2019 of the two points (or stars) from each other.The day we have replicable answers to these three focus points, we will travel as fast as\u2026or faster than light. Your arguments are welcome\u2026 :-) ",

            "answer_text": "We can\u2019t travel faster than light with any known physics. The \u201cwarp drive\u201d concept requires the discovery of \u201cnegative energy\u201d - the \u201cwormhole\u201d approach requires more energy than is contained in the entire visible universe. Simply putting big-assed engines on a spaceship can\u2019t get you up to the speed of light (let along beyond it). The lorenz transform (which is at the heard of Einstein\u2019s relativity math) says that if an object were to travel faster than the speed of light, then it\u2019s mass, length and rate of time progression would be the square root of a negative number\u2026which is also impossible. So unless some new physics comes along, we\u2019re not going to be going at the speed of light, or beyond it. The limiting speed (per the laws of physics) is very, very close to the speed of light\u2026but as you inch ever closer to that speed, the energy requirements go up extremely rapidly, so the last 0.001% eats more energy than humans will ever be able to harness. I believe the fastest design for a practical spacecraft could maybe reach a third of light speed\u2026but it would take a long time to accelerate up to that speed, and it would take a truly insane effort on the part of the entire human race to build and launch it. Basically, unless we discover some really radical (and helpful!) errors in our knowledge of the laws of physics, we\u2019re pretty much stuck within the bounds of our solar system for the forseeable future. The best chance to get humans out to the nearby stars is either: * Very slow, gigantic, generational starships - where people live, work and die - spending their entire lives (and those of their children, grandchildren, etc) on board the spacecraft. * Some kind of deep sleep/hibernation system to extend our lives out to thousands of years in a way where we would need very little energy and no food or water to maintain life support. * (My favorite) Leave our bodies behind. When someone is near death, scan their brain and convert them into software running inside a computer - send a very small, lightweight probe to the next solar system (taking hundreds of years to get there) - transmit the \u201csoftware\u201d that is that person\u2019s intellect to the craft (at the speed of light) and allow the person to visit the star and then be transmitted back to earth with all of their new memories. The trip would take zero time (from the perspective of the person going out there). Possibly have the probe be capable of constructing human-like robots to house these transmitted brains. With this technology, we could populate the universe with our intellects inside robotic bodies\u2026and our intellects would be able to flit from star to star as radio waves - at the speed of light - and to the traveller, it would seem just like instantaneous teleportation.

            "answer_text": "Humankind will never get even close to light speed. Neither will humankind go and travel between the stars. At four light years to the nearest star, it would take 400 years to travel at 1% the speed of light and 40 years at 10% the speed of light. One percent light speed is 6,700,000 mph. The absurd notion of traveling at that speed is missed by people indoctrinated with science religion. Space is nonexistent, and all reality is a deep physical reality composite of quantum particles and sparticles to a high degree, with the density of quantum particles internal to the Substance Monism being a infinite density of quantum particles. Traveling through space means that the micro and micro-micro particles in sub-plenums, that tunnel through Einstein-Rosen Bridges at ultra-high frequencies, would begin to interact with the \u201con mass shell\u201d particles of the spaceship and crew, and that\u2019s not good. Then there\u2019s the micro-abrasive particles and bodies, and with Einstein\u2019s Principle of Equivalence of Accelleration and Inertia,well, one knows that\u2019s not good, either. The ludicrous speculative nonsense about atoms in a void, of ghost particles and the scalar Higgs boson, the beliefs in vacuum theory, has caused religious elites with scientific credentials to propound the nonsense that space/time can be manipulated for a spaceship, when it is obvious to the absolute materialistic thinker that the plenum would be manipulated much easier for ultra-fast interstellar communications technology and that spaceship travel at those speeds is as likely as \u201cteleportation\u201d and \u201ctime travel\u201d. The likelihood of those later two ideas is \u201czero \u201c. Not only is traveling at 1% the speed of light is dangerous, but it is not even a good idea to travel at any speed for biological beings, and certainly not for long periods. Interstellar communications technology and optical telescopes working in giant networks are what we need. Then there\u2019s AI robotic exploration, but that\u2019s costly beyond the solar system. The main problem is the obtuse quantum mechanics science religion that denies philosophical materialism as an important ontological tool in understanding what is being observed by experimental science. George W Hill went over that issue in his analysis of the Michealson-Morley experiment. The Unified Field Theory, which I do hope to publish, against the nonsense of the Marxist Leninist toads that have introduced Max Sternerism and bourgeoisie quantum mechanics science religion and bourgeoisie sociology and psychology into their objective beliefs ( the betrayal is ripe), and against the imperialist capitalist elites that are going along with their plans for Corporate State dictatorship, includes the provable idea that the Universe is at light speed, that all deep physical reality can be considered a light geometrical reality of quantum physics and explained by new quiddity mathematics. Thus, philosophy, science, mathematics is all unified and a true M-Theory is knowable. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to answer this question in three parts, because I think there are unstated assumptions and implications in the original question. First, I assume the question is whether a spacecraft can be built and operated to safely transport a human to a distant location and back again. I am going to treat \u201cever\u201d as \u201cwithin 200 years\u201d because I think 200 years is longer than anyone could reasonably be expected to extrapolate current knowledge and technology in any field. So, the three parts are: 1. Can we build a spacecraft that can travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light, say, within 90 percent? 2. Can we build a spacecraft that can travel at exactly the speed of light? 3. Can we build a spacecraft that can travel at faster than the speed of light? The answer to the first question is maybe. It is an extremely difficult problem because of the difficulty of accelerating a massive object to very high speeds. The fastest object we have put into space is the Juno mission, which reached about 0.013 percent of the speed of light. Accelerating a spacecraft with the mass necessary to carry a human and all the required support equipment to a speed more than 5000 times the speed of Juno would be a daunting task. The energy alone is more than any current technology could provide, and we are currently unable to make technology reliable enough to support a human for the duration. We also don't have the technology to protect a spacecraft from impacts with anything it might hit, like a little piece of rock the size of a grain of sand. At that speed, the energy released by such an impact would be devastating. However, it is just possibly imaginable that we could develop current technology to the point that it would be possible to travel at very high speeds, possibly approaching 90 percent of the speed of light. But I doubt it. The answer to the second question is definitely no; we won't be able to travel at the speed of light, or even within a fraction of a percent. We don't have the means to accelerate a massive object to that speed, and there is no reason to expect that we ever will. Actually reaching the speed of light would pose what appear to be insoluble physical problems, so I think we can discount that possibility. You may be aware that the mass of an object increases as it is accelerated towards the speed of light. That means that the energy required to accelerate it increases as well. In the real world, the laws of physics mean that the closer you get to the speed of light, the harder it gets to go any faster. The answer to the third question is also no. There appears to be some means not excluded by the currently known laws of physics that might allow travel that appears to exceed the speed of light but actually does not. The effect would be that a traveler could reach a distant point in less time than it would take light to reach that point, but because the technology involves warping space, the actual speed would not exceed the speed of light. However, there is a difference between something that does not violate known physical principles and something that can actually be done. Sometimes the laws of physics are so stringent that achieving the physically possibly is not physically practical. In this case, the energy that would apparently be required to do the space warping is so great that there is no physically practical way to provide it, even assuming very favorable technology developments. It also appears that this method would require things that appear not to be physically possible. So, even though some people discuss it as if it were possible, it really doesn\u2019t appear to be possible. Even for the \"maybe\" answer, I would not place any large bets on our ability to do it.

            "answer_text": "As objects move faster and closer to the speed of light, they gain mass.  The more massive an object, the more energy it needs to move even faster.  This energy adds even MORE mass to the object.  Inevitably, this process reaches a point of no return when the mass of the object becomes larger than any available energy that can accelerate it further.  That point is the speed of light.  At that point, your mass would be infinite (which is impossible) and the energy it would take to get you there would be infinite (also impossible).  So no, you can't travel at the speed of light.  Nothing with any mass can, not even subatomic particles.  Light has no mass, so in clear space it is always traveling at the \"speed of light\" by definition.  You, as a massive particle, can get close, but it's entirely impractical in terms of energy required, time dilation effects, Fitzgerald's contraction, having starlight ahead of you become dangerous x-rays and gamma rays, etc.  In the fastest particles ever detected, called hyper speed cosmic rays, we have observed subatomic particles, single protons, packing the mass and energy of a fast-pitch baseball.  We have no idea how it gets that much energy, but it is still a bit slower than the speed of light. I write science fiction, and that speed of light is a problem.  There are irresistibly many times I want my characters to have some contact or dialogue with critters on another star.  The reader would get bored while my characters travelled thousands of years for one side of a message to start a dialogue.  So I have to invent ways to get around that limitation.  I have always avoided the Star Trek idea of \"warp speed\", which has never had even a pseudoscientific explanation and therefore smacks strongly of \"deus ex machine\".  I have resorted to tachyonic transmission, entanglement, and extra-dimensional shortcuts, however, none of which have any observable basis in real physics, but at least I can explain them to a reader.

            "answer_text": "As you might well know, it's not possible to travel at the speed of light, according to Einstein's equation. The speed of light is not really a fixed speed (in a manner of speaking), it's sort of like a boundary, one that constantly adjusts to match your speed. Here's something to think about. Supposing you were standing on a platform observing a ball being bounced inside a train on it's wall. As the ball moves forward from the person, it would have a velocity V from both your perspective and that of the thrower. Now supposing the train starts moving in the direction of the throw, the thrower still observes a velocity V whilst you would now observe a velocity W = V + V1, where V1 is the velocity of the train. Now instead of a ball, replace that with a beam of light. Intuitively, you'd expect that when the train starts moving, the person on the train with the beam would observe the speed of light to be C and you would observe a C + V1, but not so, you'd both observe the same speed C. Come to think of it, it's sort of like trying to catch up with the horizon. No matter how fast one might travel, it would always be ahead of you. Now, let's even suppose that we could infact travel at the speed of light. Usually in an enclosed environment, you would not be aware of the speed at which you are moving relative to objects that are outside the enclosing environment. For example, we are not aware that the earth on which we live is moving, nor that the solar system itself is moving, nor that the galaxy is moving, and so on up to the universe itself and whatever contains the universe :) So in essence, so long the craft you are traveling in can weather the strain, then you are fine, but you'd definitely not expect to survive if you were hurled at the speed of light into space without any protection. Just as a side note.Unless new theories come up that either expose a wholly new side to the theories of relativity, I suspect that space travel will not be accomplished via FTL travel, but probably by using other techniques that would bend or warp space-time or create temporal wormholes to connect distant regions of space.

            "answer_text": "No, I don't think so.  But a hundred years later - who knows? Well, with the currently available technology, the answer is NO. Let's take a look at the fastest man-made object ever. You'd imagine it was a spacecraft or a rocket. No. Believe it or not, it was a MANHOLE-COVER! On August 27, 1957 -  at the New Mexico (USA) Nuclear Test Site, a bomb was detonated in a 1.20 meter dia hole in the ground 150 meters deep, covered with a 100 mm thick solid steel lid - much like a manhole cover. The blast instantly vaporized the entire multi-ton concrete stuff in the hole and shot it up the tube as a multi-ton wave of vaporized matter at extremely high temperature, pressure, and velocity. The shaft had, in effect, become a enormous gun barrel with the energy of billions of kilograms of TNT.  As it happens, a very high speed film camera was recording the event and was expected to capture in slow motion the path and speed of any ejecta from the hole. Unfortunately, the camera, which had quite a wide view of top of the hole and and the area around and above, recorded the \u201cmanhole cover\u201d on only one frame. There was no malfunction of the camera, it\u2019s just that the \u201cmanhole cover\u201d blasted out of sight so fast that the camera only saw it for one frame. Later calculations showed that the heretofore mundane four-foot metal disk had been launched at six times Earth\u2019s escape velocity. That\u2019s about 250,000 km per hour!  70 km per second!  Nine times faster than the Space Shuttle, six times faster than the fastest moon rockets. Faster than the Voyager spacecraft, which, having reached over 56,500 km per hour, are now leaving the solar system and have for years been claimed to be the fastest man-made objects ever.  The  \u201cmanhole cover\u201d  in a fraction of a second, achieved more than four times the speed it took Voyager 1 decades to attain. It was the first time for an object to burn and disintegrate while going up from the surface of the Earth!! I mentioned this to let you know that 250,000 km per hour is the fastest that a man-made object has ever attained even with the help of a nuclear explosion.   The only way astronauts can safely travel at meaningful velocity is by employing a \"Relativistic Rocket\" that accelerates at 1g.  In two years of spacecraft time (roughly 4 years of Earth time) it would have reached  a little over 90% of light speed. The problem is, such a rocket would require enormous amount of fuel for a journey. We need to wait till scientists find out more efficient fuel. Therefore, it seems to me, the best combination of rocket, fuel, and the rest of it may only be able to push a spacecraft to around 50,000 km per hour and not more. But - a hundred years from now - WHO KNOWS? ",

            "answer_text": "There is a giant problem to go at or near the speed of Light. As you approach light speed, both the Matter that forms your body, your spaceship and even the very thin gas that it throughout interstellar space that is pushed forward by your spaceship is getting heavier. That does mean that whatever propellent you are using will get heavier. That does mean the energy quanta||the Bosons generated by the Atomic interactions happening inside the vessel will be going slower. At approximately 259,792,458m/s, the Bosons will be going half as fast. Though because the matter spacecraft that is generating them weighs twice as much, the Bosons will weigh twice as much too. The equation for kinetic energy |Ke| is Ke=.5mv^2 So the mass is doubled, their velocity is cut down to half the speed of Light. Multiplied, that means the energy of those Bosons is cut in half. And it is dealing with Matter that weighs twice as much. Bosons also lose mass as they slow. Its reasonable to presume they loose mass at the inverse of the curve matter gains it. The matter would have an infinite Mass at light speed; Bosons are zero at the same. If the distortion is 2.0, they will be going half as fast. On the inverse curve of the matter gain, Bosons will weigh 0.75 what they do at Light speed. So the total Ke loss factor for Bosons will be Ke = 2*(0.5^2)*0.75 Ke = 0.375 So at 259,792,458m/s the Spacecraft will weigh twice as much. The energy used to propel the Spacecraft, maintain its structure and the movements inside the Spacecraft will reduce by a factor of 0.375. It doesn\u2019t need to be too extreme. Think about how the tiny difference in the average mass of the nucleons changes so fundamentally the properties of the Element they are part of. The most stable atom on the Table of Elements is Iron. It has 2 stable isotopes: Fe54 and Fe56. Would an Fe54 atom be as stable if its nuclear weight were 107.88 instead of 53.94, and the kinetic energy of the Bosons that kept it stable was reduced by a factor of 0.375? Isn\u2019t travelling at Relativistic velocities a little more complicated than talking more slowly?. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to define what it means to travel at the speed of light.  Let's say you are in a foot race with a beam of light. The starting gun fires, and you take off at your sprinting speed. According to the second postulate of relativity, all inertial observers measure the speed of light as c. That means someone standing at the starting line will observe the light beam move to the finish line at c. It means that you too, while sprinting, will observe the light beam move off at c. Let's say the light beam gives you a small head start. From your perspective, the beam of light passes you at c. So the light beam always matches your speed, and then adds c to its own velocity. You increase your speed, and  (to you) the light beam increases it's speed accordingly. So the issue is not that you can't match the beam of light, it's that you can't even get beyond 0% of the light beam's speed.  Note that by a stopwatch which you carry, there is no minimum constraint on how 'fast' you can complete the race, fast here in the sense of 'less time'. No matter what time you finish the race, you can always do the race again 'faster' and achieve a better (less) time, by a stopwatch you carry with you.  But of course, the light beam always passes you at c, so no matter how little you race completion time is, the light beam's is always less (no head start anymore for you), and it always wins the race  (reaches the finish line first). So you can go as fast as you like, you just can't go faster than light.  Naturally, an observer at the finish line will agree that the light beam finishes first: different observers may disagree about the sequence of events at points separated in space-time, but they will all agree on the sequence of events at a single point in space.  Let's say the race track is 10 light minutes long, as measured by a tape measure stretched from the starting line to the finishing line. That means to an observer on the sidelines, the race always lasts exactly 10 minutes, since light always wins. In other words, prior to the race, identical clocks are set up at the start and finish lines, and light signals are exchanged to synchronize them. So if an observer near one clock notes the time as 12:10, through a telescope the other clock would read 12:00. If the race is scheduled to start at 3:00 pm, observers near the start line will see you and the light beam take off when that clock reads 3:00, and observers near the finish line will see the light beam cross the finish line when that clock reads 3:10. The finish line clock will always read some time after 3:10 when you cross the finish line.  So to observers on the sidelines, the distance is 10 light minutes and your time is more than 10 minutes, so your speed is always less than c. But remember, by your stopwatch, you can complete the race in as little time as you like. So let's say you complete the race and your stopwatch reads 1 minute. Observers on the side lines will agree your clock only ticked off 1 minute during the race  (cameras at the start and finish lines can capture your clock and the start/finish line clock to verify).  Observers on the sidelines will conclude your clock runs slow.  [Note that you will agree with all these clock readings. But by relatively theory, from your perspective  the clocks at the start and finish lines should run slow compared to your own. If you took careful measurements, you would conclude the start and finish line clocks are not synchronized, so they don't fairly measure the time elapsed on your stopwatch.] So if you think you finished a 10 light minute long race track in 1 minute, does that mean you traveled faster than c? If you completed the race in 1 minute, since light always wins, it must have completed the race in less than a minute. That means to you, the race track can't be 10 light minutes long, it has to be less than a light minute long. So the measuring tape stretched from start to finish lines has apparently contracted.  So everyone ultimately agrees you never travel faster than c, even though you and the people on the sidelines disagree on just about everything else.  Notice I never invoked 'relativistic mass' in my explanation. That you can't go as fast as light is directly implied by the second postulate, not by some mass/velocity equation. In fact, the equation is derived from the second postulate, so attempts to prove you can't go as fast as light using the equation is circular logic. It's not like if you had a space-ship and no matter how much energy you fed to your rocket engines your on board speedometer would top out just before hitting c. It doesn't work like that. There is no 'barrier' like the sound barrier. You can fire up your rocket engines as high as you like and get somewhere, anywhere, in as little time as you like. But because of the relatively of time and space, different observers will have different interpretations of exactly what happened.  I am continually amazed at how many people on quora claiming to have degrees in physics, even PhDs, who still cling to this ridiculous and incorrect explanation involving relativistic mass. At best, relativistic mass might find its way into the equations of externally powered flight, such as a slingshot or a particle accelerator. But for an internally powered space-ship, there is no relativistic mass increase from the perspective of the ship, so how could relativistic mass explain why the ship cannot go as fast as light? In fact such a ship can go as fast as it likes which is what we would expect intuitively, as long as we understand that 'fast' refers to time, not velocity.  ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say you accelerated at a rate of 98.1 m s^-2, you would be feeling a g-force of 10 g. That is already quite serious g-force and according to this article: g-force - Wikipedia, a person will be in trouble if they experience 10 g for 30 seconds or more. It will take about 3 million seconds at this acceleration to reach to speed of light. That is about 35 days. If you want to actually survive, the acceleration has to be lower and it will take longer. Lets say you take 3 g for 117 days, that should do it. However the amount of energy needed is so huge that I would say it is not possible to do. E=1/2*m*v^2 For something the weight of the space shuttle (only space shuttle itself, not boosters), it would take an energy of about E=5.0*10^21 J = 1.2*10^6 megaton TNT. The Tsar bomba, the biggest baddest atomic bomb ever built, has an energy content of 51 megaton TNT. You would need the energy of 24000 Tsar Bombas. So the main problem is: how do you strap 24000 Tsar Bombas onto or in your space shuttle and somehow use their energy for propulsion, in an efficient and safe way? I think at this point it is safe to say that having humans travel at the speed of light is pretty darn hard.   This is just the explosion of ONE of such a bomb. EDIT: I did not take into account special relativity. In special relativity it would take even more energy because you asymptotically approach the speed of light, and the last bit costs more and more and more. This is so to speak a first order best-case scenario. So if even the best case, optimalistic scenario concludes that it is not possible, you can be sure there is no hope that it will ever be possible in reality. Think of it like if you had a construction project for something like a bridge or a tunnel, and even the most optimistic and best case scenario is ALREADY too expensive, you can be certain that the true cost is MORE and you have no hope of being able to afford that.

            "answer_text": "In practical terms, probably no. The most believable starship that humanity could actually build using current technology is the Project Orion (nuclear propulsion). It uses a propulsion system made of small atomic bombs and could conceivably go at around 3-5% of the speed of light. This concept is theoretically sound and could probably be realised in practice with an investment on the order of that of the Apollo program. It is designed to reach the outer planets in the solar system, in timeframes of a few weeks rather than a few years and so is suitable for humans. If we wanted to settle on the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, that would currently be our only option. A more advanced concept from the 1970s using small thermonuclear bombs is the Project Daedalus. That one is designed to reach 12% the speed of light, but is not doable today, and is not designed to take on humans, only automated probes. At this speed, reaching the closest stars beyond Sol would take decades, and we do not possess a life support system that would last that long and could fit into a reasonable volume. Other concepts within the realm of known physics, for instance using antimatter, could theoretically go faster, but they are in the realm of science fiction in terms of feasibility. We do not have the means to produce any usable amount of anti-matter. Due to the E=mc^2 equivalence between matter and energy, creating matter or anti-matter requires enormous amount of energy. In theory it there is no physical impossibility forbidding endless 1G acceleration that would allow a starship to reach any speed close to c, as others have pointed out. However the practical way to sustain this endless acceleration do not exist, as far as we know. For those interested, here is an accurate online calculator that factors in things like the amount of fuel needed given a known payload and fuel conversion rate efficiency: Space travel calculator ",

            "answer_text": "It is certainly conceivable that we will travel at near the speed of light. Acceleration at 1g is very comfortable; it feels like Earth's gravity. If you accelerate at 1g for a year, and (for now) ignore relativity, you would reach a velocity of 3.1\u00d7108 meters per second after one year, slightly faster than the speed of light. If you take relativity into account, and accelerate at 1g (in your proper frame) for a year, you get to 76% the speed of light.  I don't think we can currently rule out the possibility that we will someday be able to accelerate at 1g for a year. It is not inherently impossible. Some people will argue that at such high velocities, we would be killed by the ionizing radiation of ordinary hydrogen atoms that fill space; but I disagree. I think we could design a magnetic shield that would deflect them. After two years at 1g acceleration, you would reach 97% of the speed of light. After 3 years, 99.5%.  You would never actually reach the speed of light because to do that would take infinite energy, more than the entire energy in the universe.  The key to doing these acceleration calculations is this: For an acceleration a in your proper frame, the acceleration in the laboratory frame is a/\u03b33, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. That factor of  1/\u03b33 prevents you from ever reaching the speed of light. ",

            "answer_text": "Is there a reason you think that Wikipedia and Quora are so different that we'd have the answers that would tickle your fancy? They're both fairly well-moderated databases of realistic crowd-sourced information. Did wiki mention ion engines? Continuous acceleration in the absence of counteracting forces (atmosphere or solar wind) is promising. Nuclear [bomb] engines? The acceleration is troubling, but it fits nicely with Newton's 3rd law. There is a treatise against it. Railgun? Even more destructive acceleration. Solar sail? Only works up to the heliopause. Laser-motivated solar sail? Inverse square law means the laser had better be super damn powerful.  Warp drives? There's nothing less than purely hypothetical about them. The recently reported EM chamber? Scientists believe it was a fluke, an anomaly of test equipment. It violates the conservation of energy law. Sadly, we're limited to very real constraints: Mankind is heavily reliant on many things to stay alive. Fresh water, waste disposal, gravity-like forces, food, entertainment. The support equipment adds up to a lot more weight than you realize. Consider again Newton's third law. A force exerts an equal and opposing force, so if you want to accelerate such an enormous mass you'd better come up with some seriously impressive force. There is also the matter that at some point you will be dealing with relativistic speeds, a range matter doesn't tolerate being in. There's just no way around it: we live in a universe with physical laws. We've gone as far as our current understanding allows us. The best we can hope to do is keep learning and keep applying critical thinking, coming up with new possibilities and more effective propulsion. Imagine writing to your representatives, asking for better funding for STEM and space exploration budgets! Research isn't free!  ",

If not, what is the fastest we can possibly go?\u201d; and perhaps another wonder logically through the topic can be entertained as well as entertaining.  To travel faster than the speed of light and have a classical physicists learn anything is impossible. So lets just consider at or near SoL. Lets forget about energy required to propel or accelerate us to light speed\u2026. too much baggage and weight\u2026.and outlawed according to physic\u2019s laws. And lets go with something the old classical general relativity guys will love: we are building a ship that is capable of bending spacetime with gravity.  As a variation on the Alcubierre warp drive \u201c that causes the space in front of the spacecraft to contract, while the space behind it expands. This creates a warp bubble that carries the spacecraft through space-time\u201d\u2026.. \u2026 the A-drive lost NASA favor to the same effect done with HicksMW- computer controlled magnetics.  The ship\u2019s has a skin of billions of tiny magnets, magnets who\u2019s technology will permit durable yet light weight applications, like a space ship withstanding many environments. The magnets can be turned-tuned to positive or negative and correlated-tuned to the gravitational forces of the surrounding objects/galaxies no matter what distance or how vast\u2026 gravity is the energy used to propel, break, steer\u2026 all gravity will be accounted for so to control gravity for maximum control. The outside gravity of the ship is control for travel/acceleration/location/stability and the inside is also computer controlled giving gravity for the occupants. No matter the speed, direction, maneuver etc, the crew is at a safe well controlled environment. The magnet/control technology stemmed from a fourth grader\u2019s experiment of trying to force two half donut magnets together as they repelled ends\u2026 the technology gained favor and advancement and so named Hicks Magnetic Warping- HickMW. Hovering near a black hole singularity, or traveling faster than the, oops-can\u2019t go faster than SoL\u2026 Hovering near a black hole or traveling at near light speed, because of the ship\u2019s zero gravity-mass and the unlimited power of HickMW attraction plus repelling forces of all gravity, this (how fast?) travel is\u2026 possible? douG  Imagination: it helps, then its a gift.

            "answer_text": "Yes, we can actually travel at the speed of light, by becoming light.  We already have the technology to beam any type of information over the air in radio waves. We also know that humans are just a bunch of organic matter put together in a profoundly complex way. So once we have the (not yet existent) super-technology necessary to scan your whole brain/body and actually transmit all the information necessary to construct it, we could scan your body, transmit it with a radio transmitter, and have the far away receiver decode that bitstream and build your whole brain/body in the new location with the factory made of nanobots. Oh, and ... kill your old self instantaneously at the same time.  \"But it won't be me; it will just be a copy of me.\"  Are you defined by the specific atoms currently comprising your body? No, because every decade your atoms are completely phased out for other atoms by mere metabolism, yet even with this information you're not really scared of gradual death over the next decade. You right now, feel identical and absolutely indistinguishable from if you were a \"total recall\" style clone made 5 seconds ago with injected memories. In light of this logic, one might be less fearful of this manner of teleportation.  \"But some previous humans would have to colonize the far away place first, to build the nanotechnology factory and receiver, before we can start beaming people there\".  Instead of building a factory over there first, build an extremely accurate and powerful laser which can cut at the nano-scale resolution lightyears away. Now simply use the high-tech futuristic laser to etch out the factory from the surface of the far-away planet. In other words, ultra precise atom-scale 3D-printing with a laser.  ",

            "answer_text": "There is never any need to travel at the speed of light because the universe would be length contracted to nothing if you ever reached that speed. You only need to achieve speeds approaching very close to the speed of light to get anywhere you want to be in the galaxy or perhaps even the universe. If you want to know how close to the speed of light we can travel, only time will tell. Just be aware that going back home to your friends and family would be a problem because time dilation would send you far into the future when traveling that fast. However, if you really wanted to travel at the speed of light no matter the cost then you can only reach that speed by falling through the event horrizon of a black hole, not that there would ever be any witnesses to see you do it because from the perspective of a distant observer who was safely outside of the gravity well, time dilation would cause your time to increasingly slow down such that they would never see you reach the event horizon. Or if you were to believe in all of the predictions of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics each of which seem to make no sense individually beyond their singularities, but when you put them all together, a single cohesive story seems to emerge: You would be annihilated at the Event Horrizon in a matter/antimatter annihilationSpace and time would flip-flopTime would flow in reverseSpace would be contracted to nothingYour positive energy would be expelled as Hawking RadiationYour negative energy would be transported through an Einstein Rosen BridgeOr put another way, everything that ever fell through an Event Horrizon in all of space and time, in both the universe and the anti-verse would be annihilated into positive and negative energy such that the positive energy would be expelled as Hawking Radiation and the negative energy would be transported through an ER bridge all the way back to the beginning of time. All positive and negative energy would converge creating a single event which we call the Big Bang which created all matter and antimatter as entangled pairs in opposite dimensions of positive and negative time creating both the universe and an identical anti-verse both with a shared yet hidden deterministic future through their entanglement, like two halves of the same coin.  \u2026 which, BTW, is my own interpretation of everything, if you will forgive my speculation. Or to put it in an even simpler way, for anyone who falls into a Black Hole (moving at the speed of light), directly behind every event horrizon is the Big Bang but from the perspective of those who watch them fall, it takes forever for them to get there. Seems trivial in hind-site, right? ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on your frame of reference. Right now, as you read this you're traveling at almost the speed of light relative to the Neutrino particles that are whizzing through your body, or relative to the galaxies at the edge of the Observable universe. All motion is relative.  Special relativity is based on two assumptions.  (1) that the laws of physics are identical for all non-accelerating frames of reference(2) that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the light source.  The big takeaway from Relativity is that there is no preferred frame of reference. Yours is just as relevant sitting in your chair as your hypothetical astronaut buddy heading away from you at half the speed of light. However, there is no reference frame in which either of you can travel at the speed of light. Nothing made of matter can travel at the speed of light.  You will also hear (and it is true) that there are lots of subtleties about time dilation and length contraction in relativity. If you could (somehow) accelerate away from the Earth at a sizable fraction of the speed of light it would be possible for you to traverse the entire visible universe within your own lifetime. But the Earth itself and everyone back home would have crumbled to dust billions of years before you get where you're going. That is because time passes more slowly for you when you're moving than for the folks back home who aren't (relative to you anyway). In any case, it isn't possible to accelerate to even a small fraction of the speed of light, so the complete answer to your question is \"no, humans cannot ever travel at the speed of light\". ",

            "answer_text": "The speed of light is said to be the cosmic speed limit. Nothing is proved to be faster than the speed of light in vacuum. Firstly, you must know what are the consequences of travelling that fast through space. Using Einstein's theory of relativity and its famous E=mc\u00b2 equation. If you look at the hidden meaning in it, it means that at constant energy, light is inversely proportional to mass. The more the value of c\u00b2 (the speed you're traveling) is, the lesser the mass should be. Now, that means the faster you travel, the lesser you will have to weigh. If you are a 200 pounds man willing to travel at the speed of light, then physics will not allow you to do so. A particle should have zero mass to travel at that speed. Light is the only thing that has no mass. Sadly! We can never travel at the speed of light. What is the fastest a man has ever travelled ? Apollo 10 has the record of travelling fastest with humans on board at the speed of 39897kmph speed. What is the fastest we achieved using probes ? New horizons space probe travelled at 58000 kmph speed. Speed of light is 1079252849 kmph. New horizons velocity is 0.00005 % of the speed of light. The Juno spacecraft which was sent towards the Jupiter used a slingshot to boost its already fast pace and it travelled at 265,000 kmph speed. That is 0.0002 times the speed of light. What is the fastest we can plan of achieving ? As we know these spacecrafts are of huge mass that doesn't allow them to move faster, but what if we send a smaller object with a very low mass?  There is an idea of constructing a very small but effective starship which moves with no fuel but with a very powerful lazer. Actually, a group of Lazer beams should focus on it at once.  We must hit many Lazer beams at once on that sheet to accelerate it to 20% of the speed of light i.e., approx 200000000 kmph speed. Enough to travel to the nearest star system Alpha Centauri[1] (41000000000000 kilometres away from Earth) in just 21 years. I don't know whether it will ever be made possible. Because , the accuracy must be spot on considering the atmosphere and a slight tilt will make its trajectory divert many light years away from its actual path. Conclusion : There's a lot more to be discovered and lot more ideas needed to be found. Or else we will never reach the distances we dream of reaching.

            "answer_text": "It's impossible for anyone to travel at the speed exceeding the c- barrier. So that is out of the question. Coming to the question of maximum speed attainable by a human body: People are thinking about this question for sometime now. I even bumped into this vintage 1929 article discussing the same issue -   (Source)  Soon people realized it's not the speed, but acceleration, which plays important role. As long as you are passing through vacuum at a constant speed there is theoretically no limit, apart from the one set by big daddy Einstein.  If human body encountered air resistance at very high speeds, the heat caused by friction itself would prove fatal and we are not even going into the effect of stagnation pressure. Try (but please don't try) sticking your head out of moving airplane and you'll know what I mean. g-force: g-force is an effective measure to analyze the effect of acceleration on human body (1-g = 9.81 m/s^2). How strong a g-force human body can endure depends on the duration for which g-force is sustained. People experience 50-g during crashes for a small time and do not suffer, if saved by a seat belt. But 10 g for a minute can be fatal.  NASA conducted a study in 1970s to study the effects of g-force and subjected a guy to 83-g for 0.04 sec and he was unscathed. F1 Website says the drivers experience around 3.5-g during cornering and fighter plane pilots have to sustain up to 9-g at times. Most of us would pass out if subjected to 5-g for few seconds.   flying while sustaining 9-g at times   reaching 3.5-g at corners There are several adverse effects resulting due to sustained g-environment like-  Accelerated ageingBursting of veins/ capillariesIncreased blood pressureRestricted Blood supply to the brain  Here is a table which enlists the effects at different g-levels.  Speed restriction: Hence, even though we can sustain any speed, there is a severe restriction on how we achieve that speed. Fighter planes travel at speeds exceeding 3000 kmph. But the problem pilots encounter are not due to the speed, but the acceleration. Suppose, if you accelerated a somebody at 1-g from stationary, it would be six months before he reach 0.5 c. By then the guy would be dead anyways due to enormous friction encountered at such a high speed. Or if you had kept him in vacuum to avoid air resistance, he would have been dead long back anyways.

            "answer_text": "No you can\u2019t. But not only can you go speeds that are arbitrarily close to the speed of light, in fact, you already are. To explain: if you take to heart the founding principles of relativity, you understand that there is no preferred reference frame. A reference frame is can be thought of as a non-rotating set of axes in space - though not rotating, it can be moving with constant speed and direction. You measure the velocity of a thing by looking at its motion relative to a reference frame. There are as many reference frames as there are speeds that you can go, and directions that you can go in. In each one of them, you have a different speed and/or direction. And so here is the very interesting result you get when you fully understand this: you are already going as fast as you can possibly go. In fact, you are already going every speed that is less than the speed of light. In some reference frames, you are going 99.99999% of the speed of light. In some, you're going even closer to the speed of light. But in none of them are you actually going at the speed of light. Why do I say that? Well, the theory of relativity says that light is measured as having the same speed in every reference frame. Which means that light is measured at less than the speed of light in none of them. So you can either be going the speed of light, or you can simultaneously be going all speeds that are less than the speed of light. You can't mix those - you can go the speed of light in either no reference frames, or in all of them. And you can go less than the speed of light in either no reference frames, or in all of them. And if it's less, then you're going all speeds that are less. So with all this in mind, you can realize that no matter how fast you go, you never actually get any closer to traveling at the speed of light, because you're always going all speeds that are less than it.

            "answer_text": "In 1905, Einstein published his theory of special relativity, which put forth a startling idea: There is no preferred frame of reference. Everything, even time, is relative. Two important principles underpinned his theory. The first stated that the same laws of physics apply equally in all constantly moving frames of reference. The second said that the speed of light -- about 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second) -- is constant and independent of the observer's motion or the source of light. According to Einstein, if Superman were to chase a light beam at half the speed of light, the beam would These concepts seem deceptively simple, but they have some mind-bending implications.  One of the biggest is represented by Einstein's famous equation, E = mc\u00b2, where E is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light.  According to this equation, mass and energy are the same physical entity and can be changed into each other.  Because of this equivalence, the energy an object has due to its motion will increase its mass.  In other words, the faster an object moves, the greater its mass. This only becomes noticeable when an object moves really quickly. If it moves at 10 percent the speed of light, for example, its mass will only be 0.5 percent more than normal. But if it moves at 90 percent the speed of light, its mass will double. As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass rises precipitously. If an object tries to travel 186,000 miles per second, its mass becomes infinite, and so does the energy required to move it. For this reason, no normal object can travel as fast or faster than the speed of light.Reference: http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/what-if/what-if-faster-than-speed-of-light.htm ",

After all, the whole planets full of us is already moving in whatever direction you care to specify, at whatever speed you like less than c itself, according to some inertial frame of reference. The idea of travel, however, involves a bit more. If the question is \"will humans ever leave Earth, accelerate to a speed near that of light with respect to Earth, travel a while, then decelerate to the velocity of some destination?\" the answer is almost certainly \"no\". The problem has to do not with enduring the necessary acceleration but producing it. To understand why, read about the relativistic rocket equation, in light of the need for delta-vee nearly twice c in the mission specification above. Read about fusion fuels in rockets, and why the effective exhaust velocity of fusion rockets is limited by the amount of energy released per kilogram fused. Calculated the mass ratio required, then multiply that by the likely mass of some humans, their habitat and life support, plus their fusion rocket motor. Compare that to the mass of Jupiter. Now read about antimatter fuels for rockets. Read about how much antimatter you can actually store in a tonne of antimatter storage. Figure out the they effectice exhaust velocity of antimatter fuels in disposable storage. Make with the relativistic rocket equation. Check out how much energy it would take to make that much antimatter. Make a wry face and give up on rocketry. Read up on Robert L. Forward's proposals for two-stage laser-propelled lightsails. Guesstimate the mass of a minimal ship, and work out the power requirement of the driving lasers. Compare to the global energy output, to the total amount of radiant energy Earth receives from the Sun. Then consider the use of that laser as a weapon. For humans to travel at close to the speed of light is not fundamentally impossible, but is utterly impractical. ",

(March 8,2013 by Arjun Walia) Our planet has come long way in scientific breakthroughts and discoveries.Mainstream science is beginning to discover new concepts to change our perception about our planet and the extraterrestrial enviroment that surrounds it forever.Star gates,wormholes and portals have been the subject of conspiracy theories and theoretical physics for decades,but that is all coming to an end as we continue to grow in our understanding about true nature of our reality. in  physices,a wormhole was a hypothetical feature of space time that would be a short cut througe spacetime. We often wonder how extraterrestrials could travel so far and this could be one of many explanations. Turning science fiction to science fact seems to happen guite often these days and NASA did it by announcing the discovery of hidden portals in Earth's magnetic field. NASA calls them X-points. They are places where the magnetic field of Earth connects to the magnetic field of the Sun,wich in turn creates an uninterrupted path leading from our own planet to the sun's atmosphere wich is 93 million miles away. Nasa used its THEMIS spacecraft,as well as a European Cluster probe,to examine this phenomenon. They found that these portals open and close dozens of times each day. It's funny,becouse there is a lot of evidence that points toward the Sun being a giant star gate for the\"gods\"to pass back and forth from other dimensions and universes. The portals that NASA has discovered are usually located tens of thousands of kilometers from Earth and most of them are short-lived; others are giant. As far ad scientists can determine,these portals aid in the transfer of tons of magnetically charged particles that flow from the Sun causing the northern and southern lights and geomagnetic storms. They aid in the transfer of the magnetic field  from the Sun to Earth. In 2014 the U.S. space agency launched a new mission called Magnetospheric Multi scale Mission wich included four spacecraft that circled the Earth to locate andthen study these portals. They are located where the Earth and the Sun's magnetic fields connect and where unexplained portals are formed. NASA are still unclear what these portals are.  Magnetic portals are invisible,unstable and elusive,they open and close without warning and there are no signposts to guide.

            "answer_text": "It is impossible for anything with mass to travel at the speed of light due to Einsteins theory of relativity (special and general). Things with mass asymptotically approach the speed of light, and as they do their mass increases, length shortens, and time slows down (from an outside observer\u2019s point of view). But theoretically humans could travel at any speed other than the speed of light safely, because newtons first law states objects in motion want to stay in motion. This is like when you\u2019re on an airplane you don\u2019t notice how fast you\u2019re moving once you hit cruising altitude. What we feel is acceleration, again because of newtons first law. Speeding up will cause you (and all your organs and blood) to experience a fictitious centrifugal force backwards because it doesn\u2019t want to speed up. This is what\u2019s dangerous. However, sitting here on earth we experience a constant acceleration due to gravity of 9.8m/s^2 all the time, and our bodies actually need this acceleration to function properly. If you exclude relativity, if you started from rest and traveled in a straight line in space with an acceleration of 9.8m/s^2 you\u2019d reach the speed of light in just over 3 and a half days! Adding relativity it would take much longer to get to, say 99% the speed of light, but you could theoretically do it safely if you had enough energy to keep you going at 9.8m/s^2. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Einstein NO! Einstein's formula for relativistic mass increase:   and v = c, the denominator would end up being infinite. It is mathematically not possible to divide by 0. It would also mean you'd have an infinite mass. If v was 99.99999999% of c, the relativistic mass of a 80kg human-being would be 8 thousand tons!  Put in  E=mc\u00b2 (with m increasing towards infinity) you would have to put in more and more Energy or an infinite amount of energy to accelerate something with a rest mass towards the speed of light.  Now imagine the ISS with a mass of aprrox. 420tons needing to be propelled to the speed of light. The only thing known to mankind that can travel the speed of light is a photon, only because it has no mass when it drops to a velocity below c. (Keep in mind it was also theorized by Einstein) Back to your question: To travel with the speed of light you would have to prove Einstein's entire theory of relativity wrong, which fits into nearly anything physically imaginable at the moment. Since the only trivial purpose of travelling the speed of light is to cover long distances, there are better ways to do so.

            "answer_text": "At present, the fastest human speed record is shared by the three astronauts who flew NASA\u2019s Apollo 10 mission in 1969. The astronauts\u2019 space capsule hit a peak speed of 24,790 mph or 39,879km/relative to planet Earth on their way back from a lap around the Moon. The fastest man-made, unmanned, robotic spacecraft title is held by NASA\u2019s Juno space probe when it arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Jupiter\u2019s intense gravity accelerated the probe to about 165,000 mph or 265,000 km/h relative to Earth. This made the Juno space probe the fastest-moving human-made object in history so far. Let\u2019s assume that humans have overcome the technical obstacles and have built a fast aircraft capable of traveling at the speed of light. What will happen to the human body and to the spacecraft itself? The fragile human body which is mostly water will have to contend with many significant new hazards. There will also be speculative dangers if humans achieve faster-than-light travel, either by paradigm-shattering discoveries or exploiting loopholes known in physics. Rapid acceleration and deceleration can be very dangerous to the human body. Just imagine the trauma of a human body in a car crash. This is due to inertia and gravitational forces. 1 G is equal to the pull of Earth\u2019s gravity towards the planet\u2019s centre at 9.8 m/second squared. The average person can withstand a sustained force of about 5 Gs from head to toe before going unconscious. The human record for momentary Gs is 82.6 Gs held by Eli Beeding on a rocket-powered sled in 1958 at about 34mph or 55 km/h in 1/10 of a second. In space, G forces will not be felt as much, astronauts at a cruising speed of 16,150 mph or 26,000 km/h in orbit feels like passengers do on a commercial plane. The problem will be the small space rocks or micrometeoroids. A grain-sized rock can be devastating at speeds nearly 186,000 mph or at 300,000 km/h. According to Eric Davis, a senior research physicist at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin and contributor to NASA\u2019s Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Programme, considering conventional physics for getting humans up to reasonable interplanetary space travel \u2013 they are fission, fusion and the antimatter annihilation. Different propulsion systems based on fission and fusion could theoretically accelerate a vessel up to 10% of the speed of light or about 62,000,000 mph of 100,000,000 km/h. The best case for powering a fast spacecraft far and away is antimatter. When matter and antimatter make contact, they obliterate each other as pure energy. Technologies that will generate and store minuscule amounts of antimatter exist at present, but production of useful amounts would require next generation facilities With antimatter-fuelled engines, it can accelerate over periods of months or years to very high percentages of the speed of light with Gs having tolerable level for occupants. And at hundreds of millions of kilometres per hour, every rock will become a high-powered bullet into the hull of the ship. Also, the ambient hydrogen of space would result into a bombardment of intense radiation. Hydrogen will break into subatomic particles that will pass through the ship that will irradiate the ship, the equipment and the crew. Reaching at speeds around 95% will be instant death. The ship will heat up to melting temperatures, while water in the human body will boil and then explode. Now, let\u2019s say man has reached the technological advancements and has built the warp drive of Star Trek. The drive is called the Alcubierre drive, which involves compressing the normal space-time in front of the ship while expanding it behind. So the ship will be inside a warp bubble that moves faster than the speed of light. The ship inside remains at rest within the pocket of normal space-time, which avoids any violation of the universal limit of light speed. The concept needs an exotic form of matter that possesses a negative mass to contract and expand space-time. But a 2012 paper by the University of Sydney researchers suggests that the warp bubble would collect high-energy cosmic particles. Some particles would leak into the bubble and bombard the ship with immense radiation destroying everything, which would suck big time. If physics and future scientists find out that the technology is possible, it would also give them new and unforeseen possibilities for protecting the ship and the crew. Speed. What a rush! ",

            "answer_text": "We are already moving close to the speed of light relative to lots of the galaxies that are shown in the famous deep field photograph taken by Hubble.   Ever since Galileo and Newton we have known that absolute speed has no meaning, so your question is not well-posed unless we understand what you are meaning that our speed is relative to. If you mean will it ever be possible for us to travel at the speed of light relative to the earth, our species starting point, then many people will have answered that question: assuming Special Relativistic constraints apply the answer is clearly no, but with a source of constant acceleration one could reach speeds that are very close. However this does not mean that other galaxies can never be reached by those starting out from here.  If a source of constant acceleration can be found then in terms of ship-board time this is doable. For example if you have a motor that will supply a constant acceleration of 1-g in any direction, then you could set out to journey to Andromeda and, after reaching the half-way point, reverse the acceleration so that you reach Andromeda at a sensible relative velocity, then you will reach this galaxy after less than 30 years ship-board time, despite it being 2 million light-years away! How does the ship-board person reconcile this huge journey in her own frame of reference - surely she can't see Andromeda approaching her faster than the speed of light, c? No, she can't and doesn't - what she sees is that the distance to Andromeda becomes hugely 'contracted' once her speed has come close to c. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is very possible. The difficult thing about the speed of light is that, the faster you go the more mass you produce. This makes the energy you need infinite. Currently fossil fuels isn't going to cut it. There have been ideas or theories of how to combat this problem which many have mentioned already with the warp drive. A method not talked about in the response is anti matter propulsion. Anti matter is 100,000,000,000 more powerful than modern technology. You would need a small space to generate the same power as a rocket ship to get to the moon. Anti matter is found in modern medicine. It is also created at cern. The problem with anti matter is that we can't infinitely hold it, but we have improved that time. The other issue is that, at this point in time creating it is very slow. There are people such as Ryan Weed who created a anti matter moderator. I think they are producing anti matter at a faster rate. If they can put that in a ship, create antimatter quickly, and store it, then there is no reason we can't. The major problem is it takes more time producing it. With his invention, production of a power source would continuously happen on a ship for an infinite time, releasing energy billions of times stronger than fossil fuels. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, surely, as you are accelerated towards the speed of light, you shall start to disintegrete towards the rest mass of light\u2019s photons. Yours ingredients with the least mass of your body's electrons only will travel nearer to the speed of light, but not with your human senses with the orgons intact with.Yet your electrons will enjoy travelling closer to the speed of light. The speed of an object is strictly related to the mass of the traveling object with inversely proportional to the mass and speed.(Sir. Newtons 3rd law of motion). When we fire the smallest indivisible known elementary particles with the least known masses of electron, proton and neutrons with the same canon or lightning propulsion , the electron,being the tiniest, shall travel with the fastest and longest distance by overtaking the protons the heavier in second place followed by the neutron the heaviest of all the three against the atmospheric and cosmic resistance with directly proportional to the speed and resistance against the mass. More the speed , more the resistance. The atmospheric vacuum is only in the physical particles states of atomic air levels . In the cosmic space,the space is permeated with the cosmic subatomic particles of attenuated neutral EM non thermal plasmas. Any speeding object with more than the zero rest mass is bound to face the resistance of the plasma sphere until it attained it's terminal velocity into the constant velocity and cannot achieve the universal upper speed limit.(UUSL). In the materiel\u2019s physical state, nothing can travel in the speed of light without disintegrating further and further. That is why Sir. Einstein is the legendary.No one can overtake his photon canonball\u2019s speed.Though his photon\u2019s zero rest mass postulate is in arbitration and debates till now. For an daily example. When the floating water columns of raincloud begins to fall as rain, it begins to break and split from heavier drops to smaller with it's increasing velocity against the atmospheric resistance. As it accelerates further, it starts to disintegrate to drizzle, mist, vapor sedentary and finally with it's terminal velocity with smaller mass equally with the atmospheric air and amalgamated with the air\u2019s as relative humidity of air by disintegration by decomposed in it's H2O water molecular level. Thus, all the objects including the hardest elements\u2019 spacecraft are bound disintegrate and decompose from melting, liquifying, evaporating and fissioning into their basic and the fundamental ingredients of with final least rest mass particles of no more unbreakable particles of electrons, protons and neutrons towards the speed of light.

It's a fundamental property of the Universe we inhabit (which, incidentally includes everything). Nothing which has mass can travel AT the speed of light, not even a single proton. But with an adequate energy source, we might one day be able to approach it (this IS allowed in physics). And that may be enough to achieve what we want to achieve\u2026. if that means interstellar, or even intergalactic travel within a human lifetime. I recommend the writings of Viktor T.

As you approach the speed of light, more and more of the energy pushing you is manifested as mass, meaning each speed increment takes exponentially more and more energy. Eventually, it will take more energy than there is in the universe to make you go any faster, sand you'll reach that point before the speed of light. This has been verified experimentally in accelerators acting on electrons. From a classical point of view, by the time the electron had made a thousand circuits of the accelerator, it should be moving at several times the speed of light... but although it still moves slower than light, it hits like a penny dropped on the pavement from some great height. Most of that impact is because the electron is acting as if it were much heavier. That's like a pithball hitting with the violence of a small nuke. The speed of light is the fastest speed there is: and there is no foreseeable need to qualify that with \"as far as we know at present\". The only reason photons can even move that fast is because they have no rest mass. But by that logic, the only particles capable of going faster would be particles with negative mass. Such particles are not impossible, but we're not made of them. So I'm sorry, but even the speed of light is an impossible dream, let alone faster. Apologies for being a party-pooper :( ",

This doesn't seem very helpful, since even if you set up a totally coherent beam of light, that the cast shadow of an astronaut on a distant astronomical body could move faster than the speed of light, doesn't seem to help the space program very much! However, in general relativity, it is possible for a region of space to move faster than the speed of light, and very high rates of space-time expansion are associated with the theory of cosmic inflation.  The local stuff inside that region of space does not violate the rules, and it is still limited by the light barrier. So the question, first raised in the 1990's was, was there any way you could construct a stable region of space-time that moved independently, but in which objects in the interior would not feel any G-force, or be torn apart by tidal forces?  Now in general relativity, any possible configuration of space-time is associated with a particular distribution of mass and energy, so we'd also have to determine what that is. It turns out there is a solution to the Einstein field equations, called the Alcubierre metric.  It does exist, and it seems to predict that a ship placed in the center of this theoretical distorted region of space-time would be unharmed, and that region would be capable of reaching unlimited speeds.  It is, however, essentially science fiction with math.  The energy requirements to create such a region appear to be astronomical, on the order of converting the mass of Jupiter to energy, and worse yet the energy density to pull it off has to be negative! Strictly speaking, there are specialized states that can have negative energy, but this tells us that if were ever to construct such a thing it is far beyond our current capabilities, and requires exotic matter, which, although predicted by some current cosmological models, cannot be manufactured by any known process.  To be a little more optimistic, there have been some studies that suggest that the amount of energy may be less than originally thought.   For more information on this topic: Alcubierre drive. ",

I know some physics, but not enough to give a remotely accurate answer that is based on physics and is also practically provable.  But I can answer from the view of an observer and based on the development of mankind. Once upon a time men looked at birds and wished they could fly (many did try, and didnt live to try again).  Then one fine day, the destined happened. Some folks somehow managed to use thier brain's enough to \"engineer\" a flight. The following is how mankind developed its capability to fly.  17 December 1903, Wilbur wright, flies ag an astounding 10.8 km/hr, on Kitty hawk, the first flying aircraft. A very big step for mankind, but those folks could have thought of a better name. Fast forward, today as of 2016 ( and according to google) the fastest manned aircraft is The SR-71 Blackbird, zooming in at 4700km/hr. That's more that thrice the speed of sound.(mach 3+, where mach1 refers to speed of sound). Seems the name has improved huh!? Read this amazing article below, for more on this amazing bird.http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/the-fastest-jet-in-the-world/ Now coming back to seeing the future :- Seeing the graph and its slope, It is highly probable for this species to reach the speed of light. After all, laws of physics (or any law for that matter), hold good untill the moment they are broken.    \u200bImage from Wikipedia.org Feel free to suggest any edits on facts or content. ",

            "answer_text": "Another interesting tough question, as I'm no expert, don't expect to much. But I have some thoughts to ponder. The real question may be is light really understood in the first place. You might say well yeah its a photon right. But is that all it really is? Some would say that a particle is light if it travels at light speed. But why does it travel at light speed in the first place. And if this so called particle called a photon could be slowed down, would it then become or be seen as something totally different. Its said an atom is protons, neutrons and electrons around that right. But have you ever considered if the speed of these electrons in their orbit around such an atom has anything to do with it all. You might then say well these electrons don't really orbit they just are sort of like a gas cloud of probability everywhere around the center part of the atom. And such could be thought of in that manner as well, more like a circumference standing wave of vibration or rather frequency so to speak. But this standing wave of frequency has everything to do with so much more then what may be presently known or understood. So if we could somehow take an atom and speed up its orbiting electrons or rather its standing wave of frequency if you prefer. Then what would happen to this atom? Would it then travel into what is known as a different of higher dimension or perhaps its relative speed in relation to surrounding space so to speak would increase, perhaps it may even be seen as a photon then. And if such has any truth to it, what would happen to a photon if it was reversed in a similar manner to the above. Just some thoughts to ponder there for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes & No\u2026So Will we be able to travel at FTL= Faster Than Light Speeds in the future through space during space travel? Probably not, however, I sincerely expect Space travel speeds to reach 1/4 to 1/3 of those speeds in the next 1500 years barring all of the usual arguments- Yellowstone Super Eruption, Super Asteroid Strike, Worldwide Famine, yaadee yaadee, etc. The issue that is overlooked by many though not all is that space travel successes IN MY OPINION is NOT about speed,\u2026It is about Distance. The concept of \u201cWarp Speed\u201d to most people focuses on moving at Light Speed, approx 186,000 miles per second or faster, Warp 2 = 186,000 miles per second times 186,000 miles per second, etc,. My belief is that Warp is a distance. If we \u201cwarp\u201d space than the waves of the spacial/space-time distortion will be determined by the method or device by which we warp it, the number of waves we can warp and the possibility of multiple warps/waves created. Using the Idea of the Alcubierre Warp Drive, we create a gravitational hole in space, a \u201cwormhole\u201d. Our ship can create one at a Maximum capacity initially of 50 warps by our generator, but no warp will be greater than 2 waves or \u201cWarp\u201d 2 initially. Our ships maximum speed is 45000 miles per second thru Space. Our generator creates a tunnel through space/time which using gravity we are squeezed through at the very second after creation to a Distance of Warp Two, Warp 1 at the moment of entry and Warp 2 at the moment of maximum gravitational effect in the tunnel before we are squeezed out at a distance of 186,000 miles \u00d7 186,000. Our generator requires a 24 hour cool down after which time it can be used again and during which time we travel at the cruising up to the maximum speed of our ship. Currently the energy output to make this happen exceeds our ability to manufacture however given the window I suggested initially of approx 1500 years I see this as entirely realistic.

            "answer_text": "No, I do not think humans ever get close to light speed. The universe is not empty. While the distances between objects in space are vast you don\u2019t want to tun into a stray comet. At really high speeds even gas molecules of the interstellar medium would be an issue. I doubt you can even get to significant relativistic effects before running into heat and collision problems.  With current technology the fastest thing we could build would be powered by solar panels. But those would stay behind and fire lasers at a solar sail. If you stay within reasonable budgets, like constructions as the large hadron collider or other major science projects, the optimistic speed limit would be around 15% of light speed. It would work best to send a lot of small probes. And just hope some will survive. The amount of solar sails and laser will ultimately decide how fast the vehicle goes. If you could go really over the top, you could add more lasers when the craft is further away. Maybe you could get to somewhere between 20 an 30% of light speed. At that speed the craft would need some kind of shielding to protect from even the tiniest things they could encounter. Other propulsion systems have their own problems. Chemical rockets require too much fuel to accelerate to anything near a fraction of light speed. Ion drives take too much time to get up to speed. Even futuristic systems have their limitations. To go faster you convert energy. That creates heat. At some point that heat will be transferred to the space craft. Physics doesn\u2019t allow for 100% efficient systems. A nuclear fission space craft wouldn\u2019t get anywhere close to half light speed in a decent amount of time. It also would still be hard to bring enough fuel. Anti matter or hawking radiation from a small black hole are omni-directional and would have to be converted in a directional force. Heat issues would limit acceleration. You could get eventually to quite high speeds with these. Maybe even to relativistic speeds. But then the impact of hydrogen atoms starts to affect the space ship like an artillery bombardment. I guess the maximum speed for human physical travel will be around 30%. That would require a lot of automated space stations between Earth and the destiny to keep the area clear of any space debris and accelerate it towards the destiny. At the other end space stations will use lasers to decelerate. Such a spaceship would still need to be very big to bring enough shielding to protect the passengers. To accelerate a very big ship you would require an immense amount of space infrastructure. This will not happen anytime soon. For probes it might be a bit higher as we care less if they get destroyed. But I doubt it will be much more. ",

            "answer_text": "If you ask a physicist he will say the fastest possible speed is \u201cjust under\u201d the speed of light. In theory that is possible. If you ask an engineer the same question he will tell you that physicists make to many simplifying assumptions and disregard the real world. One problem with going so fast is that is is 100% likely that you will crash into something like a hydrogen atom. Space is just filled with these. Just one atom could ruin your day. OK so the engineer decides to build a 100 mile thick steel bumper shield on the front of your space ship. OK that will work but it makes the space ship a lot harder to build but in theory it could be done. It might take a 1,000 mile thick shield, perhaps made from an asteroid. It would take a LOT to survive a crash with a dust speck let alone grain of sand. But why. Long before we have the technology to build thousand mile long space ships we will have intelligent robots who are perhaps smarter than humans. THEY can go on a slow ship. A machine would not care if the trip took a coupe million years. If humans need to be at the end location the robot can make humans from a database of DNA. But then, you asked only if you could travel at the speed of light, you did not specify a DIRECTION. So I claim that not only is it possible but YOU ARE ALREADY DOING IT. The universe has FOUR dimensions. One of them is time. As you sit motionless you travel trough time as fast as possible at \u201cC\u201d. Then if you move, even a little you travel through time at less than C. If you travel through space at C you stop moving in time altogether. It\u2019s a trade off. So, \u201cThere you go\u201d blasting thought the fourth dimension at the rate of one second per second, that is the fastest speed the laws of Physics allow, \u201cC\u201d. \u201cC\u201d is a hard limit and you can not go past it in all four dimension. Think of a photon. A particle of light travels at C in one direction but has zero speed in the other three directions. Or Your desk, We can define it to be at rest with respect to the three dimensions of space but that definition forces it to be at the maximum permitted speed though time. So, the answer to your question is \u201cObviously yes, it happens all the time.\u201d ",

Massive objects can only approach the speed of light, with every increasing inputs of energy. The relativistic kinetic energy of an object is given by Ek=(\u03b3\u22121)m0c2 where m0 is the rest mass of the object. For simplicity, I will take this to be 1 kilogram.c is the vacuum speed of light = 299.792,458 meters/second\u03b3 is the Lorentz factor determined by the speed v of the object: 11\u2212v2c2For an earlier question (Charles Knouse's answer to How much energy output is required on a spacecraft to reach the speed of light?) I had put together a spreadsheet to compute the kinetic energy of 1 kilogram travelling at speeds increasingly close to c. I also included the energy equivalent in kilograms of antimatter, using 9\u00d71016 Joules/kg from Orders of magnitude (energy).

This is not necessarily impossible, because that fuel could be consumed during acceleration. But closer you get to light speed, the more infeasible it will be to gain the required kinetic energy. I\u2019ll also note that relativistic time dilation is also determined by the Lorenz factor: \u0394t\u2032=\u03b3\u0394t If you want to use relativistic travel to overcome the vast distances in space, you need to have large Lorenz factors and correspondingly high sublight speeds. The higher the time dilation, the more infeasible the energy requirements. Another feasibility issue: Unless you want to travel in one direction at high sublight speeds forever, at some point you will need to decelerate. That means you will have to apply a force opposite to your velocity. Either You will have to carry fuel for that deceleration, which greatly increases the fuel requirements for your original acceleration (the infamous Tyranny of the Rocket Equation).Or you will have to find some external force (gravitational breaking, light sails, etc.) But the faster you are going, the less effective those external forces will be.So, I am going to take a guess and say the maximum speed we will ever attain is 0.1 c. And no, I\u2019m not going to throw in the Alcubierre Drive, which I\u2019ve discussed in a number of previous answers, particularly Charles Knouse's answer to Are there any current theories on how to shorten the substantial amount of time it would take humans to travel to other stars; accounting for the fact that we cannot travel at the speed of light, and even light is a little slow in that regards?

Suppose, you went into circular orbit around the Earth for 10 years, ship's time, at 99% c. The gamma factor at .99c is about 7. This is calculated as: \u03b3=11\u2212v2c2=7 So if your twin on Earth were to view you on the ship, then you and everything else on the ship would have time slowed down by a factor of 7. After 10 years ship's time, the twin on Earth would have aged 70 years. )But he stole your girlfriend so he deserved it.) The good news is that you (on the ship) would get to see the Earth 70 years in the future. The bad news is that you can't go back to 70 years in the past. As far as practicality goes. the biggest impediment, by far, is the amount of energy it would take to get to .99c. Let's say you're in a space shuttle that weighs 10,000kg. With a gamma factor of 7, the mass of the ship would increase by 7, so its mass would be 70,000kg. Where does the extra 60,000kg of mass come from? It comes from an energy source you must provide. And how much energy would this be? Use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc2. m = 60,000kg, and c=3x108 m/sec This comes out to over 9\u00d71020 joules. If this doesn't sound like a lot of energy, it is. One of the atomic bombs we dropped over Hiroshima had about a 15 kiloton of TNT yield. It would take the energy of about 10 million of these bombs to accelerate your space shuttle to .99c! How do we get this much energy and control its release? We can't. And we're not close to being able to do so. So stay home and watch reruns of Gilligan's Island. It will be safer, and you won't lose your girlfriend to your twin brother. ",

According to the current laws of physics you can't travel faster than the speed of light relative to any body , But there is a theoretical possibility that the by expanding the space behind the ship and shrinking it infron of it the space craft will move on this bubble faster than the speed of light .(While locally the sapce can be with zero velocity relative to it's local surroundings) This is called \"warp drive\" and it's developed currently by NASA , that hopefully will be the way that space ships will travel to very far stars. Some Interesting facts about the \"warp bubble\": 1. It was presented by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994 . 2.In the center of the bubble( The place of the ship) the gravitational forces may be zero so the astronauts will remain alive... 3.The proper time in the warp buble is the same as outside the bubble. 4.The energy to create the bubble is negative .

Many things thought impossible even back in the 20s and 30s are now considered to be fact.   The issue with FTL travel is not reaching the speed in and of itself.  That will happen eventually when someone discovers the right operator to allow it.  It is really how matter can withstand it.  The most likely solution to this problem is not going to be found in traditional space travel, but rather in teletransportation(a reality now, though it is in it's infancy) or through human created stable wormholes, or a combination of the two.  I am up to date on current research, but find most scientists to be a little close minded to possibilities and quite arrogant.  I get there is a lot more work to be done, but I think we will get there and that it is mainly a matter of funding and international cooperation(sadly, military use corrupts science).  There is a lot about the multiverse we have yet to understand, and thousands of different possible solutions, including shortcuts through other universes to come back to this one in a different place(not the best solution since it would be different physics).  Basically, my answer is hypothetically it should be possible, even with scientific findings against it currently(why they call it theory and not law), but would be extremely difficult due to the fact that the faster something moves, the more difficult it is to maintain structural integrity.

If you only care how long it takes you and not how long for people you leave behind or you destination then the closer you get to the speed of light as measure by your destination and not a beam of light, the more space along your direction of travel will contract, so what was hundreds or millions of light years away could become only 1 light years away and you can get there in just over a years, for the people you leave behind though, hundreds or millions of years would have passed. Its even been calculated that you could do a complete lap of the entire visible universe if you continuously accelerated for 50 years of on ship time, when your done earth will be millions of years older though.

            "answer_text": "The biggest problem is a thing called the rocket equation. Ever notice how a conventional rocket is huge compared to the little payloads they deliver to orbit? That's explained by the rocket equation. Here's how it works. Suppose you want to increase the speed of your rocket by velocity, v. Suppose that the exhaust from your rocket moves with velocity w. The mass ratio, r, is then r = exp(v/w) The mass ratio is the weight of the original rocket divided by the payload. Since the best chemical rockets only have w of 2 or 3 km/s, getting v > 10 is going to require a HUGE rocket to launch a very small satellite. Play with this in Excel and you'll see that even v=100 is ridiculous. Never mind v = 290,000 km/s Of course you can make this better if you use a faster exhaust. Ion thrusters can get up to as much as 100 km/s in the lab, so that would at least let us get probes up to 300 km/s someday, but that's still very far from light speed. For very high velocities, the rocket equation uses rapidity instead of velocity. Rapidity is the hyperbolic arctangent of the velocity as a fraction of light speed. So r = exp(atan(v/c)/w) But you're going to need an awfully fast rocket exhaust before you need that equation. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that the only way we can travel faster than light is in Spirit form. One of Einstein's mentors studied near death experiances. Einstein carried on from his research. He found that when people experience near death experiances they percieve time differently. This is the only way Einstein could have found out about time travel. I believe when In spirit form your spirit is basically gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is potentially faster than the speed of visible light due to being a much higher frequency. Scientist hide this fact as they want to take spiritual/god particles out of the equation. They say that frequency does not increase in proportion to speed. I think this may be untrue and will explain. Regarding sound, when a band plays in distance you hear all the sounds at the same time even though some are different frequencies and higher pitched. They say this proves that all frequencies of sound must travel at the same speed. The problem is though is that I believe the sound waves are limited in speed by the medium they are travelling in which is the air particles. If we could test each sound in a vacuum I believe we could proove that each different frequency of sound travelled at different speeds. The problem is sounds don't travel through a vacuum as they dont have any medium to attach too. If you create a sound though in a vacuum by hitting something for example, the energy must be still there though but I'm a different format. Maybe when sound is initially created it is an actual radio wave. Then the air particles capture and slow it down so it can be picked up by your eardrum. Your eardrum then could convert it back into a radio frequency that can be understood by your brain. More test need to be done. ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest answer is that under Special Relativity, the closer mass gets to the speed of light, mass increases, time slows, length/distance decreases so that at the speed of light: energy is infinite, time stops, length/distance is zero and anything that is matter is squashed to infinity. So a human cannot survive infinite mass. Only massless particles can travel at lightspeed. Under General Relativity, it is possible that space itself can curve so that it creates a black hole where gravity is so great that it creates a fold in the fabric of space. Mathematically two black holes can create an Einstein-Rosen bridge or wormhole. Add to this that some spinning black holes (highly spinning Kerr black holes) mathematically (theoretically) describe a black hole with an eye of a hurricane, a calm that should allow admittance into a black hole. If a worm hole connects two of these types of black holes, spaceships and humans could survive travel because travel is instantaneous, no distance is crossed because one side of the galaxy touches the other. Theoretically this is a possibility. Otherwise, the human body is currently unable to withstand relativistic speeds. ",

We will have to wait for ways to detect and neutralize threatening objects or build ships that can withstand such collisions. Many SciFi writers postulate that aliens come in huge ships, maybe for this reason. My personal wish is that designers will at harnessing massive asteroids as vehicles able to withstand such collisions. However, the density of large objects in our part of the galaxy is so small that serious collisions have an exceptionally low probability.

ANYTHING bizarre could happen and we shouldn't actually be particularly surprised, and we'd simply scramble to find a rational explanation for what we think we saw happen.  Personally I think unseen forces will tear the spacecraft to bits as it gets marginally close to light speed.  In fact, there might be a sudden threshold that causes it to dematerialize by losing all of its molecular bonds all at once and would simply vanish in a flash of light and a slight cloudy haze, at which point scientists would theorize that the spacecraft jumped into another dimension or traveled through a wormhole. You shouldn't put too much faith in the wild speculation that current science offers on the topic of near-light-speed travel.  Any theories or conclusions being offered are based on no actual experimental experience in this direction.  Anyone offering even a slight level of certainty about what would happen is simply not a very good scientist. I would suggest that as long as we can figure out a way to shield our spacecraft from unpredictable oncoming forces from the star systems towards which we're traveling, we can travel any large multiple of light speed we want as long as we develop the spacecraft engines capable of accelerating us within a reasonable amount of time.  NOTE:  I'm intentionally believing that classical physics holds true in the case that we travel close to or beyond light speed...  because light isn't actually particularly special nor is light speed inherently magical in some way.

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s graph of travel time as experience on the space ship and on Earth for round trips at 1g acceleration. For example, traveling to Proxima Centauri, 4.4lyr distant, takes about 8yr traveler time round trip. Traveling to Betelguese, 900lyr distant, takes about 30yr. But notice the mass ratios in red.  It assumes a kind of photon rocket in which the reaction mass of the rocket is expelled at c (like photons). The mass ratios are the \u201cpayload\u201d which includes everything but the \u201cexhaust\u201d, i.e. all the people, food, water, machinery,\u2026 divided by the \u201cexhaust\u2019 mass-energy. Note that for the round trip to Proxima Centauri the ratio is 1/37^2. It\u2019s just 1/37 for a one-way trip. So the ratio is 1:1369. Which is not too bad; a result of assuming a maximally efficient rocket. But how much stuff do you need to sustain a person for 8yrs? Say 20tons. Then you need 27380 tons that can be turned into pure energy (photons) directed out the back of your rocket. And that\u2019s for one person. Maybe with suspended animation you could cut that down by a factor of three or four, but it\u2019s still a lot. The bigger problem is that space, especially within a galaxy is not completely empty. There\u2019s a hydrogen atom even cubic meter or so. When you\u2019re going close to the speed of light, you\u2019re running into those atoms just as if they were beaming out of a particle accelerator at you. So you need shielding (more weight) or deflecting magnetic fields (more machinery and weight). ",

            "answer_text": "According to Maxwell, was a vibration in the electromagnetic field and it travelled at a constant speed in a vacuum. More than 100 years earlier, Newton had set down his laws of motion and, together with ideas from Galileo Galilei, these showed how the speed of an object would differ depend on who was measuring it and how they were moving relative to the object. A ball you are holding will seem still to you, even when you're in a moving car. But that ball will seem to be moving to anyone standing on the pavement. But there was a problem in applying Newton's laws of motion to light. In Maxwell's equations, the speed of electromagnetic waves is a constant defined by the properties of the material through which the waves move. There is nothing in there that allows the speed of these waves to be different for different people depending on how they were moving relative to each other. Which is bizarre, if you think about it. Advertisement Imagine someone sitting in a stationary train, throwing a ball from where he's sitting to the opposite wall, a few metres further down the train from him. You, standing on the station platform, measure the speed of the ball at the same value as the person on the train. Now the train starts to move (in the direction of the ball), and you again measure the speed of the ball. You would rightly calculate it as higher \u2013 the initial speed (ie, when the train was at rest) plus the forward speed of the train. On the train, meanwhile, the game-player will notice nothing different. Your two values for the speed of the ball will be different; both correct for your frames of reference. Replace the ball with light and this calculation goes awry. If the person on the train were shining a light at the opposite wall and measured the speed of the particles of light (photons), you and the passenger would both find that the photons had the same speed at all times. In all cases, the speed of the photons would stay at just under 300,000 kilometres per second, as Maxwell's equations say they should. ",

We have pushed mass to within 99.9% of the speed of light and the universe is still here. We use very tiny particles and a tremendous amount of energy to do it. Traveling through space at that speed poses serious problems. Microscopic particles will destroy your ship. Add to that, the problem of getting to that speed and of course slowing down after you have. As mass we cannot go the speed of light. Light has no mass. As such there is nothing keeping it from going faster so it does. You are now in the realm of quantum physics which is largely theoretical. So if we could convert mass to energy and back again, faster than light travel would at least be theoretical. Another possibility is to make space.time flow around you. It has no mass. Your mass just sits there. You get in and get out and you are someplace else. Sounds wierd but serious scientific work pursues the possibility. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets think about something that can be tested right now, in 2019. What is the maximum speed a propeller air plane? At the beginning, starting at speed 0, the propeller can generate enough thrust to bring an airplane airborne. But, as the plane inccrease speed, the propeller provide less thrust. Did you notice the motor in the vacuum cleaner increase speed when you block the air input? It is because the propeller has less air friction because of the partial vacuum it created. Jet airplanes do exceed the speed of sound,ore than 330 meter per second, but they too have a maximum speed limit related to the velocity of the gas ejected. You remember action/reaction from Newton physics? Like described in another answer to that question, if you could create an engine that provide an acceleration of 1g, that mean increasing your speed by 10 meter per second every second, it would take about 1 year to accelerate to the speed of light. Imagine how much energy it takes to accelerate your car from 0 to 65 mph in 6.5 seconds : your efficiency is below 5 miles per gallon while accelerating. The radiator would not succeed to cool the motor if you forced it to spend that energy continuously. Now imagine a rocket firing at 25% of max capacity to give 1 g, but burning so much fuel non stop, day and night for 1 year. Even using some type of nuclear propulsion with 100% efficiency and accelerating gas at 10% the speed of light, it is not possible to come up with any combination of energy/matter able to sustain an acceleration of 1g for a complete year.

Point being that it requires absolutely unbelievable amount of power to accelerate to this speed. Furthermore it will take just as much to slow down. In any type of conventional propellant type vehicle that the mass required is absolutely incredible as well as the fact that each pound of propellant required also increase the amount of energy needed to accelerate. I personally believe that the only way to achieve such speeds will be some type of gravity drive which will use a field to distort gravity to such an extent that the craft will accelerate without propellant\u2026 remember there will still be energy requirements to generate the gravity type drive. Additionally as the speed increases even the tiniest particle impacts will reach levels of creating fusion on the hull. So no. I do not think we ever will. ",

The radiation dose would reach 10,000 sieverts a second; a fatal radiation dose for humans is just 6 sieverts.[1]The energy densities required to accelerate objects near the speed of light are off the chart. There is no way a human friendly environment can be maintained with that much energy being converted to velocity at something less than 100% efficiency. Any object traveling at that speed would be insanely hot. As you increase in speed the joules per meter per second increase as you travel faster and faster. The curve isn't manageable from a thermal management standpoint.

If, however, an more likely, you mean near the speed of light compared to an observer on Earth then the right answer is that there\u2019s nothing in the laws of physics that we know of that would prevent it, but equally, it\u2019s extraordinarily unlikely at the moment as we know of no practical way of achieving that speed. To put this in perspective, a 10 kg space probe has been mooted which could be driven to 20% of the speed of light. Nobody has any real idea how this might be done (ground based lasers?), but it would require about 50% of an entire year\u2019s energy consumption by the entire planet\u2019s human population to do it.

I short, don\u2019t bet on it with known technologies (or even half known ones).

We all travel through spacetime at speed of light, all the time. the Technically, the \u201cspeed\u201d at which one travels through spacetime is known as four-velocity (as it has three components in space and one in time). Understanding this allows one to make more sense of the (seemingly bizarre) time dilation effects of traveling close to the (three-)velocity of light. If Bob speeds away from Alice with enough acceleration to approach near the speed of light through space (i.e. the three-velocity of light), the equations of Minkowski spacetime tell us that from Alice\u2019s reference frame, Bob is moving very quickly through space, but hardly moving through time at all (after several years of Alice\u2019s life have passed, Bob will only have aged a few months). From Alice\u2019s point of view, she is not moving at all through space, but is traveling through time at the speed of light. (The speed of light through time can be thought of as \u201cone second-per-second\u201d \u2026 the faster Bob is moving through space - from Alice\u2019s reference frame - the more slowly he moves through time.) But both of them are moving through spacetime at the (four-)velocity of light, as is every particle in the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "As it stands today, per Einstein\u2019s special and general relativity (which both are still stands true after more than a century despite what lunatic fringe people said), no, you will never travel AT exactly the speed of light in vacuum - 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second) - only massless particles can attain them (such as photon) and that\u2019s only because they have no mass and they had move with the speed of light since they are born. The fastest we can possibly go ? Depend on how much energy that you can amass to drive your vehicle, the mass of your vehicle, and the drag your vehicle experienced when it moved against other mass (particles, radiation) in space. But no, you will not attain exactly the speed of light. Except, if somehow you can prove that there are loopholes to play around the light speed barrier (thus, in the same time, proving that all known fundamentals of physics are not complete), then may be we can see faster-than-light travels and/or communications. No, don\u2019t bet on all that science fiction novels and films that depicted faster-than-light travel. Maybe, just maybe, the entanglement of two particles over large distance will offer some clues. But, don\u2019t bet on it either. Personally I think the future of interstellar travel will be done like the movie \u201cPassengers\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Not relative to anything. However, if your question is \"can I travel to the Andromeda galaxy in a reasonable part of a human lifetime\", the answer is yes, due to length contraction/time dilation. If you think about it, it makes perfect sense - the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames, so if you have a constantly accelerating rocket, you just go faster and faster, just as your intuition tells you. But there's a small problem - by the time you get back, Earth will be a very different place. In Earth's reference frame, you will never have exceeded c (you exceed it in no reference frame, not even yours - the Universe just gets shorter), so your trip would have taken more than 2 million years just in one direction. For you, however, it takes just 28 years if you accelerate at a constant 1g (which gives you a nice comfortable pseudo-gravity as a side-effect). If you want to stop at Andromeda, it will require quite ridiculous amounts of fuel. If you just want to sail by, then the numbers are a lot better (4100 tonnes per kg of payload, for a perfect engine that converts 100% of the mass to energy).

Anything the interacts with the Higgs Field cannot travel at the speed of light (like matter), and anything that doesn't interact with Higgs Field (like photons) can't travel any slower than the speed of light. That said, the Higgs Boson while theorized for a long time was only observed for the first time in the recent past.  It might be possible that someone figures out a way to get matter to stop interacting with the Higgs Field at somepoint, but I have no clue as I only have a passing interest in particles not any real experience in such things. Lastly, it should be noted that wormholes are theorized to exist, which would mean light speed travel wouldn't be necessary, as things would be able to move vast distances at normal speeds. That said, no one has been able to demonstrate that one even exists, and even if they do we have no way of knowing weather humans would ever be able to create/control them to reach specific destinations.

We travel at the speed of light, c, all the time, but not in space\u2014only in spacetime. Photons and fields of the electroweak and strong forces travel at very nearly c in space and barely above 0 in time, due to quantum fluctuations and interactions with the tenuous matter present even in the deepest intergalactic voids. Only gravitational waves propagate at c. For example, the gamma rays from the neutron star collision GW170817 - Wikipedia arrived at Earth two seconds after the gravitational waves peaked, over a distance of 40 megaparsecs (130 Mly). Matter moves at 0 in its own reference frame in space, and at c in its own proper time. In other frames of reference it moves faster in space and more slowly in time, adding to a 4-velocity in spacetime of c. Edward Cherlin's answer to Is there any thing that travels faster than light?

The more interesting version of the question that I think you meant to ask is this:  how much energy would it take to accelerate a human (say, with a mass of 90 kg), to a velocity v, taking relativistic effects into account?  There's no physics that prevents you from going really, really fast (arbitrarily close to the speed of light), except for the practical question of where the required energy is going to come from to make it happen.

We need only find an object that is already travelling near the speed of light - relative to us, and measure our speed, 'relative to it'.  There are entire galaxies that are moving away from us at 'faster than the speed of light'. Therefore, relative to a being in those galaxies, we are travelling 'faster than the speed of light'.

Because much more we use a force to accelerate a physical object much more the resistance of the Cosmos will increase.

Let consider C (the speed of light - as an invariant) as a vector sum between the speed of time and the cosmic speed for any reference frame in the Observable Universe. C= Vt+ Vc ( imagine the vector signs above these letters) ( It is the speed of time and Vc is the cosmic speed of that system) How do we represent this speed? Here is a short answer: Victor Record's answer to Is there any proof that time dilation exists? This simple and tiny formula will be the basis of developing a powerful engine for future starships. ( We call that powerful engine a system) We have just to decrease the speed of time in that system and that system will increase his cosmic speed. Why? Because we do not use an internal force of the system. We use the force of the cosmic field around. The Cosmos will invite and will support us to increase the cosmic speed. Why? Because he maintains the order. ( how quickly you forget!) How faster we can go? When the speed of time ( Vt) will be near to zero then the cosmic speed ( Vc) will be near to C. But, we have to do this in outer space far away from other forces. What does it mean to decrease the speed of time? This is another story. ",

Further as the mass of an object increases, the amount of energy required to accelerate it also increases. Finally, calculations based on special relativity indicate that as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass would become infinite. As a result, the amount of energy required to increase the speed of the object also becomes infinite.  To date no experiment has ever been performed that has contradicted special relativity, so it is unlikely that faster than light travel is possible. There have been experiments that have accelerated sub-atomic particles to over 99% the speed of light, but never equal to or exceeding the speed of light. Experimental nuclear reactors encased in heavy water give off particles traveling faster than the speed of light, but this is because the speed of light has been slowed by the water.

People are talking of Alcubierre drive, a method to travel faster (retaining environment of 1g for the passengers) but to take advantage of such concepts that are still far from shaping up, is a far fetched idea. It may take centuries to come close to thinking of the possibilities.  I think we must stay within our own environment (solar family). At best we may go to Mars or even to Jupiter by improving the current physical speed, talking of moving with velocities close to c should be abandoned, at least for the time being.  WE MUST REMAIN CLOSER TO WHAT IS MANAGEABLE. I know many of us may not agree to that, but I base my thinking on limited available 'imaginative resources' to be utilized for more probable areas that are possible in near future.  ",

The greatest speed-limiter, if you will, is how darned inefficient our modern day thrust engines are - be they ion drive equivalents or just plain old chemical fuel. There are myriads of reasons for this, but let\u2019s pick the easy one - for thrust to be applied\u2026there must exist a pressure differential between rocket/outside world. Current devices run between 150 and 3000 or so psi. Get that up by a factor of 10, hypercollimate the exhaust stream (perhaps by reducing nozzle/bell size and using hundreds of mini-engines rather than One Big Engine)\u2026.and we just might be able to manage longer acceleration times and much faster travel within the solar system. I would think over the longer run we would use the Moon for this - literally, haul water to the Moon, use the abundant sunlight for solar cells to electrolize the water to hydrogen and oxygen\u2026and\u2026.there you have it.

            "answer_text": "It is not realistically possible for a rocket to go faster than about 10% of the speed of light using known technology. The problem is the weight of the fuel is too large, a rocket needs to carry it's own fuel. To get to 10% of the speed of light, H-bombs are supposedly sufficient, like in an Orion rocket. If antimatter can be carried, you could get closer, but this is probably a dream, antimatter is probably going to be impossible to store. H-bombs are 3% of antimatter, and don't need special handling. The only ways to reach 99.9% of the speed of light with fusion fuel is to collect materials from interstellar medium to build more bombs, in theory, you could gravitationally slingshot around a black hole multiple times, but considering the slow speeds of black holes orbiting, you won't get much boost. If you find a nearly-collided double-black hole a few light years from the solar system, maybe it can be done. Otherwise, I think it's not likely we'll be able to make a collector anytime soon. ",

If our speed is relative to Earth, or other frames of reference that are traveling at velocities reasonably close to earth, then there are a lot of answers to the question elsewhere, with high energies, Alcubierre warp drives, and the like. But much more simply than that, \u201cwe\u201d get close to the speed of light all the time, at least relative to some things. For instance, we travel quite fast relative to the cosmic rays that arrive constantly from various parts of the universe. The most energetic of this travel close to the speed of light relative to us, which means we are traveling near the speed of light from their perspective. Similarly, the relative velocity of the earth and the most distant galaxies in the observable universe is in fact believed to be greater than the speed of light, due to the metric expansion of space. We may be traveling multiples faster than that, relative to things outside the observable universe. So be lazy today, travel near the speed of light while having a cup of coffee and browsing Quora.

At that speed an object with as little mass as .7 grams, about the mass of a US dime, will unleash as much energy as the atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima. Assuming one could engineer this risk away, the next challenge would be the CMB. At .99995c (\u03b3=100) the CMB from the forward direction would blue shift to room temperature. I think this is probably an upperbound for human travel. Higher speeds would require increasing sophisticated heat sheilding. At .9999995c (\u03b3=1000 ) the CMB would be as hot as it was when it was originally emitted, when the entire universe existed in the plasma state.

This tautology sounds silly but it emphasizes the fact you don't feel anything just because you are moving at constant velocity relative to something. If you've learned the Einstein-Planck 1905-7 attempted extension of special relativity to encompass at least some aspects of acceleration, you will assert it requires infinite force get to c. Einstein and Planck are at the root of all the great advances in our world view in the 20th century. They did make a few mistakes; however, and their 1905-7attempt to extend special relativity to encompass at least some aspects of acceleration actually has no range of validity. Done right, you'll find nothing special happens passing with constant acceleration through c in a universe devoid of background radiation and intergalactic matter! In our universe you won't make it to c because increasingly blue-shifted background radiation and increasingly energetic intergalactic matter will end you and/or your ship's existence before you get there. Of course there's no reason you should just take my word on this. For details, I suggest checking out my answer to Why is it possible to get near the speed of light but not past it? ",

            "answer_text": "A ship in space can make the jump to light speed if it can achieve 3127 foot pounds of thrust. This is due the corrections as follows F=ma\u00b2 for Newton's 2nd Law of MotionE=mv\u00b3 , where v is the variable speed of light correction Einstein's Special theory of Relativity. You may not think Einstein needed help but he did by not having the refractive light index from 1987 at the time he made this formula.The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted \"c\" should be \"v\" for variable it is only constant because photons have to start at zero and accelerate out and flatlines with no other influences but no one thinks about it being slowed in the vacuum light lab. The time it takes for a photon to accelerate = 23321th of a second. This formula is now: E=mv^3 where light is variable not constant. If you have a photon in a vacuum light lab environment and you run the photon thru various shades of glass this makes the photon decelerate. Now with that information you have two or three reference points of speed other than your original value. This original commonly known as the speed of light in a vacuum which should only be used as one of the points of reference for the speed of a light photon. Then deriving with the other values found at the shades of glass now chart them on a linear graph from zero to infinity for the speed of photon of a light source. Then you know as a fact that speed of light is variable. ",

Even when you are going through space, you are not going through a void, the very fabric of the universe offers a type of resistance. See it like putting your hand through water, the water might look transparent but offers a clear resistance, the same happens in space, although much harder to perceive there is a clear type of universal resistance due to higgs boson particles , which is the reason why objects have mass.

            "answer_text": "Initially, it is a cosmic fact that the master universe both expands and contracts. For further study and understanding, I suggest reading The Urantia Book from which the wisdom below is written. We do not know the actual mechanism of space respiration; we merely observe that all space alternately contracts and expands. This respiration affects both the horizontal extension of pervaded space and the vertical extensions of unpervaded space which exist in the vast space reservoirs above and below Paradise. In attempting to imagine the volume outlines of these space reservoirs, you might think of an hourglass. 11:6.2 As the universes of the horizontal extension of pervaded space expand, the reservoirs of the vertical extension of unpervaded space contract and vice versa. There is a confluence of pervaded and unpervaded space just underneath nether Paradise. Both types of space there flow through the transmuting regulation channels, where changes are wrought making pervadable space nonpervadable and vice versa in the contraction and expansion cycles of the cosmos. 11:6.3 \"Unpervaded\" space means: unpervaded by those forces, energies, powers, and presences known to exist in pervaded space. We do not know whether vertical (reservoir) space is destined always to function as the equipoise of horizontal (universe) space; we do not know whether there is a creative intent concerning unpervaded space; we really know very little about the space reservoirs, merely that they exist, and that they seem to counterbalance the space-expansion-contraction cycles of the universe of universes. 11:6.4 The cycles of space respiration extend in each phase for a little more than one billion Urantia years. During one phase the universes expand; during the next they contract. Pervaded space is now approaching the mid-point of the expanding phase, while unpervaded space nears the mid-point of the contracting phase, and we are informed that the outermost limits of both space extensions are, theoretically, now approximately equidistant from Paradise. The unpervaded-space reservoirs now extend vertically above upper Paradise and below nether Paradise just as far as the pervaded space of the universe extends horizontally outward from peripheral Paradise to and even beyond the fourth outer space level. 11:6.5 For a billion years of Urantia time the space reservoirs contract while the master universe and the force activities of all horizontal space expand. It thus requires a little over two billion Urantia years to complete the entire expansion-contraction cycle. ( Urantia = earth.) Me: Isle of Paradise = Center of eternity and residential area of the Universal Creator and closely related equals, such as Ithe Infinite Spirit and the Eternal Son (The Trinity). Many other perfected celestial beings of various orders and class also have their habitation in close proximity to the Isle of Paradise. Keep in mind that all types of universe energy, force, gravity and other basic circuits of powers all have their origin from nether Paradise. The universes of time and space circulate around the central core of eternity. There cant be time without eternity. And there cant be infinite eternity without time. The universes of time and space occupy the outer area of eternity (think of it as a disk) and beyond and surrounding the universes of time and space, with eternity an center, there circulate at present 4 gigantic huge outer space rings, containng trillions upon trillions of uninhabited galaxies. All are a slowly transforming stage to be prepared for future habitation. ",

So the previous thought was that the atom would go into a state of suspended animation. But that is not all that will happen. The electrons that are traveling the other half of their orbit would be going in the opposite direction to the nucleus. As the electrons are said to be traveling st near the speed of light, with the atom going the other way at a \u2018for instance\u2019 estimated half light speed, the combined opposite speeds would give the electrons escape velocity.

I think it is very possible that in the relatively near future, it will be possible to transfer your consciousness into digital form, that everything that makes you \u201cyou\u201d can be moved to computer storage. Anything stored on digital media can be transmitted at the speed of light via radio or laser or other lightspeed media. We could put a receiver on Mars along with a computer robust enough to house our digital persons, and transmit them from Earth, at the speed of light. Could do the same thing around Proxima Centauri B, so on and so forth. Getting the receiver and computer to the destination would take place at much less than the speed of light\u2026 but people would travel not at merely \u201cnear\u201d that, but quite literally at it.

Information reduce space. Understanding is the absense of space. Duality is being at two or more places at once, meaning you dony have to fetch or travel, because you are already there. Think why people want to take reality and rocket it as far as possible.. They want information, yet black holes provide us with information. We do nt need to travel, we dreamtravel every night. I also doubt the absurd view of people age as i travel at light speed thinking's that you teach infinite momentum thus mass then pull nutronstar on yourself, implode as a black hole. Better stay at home, and feed your thought with stardust and radiation that already travel at a quantum level with your thoughts that also travel at lightspeed. ",

We will have perfected the molecular engineering of living and nonliving systems and blending those systems together, and thus we will have perfected nanotechnology. So\u2026, we would likely send clouds of microscopic ships made up of nanotech which could combine into larger ships along the way and they would not be life as we think of it now, but they would be alive and they would contain our minds. How fast could they go? Well, we don\u2019t know. We are accelerating things like lead ions to over 99% the speed of light. But, if we were sending a cloud of microscopic ships between star systems, we would want time to react, thus perhaps 90% with a time dilation factor of I believe 2.26 would be a good target speed, if the ships could handle the radiation they encounter.

To travel at speed of light., we would need an extreme velocity which is practically impossible for humans. But there can another way. From Einstein's eq. E = mc\u00b2 , instead of velocity, we would need a large mass which would compensate the velocity required. In other words, with the help of great mass . But it will be impossible to build such a big body on earth, since it should be much larger than sun. If we start now to build it.. Maybe, after few generation it would be completed and humans can time travel. But this too is nearly impossible since because even if we try to build it outside the earth, the gravitational field of other planets may influence. But.. Somehow if we managed this, then after building, space time graph would bend very deeper and gravitational effect kf our body may influence solar system and finally, this will be the end of solar system and obviously humans.

The problem with that is that it's a necessarily destructive process so there not even a theoretical framework for converting someone back. We could theoretically accelerate someone to near the speed of light and back down again, but the gain achieved from the expenditure of nearly infinite resources would be hard to justify, so I believe nobody would do it.

In our own reference frame, things are much more difficult. There is no practical way to get anywhere near the speed of light. That's too bad.

There is no such thing as absolute speed. Speed of any body or particle is only measured relative to some other body. Hence we are already moving near light speed if we consider electron as the other still media. It is all about perception. My personal thoughts are that once you cross relative speed with an object to that of speed of light, then you cannot interact physically with that object. However Einstein's theory predicts that crossing speed of light is impossible. ",

Beam the antimatter to the ship from factories orbiting stars. The ship combines the two at the focus of a parabolic sodium chloride reflector aimed opposite the direction of travel. Accelerate at 1 g toward the Centurie stars, after 3 years, turn the ship and decelerate at 1 g for 3 years, you have arrived at Alpha Century. Take an S shaped path so your X-ray exhaust doesn't sterilize all life. Apart from creating the antimatter the biggest problem is collisions en route.

It has not been proven or unproven, but it is worth noting that Einstein's general theory of relativity is in it's infancy as far as science goes, and we've observed all kinds of things that cannot currently be explained by our existing knowledge. In science it is very important not to jump to conclusions or assumptions, and I'm afraid that's what too many of the people answering are attempting to do.  It is safe for us to continue to say \"We do not know yet\".  Meanwhile, lets continue to attempt to explain the unexplained, and perhaps one day the answer will be clear. ",

To travel beyond the limits of lightspeed would require physics not currently available to us. Even the proposed Alcubierre drive, through it might possibly offer a way around this limitation, is not a machine we can realistically propose powering within the physics we now understand. So that answer is, and for centuries yet can only be, only if it's possible. ",

Photons have no rest mass as they have never been at rest,so they can move at the speed of light. To increase the velocity of an object energy has to be added to it. But when you increase an objects velocity you increase its mass,so you have to impart a bigger amount of energy in order to increase its velocity by the same amount as in the first place\u2026ad infinitum. So even if you started with just one atom its mass would eventually reach infinity so you would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it further toward he speed of light,which means you would have to convert the whole universe into energy to make the atom go faster. But since the atom itself is part of the universe,you would have to convert that into energy too so you'd have no atom to accelerate. Enigmatic innit. ",

The zero gravity in the outer space is the biggest advantage of reaching the speed of light. When you experience no gravity there will be no gravity pull. And by small impulse in space you can reach far places in thee space which is a great advantage but your acceleration must increase in order to reach speed of light as you will experience slight gravitational pull by celestial bodies if you ever passed through it. So this may decrease your velocity resulting in failure of your mission in order to reach speed of light. ",

This could be addressed by a hypothetical Bussard Ramjet basically an interstellar jet engine that sucks in interstellar matter from the front and uses them as fuel by some process (antimatter?) which turns it into very efficiently into kinetic energy. However, I think preliminary calculations indicate that the drag of the ramjet would be greater then the forward acceleration. Another problem is that everything comes at you at the speed of light which would lead to a very intensive radiation in the vessel. Hence, I think using even hypothetical technology it seems hardly possible.  ",

Relativity is based on the premise that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light and the physics has been confirmed thoroughly.  John Bailey's answer to To an observer in a space craft, could it appear that the craft is traveling faster than the speed of light due to time dilation? was nonetheless yes.  Because, if a space traveler measures their speed by the ratio of distance traveled against the background of stars and time from their shipboard clock they could in fact be going considerably faster than the speed of light. The math of relativity allows this situation but the energy required to produce the speed is beyond imaginable limits. ",

The rate the universe is expanding is at roughly 160 km/s per million light years.That means that If we round light speed to 300,000 km/s, and divide by 160, we get a distance of roughly 1,875 million light years. Anything that is currently that far away or further, if it emits light, that light will never reach us. I understand this to be a very rough approximation of the actual Hubble horizon, and explained badly? No doubt. But whatever the current Hubble horizon is (and it is getting smaller, because expansion is accelerating), everything that is further away than that is traveling away from us faster than c. Which means in the frame of reference of something past the horizon, we are traveling FTL. ",

This effect is called time dilation. Now you might be wondering how you can travel 1000 light years and get there in much less time then that without infact going faster then light and the answer here is you don't! Space infact contracts in front of you so you actually travel less distance. Now with this is mind, if an object where to be able to travel at light speed, what would infact happen is space would contract to its maximum amount.. Causing you to be at your destination without the need to travel and this is why you cannot go faster then light speed. ",

Although, practically speaking, space is a vacuum, it's not a perfect vacuum. At anything remotely approaching the speed of light (IIRC, 1% or more of c), a significant number of interstellar hydrogen atoms would pass through the hull of the ship, and the particle collisions would very quickly kill you with acute radiation poisoning. No practical amount of shielding with any known substance would prevent this. Since these are neutral atoms, they cannot be deflected with electrical or magnetic fields. ",
