            "answer_text": "Albert Einstein was really that great! Today, all of \u2018modern\u2019 physics is divided into two parts: Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics. AE initiated RT theory and contributed mightily towards QM\u2014 in fact, he got his Nobel for his elucidation of the \u2018Photo-Electric effect\u2019\u2014 which was an early effect of QM. It is generally agreed (by the leading physicists) that the General Theory of Relativity is a real tour de force and it likely moved the science of space, time, and gravity ahead by several generations! \u201c1905 was a huge year for Einstein. He published five papers in the German Yearbook of Physics, three or them groundbreaking. The first [and second] on the [size and] motion of particles suspended in liquid. He developed a mathematical formula to explain that the visible motion of the particles was due to the invisible motion of the molecules of the liquid. [This result established that atoms and molecules were real and could produce real effects! ] His second paper was on the photoelectric effect, or the release of electrons from metal when light shines on it. Einstein used the very recent ideas of Max Planck to explain the phenomenon. That is, he explained it in terms of quanta, or packets of energy. [And it might be considered the first QM theory! ] This was the first use of the theory outside of Planck's own work. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in physics for this paper. Last and perhaps most famous, Einstein published his special theory of relativity. This resulted in the shocking conclusion that time is not constant. Neither is weight or mass. When moving at high speeds, all of these things get compressed; only the speed of light remains the same. That happens because, said Einstein, energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared, or E = mc^2. \u2026 \u201c In 1915, he wrote the general theory of relativity. It was extremely radical. To account for gravity, time and space must be curved around massive objects. The math was very complex and the whole idea so strange that most people didn't accept it. But Einstein suggested three ways it could be proven. One was to make observations of starlight during a solar eclipse. Conveniently, a solar eclipse occurred in 1919 and astronomers made the observations that proved the general theory of relativity. Einstein became a celebrity. \u201d See in People and Discoveries: Albert Einstein \u201cApplications of Einstein's work \u201cThere are many applications of Einstein's work [GPS being one], but here are some of the bigger ones in astronomy: \u201cGravitational waves: In 2016, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected space-time ripples \u2014 otherwise known as gravitational waves \u2014 that occurred after black holes collided about 1.4 billion light-years from Earth. LIGO also made an initial detection of gravitational waves in 2015, a century after Einstein predicted these ripples existed. The waves are a facet of Einstein's theory of general relativity. [So, Einstein\u2019s theories are still relevant to physics and are still being tested\u2014 and proved correct! ] \u201cMercury's orbit: Mercury is a small planet orbiting close to a very massive object relative to its size \u2014 the sun. Its orbit could not be understood until general relativity showed that it's the curvature of space-time that is affecting its motions and changing the orbit. There is a small chance that over billions of years, Mercury could be ejected from our solar system due to these changes (with an even smaller chance that it could collide with Earth.) \u201cGravitational lensing: This is a phenomenon by which a massive object (like a galaxy cluster or a black hole) bends light around it. Astronomers looking at that region through a telescope can then see objects directly behind the massive object, due to the light being bent. A famous example of this is Einstein's Cross, a quasar in the constellation Pegasus. A galaxy roughly 400 million light-years away bends the light of the quasar so it appears four times around the galaxy.\u201d See in Albert Einstein: Biography, Theories & Quotes See also Albert Einstein: Appraisal of an Intellect \u201cWigner may have said it best: \u2018Einstein's understanding was deeper even than von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement.\u2019\u201d See in J. von Neumann and A. Einstein. ",

            "answer_text": "I said this before, Einstein and most likely Mozart (as he was buried in a potter\u2019s grave and too early for autopsies to be performed, let alone DNA) were not just smart, they were physically exceptional and as such had super-human abilities due to physical differences in their brains. People will tell you this and that about Einstein, but in the end, he single-handedly reformulated physics into Modern physics, he was the first person to really prove quantum mechanics (though he disagreed with the premises of the Copenhagen interpretation, which some people are starting to do serious now as well). He spent most of his life working towards a unified field theory, although many consider this a waste of time, yet new TOEs (theories of everything) are heading more closely in line with Einstein\u2019s approach than ever before with quantum loop gravity. I suspect Mozart was similar, there was some talk of the shape and size of his head and his hearing etc., although anecdotal. However, it is my belief he was physically different, and probably the most musically gifted person in history. Yet we will never truly know if Mozart\u2019s brain was physically different. However, of Einstein, we do know. Einstein died in 1955, and shortly afterwards pathologist Thomas Harvey preserved the brain and created samples and sections. Harvey wrote that he could not detect anything unusual, meaning that any variations were within the range of normal human brains. The only obvious visual aspect of Einstein's brain was that it was a bit smaller than the average adult brain. The matter rested until 1999 when Sandra Witelson et al. discovered that Einstein's brain lacked a particular small wrinkle, called the parietal operculum, which most people possess \u2014 suggesting that his brain compensated using other regions and were a little enlarged. Other unusual features were apparent at subsequent inspections. These regions, namely the inferior parietal lobes, are known to be related to visual imagery and mathematical thinking. The finding was that Einstein\u2019s brain was physically different; enhanced. A new study was published by anthropologist Dean Falk, and colleagues of Florida State University, in 2013. They analysed 14 of the photographs from the museum collection. In compilation, they reveal the entire surface of the cerebral cortex of Einstein\u2019s brain for the first time. This analysis revealed the pattern of grooves and ridges in detail and compared them to those seen in other brains. \"Einstein\u2019s brain has an extraordinary prefrontal cortex, which may have contributed to the neurological substrates for some of his remarkable cognitive abilities.\" Falk et al., suggests that the pattern of convolutions in Einstein\u2019s prefrontal cortex are physically different from most people\u2019s brains. The full details of this study are provided below. \u201cThe cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein: a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs,\u201d by Dean Falk, Frederick E. Lepore, and Adrianne Noe. Brain, Volume 136, Issue 4, April 2013, Pages 1304\u20131327, Cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein: a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs Essentially, Einstein\u2019s brain was different, and so was his thinking, an enhanced spatial conceptuality which may have been the brain over-compensating for what it perceived as deficient in other regions. We do not know what areas Einstein\u2019s brain was underperforming but we do know how the cerebral neuroplasticity made Einstein the genius he became, and unlike many geniuses, Einstein\u2019s brain was definitely how he solved some of the most difficult problems in modern physics. I work in Einstein's relativity as my career and listen to Mozart for pleasure, and I have spent a long time doing both. There is something sublime about both their work that seems to transcend what normal people are capable of. However, genius is too poor a word for a person that is physically different from the norm, boosting their intellect and creativity, and so prodigy seems apt. Our physical body affects our ability to do things. For example, Stephen Hawking, because of his body and the inability to use it, became able to do advanced calculations in his head. Just imagine the intellectual power of a person with an enhanced brain! Lastly, in the future, we will be like Einstein and Mozart, when people have the ability to enhance their brains in such a way as to perform tasks that would have previously considered super-human. But Einstein and Mozart were enhanced by accidents of nature. ",
