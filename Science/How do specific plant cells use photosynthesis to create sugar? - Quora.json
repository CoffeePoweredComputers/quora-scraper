            "answer_text": "Cells with chloroplast can prepare sugar in them. Chlorophyll trap solar energy and a complex series of light depending reactions take place in grana thylakoid of chloroplast. This produces ATP and NADH, acting as energy packets for another cycle of reactions (dark reaction) where glucose is an output. This cycle is operational in stroma of chloroplast and is light independent. ",
