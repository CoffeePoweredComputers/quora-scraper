            "answer_text": "Oxygen is dissolved in water - ask any fish. Cold water holds more oxygen than warm water - tropical fish can survive in warm water but other species like trout do not - it is again about oxygen content. As water temperature rise and dissolved air begins to leave solution, tiny bubbles form. BUT When water boils it bubbles furiously. Those bubbles are NOT air bubbles. Hot water will have lost all dissolved gases as its temperature rises. By the time it nears boiling ALL the dissolved air has gone. SO WHAT ARE ALL THOSE BUBBLES? STEAM. ",
