            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t take any. I generally only use cash. But I learned that if you cant pay for it in cash, you can not afford it. The freedom in that, is an actual freedom. I have never worried about having to make any bill. Because I didn\u2019t take any bills. The normal things food, water, electricity and cellphone only monthly payments. Thereafter, no bills. So, work, and save. Try to find trustworthy people to work with, and co-operate and work together and stack cash. Don\u2019t buy a bunch of unnecessary things. People talk a lot about 5G. Rare will be the 5G device I buy, nor a fancy cellphone or any other electronic gadget but those necessary. I buy everything used that I can, right to clothes. But for undergarments. I have a used car. I do this to cycle funds to causes I support, my neighbor, to express my interests, and support my community. And I save money. When a problem, I can pay. No concern. SO, do the best you can, avoid unnecessary material desires which are empty; a material focus can lead to a bottomless pit in pursuit of materials. Be content, constant desire for more things is a meaningless life. So, work hard, look for opportunities to magnify your resources, do not take debt unless for an investment with low risk and beyond normal reward, buy simply, and used, and learn to do things with your hands and mind. Cycle of Debt, inter-generationally, is more a notion than a reality. A social construct, likely of a radical Sociology and duplicitous Social Psychology. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy, stop spending more than you earn. Not rocket science. Only pay for absolute necessaries, simple food, housing, transportation, healthcare, etc and use every penny earned after that to pay off debt. When debt is fully paid off continue to save/invest until you have enough put away to last a year or more then continue to put away a substantial amount, 10% or more before spending on anything beyond survival level. BTW necessary for survival does not include Starbucks, steaks, new cell phones, redecorating, play stations, BMWs, vacations, fashion anything, more than a few pair of shoes, etc. Original A2A question: How does someone break the debt cycle that their family has had for generations?
