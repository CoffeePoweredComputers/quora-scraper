            "answer_text": "Well, first you need the reaction of hydrogen combustion, which is;- 2 H2 + O2 ----> 2 H2O  The molar mass of hydrogen gas (H2)  is (2 * 1.008) = 2.016 g/mol. The molar mass of oxygen gas (O2)  is (2 * 15.999) = 31.998 g/mol. The molar mass of water (H2O)  is (2 * 1.008 + 15.999) = 18.015 g/mol. So, according to the equation above,  (2 * 2.016) = 4.032 g of H2 will completely react with 31.998 g of O2 to produce 36.03 g of H2O.   Therefore,  if 4.023 g of H2 produces 36,03 g of H2O, then the amount of water produced by 1 g of H2 will be;- Mass of H2O  =  (1/4.032 ) * 36.03                          = 8.936 g H2O Dividing this mass by the molar mass of H2O we get;- Moles of H2O  = 8.936 /18.015                           = 0.496 moles H2O            ************************************************************* That's the long winded version.....  a simpler solution would be to realise that 1g of hydrogen gas represents 0.5 mole of H2.  And since, from the equation above, 1 mole of H2 will produce 1 mole of H2O, then 0.5 mole of H2 will produce 0.5 mole of H2O. ",
