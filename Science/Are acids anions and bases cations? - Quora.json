            "answer_text": "You seem to be confused over terminology (not to worry - everyone gets confused on terminology to start with) so I assume that you are just starting to learn chemistry. A few definitions should help\u2026 Anion = Any ion with a negative charge Cation = Any ion with a positive charge Anions and cations combine to form ionic compounds so that the charges cancel out. An acid contains two ions, a hydrogen cation plus one other which has a negative charge to cancel the positive charge of the hydrogen, so is an anion\u2026 Examples Hydrochloric acid = HCl = H^(+) cation plus Cl^(-) anion (chloride) Sulfuric acid = H2SO4 = 2H^(+) cations plus SO4^(2-) anion (sulfate) NOTE: the names of acids always end in \u201cic\u201d which is part of the \u201ccode\u201d used in chemistry terms to mean \u201cthis is an acid\u201d. The simplest definition of an acid is a substance that dissolves in water to form hydrogen cations as the only positive ion. A base also contains 2 ions, usually a metal cation (or ammonium) with a positive charge plus either an oxide anion = O^(2-) anion or a hydroxide anion = OH^(-) anion. Examples Copper oxide = CuO = Cu^(2+) cation plus O^(2-) anion Sodium hydroxide = NaOH = Na^(+) cation plus OH^(-) anion Any base will react with any acid to form a salt plus water ONLY. To name the salt, take the metal cation from the base and combine it with the anion of the acid\u2026 Copper Oxide + Sulfuric acid \u2192 Copper sulfate + Water CuO + H2SO4 \u2192 CuSO4 + H2O Sodium Hydroxide + Hydrochloric Acid \u2192 Sodium Chloride + Water NaOH + HCl \u2192 NaCl + H2O Bases which dissolve well in water are called ALKALIS whereas those which do not dissolve easily in water are simply called BASES. If in doubt, call them all bases, you can\u2019t be wrong then. Summary. Acids and bases are ionic compoundsIonic compounds all contain at least one cation and at least one anion.Acids produce H^(+) cations.Bases provide the oxide or hydroxide anion that reacts with hydrogen cations to form the water.",

            "answer_text": "There are different definitions of \u201cacids\u201d and of \u201cbases\u201d. The old definition of Arrhenius is that acids form hydrated H^+ ions in aqueous solution, the more formed, the more acidic. And the definition for bases is that it forms hydrated OH^- ions in aqueous solution, the more formed, the more basic. Water is neutral with equal amounts of each type of ions, at a very small concentration, near 10^-7 molar (under ordinary conditions, of temperature & pressure). Of course, in an acid solution when hydrated H^+ cations are formed (from neutral acid molecules), there are some counter-balancing anions of some sort. Also in a base solution when hydrated OH^- anions are formed (from some overall neutral base), there are some counter-balancing cations of some sort. There is also the Bronsted-Lowry definition of acid and base. Here an acid is an H*+ donor, and a base is an OH^- donor. Overall in a solution (or in the gas phase) the overall system is electrically neutral regardless of whether a substance is an acid or a base, so that there are equal magnitude charges of cations & of anions. But a solution of such an acid or base need not have significant concentrations of H^+ or OH^-, or or cations or of anions. The Bronsted-Lowry is in some sense an extension of the definition of Arrhenius. But the Bronsted-Lowry definition applies in more a general class of solvents \u2014 and instead of having the characteristic reaction: acid + base \u2014-> salt + water it has a characteristic reaction acid + base \u2014-> salt + solvent There is a yet more general definition of acids & bases \u2014 namely that of Lewis. But maybe we do not go into that right of the bat. ",

            "answer_text": "No, the other way around in terms of Bronstead acidity. This class of acids release H+. It is that cation that gives rise to the Lewis acidity and is the basis of the pH scale. A base is something that accepts a H+ so are normally anions. It is important to note that these acids and bases are almost always neutral before they are dissolved in water. In terms of the broader definition of Lewis acidity neutral compounds can absolutely be acids or bases. A Lewis acid craves electron density (like a H+) and a Lewis base loves to donate electron density (Like an -OH). Lewis acids and bases can be charged too, but the acids are actions and bases anions.
