            "answer_text": "From a classical point of view it can\u2019t, because it is an absolute scale, where 0 K is defined to be the zero kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. No kinetic energy - no temperature - simple as that - but freezing cold !! It can be compared to the gas pressure measurements, which is also an absolute scale, that is no pressure (no Pascals) - no atoms or molecules in that measurement volume. Furthermore, both Temperature and Pressure are considered to be scalar quantities. In this respect, they can\u2019t really be \u201cnegative\u201d in a classical sense. ",
