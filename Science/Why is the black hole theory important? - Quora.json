            "answer_text": "Black hole studies are super important because black holes have the power to [indirectly] create, sustain and destroy anything in the universe. Create and destroy really just mean transform. They are observed to be the most massive, powerful and luminous \u201cobjects\u201d in the entire universe. If they weren\u2019t so gravitationally powerful and if they allowed light to escape constantly, they\u2019d always look like the brightest stars in the universe, and we\u2019d see them with our own eyes in the center of almost every galaxy. Because that\u2019s not the cause, we only occasionally see them light up and that\u2019s called a \u201cquasar.\u201d  So they are not only the most powerful, massive, and potentially luminous but they are also consistently in the center of all the action! They are at the heart or in the navel (middle) of almost all of the largest structures in the universe (galaxies).  The term \u201cblack hole\u201d is so misleading because they typically contain more light/energy/matter than stars, and they are intensely full/condensed/massive. They contain gravitational singularities. Studying black holes may lead to understanding how the universe itself was \u201cborn\u201d from a gravitational singularity. Thus black holes may contain the deepest secrets of the universe and its beginnings. A self-study of astrophysics lead me realize that in my childhood/family religion (Hinduism), Supermassive black holes were worshiped as the primal manifestations of God represented by Shiva/Vishnu/Brahma/Krishna etc... I was happy to realize this, because I was indoctrinated with concepts like God was the most powerful, luminous, creative, sustaining, destroying person/force in the universe and was manifested in the center of every mini-universe (galaxy). The sages may have tricked us into worshiping supermassive black holes and gravity, for good reasons I believe. Hindu temples are built like little galaxies, with God in the center and we \u201cdevotees\u201d walking around/circumambulating (orbiting) God. The love between Shiva and Shakti (God/Goddess) is akin to the love play between spacetime/gravity and energy/matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Studying Black Holes, is very important.  Black Holes gives us a way of studying abstract concepts like Gravity and general relativity, magnetic field and many properties of these concepts. Did you know, a supermassive blackhole is theorized to be at the center of every galaxy, implying it is necessary for the existence of a galaxy. 3) It explains the concept of Tidal Forces.  4) It accounts for a significant amount of mass in the Universe 5) Scientists have synthesized a Dumb Hole using the concept of Black holes- Definition of Dumb Hole - Sonic black hole is an acoustic black hole. It won\u2019t allow sound to escape.  Imagine the applications of this creation. 6) A moving or spinning black hole can hypothetically create a wormhole, a way of transitioning across space faster than light.It is hoped that in the future some means of transport can be founded to help us travel in these portals, which may lay base for the search of extra-terrestrial beings and uncommon minerals and elements. Here is a link that can explain the workings of a Black Hole interactively -   ",
