            "answer_text": "Pretty much all elements have multiple naturally occurring isotopes and uranium is no exception. All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in the nucleus, (for example, uranium has 92) but the number of neutrons can vary. The number of protons determines the electrical charge of the nucleus and therefore the number of electrons in a stable atom and the electron configuration. The electron shells are the main controllers of the chemical and physical properties of an element. Since neutrons have no charge, they have no effect on the charge of the nucleus or on the electron shells. Varying the number of neutrons in an atom therefore has little effect on its chemical or physical properties, though it can significantly impact the nuclear properties. As a result, atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are considered to belong to the same element, but constitute different isotopes. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost every element exists as a mixture of isotopes. Elements are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus; so long as that is the case, you can have different numbers of neutrons, as long as that\u2019s neither too many nor too few. \u201cToo many\u201d and \u201ctoo few\u201d will differ from element to element, but most elements have a range of values for their number of neutrons. So that\u2019s how: different uranium isotopes have different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. ",
