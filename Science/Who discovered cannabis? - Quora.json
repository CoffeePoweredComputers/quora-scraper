            "answer_text": "The earliest record of man's use of cannabis comes from the island of Taiwan located off the coast of mainland China. In this densely populated part of the world, archaeologists have unearthed an ancient village site dating back over 10,000 years to the Stone Age. Scattered among the trash and debris from this prehistoric community were some broken pieces of pottery the sides of which had been decorated by pressing strips of cord into the wet clay before it hardened. Also dispersed among the pottery fragments were some elongated rod-shaped tools, very similar in appearance to those later used to loosen cannabis fibers from their stems.These simple pots, with their patterns of twisted fiber embedded in their sides, suggest that men have been using the marijuana plant in some manner since the dawn of history. PS: Most probably it must have been discovered before, however we do nto have any records to show off. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on who you ask. Some will say God, and others will claim Mother Nature (also called Gaia) and Father Time procreated. In some cultures, a series of God-like superheroes caught in an endless war for immortality are the founders. Many still believe animal spirits are responsible, while others will claim the discovery for themselves. In this shared version of reality in which we inhabit, I'd say it was Tommy Chong (actor). Also Steve Jobs created computers to surf @Al Gore's Internet so I could relay this information to you and the masses through this website created by Jimmy Wales. ",
