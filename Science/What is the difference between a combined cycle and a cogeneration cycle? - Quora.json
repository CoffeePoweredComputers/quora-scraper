            "answer_text": "Combined cycle is the typical process which uses both gas (gas turbine) and steam (steam Turbine) to generate the power which is 50% higher than the normal process. Co-generation Cycle is the method where the consumption of steam required for the process (like sugar plant or paper mill), but the consumption rate is meager and the max portion of steam used to generate the power using seam turbine for their power requirement. most of the captive power plant works in this co-generation terminology.

            "answer_text": "Combined cycle is using the heat (waste heat) from the first cycle to run a second cycle. You have two cycles. Co-generation is producing with one partition of heat electricity and with rest of heat is used for food production, district heating, industry etc. Everything is in one cycle. ",
