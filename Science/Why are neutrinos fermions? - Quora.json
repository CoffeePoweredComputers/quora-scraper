            "answer_text": "One could argue that since each neutrino is associated with a charged lepton, it would make sense that neutrinos would be fermions.  It's also true that the only standard model fundamental bosons are force carriers (e.g., photon, W+/-, Z), it would make sense that neutrinos not be bosons.  But both of these assertions lead to a follow up: why are leptons fermions?  why are quarks fermions?  To which there is no real answer.  I wonder if you're asking, \"How do we know that neutrinos are fermions?\" and the answer to that is: by looking at decay product angular distributions and spin statistics. ",

            "answer_text": "Physics doesn't, won't, can't (or any other negative \"thing\") answer a question which starts with \"why\". The simplest and the most common answer: it is the way that the nature is. If you really want an answer (which won't be satisfactory), then ask this to a philosopher. They usually try to answer these kinds of questions, and fail miserably, then creating a huge subject to devote themselves to first understanding (not answering) these questions fully. They usually become divided, some arguing that his/her view should be true, another saying his/her. ",
