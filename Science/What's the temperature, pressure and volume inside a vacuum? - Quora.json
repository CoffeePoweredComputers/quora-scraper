            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you're asking about a very small object's (almost insignificant, like us) temperature, pressure and volume in space. Temperature: It's the same as when not in vacuum. However, some heat is lost/gained via radiation depending on how far the heat source is.Pressure: Assuming the pressure comparison being between Atmosphere and vacuum, the pressure difference is enormous.It is important to know that vacuum is not a certain specific value of pressure, but a range.Man has not been able to create perfect vacuum.Below are the ranges of pressure under different 'vacuum qualities' or how low the pressure is. Source: Wikipedia Volume: The volume remains the same. It may contract or expand depending on the heat transfer taking place.I would recommend reading How would buoyancy act differently in vacuum? Would the lack of air affect the floating or sinking object?  and What Really Happens When You Get Blown Out of an Airlock  for more interesting information about how things behave in vacuum. Cheers.
