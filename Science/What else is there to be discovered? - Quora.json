            "answer_text": "See, this is Exactly the Problem with modern day Society. There\u2019s Too much complacency and Ignorance. Everyone just accepts what they are told and No One Questions Anything. We need to start Questioning more, and accepting less. A Child repeatedly asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019s Not truly interested in Why, he just wants a better explanation. It\u2019s a test of Parent\u2019s Patience. We need to start asking, \u201cBut Why?\u201d more often. With the intention, of discovering Real answers. If you know and Understand REAL Science, then you would realize there\u2019s a Fleet load of things to discover. Exotic materials is one subject. AntiGravity is another. The list is nearly endless. Start by getting a proper education in the Sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Electricity, Materials, etc. Hint: Electrical voltage at a specific frequency alters the atomic structure of a material, leading to new, previously unknown substances.

There are laws to this reality but what are they? All the problems in the world are due to our disparity of form with these laws yet you hold the key to uncover these laws deep within you and be apart of the process as an active component. Yes there is much to discover on the outside but for you my friend there is a whole world underneath what you see and it still needs to be discovered. What is the purpose of my life and where do I fit in to this galactic process.  ",

I am not talking about what\u2019s in far away planets/stars/galaxies, 85% of the universe does not interact with any form of electromagnetic waves which means we cannot see it with visible light, infrared, x-rays or any technology we know of. We call it dark matter/dark energy cos we can\u2019t even invent a name to describe it. We know it is there because of its gravitational waves and we don\u2019t Really understand how those work\u2026 so based on that, event if if we knew everything there Ian to know about our \u201cvisible\u201d universe, we would only know about 15% of everything\u2026 makes you think doesn\u2019t it?
