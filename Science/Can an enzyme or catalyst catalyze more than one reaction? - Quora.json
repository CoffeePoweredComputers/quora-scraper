            "answer_text": "Yes. They can. Take the example of isomerases. Suppose, triose phosphate isomerases. They convert dehydroxy acetone phosphate (DHAP) to 3-phospho glyceraldehyde (3-PGAld). They can also catalyse the backward reaction (i.e. convertion of 3-PGAld to DHAP). Although the nature of reaction is same (i. e. Isomerisation) but they are two different reactions. This is true for all isomerases. And apart from isomerases, there are other examples as well..! Thank you.. ",

            "answer_text": "No! They just simply can't because enzymes and catalyst act upon certain special or specific substrate. They just perform single function at a time To amplify a reaction. The catalyst are usually chemical which increase the rate of reaction . And the enzymes are those which helps in digestion of certain organic materials. ",
