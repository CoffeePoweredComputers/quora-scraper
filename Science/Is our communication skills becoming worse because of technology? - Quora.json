            "answer_text": "Many understand communication skills as the skill of language. Language is only a tool that is used for communication, but language is not communication. Therefore to infer that technology innovation has made our communication worse would be incorrect. But technology innovation definitely has impacted the quality of language adversely. It all began with the advent of Short Messaging Services or SMS as mobile handsets started going \u2018Smart!\u201d To shorten the message, people started truncating spellings, avoided long vocabulary and ignored grammar that otherwise prevented loss of clarity. Online dictionary attached to all smart devices ensured that people forgot spellings they knew and the students never bothered to learn spellings of the words which were compulsory till up to the previous generations when they studied. Of late Web Apps for correcting grammar like that of \u201cGrammarly\u201d gave instant solutions for correcting what is written to anyone further seen to it that people do not find it important to learn Grammar which was also compulsory to learn earlier. Today, if you ask people to write an 800 words Essay with pen and paper, it is quite likely that most of them would make spelling and grammar mistakes. It is quite unfortunate to see that how creativity in language has come down drastically with the shrinkage of vocabulary among the students as well as that of adult professionals. This often made communication devoid of subtle pleasantries and often too clinical and detached which was not the case earlier. The \u2018cut-paste technology\u2019 further ensured copy cats that never bothered originality. What we call Victorian English that emitted beauty, elegance and at the same time professionalism is seldom seen these days in language thanks to the neo-discovery of e-mail etiquettes, etc., which simply went straight away to the point, sharing information without much being worried about frills and festoons of language! One thing that technology ensured is \u201cthe Lightning Speed\u201d of the information transmitted which of course is a boon that technology gave to the world. Well, the connoisseurs of language have assigned 7% importance to vocabulary while 55% to Non-verbal communication and the balance 38 to Voice inflections in communication. Therefore those who have mastered non-verbal communication and attained good proficiency in voice modulations still can do better communication even if their verbal communication is weak. Fortunately Non-Verbal communication and Voice inflections can\u2019t change because they are manifestations of emotions and intent of why we communicate which form the most crucial ingredients of communication.
