            "answer_text": "Being a mathematician does not make you a \u201csuperior intellect\u201d to Einstein. If that were the case, they would have written the papers that Einstein did - and I encourage everybody to read the actual papers themselves instead of looking for Answers on Quora which are naturally limited. Special Relativity is high school math with otherwordly, genius reasoning. So much so, that even Poincare himself did not fully grasp it\u2019s implications when he read it: The Moszkowski Affair So many wrong answers on here (and you\u2019ll notice they don\u2019t have any citations or references). How can Poincare possess a \u201csuperior\u201d intellect when he couldn\u2019t even grasp the physical implications of Einstein\u2019s 1905 paper? He might have been a better pure mathematician, but not a better THINKER. In other words he wasn\u2019t \u201csmarter\u201d (however you choose to define intelligence). Major difference. I have written about this in other areas, but the myths persist. The short answer is NO he did NOT steal any ideas. For some reference read Waler Isaacson\u2019s biography: Einstein: His Life and Universe: Walter Isaacson: 9780743264747: Amazon.com: Books Or the even better Abraham Pais scientific biography on Einstein (written for real physicists): Amazon.com: Subtle is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein eBook: Abraham Pais: Kindle Store Or Einstein\u2019s work on Quantum Theory by Douglas Stone: Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian: A. Douglas Stone, Gabriel Vaughan: 9781491531044: Amazon.com: Books You won\u2019t learn much on Quora other than superficial introductions to the history of ideas. Any earnest treatment must be done by delving into the literature.  Here is his notebook on General Relativity, you can read it yourself (if you can understand it): Einstein's Zurich Notebook Here is a physicist and science historian, John Stachel, on Special Relativity and the issue of citation/priority: Einstein's Discovery of Relativity I encourage you to read Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography on Einstein, where he clearly explains the lineage of ideas that led to the relativity principle. Relativity did not begin with Poincare or Lorentz, but with Galileo. Einstein rederived everything Poincare and Lorentz had done from first principles - the constancy of the speed of light and the supposition that the laws of physics should be the same for all observers. Lorentz was not even the author of the Lorentz transformations. Poincare was the first to write down the correct Lorentz Transformations and yet it is named after Lorentz - it remains a historical puzzle why. Einstein did not NEED Lorentz nor Poincare to reach SR. In theory, all you need for SR is Galilean relativity and Maxwell\u2019s equations, and this is why Lorentz always gave Einstein priority over Special Relativity. Fitzgerald should be given priority of length contraction over Lorentz; and that Special Relativity is innate to Maxwell\u2019s equations themselves. Nobody\u2019s going to be as prolific as Einstein was in today\u2019s academic environment, it is too over saturated. Specialization is mandatory in today\u2019s academic world. Einstein was the last \u2018natural philosopher,\u2019 somebody who made seminal, field-shattering contributions to every subset of physics: Statistical Mechanics (Brownian Motion) Thermodynamics (Specific Heat of Solids) Cosmology (General Relativity) Kinematics & Electromagnetism (Special Relativity) Physical Chemistry (Avogrado\u2019s Number/Quantum Vibrations) Condescended Matter Physics (Bose-Einstein statistics/Bose-Einstein Condensates) Quantum Theory (Photo-electric Effect, Spontaneous and Stimulated Emission) Steady State Theory (Quantization of Chaos Theory/Bohr-Sommerfeld Conditions) Astronomy (Gravitational Lensing/Einstein Cross/Einstein-Rosen Bridges) Classical Mechanics (Equivalence Principle) etc. The real question is will we ever get another Einstein any time soon? Between Newton and Einstein (honorable mention to Maxwell) was about 200 years. It maybe another 200 years before we get another Einstein. If anything Einstein is UNDERRATED. Fantasy Physics: Should Einstein Have Won 7 Nobel Prizes? What Is a Boson? Einstein Was the First to Know  He worked 6 days a week as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, doing physics when his supervisors weren\u2019t looking. He had no access to academic libraries, calculators, or fellow scientists to correspond with. He had not read Poincare\u2019s work either. And yet he published 4 papers that changed science. Special Relativity: it was Einstein who derived it from first priciples: The invariance of light (constant)The laws of physics are the same for all observers (iniertial frames)And from this he was able to derive the conservation of energy critical to SR, without which SR makes no sense. Poincare did not do this, Lorentz, did not do this. Lastly, the defining principle of relativity is the principle of reciprocity, an idea Poincare never quite grasped (so much for \u201csuperior intellect\u201d) and an idea Lorentz didn\u2019t come to terms with until 1915. 10 years after the fact.  General Relativity was pretty much all Einstein. He got a bit of math help (as in pointing out what recondite branch of math to use for a theory that he was literally building from scratch ) from Marcel Grossman, and Levi-Civita. Einstein taught Hilbert his theory, and published the correct field equations 4 months before Hilbert did: Findings Back Einstein In a Plagiarism Dispute Hilbert\u2019s equations were NOT generally covariant. Moreover, to Einstein had already written down the correct formalism for his field equations back in 1912, 3 years before the \u201crace\u201d to final field equations between him and Hilbert (he hadn\u2019t realized they were in fact already generally covariant). Real scientists regard him as the pinnacle of scientific thought along with the great sir Isaac: BBC News | SCI/TECH | Einstein the greatest ",

            "answer_text": "In the case of general relativity the answer is just plain no. Einstein did all the work, and he did nearly all the work in complete isolation, except for the last months of 1915, when he was competing very intensely with Hilbert and Noether to make the final form of the theory. By Nov 1915, he had the vacuum equations, certainly without any input from Hilbert, and he used these to calculate the perihelion advance of mercury (getting the right answer) and the deflection of light from the sun (doubling his earlier answer). These equations he already considered in 1914, but rejected, because of the infamous \"hole argument\". Einstein realized the hole argument was wrong in 1915, but Hilbert's letters to Einstein still repeat the hole argument nonsense, so Hilbert wasn't further along. That was kind of surprising to me, because I thought the mathematicians would see the hole argument was nonsense immediately. Hilbert in Nov 1915 was rushing to follow, sending Einstein pre-prints with his ideas. The preprints annoy Einstein, who feels that Hilbert has done nothing significantly new. Einstein gets the field equations with sources at the end of 1915, with the term that is controversial, and Hilbert gets the same equation with the same term in a paper at the start of 1916 (in pre-print with Einstein's paper), except Hilbert has the action principle, and Einstein does it from the field equations. Both methods work, but it seems Hilbert made a mistake in the trace term, which wouldn't be significant, except people sometimes say Einstein stole the trace term from Hilbert. This is completely ridiculous--- Einstein found the coefficient of the trace term by insisting that the Bianci identity enforce the conservation of stress-energy in a free-falling frame, while Hilbert found the trace term (with supposedly a wrong coefficient, which he fixed in draft) using the action. So the convention today is that it's Einstein's field equations and it's the Einstein Hilbert action, and this is as it should be. Noether did something else during this competitive phase, she did Noether's theorem. So she wasn't interested in stepping over other people's research, she went and did something new. Which is also as it should be. But one must remember in this particular priority row that Hilbert was coming into the game in 1915, after Einstein had toiled on the equivalence principle and the weak field approximation, after rejecting Nordstrom's scalar theory, after formulating the Entwurf theory (a gauge-fixed crappy version of General Relativity with no elegance and wrong perihelion precession), and after Einstein had already calculated a billion things, with all the physicists thinking he had gone mad. It was only in 1916-1917 that people started to realize his stuff works, and by then, Einstein had moved on the the A/B coefficients and cosmology. Hilbert didn't do much, except find the action (it's not that hard) and try to take over the theory for the mathematicians. He then went on to do a bunch of silly unified theories that didn't work. For special relativity, it's a different story. Here the claims of plagiarism are somewhat more justified. Einstein cited absolutely nobody in his 1905 paper, because he did everything from first principles, so he didn't need to. But he was familiar with Poincare, he read Poincare's 1902 book, which contains some of the rudiments of special relativity. This is a lapse in academic honesty, he should have cited Poincare. He does cite Poincare in 1906 and in later life, he gives most of the credit for the special theory to Lorentz and Poincare. He might be forgiven for this lapse, because Poincare was confused on certain issues, like mass-energy equivalence, and Einstein sorted that out quickly. Also Poincare had a wrong philosophy, and I suppose Einstein didn't want to endorse Poincare's philosophy. Also, Poincare was already famous. But Poincare and Lorentz deserve co-credit for special relativity, as Einstein always acknowledged at the end of his life. Regarding all the other claimants, it's a joke. It's either anti-semitism or just professional jealousy. The idea that Einstein was stealing his main ideas is a joke, because his main ideas were laughed at for decades. Photons were laughed at, even by Niels Bohr, until 1919, when Milliken set out to disprove them, and instead showed the theory works. This was also when Compton scattering was discovered. General Relativity was laughed at until 1919, and even then, it wasn't fully accepted within physics until the 1960s.  Einstein also contributed to quantum mechanics in this period, but it wasn't until the 1920s that his wave-particle duality was considered serious. He promoted Bose and DeBroglie, both of whom were outside the mainstream. This stuff was also laughed at. In the 1920s, Einstein was a reputable respected fellow, but then came modern quantum mechanics, and he rejected the interpretation, and became a pariah again. His stance on quantum mechanics cost him other physicists' respect, but it really is a reasonable position, and it was shared to some extent by deBroglie. Schrodinger also jumped on the bandwagon because Schrodinger was deeply in awe of Einstein, but later regretted he didn't follow Bohr. Bohm showed in the 1950 s that deBroglie's interpretation was viable in a mathematical sense, but the jury is out on hidden variables. Bell showed that hidden variables must be nonlocal, but in light of holography, that's doesn't sound as crazy as it used to. Quantum mechanics could be fundamental and exact, or it could be a statistical description of some deeper thing, we just don't know. We'll find out when a quantum computer works, or doesn't. ",

            "answer_text": "These aren\u2019t rumors but well-known and oft-studied allegations. Einstein used the formulas of Lorentz, called them Lorentz transformations (so he wasn\u2019t hiding anything) but did not include a citation. Why? He was working in a patent office and had no access to the library where he would have needed to look up the citations. No internet in those days. Was he stealing the idea? No, not at all. He used a certain formula and did not hide the fact that it was Lorentz\u2019s formula. But Lorentz had no idea what the formula meant, how the mathematics said something about the physical world. That idea, the idea of what the mathematics actually means in the world was Einstein\u2019s contribution, not Lorentz\u2019s. Poincare also played with the same formula but couldn\u2019t figure out what it means physically prior to Einstein. In fact, Poincare probably never really understood Einstein\u2019s physics idea fully, although he was a far better mathematician than Einstein could ever hope to be. A similar thing occurred with general relativity. It looks as if Hilbert actually wrote the correct formula down about a week before Einstein did, but only after conversations where Einstein talked about the ideas and showed Hilbert the preliminary versions he was working on. There is no evidence Einstein ever saw Hilbert\u2019s formula first. Einstein came up with the formula himself without seeing Hilbert\u2019s finished work first (so no issue of a citation could arise.) Hilbert did not grasp what the formula was saying in physics. Einstein did, very well, and at great, excruciating mental effort. Hilbert himself never claimed that he beat Einstein to the theory, despite the fact that he wrote the formula down a week earlier, without understanding the full physics. In fact, Hilbert said something like \u201cEvery boy on the streets of Gottingen (Hilbert\u2019s university town) knows more four dimensional geometry than Einstein. But it took the genius of Einstein, alone and himself, to create the general theory of relativity and its meaning.\u201d EDIT: See the comments. Several have pointed out that more recent scholarship has debunked the prior consensus that Hilbert even wrote down the correct equations before Einstein. I believe their evidence. It seems that the article Hilbert sent to a journal a week before Einstein wrote the correct equation down was edited by Hilbert later, prior to actual publication but after he had seen Einstein\u2019s correct equation.

            "answer_text": "The question reflects a common misunderstanding of Albert Einstein\u2019s role in the development of the theory of relativity. The reason for misunderstanding is that Einstein published not only much original, good work in theoretical physics, but also much explanation, of relativity and of many other matters, for intelligent readers other than physicists. The best, and best-known, example is The Evolution of Physics by Einstein and Leopold Infeld. Because of these writings for the general public, which for many years were by far the best explanations of relativity, popular misunderstanding tends to credit Einstein with the entire discovery of relativity. When one then learns about the contributions of many other mathematicians and physicists to the development of the theory of relativity, it sharply contradicts this misconception. However, Einstein did not plagiarize anything; that would have been impossible because the preceding work was mostly well known to theoretical physicists. Einstein himself stated that he was not particularly good at mathematics. In saying this, he was only comparing himself with other theoretical physicists; he was in fact excellent at math, but the point is that his great discoveries were not mathematical equations giving new insights into the working of the Universe. Einstein\u2019s greatness was the opposite: Einstein primarily found new ways of understanding the Universe, which led to better understanding of the significance to physics of equations derived by others, either before Einstein\u2019s work, on in collaboration with Einstein. Here is an approximate outline of Einstein\u2019s contribution to the theory, and the context that others supplied: Special Relativity:The effects of time dilation and length contraction, including their precise formulas, collectively known as the \u201cLorentz transformation\u201d, were known for many years before Einstein\u2019s work. However, these effects were considered to be peculiarities of matter and/or electromagnetism, in accordance with Maxwell\u2019s equations, because matter is bound together by electromagnetic forces.Einstein\u2019s great achievement was his discovery that the Lorentz transformation could be entirely derived just from the one postulate that the speed of light (when measured locally) is always the same, uninfluenced by the motion of the source or of the observer relative to each other or to anything else. This implied the fundamental epiphany that the Lorentz transformation is not a funny characteristic of matter or of electromagnetic fields, it is a fundamental property of space-time. (An example of the importance of this change of understanding is in Ron Davis\u2019s answer to If it turned out that photons actually have a very small amount of mass, what would that mean for relativity?.)General Relativity:This discovery by Einstein led Hermann Minkowski to apply the powerful mathematical methods of tensor calculus, previously developed by several mathematicians, to the deeper understanding of special relativity. One reason Minkowski\u2019s work was important was that he introduced the concept of the metric tensor, which replaces the concept of length in Pythagoras\u2019s theorem with the idea of a definition of length that varies from place to place in a space, as e.g. on a curved surface. That concept had been progressively developed by many preceding mathematicians, as is described in Ron Davis\u2019s answer to What was the path that led Einstein to recognize gravity as curved spacetime (and so a \"fictitious\" force)?.Minkowski\u2019s metric tensor was probably the source of Einstein\u2019s fundamental inspiration, a concept of gravity that involves curved space-time, even though Minkowski\u2019s metric tensor was flat.Other reasons for the importance of Minkowski\u2019s work are the introduction of tensor calculus itself, which was fundamentally important in the development of a self-consistent theory, and the more specific fact it showed, that mass, the source of gravitation in Newton\u2019s theory, had to be generalized to the mass-energy-momentum-stress tensor.Even with these important contributions, Einstein was left with the task of finding an equation that incorporated these ideas, and that yielded a theory of gravitation consistent with observation. That derivation seems to have been a cooperative effort with David Hilbert. While Hilbert may have had more of a hand in that derivation, Hilbert himself acknowledged that the credit for the discovery of the equation belonged to Einstein, because Einstein had had the idea of using those concepts.Einstein never claimed any greater part in the development of the theory of relativity than that described above. He was a great theoretical physicist, but so were the other theoretical physicists and mathematicians who were involved. Einstein stands out in importance because he explained these concepts to the general public in a manner they could understand, which he could do because he had particularly great insight in understanding the physics, as distinct from the mathematics. He therefore promoted understanding and interest in contemporary theoretical physics, and inspired many others to enter the field, including me. ",

            "answer_text": "The claim has been made that Einstein \u2018stole\u2019 from H. A. Lorentz. This is even part of Nazi propaganda. Indeed, much of special relativity is embedded in Lorentz \u2018Theory of Electrons\u2019. However, Lorentz himself knew of Einstein\u2019s work. Lorentz never once claimed that Einstein plagerized his work. I read \u2018The Theory of Electrons\u2019 by H. A. Lorentz (1915). There is a free copy somewhere on the Internet. However, I am working with my own hard copy that I bought, used. I also read a monograph written by H. A. Lorentz on \u2018Einstein\u2019s relativity\u2019. It is entitled \u2018The Einstein Theory of Relativity\u2019 by H. A. Lorentz (1920). So you can see that the claim, \u2018Einstein stole from H. A. Lorentz\u2019, is false. It is more stupid than a lie, but it is false either way. Lorentz practically handed off the theory off to Einstein. Lorentz specifically says that Einstein\u2019s relativity is \u2018useful\u2019. He says that relativity, invented by Einstein, has many different applications. He also congratulates Einstein for \u2018bringing philosophy\u2019 back to physics. Lorentz did not equate philosophy with useless, which many people do. Lorentz claims that he himself never considered the hypothesis that the time that he defines in the Lorentz transformations was a real time. He thought that the time measured by the moving observer was somehow less real than the time in the stationary frame. So Lorentz praised Einstein chiefly for his ontology. Lorentz takes credit for most of what is now called special relativity. However, he comes up with one accomplishment that he attributes to Einstein. Lorentz claims that the central axiom of relativity is \u2018reciprocity\u2019. It is the idea that two inertial observers will see the others clocks as running slower than their own. This is often referred to as a paradox in antirelativity propaganda. However, it is appear that Lorentz did not think so. Certainly, we can\u2019t blame Lorentz for not acknowledging Einstein. However, I note that Lorentz did not cite other contenders. The Lorentz transformation was introduced by three people within a year of each other. It is understandable than none of them actually cited the other. Lorentz did not cite Poincare, who presented the Lorentz transformation from Einstein. Poincare may have been inspired by Lorentz. However, Poincare did not cite Lorentz or Einstein. Lorentz, Einstein and Poincare don\u2019t even have a separate list of references. Darwin doesn\u2019t have a separate list of references. They have acknowledgements regarding people that they have worked directly with. They sometimes had a footnote citation, especially when referring to experiments. However, the custom of having a list of references had not been formalized yet. This is something that became conventional later. There was another Lorenz, from Sweden, that put together a sort of relativity. However, he published in Swedish journals only. So maybe the whole gang stole from him. The accusations of relativity plagiarism are baseless. Special relativity was a dust storm ideas blowing in the wind. Einstein packed the dust together. Einstein\u2019s reputation became exaggerated among nonscientists. This is my opinion, of course. His reputation as \u2018smartest man in the world\u2019 and \u2018inventor of the atom bomb\u2019 is highly exaggerated. However, he was HIGHLY regarded among scientists. His peers thought very highly of him. Even without cutting up his brain! Most scientists thought him creative and brilliant. The scientists that don\u2019t aren\u2019t thinking as scientists in that regard. However, accusations of wrong doing are false. People that call Einstein a thief, a plagerizer, or a murderer (yes, I heard one of those) are false. These accusations of wrong doing come from crazy people, in my opinion. ",

It states most if not all of the time, the scientist that is credited with innovating or discovering something is usually not the one that credit should go to. How can this be you ask? Science is ruled by politics as much as anything else? Recall the famous Newton vs. Leibnitz war over Calculus! What it amounts to is that (and I know this is shocking) most of the things that were discovered were really discovered by others but the credit is assigned as a matter of convenience. There are countless cases like this: Gauss, Euler, Newton, etc, etc. I was in awe of disbelief when I found out things like the normal distribution which is generally credited to Guass and even called a Gaussian, was infact traced back to other scientists living around his time in Europe. Euler\u2019s equations, the same story.. Not Euler.. no way!.. but unfortunately it is true. So the Einstein thing doesn\u2019t surprise me too much. This phenomenon called Stigler\u2019s effect has been going on since the beginning of time. Here is a brief list of Stigler\u2019s law examples. Warning, this may destroy your world so read on your own discretion! List of examples of Stigler's law - Wikipedia It could just be because back then that\u2019s how things worked. This is why getting credit and recognition for your work even in science is not an easy task. It is really a fight for fame. Remember that Einstein was a rock star, he had fame. Due to Stigler\u2019s effect (Even that was attributed to someone before Stigler proving Stigler\u2019s own theory! lol), Even Jesus may not have been the real Jesus! .. lol ",

            "answer_text": "Lorentz transformation was indeed derived by some scientists before Einstein. First one was Voigt who derived in 1887 the transformation over which Maxwell equation is invariant. Larmor derived the same formula in 1897. Lorentz derived the formula in 1899. In addition, a mathematician Poincar\u00e9 came out with the same transformation in 1905 shortly before Einstein. Lorentz transformation was known to theoretical physicist as the formula to maintain Maxwell equation invariant, at the time Einstein submitted his own paper. In my understanding, Einstein did not steal the idea. Independently, Einstein derived Lorentz transformation on his principle of physics he postulated. As a matter of fact, he was not a professional physicist in those days when he was building up his own theory of relativity. He was a bureaucrat working for Patent Agency, who liked to spend his pastime to study physics. For that reason, he did not know of the works by Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9. Lorentz and Einstein started their derivation from different standpoints. Lorentz found the transformation over which Maxwell equation is invariant. As you know, Maxwell equation is manipulated into wave equation in the form: (\u22072\u22121c2\u22022\u2202t2)E=0.(\u22072\u22121c2\u22022\u2202t2)E=0. The wave equation includes operators called d\u2019Alembertian operator, which actually is the operators inside the parenthesis. Instead of the symbols [x,y,z,t][x,y,z,t] (first three are for spatial coordinate and the last for time), if we use [x,y,z,w][x,y,z,w] where w = ictict (ii denotes the unit of imaginary number); the d\u2019Alembertian operator is rewritten as 4-dimensional Laplacian operator. In other words, electromagnetic wave equation is a 4-dimentsional Laplace equation. Similar to Laplace equation being invariant over coordinate rotation, Maxwell equation is invariant over 4-dimensional coordinate rotation. The 4-dimensional coordinate rotation some scientists found was Lorentz transformation. On the other hand, Einstein started from his own postulation of principle of constant speed of light. His new idea was based on the unexpected observation in Michaelson-Morley experiment. Despite the different start point, Einstein derived the same transformation that some scientists derived before him. In Lorentz\u2019 style staring from invariance of Maxwell equation, Lorentz transformation can predict the principle of constant speed of light. Conversely, in Einstein\u2019s style starting from the principle of constant speed of light, Lorentz transformation can prove the invariance of Maxwell equation. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as an original idea. Throughout human history, men steal other men\u2019s ideas an claim the ideas as their own. They legalize their claims using western legal systems and patent laws, trademark laws, and copyright laws. For example Newton (1642 -1726) did not \u201cdiscover\u201d gravity. He simply used math to describe his observations about objects at rest, falling objects and for every action (force) there is a equal an opposite reaction. Newton then used math to explain why the moon orbits the earth and doesn\u2019t fly off into space. All these observations were made by many men (no women?) hundreds to a thousand of years before Newton. In the 4th century BC, the Aristotle (the Greek Philosopher) believed that there was no effect or motion without a cause. The same idea of Newton\u2019s 1st Law. In De Architecture, a ten volumn book written by many authors around 15 BC, the Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius (70BC ~ 10AD) states that gravity is not dependent on a substance\u2019s weight but on the nature of the substance a concept we understand today as specific gravity. Aryabhata, a 5th century Indian mathematician, developed geocentric solar system with eccentric elliptical model of the planets. Brahmagupta (598-670) an Indian astronomer and mathematician described gravity as an attractive force and used the term gurutvakarsan gravity, a thousand years before Newton. Johannes Kepler (1571 - 1630), a German astronomer, mathematician and astrologer was well known for his laws of planetary motion and provideed the foundation for Newton\u2019s work. The same applies to inventions like the light bulb, the electric car (especially the Tesla), the steam engine. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Rocket is based on Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky 1903 rocket equation. The same equation had been derived in 1813 by the British mathematician William Moore. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX Merlin Engine is a pintle engine used in the Apollo Program in the lunar lander. It was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Caltech\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at US taxpayers expense. And the lithium-ion batteries used in the Tesla car were first proposed by a British chemist M Stanley Whittingham in while he worked for Exxon in the 1970s. Today, the Tesla Lithium-ion batteries are built by Panasonic using a Panasonic patented design. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to take exception to one assertion by Mr. Heisenberg above. He states that SR was based on two principles, relativity and the constancy of the speed of light. But in his original paper, Einstein did not explicitly begin with the latter as a proposition. What he clearly stated was that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source. As pointed out by Isaacson in his book on Einstein, it is only when this is combined with the relativity principle that one concludes that the speed of light is independent of the motion of observers; i.e. the same in all inertial reference frames. Thus, the constancy of the speed of light actually follows as a corollary of Einstein's two propositions. Unfortunately, nearly all textbooks and explanations that I've seen make this same error. Does it matter? At one level, no; one can start with the constancy of the speed of light and proceed to derive the Lorentz transformation. But at another level, I think it matters very much. For the question that the inquiring mind asks is how did Einstein come up with this idea of the constancy of the speed of light, which is so different-indeed alien- relative to all known previous wave phenomena? And the answer is he didn't. As pointed out by Isaacson, once Einstein abandoned the notion of an aether, he had to figure what one could say about the speed of light and decided to deal with it by thinking of light speed relative to sources (not observers). One has only two choices: either it depends on the motion of the source or it doesn't. The problem with the former is that it is contradicted by observation, as was discussed in books given to Einstein when he was growing up (see Isaacson's discussion), but even more important, it made a hash of Maxwell's Equations which Einstein apparently found unacceptable. He therefore went with the proposition that the speed of light does not depend on the motion of sources, from which it immediately follows that it also cannot depend on the motion of observers in inertial frames since that would then violate the relativity principle if one switched frames of reference. Personally, I never understood how Einstein came up with his idea of the constancy of the speed of light until it was explained by Isaacson's (the book by Pais, ostensibly written for physicists, does not discuss this at all whereas Isaacson, a non-scientist, clarifies the issue).

However, if I can\u2019t explain WHY the formula works other than to say it fits the data, although I have contributed to our knowledge - in some cases enormously - I have not \u201csolved\u201d the problem. An equation based on experimental data that \u201cworks\u201d doesn\u2019t explain why it works, even if it is the right equation. Its the explanation and how it is derived from first principles that truly advances scientific knowledge. Dirac used math to predict the existence of the positron. There was no knowledge of its existence but Dirac\u2019s equations showed it had to exist. In fact it turned out others had actually seen positrons in their experiments but didn\u2019t recognize them for what they were. When positrons, and other antimatter particles were found Nobel prizes were awarded to the experimentalists. But no one would argue it wasn\u2019t Dirac (who also won a Nobel for his work) that deserved the credit for showing why they MUST be there in the first place. Maxwell too built on the contributions of so many who came before him when he developed his eponymous equations. But he explained the why and derived them from first principles and therefore is considered among the greatest minds in physics. I do not mean to minimize the tremendous work done by experimentalists. Their contributions throughout history have been immense. But I am always more impressed by the people who confidently, and correctly, state something MUST be so because their equations tell them it must be so. Or as Einstein put it so succinctly in 1919 when, following the confirmation of general relativity he was asked, \u2018what if the facts had not confirmed his theory?\u2019 'In that case, I'd have felt sorry for God, because the theory is correct'. Those that preceded him came up with formulas that fit the data e.g. the Lorenz formula. But they got the why wrong. They couldn\u2019t explain from first principles why the formula worked, or what it actually was telling them. Einstein did. By the way, those who say he was not very good at mathematics are comparing him to pure mathematicians. If you\u2019ve ever tried to \u2018grok\u2019 General Relativity you\u2019d know he was pretty good at it. That was not his field and he didn\u2019t have the breadth and depth of mathematical knowledge a pure mathematician does. But once someone such as his friend Grossman pointed him in the right direction he knew how to use it. More importantly, he understood and could explain to others what it was telling him about the universe and how it works. ",

How interesting it is that two intelligent humans can read the same material and take away entirely different perspectives on \"what is truth.\" While I myself have pointed out in several posts how Einstein's erroneous assumptions led to unnecessary postulation, it cannot be argued that in 1905 he was working blind as to the real construction of the universe.  The titanic change Einstein brought about was not in the math but in the interpretation - the courageous pronouncement that time does not pass at the same rate for all observers.  The arithmetic had already been perfected by Lorentz, the revolution was not in the equations, but what they meant.    The fact that Einstein failed to cite the works of others - could in my mind, be justified in the sense, that the 1905 publication was entirely new from the interpretative context...so much so that it rightly deserved to stand alone. The novelty lay in discovering the workings of nature at a fundamental level - the equations already existed, but they were impotent and confusing without his revolutionary slant. ....  citations would likely have had the effect of diminishing the magnitude of the step he alone realized and understood- so he re-derived them with the idea of making the formalism complete.    Years later (1929) he was asked to write a few short pages expressing his philosophy of life.  One sentence comes to mind:  \"Many times a day I am bothered by the thought I have borrowed too heavily from the work of others.\"   ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of relativity wasn't Einstein's, neither was he the first to the derive an equation for the equivalence of masd amd energy (e=mc^2). Poincare published a theory of relativity in his 1903 book 'Science and Hypothesis.' He too used the Lorenz transformation to derive his equation. Einstein told William Herrmanns that their derivations were mathematically equivalent. Poincare's theory was based on an ethereal 4-dimensional space whereas Einstein introduced the idea of a space-time continuum. It wasnt his mathematics that made me young Einstein famous it was this new conception that the continuum was curved. The concept that the dimensions of space can dialate snd contract with cjarge came from HA Lorenz years prior. He and Einstein maintained some correspondence snd there was no priority dispute among the men. In the case of the general theory he snd Hilbert were working on the formulation of the theory at the se time. Einstein was getting help in mathematics from Minkowski and published his theory first. I know not of the merit of Hilberts theory but know they were friends, Einstein being invited as special speaker at Hilberts 60th birthday celebration. Apparently Eimstein wrote Poincare to doscuss the difrrence in their theory but got no reply. Poincare's books are romantic math/science/mathemsyical philosophy books and he was surely an egoist of acceptable constitution. ",

Einstein said, \u201cThe secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources\u201d. Have you ever studied: Heaviside, Wien, Abraham,Poynting , Hasenohol, or Poincare? Poincare should have been attributed E=mc2. Einstein should have said, \u201cI copied the works of great scientists\u201d. I find very little novel in Einstein\u2019s works. Some say that Einstein divorced his brains when he divorced his first wife. Some say that he was a cad and a bounder, others say that he was a plagiarist. Some say that he paid Mileva Einstein-Maric off when he got some money to keep her quiet. I think that Einstein made a terrible mistake and derailed physics, he considered all mass to be E=mc2. Henri Poincare and others before him studied black body radiation and came up with E=mc2; but, they only considered that it applied to energy. I consider them correct. We need to back up and reconsider what the total matter is comprised of. Using John Poynting\u2019s equations, Henri Poincare was the first to come up with m=E/c2 (which is the same as E=mc2). There were many other scientists (including Newton) that had envisioned mass-energy equivalence, all scientists before Einstein considered it only applied to energy and not all of mass. I consider Einstein to have incorrectly assumed all of matter is convertible. https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/pa... http://web.ihep.su/library/pubs/...

            "answer_text": "One of the advantages of nobody on the planet understanding or agreeing with your idea is you do not have to put up with the suggestion you stole it. Once you win the lottery, or even more unlikely, come up with an idea of the magnitude of Relativity, they are always going to be others claiming part of it.Except there were none. Einstein wrote that the person who came closest to discovering Relativity was Ernst Mach, and it took Mach a long time to accept it. There was a popular saying at the time, that only 12 (or 10, or 20) people in the world understood Relativity. If only a handful of people, at the time, can understand something, even after  you explain it, it is safe to say  you did not steal the idea from them. Absent Einstein, it would have been another 10 years to the Special Theory and another 20 to the General Theory. \"Without Einstein, the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later\" Einstein, Walter Isaacson \"It had no footnotes or citations, contains almost no mathematics, made no mention of any work that had influenced it or preceded it.\" A Short History of Nearly Everything\" Bill Bryson ",

As Newton once wrote, \u201cIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.\u201d This expresses a main theme of Science, discovering new ideas by building on precious discoveries. The concept of a Space-time Geometry came from Applied Mathematics, Vector Spaces and Mathematical Physics; the idea of a constant speed of light and the fail of Aether Theory came from the Michelson-Morley Experiment; etc. In addition to this, there were several notable problems in pre-modern physics which were heavily discussed among Physical and Mathematical Academics, such as the inconsistency of Newtonian Physics and Maxwell's Electromagnetism. Albert Einstein came up with the Theory of Relativity by himself. He did, however, use every single tool provided to him by his Scientific Predecessors, from Galileo to Gauss, from Newton to Poincar\u00e9. Contrary to some popular myths, Einstein was a very good student and didn't drop out of High School or University. He finished his PhD in Physics, and wrote over 300 scientific papers. ",

            "answer_text": "Some food for thought in these issues 1-An interesting remark is that there is no particles in Classical Newtonian Mechanics .Particles here are mathematical idealized points (like the mass center , gravity center , etc.) .They are just suitable to mathematical description of real bodies .As a result there is no notion of extensive bodies motion on special relativity as we are used to think on Newtonian Mechanics .2- It appears that Special relativity applies only for elementary particles ,where their description is really on the frequency wave length domain through dispersion relations \u2026.. 3- If one puts a non zero cosmological constant on Einstein Equations of general Relativity , it appears that all experimental confirmations of Einstein Theory are lost (The deflection of light , for instance appears to be unaffected by the presence of a Cosmological constant , however the Einstein classical recipe to get the well know Newtonian potential from the Schwarzschild solution of the Gravity generated by a point mass in the presence of a cosmological constant is lost ! ) .4-On the quantum realm , when the theory is formulated on an Euclidean Sapace-Time , the coefficients of the metric tensor must satisfy very strong algebraic constraints that the metric coefficients matrix is a four dimensional positive definite matrix .This rules out the famous weak field approximation on Euclidean space times and consequently on Minkwoskian Space -Times .So one does not have \u201cGravitational Waves \u201c if these algebraic constraints are taken into account into the realm of the theory . Finally ,from a Historical point of view , Hilbert was simply trying to apply the variational method of his Student Emil Noether on the Gauss integral expression for surfaces curvature,now formally written (and without any connection with manifold Differential Topology-Chern Simons Class integral curvature invariants !) in four dimensions for semi positive metric signature (which is not a topological index on Euclidean four dimensional sapce times !). I think that Hilbert\u2019s only interest was merely to solve a sophisticated mathematical exercise without regarding that a new theory of gravitation was at stake as Einstein did ! . And still remains far to be completely understood in present days (opposite to Electrodynamics-QED !,at least at an calculational level , even if the photon concept is an elusive concept \u2026.) ",

I\u2019m also curious as to the absence of rumors about physicists stealing from Einstein, or from each other. The reality of physics research, is that physicists don\u2019t steal. Not citing other people\u2019s work, is asking for trouble. It draws attention to the fact that your research comes out of nowhere. So if you want to be read, and accepted (in critical sense), that is, after checking calculation results. the best way is to cite your sources, and explain how hour work connects to this or that line of inquiry. When I worked on my thesis, a student had chosen my advisor to be on his committee. This student\u2019s research had a scary-looking equation as starting point. The first thing my advisor asked, was one line-long. \u201cDerive this equation\u201d. When the student said \u201cBut it\u2019s a 4 hours calculation. What do you mean by derive?\u201d \u201cIf I called you at 4 AM and asked you how yo go from this step to the next, you should be able to tell me. You\u2019re about to become the world\u2019s #1 expert on that equation. Ten years from now, you will sleep much better\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I definitely can't say for sure. There are millions of researhes and works published in this world and many of them go unnoticed. The theory of relativity is a big thing, it is very different from Newtonian physics. Even Einstein was regarded as a mad man when he proposed this theory until ofcoarse when he proved it. So it is possible there have been some \u201cmad men\u201d in the past also. But know this, concepts like time dilations etc are very different from the conventional physics and there were no experiments to suggest that what so ever. Einstein did what are called \u201cthought experiments\u201d where he would be in a state of deep thoughts for hours to figure things out. Even today we have Einstein's brain preserved and it is a but different from an ordinary human brain. It is different in a way that it helped him imagine a lot. I personally believe that Einstein did not steal the idea of general relativity. It is possible that general relativity was hinted by someone before Einstein but Einstein himself worked hard on it.

            "answer_text": "From my knowledge of the history of Special Relativity, the critical ideas were floating around for the previous decade (from about 1895 to 1905).  Einstein simply made the clearest exposition on the topic and set in the full modern context and after his work there was quick adoption of Einstein's way of thinking about it (which others had at the same time).   Poincare and Lorentz both made huge contributions that influenced Einstein.  There are probably a dozen other names that deserve mentioning.   You shouldn't lionize people.  Einstein made vast and important contributions for nearly 20 years.  But there are lots of others who made major contributions before and after him. As for General Relativity, Einstein really pushed the idea much further than anyone else by a long measure and had the original conception and final formulation. Along the way, others made contributions, most notably Hilbert, but there were others. ",

It is impossible and needless to quote every single past instance of an idea that you use. People in the specific scientific community that Einstein was working in are well aware of the issues and the literature that is related to their field of research. Any such an attempt for plagiarism would have been noticed right away. It is very likely that Einstein was not the only person that thought about those ideas, but that is the common case. He was the first and the only one to put his ideas forward in a clean and elegant way. He by no means did not steal any idea from anyone. Einstein was and will ever be the single most important physicist in history having great influence on our understanding of space time which can be called Einsteinian and on molecular theory, quantum mechanics and many other fields of research.

Einstein developed the Lorenz equations on his own, but credited Hendrik Lorentz because of earlier publication of those equations.

At the point that Einstein understood that he\u2019d given David Hilbert enough information for Hilbert to work out the field equations, he quickly went home to finish them himself. After reviewing his efforts to date Einstein realized that his reasons for putting aside one previous line of work was incorrect; he picked up that work again and finished the field equations in short order.Einstein gave credit where credit was due.

No he d id not steal it. What do these people think physics is. What do they think referees did while evaluating the merits of his work. I am not holding Einstein as a superman. But it is entirely different thing to tell lies about his work. He derived Lorentz result independently as a part of his much more general work. He did not use Lorentz equation as an input, it is one of his results. And no hamilton came nowhere close to general relativity. It is entirely Einstein,s work which he did single handedly. Some say his wife had helped him with some mathematics. ",

Sure he was not very generous with his citations especially to Poincare. (Much like Led Zeppelin -:)). The Voigt transformations were strangely similar to the notations in his paper of 1905. However physical and mathematical insight are profoundly different and that was Einstein\u2019s strength. Physical insight is the key for the greatest physicists. He exhibited this again in the formulation of general relativity and oddly enough we have similar priority claims. But general relativity was much clearer in its ontology. It was the singular vision by Einstein that created it. Why shouldn\u2019t he use what was available for him to develop it at the time. I don\u2019t see a problem with it. He is not alone. ",
