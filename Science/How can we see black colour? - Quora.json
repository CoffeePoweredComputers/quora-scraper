            "answer_text": "Black is authoritative and powerful; because black can evoke strong emotions, too much to be overwhelming. Black is real sensation, even if its produced by entire absence of any light. The sensation of black is entirely different from lack of all sensation. I wear black for the poor and downbeaten , living in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for a prisoner who has paid for his crime, but is there because he's a victim of time. Without black no colour has any depth. But if you mix black with everything suddenly there's shadow- no no wait, not only shadow but also fullness. You've got to be willing to mix BLACK into your pallette if you want to create something that's real. Black is not just a colour. There's something about black. You feel hidden away in it. Black seems to make a colour cloudy, but darkness doesn't. A Ruby could thus getting darker without ever becoming cloudy, but if it becomes blackish red, it would become cloudy. BLACK is a colour of power and strength and for me the reason for light to exist. :) What's your idea? ",
