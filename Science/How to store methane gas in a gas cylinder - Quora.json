            "answer_text": "I hope that when you say \u2018gas cylinder\u2019 you are not referring to a cooking gas cylinder? Those are only meant for LPG which is liquid at room temperatures and modest pressures inside the bottle. Storing methane(=natural gas) is a whole different ballgame. At room temperatures methane will always be in gas form no matter how much it is compressed (CNG) For practical purposes pressure in methane storage tanks is usually limited to 200\u2013250 bar . Needless to say that such pressures can only be contained in a heavy duty tank which bears no comparison to a LPG cylinder. Specialized multi stage compressor systems are required so dont try this at home. Methane gas can be liquified but it will need to be cooled to something like MINUS 160 C and kept there while stored in a tank. This is called LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) . Storing and transporting methane as LNG allows energy density of three times that of CNG. However the refrigeration required makes this much more complicated and expensive than simply compressing the methane into CNG. ",

            "answer_text": "The scientific supply houses have all the equipment you need to do this, but the task should not be done by an inexperienced person. Briefly, it involves connecting a vacuum pump, a gas cylinder and the methane source to a vacuum line fitted with several clever little on-off valves. Some other crucial appendages are needed in order to get this operation realized done without a mishap. Connect all three to the vacuum line and close all the valves. Open the line to the pump and pull a high vacuum. Open the valve to the empty cylinder and pull a hi vac on it. Close valve to vacuum pump, open valve to methane source, allowing methane to flood the line and the empty cylinder. Close off the valve to the methane cylinder and methane source. Close the valve that is actually attached to the cylinder. Turn off the vacuum pump and slowly bleed air into the vacuum line system. Disattach your cylinder of methane. In the remote - but wise \u2014 event that you don\u2019t feel equipped, or crazy enough to do this, keep in mind that those same scientific supply houses can sell you little lecture bottles of methane. They have the bigger ones too. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow can I store methane gas in a gas cylinder?\u201d You need a CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) cylinder. NG utilities can fill it for you. That kind of container is what is used by trucks and taxis that run on natural gas. Some utilities used to rent you such a compressor for allowing you to fuel up your truck. Important note. This is not LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) which needs to be super-refrigerated while stored. ",

            "answer_text": "Better leave that to professionals. Very dangerous. Must use right kind of cylinder within pressure limits. Fittings must be proper. Pressure regulator required. You can get such cylinders from gas supply companies already filled. Why on earth would you need that? If you just need a supply of gas they have LPG for that. Much safer and in liquid form. ",
