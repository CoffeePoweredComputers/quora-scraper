            "answer_text": "I like to tell people who want an example of the \u2018Law of Attraction in action\u2019 the story of my son, Robert. Keep in mind as you read this that he was only 7 years old when he did this, but he was able to connect with the adults in his life who were a vibrational match by simply believing and being unafraid to express that belief. His belief was so strong that others were moved to take action. He also provided a clear example to others around him of what is possible for those willing to take action, even though the action taken by him was quite easy. Also pay attention to your mindset as you go into this exercise. Be aware that if you begin reading with the belief that the LoA is unreal, this story will provide proof that it is unreal for you. Conversely, if you are looking for reassurance that it actually does work perfectly, you will receive exactly that in a gift-wrapped box. What you get out of this will be a direct reflection of your beliefs going in. The year is 2009\u2026. When my son, Robert, was in the second grade, we lived in a small town in northern California among the giant redwood trees. It is a community known for its peacefulness and unity, the land of vegans and tree-huggers. People there value togetherness and acceptance. At this time, I was studying \"The Secret\" by Rhonda Byrne, a movie and book that introduced many to the Law of Attraction. I would watch the movie daily, taking notes and comparing different aspects of the lessons involved. This was a bit different than my family was used to as most of my previous study involved just books and reading, which Robert was not interested in. He often sat with me and watched the movie, though. After watching the movie several times, Robert started asking questions. He wanted to know, as boys do, what dad was up to. We talked at great length about the law and how it shaped our lives. One day he came home from school and announced that his class would be studying fossils. Robert asked me if we could go buy a fossil so he could have his own. I explained to him that I did not know of a place that sold fossils, but we could look into it. He thought for a moment and said, \"Why don't we just use the Law of Attraction to get one\"? I froze. My thoughts and feelings of disbelief took over, and I started to think of a way to talk him out of this idea. Before I could speak, he announced that he did not need my help. He was going to get a fossil the \"Secret\" way, on his own. We quickly reviewed the basic principles, and he was off. I really thought it would end there. I was wrong. A few days later, Robert was playing in the yard, and he wanted to play in the rock garden. He asked for my help to move some particularly heavy stones, and while we re-arranged the rocks, he commented that the one he was holding was actually a fossilized piece of wood. I pointed out the fact that he had requested of the universe a fossil, and here it was! He was having none of that. \"No, dad, this is not mine. This is not the fossil I requested. I will know it when I see it.\" The next day, when I picked him up from school, his teacher (we'll call her Mrs. G) asked me to stay for a minute to discuss something. She gingerly reported that Robert had told the class that he was going to get a real fossil of his own using the Law of Attraction. She was a great teacher and cared for her students as if they were her own. The best. And she was worried that he would be disappointed when this fossil did not arrive. I smiled at her and asked how she thought he would feel if it did arrive. Could she believe it was possible? Several of the other parents gave disapproving looks, and Mrs. G tried to be helpful without violating my wishes as a parent. It was awkward, but I knew then as I do now that she had his best interest at heart. I asked her to have faith and see what happens. Robert continued his affirmations and visualizations, boldly claiming his prize was on the way. He KNEW it was coming. About 2 weeks later, his teacher asked me to stay late again. She was bubbling! On Robert's desk was a small package, and he was asked to open it. Inside were two small fossils. He shrieked when he opened the box and said, \"Here they are, just as I asked! See, everyone!\" Mrs. G looked at me and quietly explained that she had written her professor in Washington state and had him send these to her for Robert. With tears in her eyes, she thanked Robert for restoring her faith. The other parents who had been so disapproving before took turns looking at the treasures in his hands. The look on his face said it all. There are many things to be learned from this story. One of the most important for me is that the 'magic' that brings things about is not the kind a sorcerer produces, but rather the kind that LOVE produces. Was this magical? Absolutely. But the process is also very visible here. Robert believed so strongly that he was able to 'attract' the needed people with the needed sympathetic vibration to make this happen. His belief radiated out and changed the thinking of others to bring about his desire. Had he not believed so completely and openly, this would never have happened. This is where \u2018wishful thinking\u2019 and the Law of Attraction differ. Robert\u2019s unquestioning belief caused action on his part, and in turn, action on the part of others. To this day, Robert treasures his fossils. Not because of what they are, but what they represent. He knows he can accomplish anything he puts his mind to, and that is a priceless gift to any human being. He is in high school now (2019), but he still remembers this as being one of the happiest moments of his life. The Law of Attraction uses many different ways to make things happen. An infinite number of ways, really. This is just one example, but it is a good one. He believed, and he took action - even if that action was merely to speak boldly about his intention. And he helped many others along the way without even meaning to. It is not for us to determine the 'how', but to believe and act when actions are indicated. You never know how far-reaching your actions can go or how things will come about. It\u2019s not magic, but it is magical.

            "answer_text": "  Hello Brighton The Law of Attraction is a fundamental Law that governs the Universe in the same vein as the Law of Gravity. The subject would require me to type many pages worth on Quora to really guide the reader, especially a newbie, to grasp the core fundamentals, however, I will first provide a summary, then offer some depth. Ultimately, I shall share some useful references / resources for one to delve deeper and study at their own pace. The Law of Gravity is taught throughout the education system, probably globally (for me it was in the UK where I have been based since birth), but the Law of Attraction is never mentioned in the public domain anywhere. There is a reason for this which I shall briefly touch upon afterwards. Summary of the Law: Our thoughts are projected out into the Universe and reflections appear in our life based on our PREDOMINANT THOUGHTS. One little thought on a new or existing subject usually carries no weight yet its the dominant thoughts with enough \u2018ENERGY\u2019 that \u2018attract\u2019 PEOPLE, SITUATIONS and CIRCUMSTANCES INTO OUR LIFEOur experience of life and hence our reality is based on our thoughts. It is our thoughts that carry a frequency which \u2018attracts\u2019Details: We are an energy being in an energy based Universe. Everything is energy, the chair you\u2019re sitting on, the phone your holding right now etc. This can be proved in a laboratory through the right microscope that energy particles make up the respective physical matter. Our thoughts are invisible and cannot be seen yet can be FELT. Brian Tracy (a renowned motivational speaker) has stated that thoughts travel at approximately 186,000 mph. Our thoughts are extremely powerful which is why the most super successful people who mastered the Law of Attraction such as Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith and many others all at some level assert the necessity to project positive thoughts out in the world for one to consistently attract positive results. Negative thoughts will attract negative results. KEEP IT POSITIVE! A further and a more in depth explanation: We operate on vibrational frequences  Imagine there are 22 discs that we can shift up or down onto depending our mood. Use this picture below and notice the 22 points, each one can represent a disc that we would essentially be vibrating on  FOR EVERY SUBJECT IN OUR LIFE (there are so many subjects eg our hair, bank balance, petrol for car, relationship with x, clothes in wardrobe, toothbrush, teeth, glasses, job \u2026 the list goes on into what? 1000 subjects?) \u2026 we have had thoughts and continue to have thoughts on each subject\u2026 So for each subject there are a collection / mix of thoughts. For example, on the subject of someone\u2019s job the person might be dissatisfied with their salary amount yet happy with their tasks at work and maybe their relation with certain co-workers (though not all)\u2026 so this mix of positive and negative thoughts will create FEELINGS (EMOTIONS) and place them on the scale above which will determine THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE, CIRCUMSTANCES AND THINGS that are attracted into their life via LAW OF ATTRACTION. The more positive a person remains, the better they FEEL\u2026 the better the results! Take a look at your life\u2026 wherever you are ultra positive in a subject area\u2026 your results willbe better than the subject area where you are disastrously negative (if applicable). The LAW OF ATTRACTION has been known by the some of the most successful people throughout history but it will never be shared on TV, or in newspapers as they simply do not want the public to know if its existence. In society Jobs need to filled and so the people in power do not want everyone to master their life through their thoughts as otherwise more and more people will pursue higher level ambitions such as setting up businesses. I\u2019m not some type of political activist :) \u2026 I actually can\u2019t stand politics\u2026 I just have the sense to see through bullshit and can tell you that only a tiny percentage of super top achievers know and have mastered the Law of Attraction. It is not something evil\u2026 this is another myth that is a twist of the truth by those in extreme power. The ancient Babylonians, and various other leaders and groups of the past knew of its existence and did share this fundamental Law. So I wish that you master this law as the world is dependent on our thoughts being positive. We as a human race can attract more good into the world by moving up the scale on all our subjects\u2026 then the ENERGY around us changes!  EXERCISE FOR YOU: Make a list of some subject areas in your life and aim to measure where you think you are on the scale\u2026 then attempt to start to see the correlation between that and what is being attractedIf feeling ambitious\u2026 work on changing thoughts for those unwanted results for some subject areas and then notice how when you shift up the scale \u2026 what you ATTRACT improves\u2026 you may even notice that the same people you were coming into contact with also change (THE LAW OF CORRESPONDENCE ref: Brian Tracy) \u2026 Note: for some subjects if there was a lifetime of extreme negativity it will be far more productive to make gradual shifts up by reducing negativity rather than to quantum leap to being super positive\u2026 the disparity between where a person is and where they want to be maybe too large and so it will be more effective to ALLOW gradual shifts up the scale) Regards Bhavin ",

            "answer_text": "The Law of Attraction is a Universal law like gravity. Does gravity work? Of course, it just is, so is the LOA. You don\u2019t decide if & when gravity is gonna work, it just works. No questions asked. Same rule applies to the LOA & every other Universal Law out there. No there are NO limits, only YOU set the limits to what you want to attract. How deserving you believe you are attracts & manifests whatever you are focusing on. Here\u2019s how I understand the LOA: Your subconscious brings a thought to your attention, this thought has an emotion associated with it. This emotion has a specific frequency (your emotion with the experience/thought combined), when you think a thought, that emotion vibrates that specific frequency in which the LOA responds to by giving more of that frequency. This then manifests into a tangible thing or experience that will correspond to that frequency. If you want to change what you are manifesting then change the way you think & feel about what you want to attract. Setting a clear intention of what you want, \u201cseeing\u201d it in your mind (imagination/visualization), focus on how you WANT to feel as you experience it in your mind & don\u2019t worry about the \u201chow\u201d. That feeling/emotion is what is key! How YOU feel, about how worthy you are to receive this is where the manifesting begins. You need to BELIEVE you deserve it! I hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "If you want to know how the Law of Attraction work, you must study the world around you. Find out what your universe is made of and this will answer your question. Study chemistry to see how electrons interact with each other. Study chemistry and physics, mostly physics. Study what thoughts are made of. Most people think that thoughts carry no weight because you can\u2019t see them. Think again. We are finding out that thoughts are made of light, which is energy. What makes you think energy has no impact? That\u2019s why I said study what your universe is made up of. Study after study has shown that angry people get certain diseases, like cancer. Oppressed people get back pain. Fearful people get kidney disease. So you see with this example that thoughts do affect reality. And it goes even further than that. The thoughts you think attract like energy just as a magnet does. This is similar to the Law of Transmutation. But since it acts like a magnet, they call it ATTRACTION, because magnets attract. The word transmutation reminds us of chemistry where different elements interact. So your thought picks up like thoughts. If you have conflicting thoughts, it will attract both, but it will attract mostly negative and become a negative element because the majority rules and the majority of your thoughts around this particular subject were negative. Had the majority of your thoughts around a particular topic been positive, you would have a positive impact. The majority rules even in chemistry. One example of conflicting thought is you want to go out with your friends. You enjoy their company but they get drunk. So do you want to go out because you are lonely or because they offer healing words. Yes but even though they offer healing words they also like to gossip. Your subconscious mind will go with the fact that the majority thoughts are negative and give you a negative experience. It is like science. Elements themselves are not negative per se. Some elements simply give you a consequence that you don\u2019t like. If something is too hot and burn you, then you say it is evil. You see fire as evil. So you have an evil thought surrounding fire. But fire itself is not evil, it is just undesireable depending on how it is used. When it kept you warm you had a positive thought surrounding fire. In life we have conflicting thoughts about many things. When atoms are combined in a certain way, combustion occurs and we call it a fire. The combustion occurs due to the release of that energy. Think of thoughts as combinations of elements, negative or positive. This way, you know what you are attracting. If the majority of your thoughts around a certain topic are positive, you are good to go and will attract positive thoughts, and thus positive consequences. But if the majority of thoughts around a certain topic are negative, watch out. In that case you will attract negative thoughts and thus negative consequences. This is why it is so important to forgive. You forgive so that you will no longer attract that negative energy. It matters not how undeserving of forgiveness the person is. When you hear that forgiveness is for you and not the other person, they mean that if you continue in anger, blame, resentment etc, you will only attract negative energy towards you. You put out a negative vibe, you get negative vibes. So smile and your auric energy changes. The brain also puts out positive chemicals when you smile (like serotonin). See, what we think affect reality in all kinds of ways. It is a lot more complicated than vibes and vibrations. It is science, it is chemistry, it is physics. It is natural laws at work. It is energy, which is tangible. People suffer not because they are good or bad. People suffer because of the energy around them. If you have negative people around you, get away from them, lest they bring you calamity. If you are constantly thinking about what they did to you although they are gone, it is time for affirmations and visualizations, just so you can change your vibe. Once your vibe changes, your actions change. This is The Law of Attraction at work. \u200eAffirmations to Make One Manifest - EP by Mercedes Beato Aka Queen of Diamonds on iTunes ",

            "answer_text": "Is the \"Law Of Attraction\" a myth? The Ten Million Dollar Check story by Jim Carrey: Well\u2026.Its not a Myth! Trust me when I say this, I have experienced it myself but let me share well known actor \u2018Jim Carrey\u2019 experience. The Ten Million Dollar Check: When the now infamous American actor and comedian Jim Carrey was still broke and basically nobody, he wrote himself a check for $10 million and wrote in the memo: \"For acting services rendered.\" On the day when James's father died, James tossed the check into the casket and considered it to only be a matter of time before he had the $10 million in his possession... and a few short years later, he did have it. Today, Jim Carrey is one of the most well paid actors in Hollywood. How did he do it? Steps that he followed to attract this amazing amount of prosperity into his life... First, He Had a Specific Amount Getting exactly what you want out of life is much easier than most people think once they determine exactly what it is that they really want. Notice that when Jim Carrey wrote his $10 million check he had a specific amount of money in mind. He could have said: \"I want to have financial security.\" or \"I want to be rich.\" or \"I want to make a lot of money.\" But these kinds of wishes are more like the vague generalizations made by people who never get what they want because they have no specific target to shoot at. So the first step towards using the Law of attraction to manifest prosperity is to determine exactly how much you want to be certain about the amount. Second, He Had Something to Give for the Money There's no such thing as something for nothing. You must be willing to give something in return for the money that you wish for and you must know exactly what that one thing is. For example, Carey wrote: \"For acting services rendered\" in the memo of his check because he knew that his acting was what he was willing to give in return for the money. This also gave him a specific action to follow through with until he actually got what he was after. Third, He Solidified His Commitment to Get the Money The final thing that James Carey did was solidified his commitment to get the money by actually writing the amount out on a check to himself and tossing the check to his father's casket. While these two actions may not seem as significant as the years that he spent working on his acting career, it is likely that they played a large role in influencing his conviction that the money will be forthcoming. Writing down your goals and objectives makes them real and quantifiable, which has been astounding impact on your subconscious mind and your actions. So as the final step for creating a plan for manifesting prosperity into your life using the Law of attraction, write down your specific goal and what you did to get in return for it. Law of attraction works when you work :) ! Hope this helps! ",

Law of Attraction and positive thinking, positive thinking and the Law of Attraction Recently the release of the movies \"The Secret\" and \"What The Bleep Do We Know\" have created quite a stir of curiosity. Many people have been inspired by the information released in these movies and are now contemplating how they can begin to adopt the Law of Attraction and positive thinking as part of their everyday living. The movies were an amazing forward for those who have not previously heard of the Law of Attraction and quantum physics, and were released at a time of immense spiritual transformation and conscious awakening on our abundant planet. How do you define the Law of Attraction? In the words of Abraham this universal law can be explained as \"That which is like unto itself is drawn\". Whatever you focus on a consistent basis, you will attract into your life. Our universe, and everything within it, is made up of energy fields that produce varying vibrational frequencies. Our words, thoughts, feelings, actions, beliefs and attitudes all contain vibrations which are attracted to other like vibrations. Our current reality is a representation of what we have created,invited or attracted with our words, actions, thoughts and feelings. The quotation by Thomas Dreir is a great explanation of this universal law 'The world is a great mirror. It reflects back to you what you are. If you are loving, if you are friendly, if you are helpful, the world will prove to be loving and friendly and helpful in return. The world is what you are.' Unfortunately, manifesting your desires is not quite as simple as taking time out to visualize your desires and from there the Law of Attraction and positive thinking will do the rest. Unless you have a magic genie hidden under your bed it is unlikely that millions of dollars will magically appear in your life as you sit on the couch meditating on your dream of becoming unbelievably rich. Yes, we definitely do have to determine what we wish to achieve and visualize what we desire, however there are two other vital ingredients which are extremely important if you wish to achieve your gaols. Firstly, focus attention on what you desire and feel the excitement within as if your desire is currently in your reality. If it is a new car that you desire, then feel the excitement as you hold in your hand the keys to your dream car - visualize the color and shape, smell the leather interior, hear the purr of the engine and feel the power as you drive your brand new car out on the open highway. Secondly, if you would like to achieve your goals more quickly you must do something that moves you towards your goal. Visualizing and talking about your goals is fantastic, however, by consciously putting in place a daily action, be it big or small, you will bring your dreams into your reality much quicker. Our Universe is abundantly generous and willing and able to deliver our requests - so be careful when wishing for something and ensure that it is truly what you desire. It is time for you to take control and actively create the life your desire by applying the Law of Attraction and positive thinking. Wiseattraction.com ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t be sure until you have evidence, and with something like this, evidence is easy to get, because if you go to the trouble to perform Law of Attraction rituals and techniques, you will then be looking for evidence. The more evidence you find, the greater your chances of making the Law work for you, but it isn\u2019t necessarily because you have, via ritual, etc., incited the universe to do your bidding. When you find evidence, you will say, well, that worked, and keep looking for more evidence until you (and the universe, and magic etc.) make the thing happen. It\u2019s called confirmation bias, and yes, the way you think does attract itself. I like the Law of Attraction because it is a simple way to change counterproductive attitudes and thinking patterns to focus on goals and the future in a more positive way. Sometimes, I have found that many coincidental things happen. Even though I know I\u2019m subconsciously looking for them, I am still amazed at how thick and fast they can appear when I focus my mind. I often do wonder if there is much much more to it than what I have just described. But, yes, in one way or another, it works. You will see evidence. I would suggest that you keep your requests general at first. Say you want a car, focus on a make of car but not the colour. Later, as you get better at it, the exact thing will appear, but try it in less challenging ways to start. ",

            "answer_text": "The Laws of Attraction all work quite simply. Each is an attraction of Polarities. What goes up must come down. Therefore what you put out in thoughts, will come back to you. Yin/Yang is the perfect balance of Harmony, as is the Universe. Everything is Timing. If you hurt others, whether intentionally or not, the message will come back to you, to teach you a lesson. Consider if you would like it to be done to you, what you do to others? Consider with an open mind, and not ego driven, How the other person will feel and REACT BACK AT YOU OR OTHERS? Laws all have Cause and Effect. If you throw 10 white balls out and up into the air, do you think you will get 10 white balls back? Same as with thoughts. Each word has its\u2019 own resonance and vibration, so if you are living a life with good intentions for others and yourself, you cause very little harm to yourself and others, then you will be putting out what is called good vibrations. There was a song by the Beach Boys.. Good Vibrations.. I know of 9 Universal Laws. There used to be 7, but more were found. I think if you want a really good example of how Karma and the Universe works. watch the movie OH GOD! with George Burns. So many truths he speaks. Listen carefully. ",

            "answer_text": "A research in California conducted by psychotherapists proved that Energy Flows where Attention Goes. Everything in our Universe is Energy. When you say, \u201c I don\u2019t want War.\u201d You are giving your attention to War and where you give your attention, your Energy will flow there. Law of Attraction will match your Energy with that and bring it in your Three Dimension reality. So instead of saying, \u201c I don\u2019t want War.\u201d you should say \u201cI want Peace.\u201d Then your attention is on Peace, so you are giving your Energy to Peace and Law of Attraction will match your Energy with Peace and your life will be Peaceful.

So similarly change your statements \u2013 \u2013 Instead of saying \u201c I don\u2019t want to fail.\u201d say \u201cI want to Win!\u201d \u2013 Instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sick.\u201d say \"I want to be healthy.\" \u2013 Instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a struggling job\u201d say \u201cI want to have a happy and exciting job.\" \u2013 Instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with my husband\u201d say \u201cI want to have a happy relationship with my husband\u201dand so on.. Our thoughts are very powerful because Energy is transmitted through thoughts. If you think and speak about what you don\u2019t want, you will attract what you don\u2019t want! But if you speak about what you want you start attracting only what you want! Also remove words from your dictionary like Depression/ Hatred/ Failure/ Illness/Disease/ Jealousy/Misunderstanding/Problem. ",

It basically assumes you are the center of the universe and that you have supernatural powers over other people and things. I think this is grotesquely impractical. It may work if it causes you to change yourself; we all play the hands we are dealt, but what happens to you is not all up to you. There is what you are born to- economically, family type, genetics, health, the time and environment of when/where you are born and live, who is there and if they love you because sometimes even a mother can\u2019t for some reason, or say, your father has substance issues, which could mean you suffer or rise above it and who knows where you get what you need in life to deal with it. We are all born as innocent babes, and things happen along the way. Just keep looking for what you need, the harder you work the luckier you get. And be nice to others, they are dealing with it too.

            "answer_text": "The Law Of Attraction At Work The LoA at is most simple is the idea and principle that what we think about and focus on has an impact upon our external reality and chances of success in life. I assert that it works in two ways: It attracts your desires toward you.This is the first and most publicized way in which the LoA can impact upon your life. It holds that our thoughts have a real and tangible impact on our non-local external reality. Now whilst this may seem wild at first you should keep an open mind. There have been numerous studies and experiments in the field of quantum physics which have called into question the objectivity of \u201creality\u201d Indeed certain experiments have shown that particles can pop into and out of existence based only upon the preconceptions of the observer. Even more spooky is that a recent experiment (A quantum experiment suggests there\u2019s no such thing as objective reality) showed that there may be no such thing at all as objective reality. it gives whole new credence to what many have been saying for years: Our thoughts can shape our world. 2. It drives you toward your desires. This is perhaps less publicized but I would say is equally if not more important, especially for the skeptics out there. Many of the tools used by people harnessing the LoA (Affirmations, subliminal messages, hypnosis, visualization, meditation etc etc) are clear proven methods of communicating with our own subconscious minds. The subconscious is the driving force and determinant of many of our habits, impulses and feelings. It seems incredibly logical and obvious therefore that having it trained into thought patterns that support the attainment of our goals is in fact a good thing that will increase our chances of success. When we instruct our subconscious via the use of affirmations and other tools we are literally changing the thought patterns of our brain. In turn, this changes the kinds of habits and impulse actions we practice constantly on a daily basis. It changes them to better drive us toward our goals! Click here to learn how to use affirmations to manifest wealth and success. My Personal Experience Now, this is anecdotal but I still feel it is worth sharing. Around two years ago I was in a very bad place personally. I was overweight, I was near bankrupt and I was depressed (naturally). I had a lot of big ambitions and plans for myself but the years were moving on and I did not seem to be moving forward with them. I had a good look at what was going wrong and I quickly realized that in fact, it was me. I was lazy you see, I procrastinated, planned big and never followed through. A familiar sad old tale I am sure. So I decided I would work harder. it didn\u2019t work. I could not beat my own nature. So I decided to change it. This is when I came across the LoA and in particular the use of affirmations to change your behaviors. I created a very simple affirmation that affirmed my goals would naturally flow to me and that I would both enjoy and find it easy to work productively toward my goals. Today I own my own business, I am on my way to an ideal weight and most importantly, I am happy. Learn more about the use of affirmations in manifesting your goals. ",

            "answer_text": "There is not a specific mechanism with which the law of attraction works. You just have to be very specific with what you really want and to keep yourself in a positive state regarding it. In other words, you must believe that you are going to achieve what you desire and you have to have the expectation that it is going to manifest the soon as possible! The truth is that it\u2019s going to manifest on the most appropriate moment for you. You must understand that the law of attraction always works, so you\u2019d better keep positive thoughts otherwise you will sabotage your own results. I hope I helped\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Subconscious is very famous topic these days but most people don\u2019t know meaning and facts about the subconscious mind which ultimately leads to the wrong usage of it. So, get ready to read the top 7 unknown facts about the subconscious mind:- It Is Always Active Even During Sleep \u2013 Yes, it is real and scary to know that your subconscious mind is always active even during sleep and every word is listened and stored by your subconscious mind so be careful on what you speak and hear because every word you speak or hear is listened by your subconscious mind and conscious mind. It Is Not Able To Hear No Or Not \u2013 So, you have just read the above line but your subconscious mind reads like this \u201cit is able to hear or\u201d and that\u2019s the biggest reason why people can\u2019t lose addictiveness towards drugs, alcohol and smoking because whenever they say \u201cI will not smoke again\u201dtheir subconscious mind reads \u201cI will smoke again\u201d and that\u2019s the real truth you are never told about. So, be aware of this before leaving any bad habit and I am 100 % sure that it will help. It Is A Giant Tape Recorder \u2013 Your subconscious mind records everything you have seen hear all your life as mentioned above that it is always active and this here this fact is the reason why it is always active. Your subconscious mind store all these recordings as mental movies so as to repeat it in your mind whenever you think about it again. This is the reason why all those website and videos tell you to see and watch and hear good things and moments. So, try to show good things to your minds and hear wonderful affirmations every day so that you have a strong subconscious mind. It Cannot comprehend future \u2013 Our subconscious mind only lives in the present it doesn\u2019t watch future and that\u2019s the only reason why those gurus say to you that if you want to accomplish a certain goal then you should watch it and speak it like it\u2019s already done. So that your subconscious mind can work on it and make that goal happen. It Makes 95% Of Our Day \u2013 So, do you want to know why successful people believe in subconscious mind and law of attraction? Here\u2019s your answer \u2013 our subconscious mind forms your daily habits and these habits rule nearly 95% of our day and the majority of things we want to achieve or we have achieved in our life is indirectly due to subconscious mind. So, consider using subconscious mind correctly so that it provides some value to you. The subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between an actual event and think \u2013 Ever thought about why you get Goosebumps while watching a scary movie if not you are like me but let\u2019s answer for them who thought this \u2013 your subconscious mind doesn\u2019t differentiate between reality and imagination which leads to believing in things that are not real or cannot happen. This is the reason why most people tell you to visualize your dreams because this will lead to a belief in your subconscious mind that can convert that dream into reality. Your subconscious mind really attracting things:- This is the last but not the least fact that is your subconscious mind can really attract thing but \u2013 how this is possible and why we can\u2019t see it? This happens on a quantum level you attract things with the energy of your words seems similar to the principle of converting energy to matter. Conclusion So, the subconscious mind is true you cannot deny it but if you don\u2019t want to use it then just go with the journey because there are a lot of people out who are successful without using the technique of attracting things through your subconscious mind. This just only enhances the journey progress. Ask questions in comments as much as you can so that I can answer them as much as I can. ",

If you want to experience it then start with small things and you will see that it is really working for you or whatever\u200b you were thinking or trying to attract is in front of you. Try with something small for example, thinking of a friend you haven't met for a long time or thinking of a movie that you want to see on your t.v. etc etc See what I personally believe if you really want to apply LOA on your life then first and foremost thing you will have to do is being desperate for that thing or enjoy whatever\u200b you are thinking. Your state of mind is very important and the lOA will definitely work if you are happy at that particular point of time thinking about anything you want to attract. Remember our mind is like a magnet. The more powerful the magnet is, the more it will attract. ",

If you believe what you want is going to take hard work, be difficult or practically impossible to achieve those are limiting beliefs that will restrict the amount of abundance that can flow to you. The way you transmute those limitations is by accepting and allowing the universe to yield to you by believing it knows more ways than you can think of to deliver what you want, to you. The more you notice the synchronicity of thinking about something and then having it show up, acknowledging it as a manifestation will help you gain confidence and momentum on receiving even more. Focus on outcomes like having fun, loving the people you\u2019re surrounded by, learning, growing, expanding, creating, traveling, living your best life. The less you try to control or define the details the faster things can come. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Definitely. I will give you my example. This one is recent. I have experienced law of attraction work earlier many times. In my previous job, I used to travel 28 kms one way to work. While going to work I used to pass this commercial complex which had lots of companies operating. This commercial complex was very near to my house, about 3\u20134 kms. After working at my previous job for about 2 years, my honeymoon period ended. Work and all was fine but what used to frustrate me was 3 hours of travel. This is when I decided to use the law of attraction. While commuting daily I used to imagine myself working in the commercial complex near my house. I used to feel good just thinking about the leisure I would have working so close to my house. I also started discussing this possibility with my family to strengthen the manifestation. The important thing here was that I had the opportunity to visualize myself working near my house twi a day. I knew that my manifestation started coming into effect when I received a job call from a company whose office was situated in the same commercial complex near my house. Then I started affirmation with more rigor. I cleared the interview with flying colors and now I work in that company, close to my home. I am now able to give my time to my family and I am really happy about this. And the cherry on the cake is that I got a higher position and good salary perks. So, it works, it definitely works. Cheers. ",

For a deeper understanding of the Law I suggest you listen/read to Abraham Hicks. She explains it fully and in-depth enabling you to understand it in a complete way. Some quotes to help you understand- \u201cThe Law of Attraction says that that which is like unto itself, is drawn. In other words, that which you think, in any moment, attracts unto itself other thoughts that are like it.\u201d \u201cIf something you want is slow to come to you, it can only be for one reason: You are spending more time focused upon its absence than you are about its presence.\u201d \u201cThe Law of Attraction is most understood when you see yourself as a magnet getting more and more of the way you FEEL\u201d ",

You create your life by what you think about. No matter the thought, good, bad, what ever you think, that thought is alive and begins to create by way of LOA. One thought is not that powerful, but when you keep thinking one thought, then another and another, BAM you are creating. Now what you created in that moment dependa soley on what you were thinking. We have always created but by not understanding this, we create by default. So you see good, think good, good comes to you. You see bad, think bad, bad is what comes to you. By simply taking control of your thoughts, focusing more on what you want to see in your life and turning your back to negative thoughts will change your life and bring more of what you want to you. Start to guide your thoughts to what you want and watch how amazing your life becomes. This is the Law of Attraction. And this is how you create your life on purpose. Cindy Wahlberg  ",

Basically this law states that you should focus all your senses and thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions, attitude, belief,and ENERGY on what you're wanting to attract or manifest in your life. You may have heard of this as the law of attraction but, the law of manifestation is much advanced and deep for quicker results. On one hand the law of attractions states that you must focus only your thoughts and feelings on the desired Item or state of mind you're wanting to attract on the other hand the law of manifestation applies not just for thoughts and feelings but also, for Imagination, Visualization, Belief, Attitude, ENERGY and love <3. And with love i say THANK YOU for taking the time to read and watch the video <3.  ",

However be forewarned, I believe it was the great Quantum Physisists, Neils Bohr, who said \u201cAnyone who thinks Quantum Mechanics makes sense, doesn\u2019t understand Quantum Mechanics\u201d. Good luck. The book is well worth the effort but I\u2019d be lying if I didn't say that I found it difficult to assimilate.

I would look at my phone and say at 7.38 I want to be at the robot at the end of the walk and put my phone away without checking it again to see how much time I have left. And it works everytime, everyday. Like clock work I am at that point. I have listened to people speak about it and they say attract what you want but don't dwell on it. If you do it is because you don't believe it will happen. I want to try it on a bigger scale myself, but I need someone that would be able to coach me or provide me with the steps I might need. It will work so just focus on it with small steps. I think it takes practice just like anything in life. ",
