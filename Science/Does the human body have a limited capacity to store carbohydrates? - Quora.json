            "answer_text": "Yes; quite limited. As a general rule of thumb, plants use CARBOHYDRATE as their main store of energy, with a small store of fat.  whereas animals use FAT as their main store of energy, with a small store of carbohydrate.  So, how much can the human body store? There are three main places that carbohydrates can be stored. One is in the skeletal muscles, in the form of glycogen.  This amounts to around 500 grams for most people, but I\u2019m just assuming that people like \u201cThe Mountain\u201d are gonna be able to store a wee bit more-likely at least 50% more than that, maybe even double.  The second is in the liver, also in the form of glycogen.  This isn\u2019t as much, perhaps 100\u2013120 grams. The best way to think of it is that the liver is like your battery. It absorbs energy when you eat, and slowly dispenses it throughout the day (and at night) when you are not. This is mostly to support your brain, which burns about 100g of glucose per day. The third area that your body can store carbohydrates is\u2026directly in the bloodstream. This is about 4\u20135 grams. That\u2019s about a small gulp of soda. In your entire 4.7 to 5.5 liters (1.2 to 1.5 gallons) of blood.  This is why it is important to avoid high GI carbs, as it makes it very easy to spike your blood sugar up. This is especially true if you are sedentary-your skeletal muscles are always full because you never use them, and once your liver is full, it needs to convert all of those carbs to fat to be stored either in the muscles, liver or fat cells. All in all, there are definitely arguments for a lower carbohydrate diet-most people aren\u2019t doing the long AND intense training that burns off tons of muscle glycogen, so there just isn\u2019t a place for all those carbs to go.
