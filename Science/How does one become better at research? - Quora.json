            "answer_text": "From many years of learning from my mistakes in doing research, here are the key lessons I've learned: 1. Read a lot of literature on your topic. Based on the literature, pick a very narrow subtopic. Now, read all the literature on that narrow subtopic, everything that's ever been written on it. 2. This is particularly important if you're doing experimental research. Pick a really modest question to answer in that subtopic, one that wasn't answered before. Make sure it doesn't delve into unknowns that are very distant from what was answered before. Aim for only an incremental contribution. Now, I hate small ideas and I love big ideas. Yet success in experimental work requires proceeding in incremental steps. If you have a big idea, that\u2019s awesome and unboring. Break it up into smaller questions or goals and pursue those one at a time (especially if your work is experimental). The bigger the contribution you aim for initially, the smaller your actual contribution will likely be, unless you're an absolute genius beyond your peers and your superiors/supervisors. The more modest the question you choose to answer, and the more realistic your goals, the more likely you are to go even beyond them and offer deep, great insight, and be recognized for it ... It's counterintuitive, but this is the reality, especially in experimental research. You might be able to get away with aiming for bigger leaps in the theoretical world (also, see the edit right below). Most importantly, chances of a great contribution skyrocket if you're genuinely interested in the topic (maybe obsessively so), and are very careful in thinking through the caveats - i.e. you're not overconfident and know how to challenge your own assumptions. Edit: some research is meant to be \"high risk, high reward\". It\u2019s among the most interesting research to work on if you can get your hands on it. The advice I gave above doesn't apply directly to this kind of research. However, to determine what approaches to try when pursuing this kind of research, one still needs to use present knowledge to see how close it gets to the desired goal of the research. The challenge is in bringing in some other external knowledge (maybe from another traditionally separate discipline) to create a new and intelligent approach that is \"outside the box\" and really creative and unconventional. There still has to be some strong suggestion in present knowledge that things might possibly work with this new bold approach. We have to have a reason to think it could work, and this reason needs to be reasonably convincing. In this regard, there is some similarity to incremental research in that we need to figure out how close present knowledge has come. Where high-risk, high-reward research differs is in that it requires reading literature in other traditionally unrelated or weakly related topics. This is the way we can get creative and think outside the box. Sometimes, it also helps to talk to people with expertise in different disciplines. So high-risk research is more likely to be interdisciplinary and is hopefully collaborative (it should be). Still, the contribution to each of the disciplines individually can be incremental, but combining the concepts from each of the disciplines into a new approach, this is what needs to be ground-breaking and completely new and unconventional. So in some regard, the advice can still apply loosely. But it likely requires understanding several topics to different levels of depth, rather than just focusing on one topic in great depth. 3. Form an intelligent hypothesis and have a clear way to test it and to answer your research questions. If you've followed advice from 1 & 2, you should be on the right track to doing this. Have a clear definition of \"when you're done\". 4. Involve whomever you're working with as much as you can. If you have an adviser/supervisor, talk to him/her almost on a daily basis. Let's say this would be a reasonable minimum of interaction: 2 times a week briefly, plus once a week at length (maybe 45 mins to an hour at least). This is a minimum. Depending on your and his/her preference, communication can be even more extensive. 5. Don't be afraid to email and contact other people to ask a question. Someone from another department? Someone from another country even who wrote a paper you have a question about? Yes, definitely email him/her. The worst thing that can happen is that you won't get a response, but in my experience it's much more likely that you will get a response. 6. If you're going to collaborate with someone at all, especially if s/he is not required to collaborate with you, make sure the agreement is really clearly spelled out. Make sure it's clear what the expectations are, what the deliverables are, who's going to do what and when, and what will be the attribution for the final result (who gets credit for what). It should also be clear what this final result is: a paper? Many papers? A brief presentation? There are many levels and many types of collaborations. Spell it out. If it's someone who has a boss, make sure his/her boss is not only on board but is also enthusiastic about the collaboration. If the boss doesn't prioritize it, the person you're working with likely won't prioritize it either. Make sure your boss is totally on board as well. Make sure everyone involved, including said bosses, understands the agreement including details of deliverables, attributions, etc. 7. Self-motivation is difficult for anyone. Don't assume you have self-discipline. Find structure wherever you can to impose discipline on yourself. Set deadlines and share with your advisers/supervisors and make sure they hold you to those deadlines. Also ask them to help you meet them. Impose structure on yourself. Have a place to work. Use timers to make sure you spend sufficient time on the tasks at hand. Find other people in similar situations to keep each other accountable if you can. Agree on rewards and penalties for meeting (or failing to meet) certain goals, and make sure you are both committed to holding the other person to the agreement, even if it means you seem like a bit of a jerk. (I never could find anyone like this, but I wish I did). 8. Live a balanced life. Have social interactions. Exercise. Have a set schedule and get enough sleep. Have a routine. 9. Things will take at least 2-3 times as long as your most conservative time estimate. If you multiply this conservative time estimate by 2-3 times in order to follow my advice, the actual time it will take will again be 2-3 times longer than that. 10. While this may seem contradictory to point number 9, a lot of things will take as long as the time you give them. So, if you give yourself less time, things can often take less time. If you give yourself more time, things will definitely expand to fill that time. This is actually not contradictory to point number 9. In fact, it goes right along with it. Things take way longer than expected especially if you allow them to. 11. The trick to reconciling 9 and 10 is understanding what details can and should be skipped. Many details that multiply the required time only improve the results marginally. Apply something like an 80-20 rule. Usually 20% of your activities will yield 80% of your results, and the remaining 80% of your activities will only contribute to 20% of your results ... Focus on the first 20% that yield most of your results. The rest is extra if you have time and don't want to spend it on something else (like starting your next project or taking a much deserved and needed break). 12. Start outlining and writing things up well before you're ready to. This will help you focus on important things, organize your tasks, and implement point number 11. I can't emphasize this enough. You're still learning about a topic but have an idea of what you're trying to do? Start writing a paper as if you know what the heck you're talking about. It's okay -- no one will need to see it and you can change it / scrap it any time. This is a trick that will help you in ways you can't imagine. Just trust yourself, trust the process, and start writing. This answer gets into this a little bit more: Sherif R. Fahmy's answer to What is the easiest way to write a research paper? 13. You'll likely have a really hard time following most of this advice, but keep trying. It gets easier over time, and you'll become a better researcher in the process... 14. Related to 13 - don't get discouraged. Everyone sucks at whatever they do when they start, and if you're doing research in something that's highly specialized, you should realize that if it weren't complex and intricate, there would be no opportunity to do research in it ... So, by construction, you're bound to suck at it for quite a long time. Just embrace your ineptitude and don't focus on what great achievements and expectations you're failing to meet. Only have the expectation that you'll learn and better yourself. That is enough. If it's not enough for you, you likely won't be a good researcher. You'll likely be a grumpy one, which is almost a guarantee of being a bad one. The only time you can have grand expectations of yourself and meet them in research is if you are a true genius. However, you're probably not, and even if you were, you too are likely to overestimate your ability in contrast to your actual ability just like everyone else does ... So this advice will likely still apply to you. Realize that there are many unknowns and that all you can expect is to learn while you navigate them. Hope this helps. Have fun - or at least try to. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of reading and developing the fundamental understanding of the topics. Only reading doesn't make any scene. One need to solve as many as problems. Try to reproduce the results of some good journal papers then you will get confidence.  We like to label people so we can understand them; it\u2019s just the way human psychology works. It makes it easier to associate this new person with the template we\u2019ve set up in our heads that it is represented by the label. Call someone a biker, skater, rock star, drug dealer, doctor, lawyer or marketer, and an automatic set of assumptions pops up in your mind. It makes it easy to pre-suppose what someone is like, and someone is stands for. And it is the kiss of death for your brand. If you have a simplistic label that you identify your brand with \u2013 life coach, internet marketer, consultant, whatever \u2013 people will see you as part of this great big group that they already have templates for in their mind. And you will not stand out. At all. You don\u2019t need a label \u2013 you need a mission. Things you stand for that the rest of your industry doesn\u2019t stand for, or has a painfully weak stance not worth mentioning. Your mission is to bring _______ to your industry. Only you can decide what that is, and once you do, you\u2019ve got to push for it with all you\u2019re worth. Then you\u2019re not another _______, you\u2019re you. You\u2019re worth remembering. You\u2019re not a talk show host, you\u2019re Oprah. You\u2019re not a CEO, you\u2019re Richard Branson or Donald Trump. You\u2019re not a motivational speaker, you\u2019re Tony fucking Robbins. You need to decide what it is you stand for and what you bring to the industry. And then you need to live that out loud so no one can possibly put a label on you. And then nobody forgets you. When I started out as a marketer, I never positioned myself as a \u201cmarketer.\u201d I had mission. I walked in determined to bring class to the online marketing industry, inspire the hell out of pressure-crushed entrepreneurs, and give straight talk without the bullshit you see everywhere else. You can like me, you can hate me. Whatever. I\u2019ve got mission, and that\u2019s why business comes to me and I\u2019m not scrambling. Get your own mission. I want to see the same thing happen to you.  I\u2019m tired of people saying they\u2019re experts at something when their content doesn\u2019t reflect it. It hurts their business so much. They focus on trying to make trendy blog posts that will get social media back-scratching and they scramble to get people active in their comments. They focus on getting retweets, likes, comments and page views and they don\u2019t focus on the most important thing: Blowing people\u2019s minds, again and again and again. And again. Then they wonder why business isn\u2019t booming. Forget social media, forget blogging three times a week, forget about \u201cextending the conversation.\u201d Screw conversation. Monologue instead. Monologue about everything you know, about things only you know, about amazing insights that you\u2019ve come up with. Imagine that every post you wrote was required to bring in $10,000 in business for you. You\u2019d write differently, wouldn\u2019t you? Damned straight you would. Take a page from my book. When I wanted to establish authority, I started writing articles that were 4,000 \u2013 6,000 words long, and their depth of content alone attracted more pageviews than any traffic gimmicks you see out there. I created product-quality workbooks \u2013 around 100 pages of them \u2013 and gave them away for free. And since I\u2019m a product launch consultant, I started dissecting other people\u2019s launches in real time, for the viewing public, and gave it away for free. I don\u2019t need to say I\u2019m an expert. I give more strategy away for free than most people do in their paid products. That does the talking for me. What\u2019s doing the talking for you? An \u201cabout\u201d page or a Twitter bio that says you\u2019re an expert? Don\u2019t say it \u2013 show it in every post, every download, every video \u2013 everything. Show it, and do a better job than anyone else. Word will spread, people will come to your website, and when they see how much content you have talking for you they\u2019ll wonder what the hell is wrong with your lazy competition.  We all love self-promotion. It\u2019s human \u2013 and I\u2019m not knocking it. If you kick ass, you should let the world know. You just don\u2019t need to do the talking yourself. If you say you\u2019re great, who\u2019s going to believe that? Of course you say you\u2019re great, you\u2019re you. If I said \u201cI\u2019m the greatest product launch consultant in the world,\u201d you\u2019d roll your eyes and say \u201cWhat a tool.\u201d  The sign of a true authority is not that they\u2019re the smartest person in a conversation, it\u2019s that they\u2019re making the conversation. They\u2019re bringing up the things no one else will talk about, they\u2019re asking the scary questions, they\u2019re putting their ass on the line by taking a stand. They\u2019re controversial (not for the sake of controversy, but because they\u2019re vocal about their stand), and the market pays attention. They\u2019re not spouting fluff on their blogs or rehashing what everyone else is saying. They are taking a stand, in a big way, on a regular basis. They are telling their audiences, \u201cTHIS is what we need to be talking about. THIS is what\u2019s important to address. Like it or not, popular or not, this needs to be said.\u201d When another big player says something that\u2019s just not right, they push back. They\u2019re willing to take that stand, voice their opinion, because it\u2019s more than just opinion, it\u2019s conviction. It\u2019s a confidence that they know better for a good reason. And again, it\u2019s not about manufactured controversy. It\u2019s about knowing your mission, and knowing how you want to change and improve your industry (or change and improve the way your customers get served), and playing full out. As I write this there are ballsy people out there who earn authority by taking their stands. Gary Vaynerchuck telling people to \u201cStop watching fucking LOST,\u201d and to build something meaningful with their passion. Rae Hoffman warning affiliate marketers that the market was due to change, and if they didn\u2019t change, they wouldn\u2019t survive. Naomi Dunford telling social media junkies that the platform\u2019s purity was gone forever, and it was their fault. Julien Smith and \u2013 well, just about every damned thing he says. These people are authorities because they\u2019re making conversations worth following. None of this \u201cNice post\u201d garbage \u2013 they\u2019re saying things no one else has the stones to say. You do the same. You\u2019ve got stones \u2013 use \u2018em.  It\u2019s easy to get it into your head that you have to \u201cpay your dues,\u201d and that becoming the Next Big Thing will take years. That thought will keep you poor as hell for a long time. I\u2019ll keep this last strategy short, because I want you to really remember it: Acknowledge how damned amazing you are,Prove it to the biggest players in your industry, andAlign with them.That\u2019s the core. That\u2019s what you need to remember. Certainly, work your way up, connect with small and mid-level people to help you grow, but not exclusively. If you want to BE an authority, you\u2019ve got to get in the sights of the other authorities in your field. You don\u2019t get labeled as \u201cA-List\u201d when most people see you with the \u201cD-List.\u201d Another important point: There\u2019s nothing wrong with the D-List. Plenty of people who aren\u2019t big players in their niche have no desire to be. Not everybody has that ambition, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s like with money \u2013 there\u2019s nothing cool about being a millionaire \u2013 if $30K a year makes you happy, then be happy. If being a small player appeals to you because it\u2019s easier, less stressful and let\u2019s you live the life you want, more power to you. But if you want to rise fast, then you have to walk in with your sights on the top from day one. If you want to be at the top in 3 years, then act like you belong there now. Not by \u201cacting\u201d (as in pretending) but by taking action as if you were already there. And that\u2019s the basics.  1. Teach a Class Before you panic: it\u2019s easier than it sounds! Check out Skillshare, a start-up focused on connecting experts in any field with people interested in learning about them. Classes can be taught locally or online, and topics range from \u201cFinancial Modeling forEntrepreneurs\u201d to \u201cLearn to Knit with Kollabora.\u201d It\u2019s a great way to position yourself as an expert and immerse yourself within a growing community of entrepreneurs that are eager to learn about what you know. 2. Guest Blog Media outlets are always looking for industry advice and insight from experts\u2014and why shouldn\u2019t that expert be you? Pitch a few publications and offer to write a series of guest blogs related to your industry. For example, if your brand is a nutrition consultancy, pitch a health blog with a series of articles focused on helping women stay fit in the winter months. If your brand builds websites, pitch a technology outlet with a blog series focused on developing APIs. Remember that the content should be focused on educating your audience on a topic\u2014not a sales pitch for your brand. 3. Join the Speaking Circuit You\u2019re likely already familiar with the conferences and events that take place within your industry. But have you spoken at any of them yet? If not, now is the time! Research the panels taking place and pitch yourself for the one most relevant to your industry (and most likely to engage your target audience). If an agenda isn\u2019t available yet, contact the event organizer and pitch your expertise, including the topics you can speak to. Keep in mind that event organizers are always looking for fresh new voices, so don\u2019t be intimidated by the roster of previous speakers. 4. Get Out and About In addition to these more organized tactics, it\u2019s just as important to meet and get connected with people in your industry. A great way to begin is by looking for localMeetups. For example, if you\u2019re a technology start-up in NYC, you should join New York Tech Meetup. If you\u2019re a beverage brand in San Francisco, check out the Bay Area Beer Socials. This allows you to network in-person, with a ready-made community eager to learn more about the industry. And who better to teach them than you! There are many powerful aspects to positioning yourself as an authority for your brand. Remember, by raising your own profile, you will, in turn, raise the profile of your company. You\u2019ll also significantly widen your reach (think about how many people read your last press releases vs. how many people could read your guest blog on theHuffington Post!). The bottom line is, people buy products from brands that they know and trust. And they\u2019ll trust you\u2014once they know where to find you. ",
