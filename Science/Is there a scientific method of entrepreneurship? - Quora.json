            "answer_text": "The scientific method is unnecessary because the human mind is structured like the scientific method. At the lowest level, we make observations. Then we ask questions about what we observe and invent theories to answer the questions. At the third level, we marshall the evidence and decide whether a theory is true or just probable. At the fourth level, we decide what to do with our bodies. ",
