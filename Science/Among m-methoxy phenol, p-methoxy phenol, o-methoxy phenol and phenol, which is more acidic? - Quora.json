            "answer_text": "Ortho or 2-methoxyphenol pKa: 9.98meta or 3-methoxyphenol pKa: 9.65para or 4-methoxyphenol pKa: 10.21phenol pKa: 9.98(source: pubchem and Absolute pKa Determinations for Substituted Phenols) A methoxy group is mesomeric donating (+M) and inductive withdrawing (-I). Resonance effects only play a role in the ortho and para derivative. The inductive effect is dependent on the distance; the greater the distance, the weaker the effect. If only the inductive effect would influence the acidity it would be: ortho>meta>para>phenol If only mesomeric effect would play: (phenol = m) > (p=o) combine both and an educated guess would make the para derivative the least acidic but -to be honest- it would be rather difficult to predict the others two opposite effects play a role. As a general rule a resonance effect is more powerful than an inductive effect, but apparently in this case it is almost the same since the ortho and unsubstituted phenol are the same in acidity. Which makes the meta the most acidic. (But I looked up the numbers; it\u2019s easy to explain things if you have the numbers.) ",
