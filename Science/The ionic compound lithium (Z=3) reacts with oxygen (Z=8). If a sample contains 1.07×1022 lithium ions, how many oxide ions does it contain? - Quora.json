            "answer_text": "The question is a little awkward\u2026. Lithium is an element, not a compound. Being in the first column of the periodic table, it has one 2s electron that it would like to give away to get a valence of +1. Oxygen atoms are in column 6A, with 6 valence electrons, needing 2 to fill its 2s/2p shell, so it has a valence of -2. Lithium oxide, therefore will have 2 Li+ atoms and one O-2 atoms to have the same number of + and - charges\u2026.. Li2O. The balanced equation, given that oxygen is diatomic and comes in O2 molecules, is: 4Li + O2 \u2192 2 Li2O The ratio of Li:O2 is 2:1. If your sample has 1.07 x 10^22 Li ions, there will half the number of O ions. Doing the math gives 0.535 x 10^22, and to make it prettier, move the decimal to the right; 5.35 x 10^21 O -2 ions. ",

C. 2, 6 Oxygen will gain 2 electrons to form binegative ion So formula of Lithium oxide will be Li2O Hence number of oxide ions will half the number of Lithium ions or 1.07 \u00d7 10^22 / 2 Or 0.585 \u00d7 10^22 ions.
