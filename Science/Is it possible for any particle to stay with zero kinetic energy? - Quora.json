            "answer_text": "There are two answers to this question. Yes and No. In short it depends on your theory/model. If your model/theory accommodates 'zero mass' or 'absolute rest' for all practical purposes then yes. Else no.   The reason for this 'yes' and 'no' view is that in the beginning of modern physics particles were understood to be the 'smallest' empirical/detectable states of matter that were stable under 'normal given' conditions, ie., they destabilised only when one could 'explain' why they destabilised. But theories/model were created that sought to explain the 'particle' itself. Then began the seesaw tension between 'theoretical abstract particles' and our quest to find them. On the other hand we now live in the paradigm of matter and energy being interconvertible.  I hope it answers your question. You cannot 'prove' a particle is 'massless' or 'at absolute modelic rest'. You can only explain it by the other assumptions of your theory. So yes and no. Note - This answer is not meant to be 'pessimistic' answer in the realm of science. We build models that should survive 'falsifiability'. Cf., Karl Popper - The Logic of Scientific Discovery. Thanks for reading. - Aniket. ",
