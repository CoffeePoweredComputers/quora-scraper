            "answer_text": "I think that you might mean 2-butoxynaphthalene which indeed has a significantly lower melting point (35\u201336 degrees) than 2-naphthol (121\u2013123 degrees). This is because the hydrocarbon \u201ctail\u201d in 2-butoxynaphthalene gives the molecule some fatty properties and lowers the melting point. You can see this trend in the melting points of 2-methoxynaphthalene (72 degrees) and 2-ethoxynaphthalene (37.5 degrees).   ",
