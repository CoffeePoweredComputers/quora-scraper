            "answer_text": "You need to research the \u201cnitrogen cycle\u201d There are many many detailed and simple explanations on the internet\u2026. basically it works like a circle: starting with ammonia (left over fish food and fish waste)\u2026.. then a set of bacteria that develops in your aquarium that turns the ammonia into nitrite (with an I)\u2026.. then another sweet develops that turns nitrites into nitrAtes and you remove the build up of nitrAtes through either weekly/biweekly water changes\u2026.. but bedore ANY of this can happen and before you can add ANY fish\u2026 you need to \u201ccycle\u201d your aquarium\u2026. That is where (depending on what type of filter you have) either the little bioballs, the ceramic rings or circles, or the sponge if you are using a sponge filter gain the capability to preform the nitrogen cycle you must start with just your basics- tank/stand, heater, thermometer, decorations, substrate and water then you add an ammonia source (like a peice of shrimp\u2026 some fish food\u2026 and eventually the cycle will begin\u2026. First the ammonia eating bacteria will develop\u2026 then the nitrite eating bacteria and then the bacteria that turns nitrite into nitrate and then the nitrate is removed by the water change\u2026. but before even buying a tank you should research the cycle\u2026 then the fish you want\u2026. then start looking at tanks and such as certain fish won\u2019t get along with others\u2026 you will need certain size tanks for others and certain substrates and special materials for others\u2026. hope that helps a bit! It\u2019s really a simple concept once you do some reading on it! ",
