            "answer_text": "Question: Can you die from too much oxygen? You can indeed. Too much of anything can be deadly. Oxygen is interesting in that it can for a free radical. Basically, this means it has an unpaired electron and is extremely reactive. It will go around and convert other elements to radicals, quickly damaging your DNA and other components of your body. Our body has the ability to fight off these radicals with special enzymes, but obviously these can only work so hard - too much oxygen can overwhelm the protective systems in place. ",
