            "answer_text": "Yes of course. Sulfur in it is in the oxidation state four. It can be oxidized to sulfate or sulfuric acid (with ox. n. 6) with middle strenght oxidants, as hydrogen peroxide, or reduced to lower oxidation states, as elemental sulfur (ox.n. = 0), with strong reductants. The latter reduction can be accomplished even with H\u2082S, where sulfur is at its lower oxidation state. ",
