            "answer_text": "The covalent bond is formed by the interaction of molecular orbitals and these orbitals have a precise direction in the space, with angles that depend on the atoms that form the bond. For carbon atoms usually the molecular orbital sp3 has 4 tetrahedral directions forming angles of 109\u00b0.The ionic bonds are simply electrostatic bonds between positive and negative ions and in the solid state (crystalline) the position of the ions depends on the reciprocal dimension of negative and positive ions and the nets is made by anions surrounded by cations and vice versa, in such a way as to fill all available space. The reciprocal position of the ions depends on their reciprocal dimensions. Moreover, usually, these products are polar and soluble in water. In that case the water, being a strong dipole, is positioned between the cations and the anions and the ionic bond doesn't exist more; the cations and anions, surrounded by water molecules (hydrated ions), are free to move in the aqueous solution. The polar molecules that are formed by covalent bond even if they were soluble in water they would remain remain unaltered and the covalent bonds are not broken. ",
