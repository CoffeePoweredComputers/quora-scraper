            "answer_text": "Not a chance. You can\u2019t tap just a tiny amount of lightning. The amount of electron flow, i.e., energy, in even the smallest lighting bolt would overheat a car battery instantaneously. It would simply explode, with enough force to shatter your car into fragments and scatter them over several acres of ground. If you were anywhere in the vicinity, you would be cooked into a cinder, even before the debris from your exploding car would rip what is left of your body into shreds. ",
