            "answer_text": "Ignoring the cranks pushing an agenda, for the moment, and setting aside my own kneejerk impulse to defend the scientific method as best I can, I think a proper answer depends somewhat subjectively on what you regard as a \u201cflaw.\u201d To put it another way, it depends on what you want the scientific method to do. For an exaggerated analogy to illustrate my point: if you want to slide down a hill, a sled is great, but it has a number of serious flaws if you want to use it for flight. The scientific method is very good at providing a set of guidelines for overcoming the complications of human subjectivity by demanding objective and hitting the brakes on our (often overpowering) impulse to leap immediately from \u201cI have an idea\u201d to \u201cthis is how the world works.\u201d It forces us to accept how much we don\u2019t know\u2014or at least, to be more open to it than we naturally like to be. It\u2019s been pointed out that people can fail to properly apply the scientific method, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a particular failing of the system; I believe that\u2019s a fundamental feature of systems. All systems have rules, and people can learn to take advantage of those rules; all systems with people require some minimum level of trust, and people can take advantage of that trust. As systems go, by demanding continuous objective testing and the separation of hypotheses from theories, the scientific method is better than many systems. Corruption is possible, as it always is, but it requires directly violating the rules of the system, rather than just choosing to interpret them in a dubious way. However, it\u2019s important to understand that the pursuit of science (for which the scientific method is designed) is not the pursuit of Truth. At least, not in a Platonic sort of way. Science is, somewhat counter-intuitively, not about finding the absolute and complete truth, but about reducing our ignorance and confusion. Most of the work of science is being wrong until you find a way to be slightly less wrong than people have been before\u2014but you\u2019re going to end up being wrong eventually, anyway. For example, Newton\u2019s models are all wrong. They\u2019re good enough models that for most purposes, we can still use them today, but we know they aren\u2019t The Truth. In fact, no model is The Truth. It\u2019s just a model\u2014like how a drawing of a dog isn\u2019t The Truth About Dogs, but it might be useful if you need to identify a dog. To put it another way, science doesn\u2019t aim for True: it aims for consistent with observation. You can\u2019t actually do better than \u201cconsistent,\u201d with empirical observation in the real world, so you design your experiments to narrow the field of consistent observations, and rely on some logical assumptions to hold everything together (e.g. the laws of physics are consistent, without which there\u2019s no point even trying to build understanding). This means the scientific model is absolutely useless in areas of philosophy, theology, and so on. It provides no answers about spirituality, and frankly, I\u2019d argue that it doesn\u2019t recognize the questions as having any real meaning in its framework. You can extend its application of logic to any intellectual pursuit (e.g. it seems self-contradictory to posit a transcendental creator, and then try to expound on its qualities and nature), but without empirical observation and objective reproducibility, it\u2019s like trying to use a sled for flight. In the same way, the methods of philosophy and theology (I\u2019m thinking of Descartes\u2019 aggravatingly vaulting leaps of reasoning after the fairly unassailable famous one) are generally pretty useless when applied to understanding the mechanisms of the physical world. So, in summary, I\u2019d say the main flaw, from the perspective of human interest in general, specifically attributable to the scientific method, is that it doesn\u2019t answer or even recognize as meaningful some of the questions that haunt us most. But, then again, it never really said it would, and it\u2019s quite good at helping us answer other questions we don\u2019t really have a better or even seriously competitive way of approaching. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several kinds of failure that occur. Here are some major kinds. We may have no idea where to start. Thales proposed the basic idea of science, which is to look for natural and not supernatural causes for natural phenomena. But then he proposed that the Earth is flat and floats on water, and that disturbances in the water cause earthquakes. Currently we cannot observe anything inside a black hole except gravitational waves, and that only very rarely. (Three times, so far.) We have little idea of how matter behaves in neutron stars, and no idea what happens at even greater density.We may fail to ask a question. The Greeks had all of the math that Galileo did, but failed to understand gravity in the way he eventually did. One key reason for that is that no Greek noticed that the path of water in a fountain, or any other object in free fall near the Earth, is approximately a parabola, apart from the effects of air resistance.We may ask a question in an incorrect form, based on incorrect assumptions. Many ancient peoples thought that the sky and the \u201cheavenly\" bodies revolve around the Earth, which led to the dominance of Ptolemaic astronomy for more than a millennium. Copernicus had the idea of the planets going around the Sun, but made the incorrect assumption that they went in circles. Kepler worked out the elliptical shapes of planetary orbits, but could not explain what caused planetary motion. Newton got it all to work with inverse-square gravity, which held up for hundreds of years.We may refuse to believe our results. When James Clerk-Maxwell predicted electromagnetic waves, and suggested that they might be light waves, his equations clearly predicted a uniform speed for light. Nobody believed it at all until the Michelson-Morley experiments and Einstein\u2019s Special Relativity.For other reasons, many people rejected evolution, and the Darwinian explanations for evolution (Natural Selection and Sexual Selection, especially selection of mating partners). Many still do, and a great deal of pseudoscience has been put forward by people who refuse to understand how science works. One of the problems is that Darwin suggested that we are all descended from Black Africans, an idea that could not even be discussed among slave owners and other White Supremacists.Also similarly, business interests may have an interest in generating fake science in order to deny the real science that threatens their markets. Examples include lead, DDT, acid rain, the ozone hole, tobacco, fake cancer and AIDS treatments, and Global Warming.We may refuse to believe the data. Plate tectonics was \u201cobviously\" impossible when everybody knew that the crust of the Earth was entirely solid, before the discovery of mid-ocean volcanic ridges and subduction zones. It didn\u2019t matter that the shapes of continental boundaries across the Atlantic Ocean made the idea obvious to those without preconceptions.We may face a real problem in which competing theories cannot be reconciled. This is currently the case with Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). QM is only defined in flat spacetime, and GR only in curved spacetime, and there is no way known to bridge this gap. We assume that a solution will be found someday, but we have no more idea of how to do it than Newton had of Einstein\u2019s theories.Scientists have rarely been known to fake data. The best-known case at present is the fake study that pretended to find a link between vaccines and autism.Scientists have rarely been known to produce bogus data that they believed. The best-known case at present is Cold Fusion.There are many more failure modes. The list above should be enough to make it clear that Mark Twain is one of our most important philosophers of science. It isn\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you in trouble. It\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so. ",
