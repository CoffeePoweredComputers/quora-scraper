The last 2 electrons are in the s orbital of the shell having the principal quantum number 3. Since it is an s-block element having 2 electrons in the outermost shell, it will belong to group 2. And, since the outermost shell's principal quantum number is 3, the element is in period 3. ",

Atomic number of the given element is 12, which implies that there are 12 electrons.So, the electronic configuration will be, 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 The last pair occupies 3s orbital.Hence it belongs to 3rd period. Structurally, elements with an outer s orbital which is full are classified in to group 2 elements.Hence the element is Mg.The elements of group 2 are also called as alkaline earth metals. ",
