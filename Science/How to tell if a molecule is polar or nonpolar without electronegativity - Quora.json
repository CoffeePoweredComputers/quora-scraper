            "answer_text": "For molecules, polarity isn't quite so simple. We know that all bonds between dissimilar atoms are polar, but in a molecule, sometimes the dipole moments add up to form a net dipole moment of zero. When we say something is polar, it has a very specific meaning. It means that there is a spatial separation of charges, or a dipole moment. In the simplest case, this is given by: \u03bc=Qr \u03bc=Qr Where, \u03bc is the dipole moment, Q Q is the charge on each pole (equal and opposite) and r is the distance between the charges. Anything with charges can have a dipole moment, and therefore be polar. When there are no polar bonds in a molecule, there is no permanent charge difference between one part of the molecule and another, and the molecule is nonpolar. For example, the Cl2 molecule has no polar bonds because the electron charge is identical on both atoms. It is therefore a nonpolar molecule. None of the bonds in hydrocarbon molecules, such ashexane, C6H14, are significantly polar, so hydrocarbons are nonpolar molecular substances. A molecule can possess polar bonds and still be nonpolar. If the polar bonds are evenly (or symmetrically) distributed, the bond dipoles cancel and do not create a molecular dipole.For example, the three bonds in a molecule of BF3 are significantly polar, but they are symmetrically arranged around the central boron atom. No side of the molecule has more negative or positive charge than another side, and so the molecule is nonpolar. A water molecule is polar because (1) its O-H bonds are significantly polar, and (2) its bent geometry makes the distribution of those polar bonds asymmetrical. The side of the water molecule containing the more electronegative oxygen atom is partially negative, and the side of the molecule containing the less electronegative hydrogen atoms is partially positive.

            "answer_text": "In a first approximation, a bond between two atoms of the same element like Cl-Cl, H-H, C-C (as in an alkane), C=C (as in an alkene), etc can be taken as nonpolar. On the other hand, a bond between atoms of two different elements is polar, like, H-Cl, C-H, O-H, C-O, C=O, etc. Therefore, if there are between atoms of different elements are there in a molecule, you can expect the molecule to be polar. However, there are other features that determine whether a molecule is polar or not. For example, we have to look at the disposition of the bonds, that is, the direction of the bonds. If there are more than one same kind of bond, then their symmetrical disposition, or in other words, the molecule has a symmetrical structure, then the molecule will be non polar, e.g., CCl4, AlCl3, O=C=O, Cl2C=CCl2, etc. However, molecules like CH3Cl, CHCl3, ClHC=CHCl (cis or trans) will be polar.
