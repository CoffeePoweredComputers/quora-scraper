            "answer_text": "It feels uncomfortable replacing surely with almost surely, because we think of probability 1 as an absolute certainty. The word \"almost\" is too weak to describe probability 1. This discomfort is in large part due to our inability to comprehend the size of an infinite set. Let's pick a positive integer uniformly at random and call it R. Pick a number that you think is really big, say N=10^(# of electrons in the known universe). We may think of this number as big, but I can confidently assert that R is bigger. I'd bet everything I own on it, because N is actually a tiny number. Even if we know that R is between 1 and N^2, the probability of R<=N is only 1/N. And N^2 is a tiny number too. If you don't believe me, compare it to N^N. The size of any finite subset of an infinite set is utterly insignificant. In practice, this \"almost surely\" business is not really a problem, because we can't even locate the outcomes that have probability zero. Going back to the random point on the square, we can talk abstractly about the point (0,0). Now imagine an actual square section of a table. Can we distinguish the exact middle point in space from the infinitely many points around it? I'm not even sure there are in fact infinitely many points there to choose from. Perhaps the universe gets pixelated if you look close enough. We can, however, put as tiny a circle as we like in the middle and ask the probability that the random point will be in that circle. This probability may be small, but it won't be zero. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll take the second question first. There is no proof of empirical probability. You can think of it as an experimental result. The law of large numbers gives some sort of justification, but not proof. I wouldn't take empirical, or a priori probabilities as definitions. But once you decide that a probability exists, then the weak law of large numbers shows that you might be able to approximately calculate that probability with a finite number of trials, but there is always a small probability of a large error. To avoid a circular argument you have to assume that the probability exists, and the error probability exists. I don't believe your Kolmogorov definition. How do you know the points are equally likely? This is the a priori definition and only makes sense if you have good reason to believe that the points in the sample space are equally likely (or nealry so). Kolmogorov's theory is axiomatic. Any countably additive system that is non-negative and has P(Omega) = 1 is a candidate for probability theory. To take your first question. Probability theory is mathematics, and mathematics is not real life. It exists entirely in the mind of the beholder. Mathematics is useful in the real world because we can often find an approximate one to one correspondence between objects in the real world and abstract mathematical objects. But this is rarely an exact correspondence. When did you last see an infinite sequence of coin tosses? Or when did you take an EXACT measurement? ",
