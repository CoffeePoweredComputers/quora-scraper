            "answer_text": "Einstein was a complete fraud His four Annus Mirabilus papers [in 1905] were authored by his first wife Mileva. They being \u2018the kinetic theory of matter\u2019 which was the paper to explain Brownian motion, completed in 1904 by Jessiah Gibbs. The photoelectric Effect paper was from the work of Max Planck and based on the experimental work of Phillip Leonard. Special Relativity was completed as it it is known today by Henri Poincare. In 1904 he was the headline speaker in St Louis for the Physics world fare where he declared- \"From all these result, if they are confirmed, would arise an entirely new mechanic, which would be, above all, characterized by this fact, that no velocity could surpass that of light, any more than any temperature could fall below the zero absolute, because bodies would oppose an increasing inertia to the causes, which would tend to accelerate their motion; and this inertia would become infinite when one approached the velocity of light.\u201d The historic record shows that at least five others produced \u2018his\u2019 E=mc^2 formula before him. One person Olintino De Pretto published in the science magazine called \u2018Atte\u2019 in 1902 or 03, the E=mc^2 formula with all it\u2019s derivation. The De Pretto family was good friends with a man named Michele Besso who was also a friend to Einstein. Einstein only credited Besso for his special relativity paper\u2019 The field equations for General Relativity theory were completed by David Hilbert and copied possibly by his friend Erwin Freundlich for Einstein\u2019s paper. The field equations for GR are derived from what is known as non-Euclidean geometry. Sixteen months after Einstein supposedly completed the non-Euclidean equations, a non=Euclidean specialist named Max Klein writes Einstein to explain where Einstein made a very simple error in a non-Euclidean paper. Einstein writes back with his hands in the air and says that he has actually never done any non-Euclidean geometry. David Hilbert himself says of Einstein\u2019s non-Euclidean ability that it was worse than any school kid in Gottingen. Einstein was made famous in 1919 after an observational experiment of bending of light which many know today that this too was a complete fraud. At the same time many scientists from around the world erupted in anger especially as he was to receive the Nobel prize. The controversy delayed the 1921 prize till the end in 1922 where he receives it not for Relativity but the Photo-electric effect. Einstein was labeled a fraud, not an honest investigator a career plagiarist and much much more. What is amazing, is that today people don\u2019t know of this scandal. Many today argue that Einstein should have received five to seven Nobel awards. Einstein received a record 62 nominations for a Nobel up the year 1922 for many different theories. The scandal had such an effect that from 1923 until his death in 1955 no-one dared nominate Einstein again. Not one person from anywhere in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Say E=MC2 and most people immediately think of Albert Einstein. However, the fact is that the theory of relativity was not Albert Einstein's work, even though he took the credit for it. It is easily proven that Albert Einstein did not originate the special theory of relativity in its entirety, or even in its majority. The historic record is readily available. Ludwig Gustav Lange, Woldemar Voigt, George Francis FitzGerald, Joseph Larmor, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9, Paul Drude, Paul Langevin, and many others, slowly developed the theory, step by step, and based it on thousands of years of recorded thought and research. Einstein may have made a few contributions to the theory, such as the relativistic equations for aberration and the Doppler-Fizeau Effect, though he may also have rendered an incorrect equation for the transverse mass of an electron, which, when corrected, becomes Lorentz' equation. Albert Einstein's first work on the theory of relativity did not appear until 1905. There is substantial evidence that Albert Einstein did not write this 1905 paper on the \"principle of relativity\" alone. His wife, Mileva Einstein-Marity, may have been co-author, or the sole author, of the work. If Albert Einstein did not originate the major concepts of the special theory of relativity, how could such a historically significant fact have escaped the attention of the world for nearly a century? The simple answer is that it did not. . . . . . . in 1927, H. Thirring wrote, \"H. Poincare had already completely solved the problem of time several years before the appearance of Einstein's first work (1905). . . .\" Sir Edmund Whittaker in his detailed survey, A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, Volume II, (1953), included a chapter entitled \"The Relativity Theory of Poincare and Lorentz\". Whittaker thoroughly documented the development of the theory, documenting the authentic history, and demonstrated through reference to primary sources that Einstein held no priority for the vast majority of the theory. Einstein offered no counter-argument to Whittaker's famous book. . . Even among Einstein's admirers, voices are heard, which deny Einstein's priority. Max Born averred, \"I have now to say some words about the work of these predecessors of Einstein, mainly of Lorentz and Poincare. Many of you have looked upon Einstein's paper Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Korper in Annalen der Physik and you will have noticed some pecularities. The striking point is that it contains not a single reference to previous literature. It gives you the impression of quite a new venture. But that is, of course, as I have tried to explain, not true.\" ",
