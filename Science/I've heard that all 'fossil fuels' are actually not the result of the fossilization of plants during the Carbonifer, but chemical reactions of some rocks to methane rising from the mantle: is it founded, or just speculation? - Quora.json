            "answer_text": "No, that\u2019s all idiotic nonsense. I grew up in coal country, both my grandfathers had their own coal mines, and my father worked in the coal mines for a while. He had a dozen petrified tree stumps in his yard which had been pulled out of the coal mines, which made it pretty obvious where the coal came from. Where I live now the footings of my house are sitting on the biggest deposit of Anthracite coal west of Pennsylvania, not that there\u2019s any market for it any more. The coal mines went out of business after we found oil and gas underneath them.[1] Tree stump found in coal mine 1918[2]  These things can be a real hazard if they fall out of the ceiling and hit a miner in the head. Underneath and sometimes interleaved between the coal seams there are oil and gas fields. I worked in the oil industry for about four decades and we had a pretty good idea where it came from, because knowing that is worth a lot of money. Some people became billionaires knowing where to find oil. To figure out the process, our researchers created oil in the lab from organic materials. It took about a week to create crude oil from basic organic material in the lab. You can actually create crude oil from just about anything organic, unfortunately it is uneconomic. Making oil in the lab.[3]  I also grew up about 15 minutes drive from the largest museum of paleontology in the world, the Royal Tyrell Museum, which was built after I left. When I lived there, we had dinosaur bones lying around all over the place, and on one of our canoe trip the nieces and nephews found a complete hadrosaur (duckbill dinosaur) which was really exciting if you are a kid, finding a 30 ton dinosaur. We reported the location to the museum, but I think they already had all the hadrosaurs they needed.[4] No, those are not my relatives. That\u2019s a kid that found another hadrosaur more recently in the same area. His father on the left, paleontologist on the right.[5]  We had coal, oil, gas, dinosaurs and fossilized sea shells all around and underneath us. How much more do you need to figure out the geology? Being a good Christian Sunday school student I read my Bible and it just wasn\u2019t there. But then this happened and clarified the situation: Leduc #1 Well Test in 1947[6]  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Clause. It was the Leduc Reef, a Devonian era ocean reef hidden under the flat prairie, it was full of oil, and it was one of hundreds. It was a defining moment in a geologist\u2019s career. Old geologists used to weep about it as they drank single malt scotch in their new mansions. They had missed it for 50 years. They could have found more oil by drilling completely at random than by following their old theories. The coal generally comes from ancient forests, many of which grew during the Carboniferous period 360 to 300 million years ago, hence the name. However, it has been created for about 400 million years and is still being created today in peat bogs.[7] Creation of coal  The oil and gas generally comes from plankton in marine sediments, has been created since the Cambrian period for about 540 million years ago, and is still being created today in the Gulf of Mexico.[8] Creation of oil field  Where I live it all came from marine sediments from an inland sea that was in the middle of the continent. Where I live in the Canadian Rockies, you find seashells on top of mountains, but that just means the tops of the mountains used to be at the bottom of an ancient sea.[9] Where I grew up we had not only coal, oil, gas, and dinosaurs, we had fossilized sea shells 1000 km from the nearest sea. We had it all. There apparently was no oil created before the Cambrian era, 540 million years ago years ago. There was no theoretical reason why it couldn\u2019t have been created, since life has been around for nearly 4 billion years, but it just doesn\u2019t seem to have happened on any large scale. Well maybe it did, but it has since been destroyed by heat and pressure by being buried too deep. Just to be sure we used to drill wells right through the Cambrian to check what was below it, because you just never know.[10] Despite a common belief, none of it comes from dinosaurs. You occasionally find a dinosaur in a coal mine or an oil sands deposit, but that has nothing to do with how the coal, oil and gas was created. \u201cFossil fuel\u201d is something of a misnomer. Marine plankton doesn\u2019t really fossilize, it just turns into oil. We used to identify it by chemical analysis of the oil. Squashed but intact dinosaur at the Royal Tyrell Museum found in oil sands.[11]  The fact it was found in the oil sands has nothing to do with how the oil sands were created. The dead dinosaur just floated out to sea and sank in an oil sands formation.

            "answer_text": "The sheer volume of oil and gas do NOT tally with the sheer volume of oil and gas being actually discovered. The depth at which the oil and gas is now being discovered does NOT tally with the fossil theory either. It is very easy to make a case that oil and gas is a fossil derivative like the other popular answer above will make. There is political traction for people who \u2018want\u2019 that theory to be the truth! As always, that does not make it true. All those plausible explanations can as well be wrong as there are other ways to explain for all those observations. This is not really proper science. It is promotion of a theory. If you are really scientific, then you can see that each and every point being discussed can have alternate explanations too. It is not rocks that react to methane, but Hydrogen and Carbon does appear to combine to form hydrocarbon chains under pressure. The carbon and Hydrogen are \u201celemental\u201d things that are present in the mantle. Hydrogen is formed as the basic atom in the universe and Carbon is formed in stars, however, on earth, there is 1% Carbon by weight in the crust. The Carbon and Hydrogen that is trapped underneath combine to form the kerogen goo and the gas etc. This can explain why petroleum deposits almost always contain biologically inert Helium. This also completely blows out of water the estimates of how much oil and gas we have. It is being formed constantly if we care to understand this. The Carbon 13 isotopes often gets mixed as they seep upwards and often get mixed with fossil sediments like lignite-coal and peat. This appears to confuse a lot of people. The logic is however quite simple. There is far too much coal, and oil, and gas. Then there is the Ukranian scientist that proposed this Fischer-Tropsch process known as the serpentinite mechanism. But there is more than one scientist who has contributed \u201c(first Nikolai Kudryavtsev in 1951, then Kropotkin 1956; Anisimov, Vasilyev et al. 1959; Kudryavtsev 1959; Porfir'yev 1959; Kudryavtsev 1963; Raznitsyn 1963; Krayushkin 1965; Markevich 1966; Dolenko 1968; Dolenko 1971; Linetskii 1974; Letnikov, Karpov et al. 1977; Porfir'yev and Klochko 1981; Krayushkin 1984, Krayushkin, Tcheba nenko et al. 1994)\u201d\u2026 \u201c Tectonic movements [\u2026] reshuffle rock strata, leaving younger sedimentary oil- or gas-bearing rock beneath basement rock, leading in some cases to the appearance that oil has its source in Precambrian crystalline basement, when this is not actually the case.\u201d \u2026\u201cBeginning in 1964, Soviet scientists carried out extensive theoretical statistical thermodynamic analysis which established explicitly that the hypothesis of evolution of hydrocarbon molecules (exce pt methane) from biogenic ones in the temperature and pressure regime of the Earth\u2019s near-surface crust was glaringly in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.\u201d Then, there is a need to explain the spectrometry that shows spectral bands of hydro-carbons (clouds of nebulae) in space. There are methane and other long chain hydrocarbons in our solar system as well. It has been seen in comets as well. So obviously there are other ways CH4 is formed, ways other than the decomposition of dead life. At the end of the day, life itself arose out of elemental molecules**. So there. Thanks for reading. [**Life itself came out of more fundamental organic molecules. Therefore these organic molecules (hydrocarbons/crude oil) came before life, not after. The term Fossil Fuel is a deceptive, if not a stupid, term. It is designed and named in such a way as to mislead the public. Petrol & diesel gives maximum freedom to the individual. It is maximum portability of heat and energy. It is portable electricity as well. Whereas dependence on publicly provided electricity makes one dependent on the grid. It minimises individual freedom.
