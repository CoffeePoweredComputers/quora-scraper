            "answer_text": "Generally, they do. They also play other games. There might be some backend programmers that do stuff in an engine that is not really related to gameplay who might not have to play the game. Think of network stuff and graphics algorithms as an example. But usually they have a passion for games and play the game anyways. The playing a developer does is very different from what you might think it is. If you work on something, you could spend hours playing just one little thing over and over until you get it just right. This is not the fun casual playthrough you do as a consumer. This is actual work where you focus on the details you work on, not your character progress or finishing a quest. Many game developers play other games. Sometimes for inspiration or to see what the competition does, most the time for fun. Those guys are passionate gamers, but playing their own game is work so they play something different to unwind. If you follow some dev blogs, you might see them mention the games they play from time to time. So if you want to become a game developer because it is playing computer games all day, you are kind of mislead. It is actually work and has little to do with how you play the game. It is the same as liking to drive fast cars and deciding to become a mechanic. While both needs a passion for cars, they are vastly different. And taking out the customers car for a joyride may get you fired from your job as a mechanic. The same may happen to you if you are game developer who just plays the game instead of doing actual work. Even the playing a QA tester for a game company or a pro gamer does is not the casual fun thing you might think it is. There is a lot of doing the same weird thing again and again until you are sick of it until you got it just right or found the weird little issue, even the grindiest of grind games are not that repetitive.

            "answer_text": "It is pointless for heavily story-based games, especially ones with bad repetitive gameplay (I think playing such games is pointless for anyone who values their time, but this is another story). It is also pointless for games based on solving static puzzles, as you already know all the solutions. But the situation is different for games based on skill and/or improvisation. Roguelikes in particular are often created because the developer wanted to play games like this, and see how the various elements interact together in a game. I play my games a lot during development to check that the game is challenging and the balance is right; after this, I feel that I have won, so I do not play that much myself. I play the harder challenges, to make sure that they are still possible. Improvisation is still interesting, but I rather prefer reading the players\u2019 posts about the strategies they have devised, and comparing them to my own. Sometimes players devise their own challenges (\u201cIs it possible to [\u2026]?\u201d, or they get high scores in the leaderboards) and I try to beat these. I also like to play multiplayer, as this is a fresh experience. On the other hand \u2014 it could be said that roguelike developers do not play their own completed games, because roguelikes are never completed\u2026 they tend to get significant updates years after the \u201coriginal\u201d release.

            "answer_text": "Playing is really strongly encouraged by everyone in management. But\u2026 it\u2019s awful. Take ThudGame. This was a multiplayer lobby, with 2-player-plus-observers board games. If I went into the lobby, I\u2019d be challenged to a game. That was an hour of my time eaten up, that I couldn\u2019t work on coding it. It was a fun game, and I might see some bugs that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019d be better off working on the bugs I already knew about, or working on the next version. Take Furcadia. I initially joined the game as a player, volunteered as a newbie-welcomer, and was quickly stolen as a bug-tester, then offered a job as a developer, and eventually became the lead dev, and then the only dev. Each extra level of responsibility was accompanied by a corresponding reduction of my available time, and of my desire to go onto the game. I was in the game to socialise, you see. So I had a few choices. Socialize with people who knew me, but have to remember that I always had my \u201cbadge\u201d on even if it was turned off, always had to be on my best behavior, always had to listen to people\u2019s problems, and that everyone would be able to see me online and ask me for help.Get a new account and don\u2019t tell anyone. I am insanely bad at \u201calting\u201d, though - everyone who knows me even slightly can tell that I am me in about a minute of conversation.Get a new account, and build new friendships, never contacting old friends. This had no interest to me.So we observed this in each volunteer as they got more responsibility: they moved away from the game, spent more time in staff-only areas, or in the Skype chatrooms (I think they since moved to Discord, but same thing). Becoming a \u201cpublic figure\u201d makes you no longer want to go out in public. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it largely depends on the type of game and how well development on it went. For a story-driven single-player game that doesn't have a ton of replay value (a point-and-click adventure or puzzle game, for instance), no, probably not. Most developers would have been exposed to most or all of the game during development - maybe you'd blow through the completed version once to see how it came together, but you probably wouldn't see them playing it over and over by choice. If it's highly replayable (like the main focus is grinding for high scores/building your skill, or there is a large PvP component, or it's a sandbox game, or the game is a live service that is in constant development and adds new content all the time), maybe. Depends on how burned out you got during the game\u2019s development, IMO. Maybe also how much your role involved painstakingly recreating bugs by hand. For example, I know a few people at Riot and they are all avid League Of Legends players. (I see some of them on Overwatch a lot too. Don't tell their bosses.) Game testers, on the other hand, I can see getting completely burned out on the games they play all day. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Most game developers work in the industry and/or stay in the industry because they love video games. They may love it in different ways from typical gamers but it\u2019s hard to continue in the industry without a passion for them. Having a passion for them, they will typically play at least some video games. Many developers, being professionals with challenging jobs and long hours, might not play video games to the degree gamers will, but I\u2019d venture to say the majority of developers will play at least something, at least once in awhile. If nothing else, staying up to date and having first hand knowledge of the gaming market is a tremendous advantage in the industry. You can\u2019t really make things if you\u2019re completely ignorant about the general trends at large, at least how it relates to your specific role. In this sense, a lot of games played by developers also double as research and developers often play games they have little personal interest in playing out of professional curiosity. ",

Your typical playtime in those games is probably on the order of low tens of hours to maybe a hundred or so, at best. Now imagine having played that game, in some premature yet representative form, for an average of 2 hours per day, for the last 2\u20135 years. Not just more than the average player, but perhaps hundreds of times more. It changes your outlook a bit. I have played through some of the games I worked on, but not most of them. It\u2019s no knock against the games I worked on - really I have been fortunate to have worked on mostly-successful, mostly-shipping games - but it\u2019s still different working on them than consuming them as an average player.

Most of my game dev experience is in QA (and yes, QA counts as game development), and I would say about 75% of the games I\u2019ve tested I never want to look at again. This is a fairly common mindset among QA testers; in fact, it was one of the things I was warned about when I first started in QA. Think about it: if you spent 8+ hours a day, 5+ days a week, playing the same game over and over again\u2014in various states of brokenness\u2014and then, when it was released, you had the opportunity to play that game again\u2026what are the chances that you\u2019d take that opportunity? Even if it was perfect and all the bugs were fixed (hahahaha like that ever happens)? Probably pretty low. However, there are some exceptions. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work on some games that are so good that I would happily play them again, even though I know them inside and out. Yakuza 2, for instance, and The Blackwell Epiphany. Also, there are some online games I\u2019ve tested (mostly MMOs) that I wouldn\u2019t mind playing again; the nice thing about MMOs is that it\u2019s practically impossible for a single person to see everything in them, so the \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d feeling isn\u2019t as strong. Plus, playing with other people adds a dimension to the game that you don\u2019t get to experience during the QA cycle. The sad thing about working in game dev is that you usually get a free copy of the game you worked on when it comes out, and for the reasons I outlined above, it might just end up gathering dust on your shelf.

As a game programmer, I played the game I was developing hundreds of times, but usually just to check or playtest the feature I was working on. I didn\u2019t play it all the way through that often, though I would a few times, especially near the end of development. After the game was released, I didn\u2019t play it again, except maybe to show it off to people.  I programmed the UI for these menus, as well as a ton of the rest of the game. I inserted a cheat here so the program would automatically select some players and start a game without me having to set up a game every time. Does it look good? After seeing it 100,000 times, I can\u2019t tell anymore. (image credit) If I had developed a game in a genre I was really into, I might\u2019ve played it after it was completed, especially if it had some random elements so it would keep me interested. For example, I can see myself playing Diablo after it came out if I had helped develop it. But it all really depends. Playing a game over and over and over when it isn\u2019t completed can really take the fun out of the game, even when it\u2019s done. ",

            "answer_text": "Once someone has started working in game development they no longer enjoy games the same way. They tend to pick up a lot of the decisions that the development team did. They essentially are taking the game apart, trying to figure out how they developers did it, trying to get a \u201cwhy\u201d behind certain technical choices. Bugs, or shortcuts/approximations jump at them. They also tend to play (subconsciously) like testers, trying to break the game. I have quit the videogame industry for more than 15 years and I still can\u2019t shut this down. Conversely, solving certain technical challenges in game development can bring a satisfaction similar to solving a puzzle or a quest in a game. In most games, including some not very ambitious projects, there is something that no one else has ever done and being the first that figures out how to do that is very stimulating. A lot of game developers or people in the game business more generally are very interested in the pop culture aspect of games (and adjacent domains like sci-fi, toys, fantasy, movies, animes, board games, comics, history, etc.), partly because they enjoy it and feel they belong in it but also because part of their mind is always trying to think of future projects and combining ideas. So, I feel the vast majority of game developers are very interested in the technical/artistic aspects of game development but not that many are gamers in the first sense. Some developers are very candid and will just claim that they don\u2019t play games. And those who do play games do it a bit differently than their audience. ",

Not necceserally only the games of the genre i'm helping develop, since i understand that i'm somewhat more of a niche player, but i do play and am able to enjoy games, likely in a way that is different than the way that my kids, for example, enjoy the games they play. When i like a game a lot, i often can't avoid \u201cstriping\u201d it to its design layers: mechanics, balance, aesthetics, trying to realize ehy certain choices were made. I also often can't avoid trying to \u201csolve\u201d the game by understsnding the design choices the creators had to choose from, and how they \u201cwanted\u201d me to play their game. I do enjoy the games still, despite this forced analytical process, but it is a different type of fun, i guess. However, it doesn't completely replace the \u201cusual\u201d casual fun i derive from a game. Often times, especially when a game is new to me or when the genre is far from those i've worked on, i am too immersed in the gameplay and enjoy it in s way that is probably more similar to the way a \u201cstandard\u201d gamer does.

He is also a very avid player of their games, and I constantly see him online playing Overwatch regularly. However, he\u2019s one of hundreds of employees there. He does not build the game from the ground up, and instead plays a very small role in the overall development of the game. I imagine the answer would be different if you were developing a game on your own, or as part of a very small indie development team. ",

While making games, we have to constantly test. You change one line if code trying to get a little feature perfect, you play through a part of the game. It wasn't quite right? Change it and try again. Often you test games thousands of times during development. So in a way, we already have played our games many many times. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny but in a lot of cases game developers do not play their games following release just due to time and moving onto new projects, which requires you to adjust your mindset when you\u2019re a professional creative. Back in the day, when it was just console and PC games, our dev cycles were so long you\u2019d work on a game day in day out for 2\u20135 years and over time it stopped becoming a game. Those are the hardest to play afterwards, every step is a painful reminder of the time invested. Nowadays it\u2019s a bit different. Dev cycles are much shorter thanks to the tools and platforms and games require a lot more post-release work to survive and thrive. So now it\u2019s more of a requirement than something we want to do, we have to stay on top of the user base, the games meta and find new bugs that are stopping our games from earning. ",

In fact, the only reason for me to make that game is because I wanted an actually good game on my iOS tablet, and when I didn\u2019t find it (this was before Hearthstone was released), I set out to make one. It was a skill-based action game (with same-device multiplayer and \u201cvs AI\u201d singleplayer), so it\u2019s not like I was already tired from the story or anything ;) ",

As an indie game developer, playing these games is like the actual work - you are testing your games, and you want to fix it if you find anything worth improving. And to be honest, I don\u2019t think anybody likes working. On the other hand, if your games are published and you move on to the next project, and you probably will never touch them again, your games become something like your own creation, and something belongs to your own past. They become adorable again - and who knows, you might be able to really enjoy them. ",
