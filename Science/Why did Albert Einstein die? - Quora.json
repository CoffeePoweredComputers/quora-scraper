            "answer_text": "I think nobody wants to die but we all know that death is inevitable, death is reality and death, I guess, is also important for the obvious ecological reasons. I cannot help you with the why of the question but I can definitely tell you something about the How part of it. Here is an excerpt from wikipedia page of Albert Einstein: On 17 April 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an artery in his heart, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it. Einstein refused surgery, saying: \"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\" He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end. During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. In a memorial lecture delivered on December 13, 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: \"He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn. There are lot of research projects where Scientists are trying to make human memory store in supercomputer. They are thinking of uploading consciousness or transferring it to a computer. These are really really ambitious projects and I do not see them getting materialized till next 100 years but, but they are possible indeed. Will People Alive Today Have the Opportunity to Upload Their Consciousness to a New Robotic Body? (Will People Alive Today Have the Opportunity to Upload Their Consciousness to a New Robotic Body?)
