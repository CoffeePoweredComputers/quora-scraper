            "answer_text": "Giant and colossal squid are deep water species. Most sharks are mid water fish. A large great white shark grows to 25- 30 feet long. A Giant Squid is fifty - sixty feet long from tip of it's mantle to the tip of it's longest tentacles. Colossal Squid are bigger still. We only see giant /colossal squid when they are dead or dieing on the surface or washed up on a beach. The giant /colossal squid are far more massive than the biggest carnivorous shark, the only sharks that come anywhere near as big are basking sharks and whale sharks, both these are plankton feeders. So first of all they live in different areas of the oceans. If a carnivorous shark was to encounter a giant or colossal squid its almost certainly dieing or dead by the time it gets up to mid ocean where most sharks are. The main predators of such squid are sperm whales. The largest carnivore on earth. Nearly every adult sperm whale has massive scars on it's hide from these squid. Nothing else in the oceans can tackle them and stand a chance of winning. ",

            "answer_text": "While it\u2019s not very likely that a shark and a giant squid would come into contact there are a few situations where they might. A squid heads to the very top of it\u2019s ocean zone and the shark the very bottom. If they meet and fight the shark will die, simply because the squid has better \u201cweapons\u201d.A sixgill shark meets one. It is possible that a squid would travel low enough to meet a sixgill shark would be a good match up to the squid. They arae about the same size, but because sixgills never use more energy than they have to, they would lose.",

            "answer_text": "In truth we have little knowledge about the Giant Squid. They could definitely kill a shark easily enough. They are massive and sharks are slow to attack. They will bite, thrash and swallow then swim some and thats when the squid may kill it. A good puncture of the gills with one of its thorny spikes or teeth on any of its 8 tenticles and the shark could die or swim away. ",
