            "answer_text": "Neither - ash is lava that exploded and was shattered into small particles. Note that 'melted lava' is a tautology - lava is partly molten by definition. Also note that 'vaporized' lava does not exist in nature - temperatures are only ever high enough to melt the rocks, not to vaporize them - which is why refractory elements (i.e. rocks) formed a planet in the first place.
