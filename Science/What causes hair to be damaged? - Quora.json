            "answer_text": "Causes of Damaged Hair and its Treatment: Ms.Pinky Singh Introduction: Ms.Pinky Singh is one of the leading cosmetologists in India. She has been in this industry for several years and has immense knowledge and experience with her work. She is a Hair and Makeup Artist and has always offered the best of insights to her clients. She explains the cause and also gives us the solution to the problem in this article. Cause: Ms. Pinky Singh states that damaged hair is often a cumulative result of habits that gradually harm the health of your hair and scalp over time. For example, you may cause damage to your hair by misusing styling tools like brushes, blow dryers, or curling irons, as well as color treatments, bleach, and perms. Over time, maltreatment dries your hair out, the naturally smooth cuticle layer becomes rough, hair starts to become brittle, and split ends begin to appear. In some cases, these kinds of improper care are the sole culprits of damaged hair. However, it\u2019s worth noting that stress and unbalanced diets can also contribute to an unhealthy head of hair. How to repair damaged hair: Treatment Effective damaged hair treatment begins with knowing how to wash your hair in a gentle way. Wet your hair with lukewarm (not hot!) water, gently and thoroughly work in the shampoo from the roots to tips, and rinse. Then it\u2019s time for the conditioner, which is especially important for repairing damaged hair and roots. Ms. Pinky Singh States that for best results, make sure you take some time to apply the conditioner thoroughly, paying particular attention to your tips, and leave it in for a while before rinsing. As long as you remember these key points, you can\u2019t go too far wrong: 1. Avoid washing daily (this strips away your hair\u2019s natural oils) 2. Use lukewarm water 3. Massage your strands and roots gently, don\u2019t pull or tug 4. Leave the conditioner in for a while before rinsing Proteins and Nutrients for damaged hair There are certain ingredients in shampoos and damaged hair treatment products that are especially worth looking out for. For example, moisturizers like Aloe vera, panthenol, glycerol, or silk proteins can be lifesavers for fine hair, while plant oils and proteins work wonders for hair that is distressed and difficult to manage. Split Ends: Split ends are pesky and can be frustrating to deal with. For this reason, the best way to deal with them is prevention rather than treatment. As well as following the styling tips we mentioned above, choosing the right kind of brush or comb can do wonders for avoiding damaged hair. Specifically, go for either a wide-toothed comb or a brush with natural boar bristles \u2013 these options are much gentler on your hair, and will minimize tugging.
