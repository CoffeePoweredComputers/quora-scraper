            "answer_text": "There are quite a couple, however the most simple/basic ones: It is non-destructive. That means it does not damage/destroy your sample and you can use that sample to do other experiments with (or rerun it on the NMR again)You can use both solid and liquid (and even gaseous now I think) phases on it. Whereas some instruments are limited to only the solid or liquid phase, NMR has both. The advantage to this is not everything can be crystallized, so being able to determine various properties of the molecule in liquid phase is very important (and biologically relevant).There are a laaaaaarge amount of things you can observe using NMR, and that is growing even more. You can work with very small and very large molecules with NMR. You can observe various conformations, dynamics, structure, and more at a single-molecule level.Not only can you use it for a large variety of molecular sizes, but you can also use it for a variety of temperatures (from 77K to over 350K).You can also observe in-cell processes happening in real time too! Did I mention it\u2019s non-destructive? That means you can watch a cell function at a molecular level (with proper labeling of the molecule of question in the cell) over and over again!These are just some of the basics, but there are a large variety of molecules and a vast amount of their properties that can be observed/determined using NMR. It is useful for everything from small-molecules to large proteins and even cellular systems. It\u2019s temperature (and pressure) range allows you to test all the above under a variety of conditions. It is non-destructive too, which means you can repeat these experiments over and over again without having to make new sample! ",

            "answer_text": "Absorption of (radio frequency) light by nuclei (having a magnetic moment) within molecules in the presence of a varying magnetic field. The significance is that the effect of the nuclear magnetic field is relatively simple. Other effects relate to the environment of the nucleus in terms of adjacent nuclei and shielding of the spin by electrons. Unlike most other forms of spectroscopy, the absorption of energy is by the nuclei, not by electrons. Different types of nuclei give different effects, which is why [math]{}^1H[/math] NMR is different to [math]{}^{13}C[/math] NMR. Similarly nuclei with no magnetic moment do not have NMR spectra. NMR typically represent peaks as chemical shift from a known reference molecule. tetramethylsilane (TMS) is a typical reference. Additional details are available at NMR Spectroscopy - Theory  ",
