            "answer_text": "The said ions could be present in aqueous solution, though not mentioned in the question. Still there wouldn\u2019t be any difference when the solvent is not water! Ni has the outer electronic configuration d8 s2. Ni+2 would then have an electronic configuration of d8. With water as a solvent there is a split in degeneracy to give a configuration t2g6 eg2, with 2 unpaired electrons - and therefore making it paramagnetic. Zn has the outer electronic configuration d10 s2. In Zn+2, the configuration becomes d10, which has always paired electrons, even in the presence any solvent, - making it diamagnetic. ",
