See this: Michael Cozad's answer to Is it possible to live on the moon and will man someday live on the moon? The item is time and moon. To many people think of going into space as the Europeans going out to explore the new world. There is a huge error in that. The smallest ship used to explore the new world is twenty times bigger than any vehicle we have got in one peace in outer space. To go to Mars. Something the size of the ISS\u2014International Space Station\u2014would be nice. The ISS is roughly the size of Charles Darwin\u2019s HMS Beagle. To go to Mars you need as much as possible with you. To go to the moon you just need a lot of launch vehicles. At both places it is possible to use available items to build structures. In the beginning they shall need to be lined with Earth made materials. But eventually, say within ten years after getting there. After the setting up of various micro (small office, big home, printer size) factories. So as to make mini factories. So as to get to small manufacturing facilities.In ten years, 99% of items needed could be made at the colonial base camp.With 99% of need food, water, et al, being local. The places become for all practical purposes self sustaining. For a moon base. That is, say, may be, some twenty Orion trips to the moon. Over five years. To find, setup basic shelters, transport all of the stuff. Then bring up the personally. Whom are going to be temporary individuals for several years. Then at ten years, the basics to colony to survive mostly independently shall be in place. They can start local transportation expansion.Look at building moon orbit vehicles.Be ready to build deep ground bases. For solar protection.And so on. The moon is possible. Cost. Less than $35 billion over fifteen years in direct cost. The cost for the cost of things. Another $200 billion.These are off the head guesses. The front cost is probably close, the background cost could be way off. So about $235 billion. Mars. Twenty times that. $5 trillion. As we get better at getting things into space. The cheaper it gets. Also, twenty-five years ago 3D prints were just beginning. Now anyone can buy one. One of the micro factories is basically an advanced one of those. (Advanced because it is going to have to work in low gravity. Among other difficulties.) But things in these areas are getting cheaper and better. ",

            "answer_text": "I firmly believe that we will have a permanent presence on the Moon, one day. I feel that we need to go back there, before going on to Mars. There are too many things we haven\u2019t learned about living on another world, yet. Better to do that on the Moon, first. Also, I\u2019d like to see us have a nice, big telescope there. We need to learn how to make many or most of the things we need to survive, wherever we are, as it simply costs too much to ship them all wherever we go. Basic mining technology, 3D printing (for tools, parts, etc.), & many other basic technologies will have to be done where we go - the Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, etc. I\u2019m very afraid that, if we rush off to Mars without learning more about these things, people will die there. Besides that being a terrible tragedy, it will probably kill any manned space program (at least for America) for quite a while. There are many risks to space travel, but that\u2019s an entirely unnecessary one! ",

            "answer_text": "From a purely technological standpoint, we know we can reach the moon . But reaching the moon and living on it are two different things. Future lunar colonists will need to bring or create their own sustainable sources of power, air, water, food and shelter.The colonization of the moon  is the proposed establishment of permanent human communities or robot industries on the moon.Recent indication that water might be present in noteworthy quantities at the lunar poles has renewed interest in the Moon. Polar colonies could also avoid the problem of long lunar nights \u2013 about 354 hours, a little more than two weeks \u2013 and take advantage of the Sun continuously, at least during the local summer (there is no data for the winter yet). Permanent human habitation on a planetary body other than the Earth is one of science fiction's most prevalent themes. As technology has advanced, and concerns about the future of humanity on Earth have increased, the argument that space colonization is an achievable and worthwhile goal has gained momentum. Because of its proximity to Earth, the Moon has been seen as the most obvious natural expansion after Earth. ",

Initially, very small. A lunar base may have two or three rooms the size of a typical office. We will bring structures\u2014basically prefabbed cylinders like the ones on the International Space Station\u2014from Earth. One concept is to cover them with about 10 feet of regolith\u2014the small rocks covering the moon's surface\u2014because that would shield the interior from micrometeorites, extreme temperatures and radiation.\u201d \u201cHow many years would it take to establish a year-round station or colony on the moon? Ten to 15 years if we're really serious about it. We have much of the technology. The biggest challenge is ensuring that people survive on the moon. Initially, astronauts will live there for six- to 12-month stints like they do on the space station.\u201d \u201cHow important is a mission to the moon overall? It's a very positive mission that focuses on the future. If we say we're going to go to the moon and Mars and we're exploring the solar system, we're doing it to enhance humanity and we will learn lots of things that will help people on Earth. We could create a whole new civilization and economy. It can take humanity to the next level, with huge leaps in capabilities and options for many people.\u201d CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE A REAL THING? I cannot yet\u2026 ",

An unmanned tractor - trailer is how I would write this story. Something like the X37B as the main tractor. It doesn\u2019t land on the Moon, just goes into lunar orbit while smaller unmanned tractors bring the cargo containers down to the Moon and take empty cargo contain back up. Then the space tractor returns to Earth or a space station. Is a geosynchronous Lunar orbit possible? ",

If they say no, then maybe we will have to go somewhere else. Mars come swiftly to mind, unless they're on Mars, too! ",
