            "answer_text": "Engineering is pretty intense math man.  If you did basic Algebra 10 years ago, you got lots to catch up.  Review of pre-algebra, review of algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry, a deep understanding of functions.  Then, you can start with pre-calc in college. Here is what you could do.  Go to a Kumon center and take a kumon diagnostic test and see how your skills are in the pre-algebra stuff.  That will give you a good idea of where you are in math now.  If you can take a bunch of Kumon classes to improve your skills, great.  If not, continue with Khan academy.  Another site I like is Why U.  They give you a deeper understanding with proofs.  Enjoy the process.  If you really wanted to and worked really hard, you could get to calculus in 6 months.  But, you would have to set up a very intense program of learning and practicing. Remember to do LOTS of problems.  Solve many problems and you will get better at it.  Don't be concerned about mistakes, use mistakes as a way to learn new skills. ",

            "answer_text": "An understanding of probability and statistics is important, since a lot of machine learning is basically just extra-fancy statistics. You also need a good understanding of basic algorithms, because without that you will get bogged down in details. Besides that, nothing else is as important.This is perhaps the wrong way to go about it, though. You don't need much more than a basic level of understanding in any particular other field to start learning AI. It's not like calculus which is extremely dependent on algebra. Just dive right in and pick up the details of other fields as you go. ",

You could also try these websites, if you learn easily by reading things that are written out: Pauls Online Math Notes Or from videos: Khan Academy ",
