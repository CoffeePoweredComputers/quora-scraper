            "answer_text": "Your question requires some analysis and reflection. Here are some of the relevant considerations: Information has an expiration date on it; if it is not used , it will become useless, whether or not it is rediscovered at a later date. Applying the new knowledge that is discovered is a formidable challenge. Frequently, an important bit of information is published: but it languishes in the literature, unnoticed and unused until someone uses a search engine to bring it to the attention of the specialists. Only at that point is its importance is used for a new application. The literature of relevant knowledge and information is a repository of useful tools that is frequently buried in a glut of irrelevant publications that is produced at an astonishing rate. This is because much of the literature consists of new applications of old discoveries. The relevance of such applications sometimes is unrecognized until a truly insightful observer sees it. A search of the literature could possibly suggest that a very good outcome may be realized if this information were applied correctly. The same kind of search and analysis may enable us to foresee a very bad outcome that is inevitable if nothing is done. Regrettably, we do not usually employ considerations like this; we don\u2019t have managers that announce \u201cWe must have an emergency project to do some long-term planning \u201d. Many scientific and engineering operations have a team of specialists that comb the literature for relevant insights into their currently-pressing problems. Their job is to mine that pile of information. Yet, specialists who are capable of doing that are busy creating additional new knowledge and information. It\u2019s easy to see how we might be creating it faster than we are using it in time. ",

            "answer_text": "Knowledge , information , belief , faith Is it knowledge to \u201cknow\u201d the names of various cans of drink ? Perhaps its simply information, belief in a flat earth is almost now a faith It is important to make these terms consistent as they are now muddled. All labels are arbitrary so naming something does not make it knowledge. We assign labels and people agree to use them, but over a few months/years they can change If they were knowledge then they would always be true. Knowledge is a persistent truth and it is also appropriate as a response (verbal or action ) for the environment that we exist in. Its value is that it is a basis for modelling(thinking). To lose knowledge is unacceptable in our environment we need it. Information is anything we receive from sensors so reading a book , listening to someone , looking, hearing all these supply information, so the labels on cans giving their name is not knowledge but information when we say we know them we mean theat we have constructed a memory for that identifiable item. We recall that from our memory it is not part of the consistent world something to make plans with, but being recallable we can decide to get some in a shopping list. Information is normally short term most of our samples will be forgotten soon ofter being observed . It is often essential to our system to not recall it all (consign to memory ) so most goes immediately. This is normal. The data (recallable information) can form a baisis for a model but its status is not knowledge so we are using plausible beliefs rather than knowledge in that model. This weaken our modelling case but gets us further in plausible predictions. We can even use the modelling-prediction and then observation process to promote recallable information to in hopes of building new knowledge (the scientific process is built on this mechanism. Refining beliefs (recallable information (ie data)) into knowledge is the primary intelligence mechansims - that make us an intelligent species. (it is not the only one we learn via our neural nets to respond faster and more accurately to inputs (Hebbian learning). Sometimes we construct a basis which cannot be testable but provides us with a plausible basis for analysing our world. This gives reason for actions that we have observed but can\u2019t explain eg why we are here , why bad thing happen. This untestable basis can be memetically spread so that other might benefit by it. Because it is untestable , but still helpful for the peace and security of social groups it spread and becomes a faith. To question is fairly pointless, but to use them (faith bases) to deny tested knowledge is harmful to the world at large. If it is a faith then it should not be subject to scientific scrutiny , but the faithfuly cannot expect to be taken serieously when they challenge tested knowledge. Flat Earthers are such a faith group. Now we can answer the question: One would hope that knowledge is never lost. It is correct for us to lose information all the time. Recallable information is of interest but may not lead to knowledge. Knowledge is available courtesy of the real world environment. We receive it as information and store some then process it to knowledge (discarding the samples) . Faith and much recallable information (data) are memetic they provide plausible beliefs to make bases about. Faiths do help promote social groups (common binding beliefs). These allow joint actions and control over the group. They are promoted as memes (word and image based input to sell the basis. Societies evolve memetically. Memes are created by us (they do not exist as testable entities ) some memes are socially harmful. Memetic information will be absorbed by its followers, But has no value to those who are not subscibers - this creates a vast amount of superfluous information and it is mosly not needed. Created information (writing , vocal , internet etc) is a poor information source unless it can be turned into knowledge. This is the source of the information explosion and most of it needs to be erased. ",

            "answer_text": "Just the opposite. The exposition of information is exploding. The fact that humans are not retaining but a small portion of the massive flow of information that daily overwhelms us is really immaterial except that in our cocoon like subjectivity we tend to become utterly irrational in our buffering. Modern flat Earth societies From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article is about flat Earth societies. For the Belgian band, see Flat Earth Society (band).  Projections of the sphere like this one have been co-opted as images of the flat Earth model depicting Antarctica as an ice wall [1] [2] surrounding a disk-shaped Earth.  An animation of 22 images taken by the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera on the Deep Space Climate Observatory from the L 1 Lagrangian point between the Earth and the Sun on 29 May 2016, showing a globe-shaped Earth rotating once a day. Modern flat Earth societies are organizations that promote the misconception that the Earth is flat rather than a globe. Such groups date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by pseudoscience or Biblical literalism. Through the use of social media, flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups, many of which have members from several countries. [3] [4] Contents See also: Biblical literalism Modern flat Earth belief originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham (1816\u20131884). Based on conclusions derived from the Bedford Level experiment, Rowbotham published a pamphlet Zetetic Astronomy.He later expanded into a book Earth Not a Globe, proposing the Earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, Antarctica. Rowbotham further held that the Sun and Moon were 3,000 miles (4,800 km) above Earth and that the \"cosmos\" was 3,100 miles (5,000 km) above the Earth. [2] He also published a leaflet titled The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures, which argued that the \"Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture\". [5] Rowbotham and followers like William Carpenter gained attention by successful use of pseudoscience in public debates with leading scientists such as Alfred Russel Wallace. [6] [7] [8] Rowbotham created a Zetetic Society in England and New York, shipping over a thousand copies of Zetetic Astronomy. [9] After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount established a Universal Zetetic Society, whose objective was \"the propagation of knowledge related to Natural Cosmogony in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures, based on practical scientific investigation\". The society published a magazine, The Earth Not a Globe Review, and remained active well into the early 20th century. [10] A flat Earth journal, Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science, was published between 1901\u20131904, edited by Lady Blount. [11] In 1956, Samuel Shenton created the International Flat Earth Research Society as a successor to the Universal Zetetic Society, running it as \"organising secretary\" from his home in Dover, England. [10] [12] Given Shenton's interest in alternative science and technology, the emphasis on religious arguments was less than in the predecessor society. [13] When satellite images showed Earth as a sphere, Shenton remarked: \"It's easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye\". [14] Later asked about similar photographs taken by astronauts, he attributed curvature to the use of wide-angle lens, adding, \"It's a deception of the public and it isn't right\". [12] In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a Polytechnic of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish. [15] Historical accounts and spoken history tell us the Land part may have been square, all in one mass at one time, then as now, the magnetic north being the Center. Vast cataclysmic events and shaking no doubt broke the land apart, divided the Land to be our present continents or islands as they exist today. One thing we know for sure about this world...the known inhabited world is Flat, Level, a Plain World. -Flyer written by Charles K. Johnson, 1984. [16] Shenton died in 1971. Charles K. Johnson inherited part of Shenton's library from Shenton's wife, and established and became president of the International Flat Earth Research Society of America and Covenant People's Church in California. Over the next three decades, under his leadership, the Flat Earth Society grew to a reported 3,500 members. [17] Johnson issued many publications and handled all membership applications. The most famous publication was Flat Earth News, a quarterly, four-page tabloid. [1] Johnson paid for these publications through annual member dues costing US$6 to US$10 over the course of his leadership. [1] Johnson cited the Bible for his beliefs, and he saw scientists as pulling a hoax which would replace religion with science. [17] The Flat Earth Society's most recent planet model is that humanity lives on a disc, with the North Pole at its centre and a 150-foot (45 m) high wall of ice, Antarctica, at the outer edge. [18] The resulting map resembles the symbol of the United Nations, which Johnson used as evidence for his position. [19] In this model, the Sun and Moon are each 32 miles (52 km) in diameter. [20] Flat Earth Society recruited members by speaking against the US government and all its agencies, particularly NASA. Much of the society's literature in its early days focused on interpreting the Bible to mean that the Earth is flat, although they did try to offer scientific explanations and evidence. [1] Eugenie Scott called the group an example of \"extreme Biblical-literalist theology: The earth is flat because the Bible says it is flat, regardless of what science tells us\". [21] According to Charles K. Johnson, the membership of the group rose to 3,500 under his leadership, but began to decline after a fire at his house in 1997 which destroyed all of the records and contacts of the society's members. Johnson's wife, who helped manage the membership database, died shortly thereafter. Johnson himself died on 19 March 2001. [22]  Logo of the 2013 Flat Earth Society In 2004, Daniel Shenton (not related to Samuel) [23] resurrected the Flat Earth Society, basing it around a web-based discussion forum. [24] This eventually led to the official relaunch of the society in October 2009, [25] and the creation of a new website, featuring a public collection of flat Earth literature and a wiki. [26] Moreover, the society began accepting new members for the first time since 2001, with musician Thomas Dolby becoming the first to join the newly reconvened society. [27] As of July 2017, over 500 people have become members. [28] In 2013, part of this society broke away to form a new web-based group also featuring a forum and wiki. [29] Flat Earth Society of Canada was established on 8 November 1970 by philosopher Leo Ferrari, writer Raymond Fraser and poet Alden Nowlan; [30] and was active until 1984. [31] Its archives are held at the University of New Brunswick. [32] Calling themselves \"planoterrestrialists\", [33] their aims were quite different from other flat Earth societies. They claimed a prevailing problem of the new technological age was the willingness of people to accept theories \"on blind faith and to reject the evidence of their own senses.\" [31] The parodic intention of the Society appeared in the writings of Ferrari, as he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the spherical Earth model. [34] Ferrari even claimed to have nearly fallen off \"the Edge\" of the Earth at Brimstone Head on Fogo Island. [35] Ferrari was interviewed as an \"expert\" in the 1990 flat Earth mockumentary In Search of the Edge by Pancake Productions (a reference to the expression \"as flat as a pancake\"). [36] In the accompanying study guide, Ferrari is outed as a \"globularist,\" a nonce word for someone who believes the Earth is spherical. [37] The real intent of the film, which was part-funded by the Ontario Arts Council and National Film Board of Canada, [36] was to promote schoolchildren's critical thinking and media literacy by \"[attempting] to prove in convincing fashion, something everyone knew to be false.\" [38] Multi-media artist Kay Burns re-created the Flat Earth Society of Canada as an art project with her alter ego Iris Taylor [32] as its president. [39] Burns created an installation entitled the Museum of the Flat Earth, which included some artifacts from the 1970 group. It was exhibited in 2016 at the Flat Earth Outpost Caf\u00e9 in Shoal Bay, Newfoundland. [32] ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, what do you mean by \u201closing knowledge and information\u201d? We write a lot of what we learn down in books, in scientific journals or in other forms. The only way to lose this knowledge would be something destructive, like the fire that burnt down the Great Library of Alexandria. Otherwise, it seems unlikely that information is being lost very quickly at all. We are creating knowledge and information all the time. Scientists are discovering new properties of the world we live in every day. Massive companies such as Google and Facebook are continuously collecting data on the billions of users they have. We have more information and knowledge than we could ever imagine. It might be true, however, that as a single person, you are losing information faster than you are learning it. But this cannot always be the case, as you would eventually forget everything. On a side note, it is a belief of mine, that if just one person knew everything that humans have discovered so far, they would be massively more powerful than everyone else. This is why it might be a bad choice to let an AI loose on the internet. Short answer: probably not. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the answer depends on your frame of reference. An early paper by Max Tegmark, written before he became a professor at MIT, makes an interesting point. Apparent complexity of the physical world is a function of the frame supplied by the subject. \u201cAt first sight, an accurate description of the state of the universe appears to require a mind-bogglingly large and perhaps even infinite amount of information, even if we restrict our attention to a small subsystem such as a rabbit. In this paper, it is suggested that most of this information is merely apparent, as seen from our subjective viewpoints, and that the algorithmic information content of the universe as a whole is close to zero.\u201d (quoted from Does the universe in fact contain almost no information?) On re-reading Tegmark\u2019s paper, I realize the problem. The world is getting more complex over time. Knowing as much about the state of science and technology today is much harder than it would have been fifty years ago. Measured by the number of scientists and the percentage of the world they understand, IMHO mankind is loosing ground. It is, however, mostly a world of its own making. ",

After reading a few answers I see the question has depth I would go with some knowledge gets updated or becomes obsolete as very unlikely to be used in the future Case example My first car, a Ford, starting method was to put a long bent rod (starting handle) through a hole low down at the front of the car. When the pins at the end of the rod reached the motor and engaged in the slots, time to turn the handle Handle needed to be turned fast enough to make the alternator produce a spark at the plug, ignite the compressed fuel, at which time the motor fires up and becomes self sustaining Caution if the pins on the handle do not disengage you have a dangerous whirring rod of metal very close to you Good job that this system of starting cars have gone but the knowledge of being able to produce a spark by rotating a alternator is still useful As to the QUANTITY of knowledge being lost / gained I would put it as more gained than lost However the lost information I would say is more a case of being forgotten (almost the same) If archived could be hard to find simply because first you have to know at least something about the information you are looking for Thanks for the question ",

As we specialize we get more very specific information about that particular specialization and so we get to a point where the specialization has to split. This means when a graduate gets out of school there is no way he or she can know what specialization is needed because all of them are trying for new jobs, jobs that did not exist even a year ago let alone when I was born. Change is the only constant. At the other end of the scale. We are killing off ancient communities and they had skills that if they were never recorded will never be relearnt. At that end of the scale we are losing valuable skills. That would become essential if for example the internet failed, due to a solar flare or a nuclear world war. ",

In the past, retaining copies of information in the face of morons burning down libraries and banning books was a real problem. Since the internet age, the problem is more one of managing the shear volume of information, most of which will never be pertinent to you personally even if it is to others. Oh, and keeping knowledge in the public domain rather than behind firewalls. That is a modern problem. So even now it is often easier to reinvent the wheel than it is to recreate something we knew how to do in the past, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. For example it would be stupid to try to recreate the Saturn-V rocket that took men to the moon for other than historical purposes or as a billionaires hobby. On the other hand there are plenty of clever computer designs from say the 1980\u2019s that never became commercial products due to economic forces but which are nonetheless incredibly useful designs that deserve to see the light of day. These are now being reinvented as we speak. ",

It is still there but it is in a closed bag, closed for ever. Aristotle\u2019s ideas come to mind. Alchemy can also be categorized as such. New information is created in a nonlinear way. Wars slow down compilation and creation of new knowledge. But present day rate of creations depends on lot of studies done in the past. So, its \u2018appearance speed\u2019 drops, although hard work continues with same zeal. Therefore, without giving a quantitative ratio, it is seen that new knowledge including hard labor that goes in acquiring process is faster as it is more strengthened by more and more individuals producing it.

For instance: conspiracy theories, flat earth theories, and a lot of what a certain president says on a daily basis. As technology rapidly improves and storage capacities increase, I think we are saving more and critical information. And I believe that will continue: for example, with quantum-based computer systems and storage devices. When I started working as a computer programmer and systems analyst in the late 1970s, small computers had 48K to 64K RAM (that\u2019s a fraction of a megabyte), and floppy disks typically held 120K to 240K (still far short of a megabyte, and gigibytes were not even in the discussion). The things we were able to do with such \u201cstorage challenged\u201d systems was amazing. I believe some of NASA\u2019s early spaceships utilized similar onboard computer systems. Data storage capacities have increased by tremendous magnitudes and will continue to increase.
