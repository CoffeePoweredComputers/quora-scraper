            "answer_text": "Following the derivation here, using Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, the rate of change of an observable Q is [math] \\frac{d}{dt} \\langle Q \\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\langle [H, Q] \\rangle + \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial t} \\right \\rangle. [/math] (They\u2019re all operators in the equation; mentally insert the party hats as necessary.) Now let Q be H itself. Since the Hamiltonian aka total energy certainly commutes with itself, the first term vanishes. If the second term exists then by definition you are pumping energy into the system from outside, and you can hardly expect the system to have constant energy over time (though the total system of energy source + energy sink still obeys quantum physics, and therefore still conserves total energy). But when the second term also vanishes, the total energy is conserved. QED.  But wait! What about superpositions and mixed states and natural linewidths and all that? Superpositions. Consider a system initially in its ground state, which then undergoes preparation to end up in a superposition of the ground state and an excited state with extra energy E. Then energy is conserved because the energy you put into the system will be equal to the expectation value of energy of the superposition (some fraction of E). Over a large number of measurements the average energy you put in will be equal to the average energy you get out of the system (since you will measure whether or not the system is in the excited state by attempting to de-excite it and hence get your energy back).Superposition part II. \u201cBut wait!\u201d you say, \u201cthat\u2019s only after a large number of measurements. Can\u2019t a single measurement violate energy conservation?\u201d No, because over a single preparation procedure your machinery is entangled with the system. That is, your entire lab becomes a superposition of \u201cmachine used energy + system is now excited\u201d and \u201cmachine didn\u2019t use energy + system is not excited\u201d. Either state conserves energy, and measuring the excitation of the system retroactively collapses your entire lab into one of two intermediate energy eigenstates, within each of which energy is conserved. (Yes, it\u2019s philosophically screwy, but take it up with the delayed choice experimenters for trying to destroy the fabric of space and time.)Mixed states. As above, but don\u2019t ask me for details because I never got density matrices. Sad but true. (If you don\u2019t know the difference between a mixed state and a superposition you definitely can\u2019t handle the details here.)Natural linewidths. \u201cAh! But I\u2019ve heard so much about natural linewidths, which is where high-energy particles have uncertain rest energies because their lifetimes are so short!\u201d Well, actually you probably didn\u2019t think about them until I mentioned them. This part gets technical, but long story short: time-independent QM has energy eigenstates of fixed energy, but doesn\u2019t have transitions, while time-dependent QM (which you need for transitions) has states with random fluctuations in energy. When (say) an excited photon is emitted with slightly less energy than \u201cexpected\u201d, then either the initial state had a little less energy than expected or the final state has a little more energy than expected. Energy is conserved. And if you\u2019re going to ask me \u201cBut that\u2019s convenient! How would you know that the atom\u2019s energy was slightly off without the photon being emitted?\u201d, my answer is: \u201cThe photon measured the atom\u2019s energy, and there\u2019s no other way to even define the atom\u2019s energy, so there\u2019s no operational sense in which energy could be not-conserved.\u201d The long answer, as usual, follows below. On natural linewidths Energetic transitions (such as when an excited atom de-excites by spitting out a photon, or when a massive particle decays) are characterized by a natural linewidth, which is where the measured energy has an uncertainty:  The technical derivation of the Breit-Wigner distribution actually makes it quite clear where this uncertainty comes from: the Fourier transform of coefficients of a state with finite lifetime must have a spread in frequency; this spread is an uncertainty in energy. The (slightly) less technical explanation is as follows. If you write down Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation for (say) the hydrogen atom\u2019s electron, with only the proton\u2019s Coulomb field, you will get a bunch of beautiful eigenstates, all of which are orthogonal to each other. And guess what? The probability of a system\u2019s transitioning from state 1 to state 2 is (proportional to) the inner product of those states - yeah, that\u2019s zero for your previously-found-bunch-of-beautiful-eigenstates. That\u2019s no surprise, because you didn\u2019t write down anything for the hydrogen atom\u2019s electron to lose energy to. Once you put the photon field in (like this), you now have a continuum of states (you get one harmonic oscillator per photon frequency, and free space allows a photon to have any frequency), and most importantly you now have cross-terms in the electron\u2019s part of the Hamiltonian where once you didn\u2019t. This means that if you take states of the interacting, time-dependent Hamiltonian, they will be superpositions of the eigenstates of the non-interacting, time-independent Hamiltonian of the isolated electron. Therefore, asking the non-interacting Hamiltonian what the energy of the interacting Hamiltonian\u2019s states are will not give you a definite answer (since these are no longer eigenvalues). You cannot thus have an electron of definite energy waiting to radiate its energy: either the electron has definite energy which it will have for all eternity, or it has an indefinite energy because it can radiate. Energy remains conserved in the sense of the earlier explanation: the expectation value of the energy operator (across both electron and photon field) is constant, and the values in any individual experiment will be self-consistent (including possibly unobservable initial / final indefinite energies and entanglement with preparation and measurement systems).

            "answer_text": "In QM, formally, a quantity is \u201cconserved\u201d if, for any initial state [math]\\psi[/math], one has that the expectation value of the quantity does not change in time. This occurs if and only if \u201cthe operator associated with that quantity commutes with the Hamiltonian\u201d - or, in less technical language, if \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether you measure that quantity first or energy first, you\u2019ll get the same result, for any state.\u201d Since it doesn\u2019t matter whether you measure the energy first or the energy first (because, well, to some degree, duh, although there are a few important technical points there too), in the sense we define \u201cconserved quantity\u201d in QM, energy is necessarily conserved. This implies that, for any state, the expectation value of energy is a constant - and, in fact, moreover, that the probability of measuring any particular energy is a constant, although that requires more understanding of QM to show.
