            "answer_text": "Hello. You're starting with the basics, good for you. Lighting is electricity, just LOTS of it. Lightning can be said to be generated by triboelectricity*, a frictional process. We haven't been able to harness it, yet. Wiki it* for the full story. What you & I conventionally speak of as electricity is the form of electricity that we use and have generated by constructing conversion devices such as batteries, microphones, piezoelectric crystals & generators being spun by wind, water falling, water heated into steam by fossil fuels and nuclear fission and more recently by the tides. Lighting is measured in the millions of volts and lasts but for a few seconds at a time. It builds gradually from a few Volts to a level big enough to hop across hundreds of meters. When it jumps we call it lightning but it may have been building up for minutes, even hours before then. Generated electricity is measured in nanovolts, millivolts to volts topping out at a few megavolts, or million volts. The alternating voltage powering our homes is 120\u2013600 volts and is available round the clock, 24/7/365. Tiny action potentials are generated in & by our muscles, brains and nerves. Larger millivolt signals come from microphones & stereo cartridges and flicker on & off up to 20,000 times a second, as the sound changes. The potentials driving industry originate mainly in copper windings rotating in a magnetic field. Many more energy-productive devices exist. The words \u2018Lighting\u2019 & 'Electricity' describe the same infinitely useful energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Lightning is a massive discharge of static electricity, very powerful, very short duration, but still a big flood of electrons moving from the ground to the sky.  \u201cElectricity\u201d itself is the various effects of electrons, their potential energy, their current, the electrical and magnetic fields they generate under different circumstances.  So Lightning is just one particular form and observation of Electricity in action. ",
