            "answer_text": "No gas can be collected over water. Gases do not exist in the atmosphere and only for a brief time in containers (such as a can of \u201cbad\u201d spray paint). ALL contained gases consist of a concentration of like atoms which constantly bounce around inside the container until the individual atoms return to the atmosphere. For example, a balloon filled with helium will soon become limp and eventually completely deflate as INDIVIDUAL helium atoms constantly seek equilibrium with the atmosphere OUTSIDE the balloon. They eventually enlarge pores in the balloon and one-by-one they escape into the atmosphere - NOT AS GAS BUT AS ATOMS. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey dear, \u25cf Answer -Sulphur dioxide (SO2) \u25cf Explaination -- Insoluble gases don't dissolve in water and thus can be collected over it. E.g. Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carnon dioxide, etc.- Soluble gases dissolve easily in water and thus can't be seperated from it.- Sulphur dioxide reacts with water to give sulphurous acid.SO2 + H2O ---> H2SO3- Therefore, it can't be collected over water. Hope this helps... ",
