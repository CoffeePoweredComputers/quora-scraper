            "answer_text": "As Kristina Ku\u010danda mentioned, the Bombardier Beetle is very much a real organism. She has already given the best answer, so I'm not sure how much more I can contribute, other than to say that the biological structures of the beetle itself are made to withstand the high concentration of H2O2.Some protein structures (like keratin) are sturdy enough to resist highly corrosive substances, whereas others (like casein) are not. In most cases, 25% hydrogen peroxide would destroy proteins, which is why the Bombardier Beetle uses such an attack method. (Late A2A) ",
