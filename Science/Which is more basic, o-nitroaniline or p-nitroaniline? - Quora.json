            "answer_text": "p-nitroaniline is more basic than o-nitroaniline. Try to understand it in opposite way. That would be easier. Something which is less acidic will be more basic. Here the predominant role is inductive effect. The nitro group is an electron withdrawing group. When attached on the benzene ring, it activates the ring by pulling the electrons towards itself. In ortho isomer, the -NO2 group is on the adjacent carbon atom. Therefore the lone pair on nitrogen atom travels from aniline into the ring to the nitro group and is thus stabilised by the electron withdrawing nature of nitro group. Hence the nitrogen atom acquires a double bond character ( due to +R effect) andN-H bond in NH2 becomes weak. Hence it is more acidic ( H+ ion can be easily given away since the bond weakens). On the other hand, in para isomer the distance between the NH2 group and NO2 group increases. Therefore the inductive effect is less pronounced. Hence p-nitroaniline is more basic ( as it is less acidic) than o-nitroaniline. ",

            "answer_text": "o-nitroaniline is less basic. The reason is that inductive effect directly proportional to the distance. Ortho position is closer compared to para and hence -I effect of nitro group is more for this. As nitro group pulls the electron cloud from the ring, the -NH2 group cannot give out its lone pair. ",
