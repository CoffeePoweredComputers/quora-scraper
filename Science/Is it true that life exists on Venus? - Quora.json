            "answer_text": "The Shortest answer is Never. There was no life there and will not be ever. Let's see why! Venus is twin of earth. If we want to know the existence of life on Venus, we have to look at its past. Let's join the journey to past of Venus and Earth.  5 billion years ago (after the formation of Sun), there are peices of enormous rocks and asteroids between a distance of sun and snow line (you can consider the distance between sun and asteroid belt today). Each one have different direction and velocity, so collisions were common. After a long period, these rocks collide to be one. Thus the size of rock increased which tended to increase its gravity. More gravity means more attraction to another rocks and thus the planets gain their size as today. As we see, there's no big difference between sizes of Earth and Venus. Yet, the future of both planets would be quite differ. Today, earth is full of life and beauty. A peaceful world, which is absolutely perfect for life. And what about Venus? It's hell. The hottest planet of our Solar System. What happened with it?  The theories of astronomy answer it in better way.  The theory I am talking about is Big Splash theory (or giant-impact hypothesis). 4.5 billions of years ago, an asteroid (or you can say- 'a proto-planet') named 'Theia' had a size of Mars collided to earth. It singled the surface of earth, yet it was one of the fortunate event required for life. The collision divided earth into two parts, the smaller part is called as our moon. That impact raised up the spin of earth that produced a powerful magnetic field around it.  Nearly at same time, Venus also underwent a large impact, but the result was different. Today, it's only venus in our solar system, having opposite spin.  Something happened with it. Any impact was so huge that it stopped the spin of venus and then turned it backward. The back spin of venus is 243 times slower than the spin of earth. A day of venus is larger than an year. Such a slow spin couldn't produce a magnetic field. And that was the twist in the story of these twins.  Now, you can ask what's the problem if it have no magnetic field. Have listened about solar wind?  It's a stream of superhot charged particles (mainly electron and proton) and often shoot by sun towards planets.  The magnetic field of earth saves us from solar wind but what about Venus? From very starting, Venus had no any safety weapon. Solar wind entered into its atmosphere and singed its surface. It evaporated all the water, now it's in vapour state.  The thick and dense atmosphere of Venus couldn't emit that heat back in space and became an example of what can a global warming do. Worry about Global warming of Earth? You should.  How could that melted surface support life, nothing change today. Solar wind explodes on surface and erode the beauty. Beauty? What a joke! It's one of the worst planet of solar system. Here's the rain of Sulphuric acid which evaporates before reaching at surface. Life was never possible on Venus and will not be possible ever. The temperature of surface reaches extremely and the high atmospheric pressure, which can crush anything. Atmospheric pressure of venus is nearly 93 times more than earth. There're ugliest conditions there in all over the solar system. There's no question of life there.  [Did you know? Some scientists believe it may be microscopic life in the clouds at altitude on venus. Here's no much temperature and water is present in vapour state.]  Did that interesting? You can comment your thoughts on this! ",

            "answer_text": "With the current technology, NO. In the future? SURE. Venus is the closest planet to the Earth. It is nearly identical in size and gravity to Earth. So why not colonize Venus instead of Mars? Lets say that you are part of a daring mission to Venus and manage to touchdown without dying(which is impossible but just go with it). You hop out of your lander, ready to proudly plant your flag, then you burst into flames, then you implode, then your lander implodes. Get the picture? The surface of Venus is extremely hot, around 450\u00b0C at the equator. The pressure on the surface is almost 90 times greater than on Earth. This has caused untimely demise of various probes over the years with even the most successful missions being extremely short lived, lasting around an hour at most.  Venus, the hot goddess   Venusian Atmosphere So the surface of Venus is out of question for colonization but that doesn\u2019t rule Venus out for colonization. According to NASA Engineer Geoffrey A. Landis, The problem with the Venus is merely that the ground level is too far below the one atmosphere level. At cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet. As you ascend through the atmosphere of Venus, temperature and pressure begins to drop dramatically. At an altitude of 50 km, its about 75\u00b0C, still very hot but pretty much manageable. The decrease in pressure also rules out the need of pressurized suits.  The atmosphere of Venus is quite promising for human colonization. As early as 1971, scientists have proposed ideas to colonize Venusian atmosphere. More recently, we\u2019ve seen proposals of Aerostat Habitats.  Aerostat Habitats developed by NASA Lets look at these prototype habitats. Since the Venusian atmosphere is mostly composed of dense Carbon dioxide, a breathable mixture of Oxygen and Nitrogen could act as the lifting gas, which is about 60% effective as Helium on Earth. The idea is that the balloon could suspend a human colony in mid air. The balloon will be safe from the heat and pressure of the surface and will be shielded from harmful solar radiation by the upper atmosphere, which is almost as good as Earth. Challenges Venus is almost devoid of water in any form. The Venusian clouds contain highly corrosive Sulphuric Acid and Sulphuric Dioxide vapor. So, the artificial habitats must be acid resistant. ",
