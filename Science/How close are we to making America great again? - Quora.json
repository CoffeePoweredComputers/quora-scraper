And when I talk about the world I am not talking about Europe, Canada, and Austria but the rest of the world as well. What the question is is how close are we to making America into a liberal fantasy land and that is never. Venezuela was supposed to be the same thing and look what happened there. If you want to talk Covid then talk percentages and notice that Europe isn\u2019t doing as good as the liberals would like you to believe. In fact, it looks like it is ready to slide back into the dark ages again when you compare it to what has happened in the past. ",

(That\u2019s 25 TIMES more dead Americans than those who were killed at Pearl Harbor and on 9/11. 25 TIMES!) Plus more than a million Americans are now unemployed as a result of the pandemic. In 2016, Cheeto promised us we\u2019d be doing so much winning we\u2019d be sick of it. Well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I am sick to freakin\u2019 death of all the winning we\u2019ve been doing since that POS car-jacked the Oval Office. Great again? We aren\u2019t within 40 light years of being great again. ",
