            "answer_text": "Even in laboratory conditions, it is almost impossible to filter or distill water until it can be called pure, in nature, water on or in the ground will contain minerals and compounds that dissolve in water, and in the air, particulates are absorbed by water vapor, so even rainwater isn\u2019t nearly pure water. De-ionized water and distilled water will still have some impurities in them, filtered water, the same, so to expect groundwater or stream or lake water to be pure is simply unrealistic, there are too many minerals and chemical compounds that are readily soluble to avoid some impurities no matter where you find water.

            "answer_text": "What is your definition of \u201cpure\u201d? All natural water contains elements, some metals, and inorganics. After all, the water travels through the ground before it gets to you and is picking up these along the way. The thing you need to be concerned about is the level of any that are present in your water. Some minerals are actually good for you. The only way to remove \u2018everything\u2019 is to distill it. But, you wouldn\u2019t want to drink it because you a likely to miss some important elements need for good health. ",
