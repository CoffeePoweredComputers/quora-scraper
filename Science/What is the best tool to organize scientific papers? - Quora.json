            "answer_text": "Here is my experience in using software to organise scientific publications. I use BioMindmap.com for a few months. Previously I used Mendeley, Paperpile, and Google Spreadsheet. They have nice functionality, but also some nuances. Justin mentioned the Endnote, but I did not like at all. Guys above already mentioned these. Zotero is nice, but I prefer reusing knowledge that was extracted by others. BibDesk became recently unusable. Although it is an open source, so you can improve it yourself. PDFs are too annoying. I had piles of them on my hard drive. Tree-like structuring of files is not good. I like the graph-like or mindmap-like distribution of cross-links. From last summer I use BioMindmap to organise scientific proofs for the topics I am interested as a researcher. (I am not a lab researcher, but a text-researcher I would say.) Pros: Free software.Easy interface.Citations are color-coded/auto-highlighted.Collaboration tool. As if you work on one big graph/mindmapScorecard that shows the validity of proofsOne statement\u2019s page holds many proofs in one place. The best feature I need.Automatically fetches publication\u2019s meta author, year, etcCons: Initially you can only propose new knowledgeWhen you submitted enough, you are approved to add more without premoderation queue.Does not work offline.As it is collaborated tool, someone can change your entries (as in wikipedia) if the user is reputable. Maybe this is not expected.Currently there are no Favourites Lists, but developers promise to ship it in few weeks.Mostly PubMed is considered a good source. But there are about 10 other domains that are ok too. Check FAQ on the website.",

            "answer_text": "There are a bunch of software for managing academic references. I personally have experience in using a few of them. I think it depends on you which software you want to choose and work with since you have to feel comfortable when using it. Choosing an organizing software, you may need to pay attention to the cost you want to pay for it. There are some free software but they may have limited free storage space and they will charge you if you want to exceed that amount. For instance, Sente is a cool app for Mac to work with but 250 MB of storage is something not interesting to me. It is just free for libraries up to 100 references. It may be good to work with it for a course project, but for a PhD thesis you will definitely need more space. Of course, this will not be a huge problem if you are OK to buy space from them ($60 for students, faculty and staff). Endnote is probably the oldest software for organizing the academic research papers. It gives you so many different citation styles (more than 5,000) and it is compatible with Windows and Mac. It has a free 1GB web storage space but it is not a free software and it costs you $250 to buy it. They have some discounts for students and faculties (up to %60). Your University may have a license for it as well, however, you no longer can access the university\u2019s subscription after your graduation. It is strange that they don\u2019t support android devices and they just offer an iOS app. I like using Mendeley. A free software that you can download it for windows and Mac and have your exact synced database on all your devices at the same time. Also, you can download iOS or android app and access your references on your phone or tablets. You can also access to your library via your web browser. One cool thing about Mendeley is that once you sign up for an account and upload your references, you will get personalized paper recommendation every so often which helps you be more updated in your specific field. You can download Mendeley Desktop to as many computers and sync them with a click of your mouse. One more important thing is about the publishers of this kind of software. Many journal articles accept your bibliography when you use EndNote or Mendeley since they are published by Thomson Reuters and Elsevier, respectively. ",
