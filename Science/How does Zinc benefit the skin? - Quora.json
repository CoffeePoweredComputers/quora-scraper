Zinc gets depleted quickly depleted when we are sick, and also if we have a chronic skin condition. Our body uses zinc in the wound healing process, so for example if we have acne and our skin is forever in repair mode, it gets to the point where your zinc stores are just depleted and this is when scarring begins to happen and those pimples stays on. How Zinc Benefits the Skin: 1. Kills acne-causing bacteria( Cutibacterium acnes or Propionibacterium acnes) that invade pores and cause acne. 2. Fights inflammation together with other important anti-inflammatory, antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, E, and selenium 3. Zinc and vitamin A function as companion nutrients in the body and play a critical role in cellular growth, repair, and healing of the skin and all tissues. 4.Zinc also reduces the activation of keratinocytes \u2013 which are cells that produce keratin (a protein that binds the cells together). Excess keratin can lead to blocked pores and acne. These properties of Zinc help with healing scars and also preventing herpes outbreaks.
