            "answer_text": "The big problem with answering \"what does an atom exactly look like\" is that in order to look at something, we normally shine light on it and observe the light that bounces off. Visible light has a wavelength that is much bigger than atoms. It is impossible to make out small details of objects by probing them with waves of large size -- the waves simply flow around the small object. Shorter-wavelength light may be used, but the energy per photon increases as the wavelength shortens. As it turns out, when the light has a wavelength comparable to the size of the atom or smaller, it has enough energy to change the atom by moving the electrons around. This is one consequence of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. We cannot say where the electrons are and how fast they are moving at the same time, and hence we cannot draw a picture with a little electron on one place sitting on a circular orbit. The fuzzy picture at the bottom of the page linked to is closer to the truth, describing the probabilities of finding electrons, depending on where you look for them. The nucleus, containing protons and neutrons, has a similar problem, but it is much much smaller than the electron cloud, and hence the energy of a photon needed to resolve structure is much higher. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle applies to neutrons and protons as well, and so a fuzzy nucleus isn't such a bad representation either. But for show in a classroom, the clear pictures showing the details get across the important points that atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, that the protons and neutrons are in the nucleus and the electrons are found at larger radii.

            "answer_text": "If u are too tiny and happen to sit on the nucleus of the atom, then you would see electrons revolving around you in high speeds, on an elliptical kinda path. Point to be noted, the nucleus is much larger than the electrons, and the electrons are quite far away from the nucleus. ",
