The magnitude of the second order rate constant is about [math]10^{8}s^{-1}M^{-1}[/math], indicating a diffusion controlled reaction. Several enzymes do operate close to the diffusion controlled limit. The list I have in front of me is acetylcholinesterase, carbonic anhydrase, catalase, crotonase, fumarase, triosephosphate isomerase, beta-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase.* *Table 4.5 in Ferscht, Alan \u201cStructure and Mechanism in Protein Science,\u201d (1999) Freeman ",
