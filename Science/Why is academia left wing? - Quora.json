            "answer_text": "Why is academia left wing? It\u2019s very telling and very sad that the question is \u201cwhy is academia left wing\u201d instead of \u201cwhy does the right wing reject intellectualism\u201d. [*] People go into academia because they want to study and better understand the world, and want to share their findings with the rest of society. So it\u2019s really no surprise that they don\u2019t want to vote for any of these pricks: John Kasich (contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination) cut more than $84 million from public schools. Donald Trump (45th US President, Republican) The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.[1] Donald Trump also wanted to slash funds for the Environmental Protection Agency by more than 30%. Todd Akin (Republican running for a seat in the U.S. Senate) [\u2026] from what I understand from doctors, [\u2026] [i]f it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing [pregnancy] down.[2] Rick Perry (contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination) said that global warming is \u201ca contrived phony mess that is falling apart under its own weight.\u201d Rick Perry also wanted to abolish the Department of Education. Ben Carson (contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination) thinks that the theory of evolution is inspired by the devil, and that the Earth is 6000 years old. He also believes that the pyramids in Egypt were built to store grain. And he rejects the Big Bang theory. Mike Pence (Vice President of the U.S.) thinks evolution is only a theory. Chris Christie (Republican Governor of New Jersey) is ambivalent on the purported (but thoroughly debunked) link between vaccination and autism. Donald Trump also believes in the discredited idea that vaccines can cause autism.[3] I am being proven right about massive vaccinations\u2014the doctors lied. Save our children & their future. Heartland Institute (a conservative think tank) put up billboards comparing people who believe that global warming is real to the Unabomber.  There is definitely also anti-intellectualism on the left. But the right takes the cake, by a long shot. That\u2019s why the people who make it into academia don\u2019t tend to be right-wingers. [*] Others have already pointed out that \u201cleft wing\u201d is too strong a word for academia; I\u2019ll just assume the OP meant \u201cleft leaning\u201d instead. I\u2019m also assuming that this question is about the US, because in other parts of the world the political spectrum is shifted such that there isn\u2019t such a clear correlation between the political left and academia. Footnotes[1] Did Trump say climate change was a Chinese hoax?[2] Todd Akin - Wikipedia[3] Donald Trump Has Long Linked Autism to Vaccines. He Isn\u2019t Stopping Now That He\u2019s President.",

            "answer_text": "Let me offer another view. Business people and anyone involved in \u201ctrade\u201d of any kind have learnt that the systems that are needed to support products in the market have to deal with a number of unpredictable events; everything from a new competitor entering the market to a product component failure - to a breakdown in delivery mechanisms. For business people, these are day to day management issues. A real example is say an overpriced product - within a short space of time a competitor will appear - often with a cheaper and maybe better product. The new product and the reaction of the people managing the old product are a mixture of instinct, design, engineering and good systems etc. Liberals have no concept of this drama which plays out in all products in all markets every day and involves company managers / distributors / marketing agencies / retailers / lawyers / accountants and so on. Academics are also used to pontificating about subject where they have no stake; Paul R. Ehrlich - Wikipedia has made predictions of coming catastrophes of all kinds without any of them coming true. In business, nobody would admit to ever having met him; in academia he is an international hero. (There\u2019s a good research paper in there I think.) Having never been involved in such market movements - which often include weird and inconsistent customer behaviour - Liberals and other left leaning thinkers believe it must be easy. And if it\u2019s not exactly easy - it must be corrupt - maybe both.Not only is it not easy - the market is beyond comprehension in some ways. And (this is something never admitted to by non-players until too late) the corruption in market-capitalism is nothing like the exploitation that occurs with state managed / single-supplier controlled commerce. As Thomas Sowell - Wikipedia points out in some of his articles (all well worth reading by the way) Soviet Russia was trying to control thousands of prices (including bread, flour and other staples) ever day from a central authority - until it collapsed. Now just think for a minute what happens when a distribution problem occurs; say the delivery to some destinations fail. The messages sent back to central control pleading for supply will overwhelm the controllers to they extent that they will ignore them (always happens). And that\u2019s where the black-market steps in, hoarding takes place and general mayhem ensues. For a black-humour version of what actually happens see Zinoviev Yawning Heights - a Russian Catch-22; Zinoviev was a philosopher and \u201c. . .should be up there with Hobbs, Voltaire, Swift, George Orwell. . \u2018(NYT) In a market system, a competitor or an opportunist distributor will step in and quickly arrange for alternative supplies - even if they are from over-supply in another area or even overseas. The market system is flexible and will take opportunities where it can find it. There are no opportunities in State Run Central Command and Control systems - only problems and graft of which there are always too many of both. Liberal- academic writers really need to get out and work in a real organisation for a few months / years. A warehouse job in a food distribution centre would be a good starting point. If they ever return to academia, I guarantee they will have a different view of the world. The drawback would be they would never stop telling you about it. ",
