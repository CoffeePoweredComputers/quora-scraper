Or wood stoves for our cooking? I know that appeals to some people, not most. The only alternative I can thing of that comes close is natural gas. Then there is manufacturing. Today\u2019s aluminum wouldn\u2019t be possible without electricity to refine it. Before that process was invented, aluminum was very valuable. ",

            "answer_text": "One minute represents 0.07% of any given 24-hour day, i.e. not much. Imagine the whole world suddenly being told that from now on electricity will not be available for one minute per day. That minute happens randomly but is guaranteed. \u2018No electricity\u2019 means no mains, no batteries, no back-up generators, no dynamos, nothing. Anything running on electricity goes dead for one unpredictable minute every 24 hours. What would happen? We would need to restart many billions of machines once every 24 hours. We would need to restart every timing device, including the timing device in our PCs and apps that runs on a separate battery. Think about life-saving devices and other critical medical devices. Think of vehicles on the move. And think of our electricity-driven brains and bodies. For a baby a one-minute stoppage is a long time. And anyway who or what would restart every single human being that doesn\u2019t itself need to be restarted? ",

How much would a person 200, 300 or many more centuries ago have given to send a message world wide from any place on earth with just a FEW touches of a keyboard. That is just ONE thing electricity has given us. There are so many others like heating cooling , cooking and lighting. MAN are we lucky and SPOILT. ",

God forbid they should ever have to use their own brain's to write, speak, do simple math, or read an actual book. Should the power go off, even temporarily, they are lost souls. What they don't get is that having these skills is a backup mechanism that will allow them to function. As the demand for power grows, there will likely be more & more brownouts & blackouts in the future. Perhaps school curriculums should reinstate the three R's & a healthy dose of common sense, as this seems to be lacking in this group too. ",

Occasionally we use a blender, & my wife uses an electric sewing machine but she also has a treadle sewing machine. The most important item is the fridge, it makes life much easier, & oh yes, almost forgot, the washing machine. I used to do all the washing by hand in a copper. We lived for over 20 years without electricity, so we could do it again, but the fridge definitely adds to our ease of living. Keith. ",
