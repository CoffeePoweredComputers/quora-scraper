            "answer_text": "No. This is the greatest problem, associated with a black hole. If light could escape the Event Horizon, many problems regarding a Black Hole would have been solved. Light is the main source of information about any astronomical object. If light could escape the Event Horizon, we would have had much information about the Black Hole, just like we have regarding all other astronomical objects. Unfortunately, neither can light escape, nor can we get a clear view of the Event Horizon. ",
