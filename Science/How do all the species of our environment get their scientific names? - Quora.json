            "answer_text": "There are international standing committees which decide this. In the main, when a new taxon is described, the describer decides on a name which must conform with the international standards for names. These standards are slightly different for animals and plants. The first name given to an organism will almost always be the official name for that organism. If two people name the same organism with different names, the first name to be officially published will be the official name. If a name change is required, the person who wants the name change will publish a proposal which will need to be ratified by the appropriate international committee. Sometimes there might be a problem with a name, then there will need to be a proposal to officially change the name but in general, once named the name is for good. ",

            "answer_text": "Frequently the finders name is included. Now its taxonomy, it kinda goes by unofficial quorams. The dog has been moved three or more times,in relation to the wolf. Now, with more species being DNA sequenced, they did for example just find out the Egyptian Jackal is a wolf. Now known as the Egyption Wolf. That was an easy one. The Golden jackal from the same surroundings is though a jackal. They look so much a like because they share the same adaptations to the same environment. But back to the dog, some scientists are saying it should be a completely separate species. The number of scientists is one thing, but so is their background and the general worth of other contributions to science. They kinda pull more people behind them, and then they change the textbooks. Note, this isn\u2019t a huge change. But using DNA as the final arbitrator, there have been quite a few changes in the taxonomy of various creatures. ",

            "answer_text": "His name is Barry. He decides the name of everything. No, seriously the names of things are not simply decided, and they are not just made up. They are descriptive, so that based on the name, we know where they fit, into the family and the classification so that we can group them based soleley on their names. The scientific designator in which the first name (genus) and the secondary name (specific epithet) are the same is known as tautonym. The reason is that such a name implicitly indicates that the species is the type of its genus. This type of naming convention (nomenclature) is applicable only in description based on animal diversity. ",

As John Margetts has noted, these organizations don\u2019t name species themselves; generally, the first scientist to formally describe them in a scientific publication does so; this scientist is often but not necessarily the discoverer.
