            "answer_text": "My daughter just had her birthday this past week. My birthday is in July. I had to explain to her that she was lucky to have hers during the school year because her teacher could wish her a happy birthday and because we were able to invite her friends to a \u201cdrive-by\u201d birthday party (COVID-19 for the loss). I am also reminded that our month of birth, to some degree, dictates when we get to start our first year of school. My daughter missed the cutoff to start a year earlier by only a few weeks (the district doesn\u2019t let you do a waiver). Thus, I could maybe argue that your birth date may have some very vague influence upon your personality. That has nothing to do with stars, though. Correlation isn\u2019t causation. A celestial body that is so far away that our minds aren\u2019t capable of fathoming the distance isn\u2019t really possible. In fact, they aren\u2019t even where we see them anymore. We\u2019re receiving light from a body that is quite far away. Cassiopeia is 4,000 light years away. Who knows what it looks like right now? The belief that stars affect us in any way is romantic prattle. It\u2019s cute for poets to take about it, but it\u2019s nothing more than that. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cSigns of the Zodiac\u201d do not affect anything, rather the reflect a person\u2019s nature based upon natural order in the universe that aligns with, well, everything!\u2026 including our coming into being. By asking about \u201cscientific evidence\u201d this presumes that science is the supreme measuring stick of all in life. This of course is a misguided notion, for example, how did science do in anticipating the dying state of the planet? And what solutions, real solutions, are being offered even after their gross mis-perceptions have come to light? While most sciences bear a relationship to \u201cphysics\u201d \u2014which even that science is screwing up by mostly ignoring the most important cutting edge areas of physics referred to as \u2018quantum physics\u2019, given it collides with some of their outdated and conservative views\u2014 Astrology pertains to \u201cmetaphysics\u201d. While metaphysics fully accepts and understands the nature and limits of physics, physics cannot even understand metaphysics, as their closed systems do not see beyond their borders. What scientific evidence there is, and has been for many years, relative to all matters of metaphysics, is negated for various reasons that protect the borders science maintains on its reach. ",
