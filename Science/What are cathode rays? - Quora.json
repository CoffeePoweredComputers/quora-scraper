            "answer_text": "Beams of electrons which have been stripped from atoms in a low pressure gas, say in a glass tube, by an applied electric field and moving in the field. The electrons can be deflected by external electric and magnetic fields. The charge to mass ratio of the electrons can be found from experiments in which electric and magnetic fields of known strengths produce opposite deflections, and then balancing the fields for zero deflection. The beams can be focused by special electric or magnetic fields. When the beam falls on a fluorescent screen you can then get a spot of light. This is used in a CRO. ",

            "answer_text": "Cathode Rays are just beams of electrons. Due to an absence of a conductor the electrons are forced to travel through vacuum (i.e ions in the low pressure air medium), this causes a glow on the other end of the terminal. The same principle is used in CRT monitors and displays where the opposite end of the cathode is coated with a fluorecent material to bring the radiation into the visible spectrum, while the beam is refreshed 50 to 60 times per second, leading to a moving picture on the screen.
