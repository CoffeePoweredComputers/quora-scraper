            "answer_text": "The proton, or something very like it, was theorized about as early as 1815 by William Prout, who imagined there should be a basic constituent of all of Dalton\u2019s newly proposed atoms. Prout wanted to build all of the atoms out of hydrogen atoms, which was in fact a very clever idea. But it didn\u2019t quite work with real atomic masses. The singly positive hydrogen ion was seen at least as early as 1886, but it was not thought of as the proton. It was thought of as a cation at that time. The proton was really first discovered and named by Ernest Rutherford, in the years from 1917-1920, after the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Rutherford model of the atom was already established. Rutherford showed that a particle with charge +1, which can also be shown to be the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, can be knocked out of a nitrogen nucleus, and that it is also found in other nuclei; he did this using [math](\\alpha,p)[/math] reactions. The first nuclear reaction ever seen was a knockout reaction on nitrogen, producing a proton and carbon. The neutron could have been predicted after the proton was known, by looking at atomic masses, which tended to be a bit more than twice the atomic number times the proton mass, up to small corrections. But since they are neutral particles, it was hard to see neutrons, and since Rutherford believed there were only electrons and protons in nuclei, and that this should be enough, he didn\u2019t think of suggesting a new particle right away. Moreover he rejected the arguments of the quantum theorists, such as Pauli, who argued that there couldn\u2019t be electrons and protons in nuclei, for various reasons, including that such nuclei would have the wrong statistics. Neutron knockout reactions produced by alpha particles incident on beryllium were first seen by Bothe and Becker in about 1930, but they could not be certain that the neutral particle they saw was not a photon. Joliot and Curie did experiments that suggested very strongly that the neutral particle could not be a photon, by bombarding paraffin with the particles, and they saw that secondary particles came out from the paraffin with so much energy that it would have required a 50 MeV photon to produce them, which seemed very highly improbable. If they assumed the mass was closer to the proton mass, they could roughly explain the energy of the tertiary products. But this was not completely conclusive. James Chadwick, in 1932, finally did a clever series of experiments with the new neutral radiation on a series of targets, containing light nuclei, which showed, similarly to Joliot and Curie that not only was the particle not likely a photon due to energetic considerations, but that it had an interaction cross-section which was enormously greater than that which was expected for Compton scattered photons. That was completely conclusive, it showed that the particle was something new, and then Chadwick only needed a measurement of the new particle\u2019s mass. The method Chadwick used was quite ingenious: he produced neutrons by bombarding a boron target, then struck nitrogen with the neutrons. The alpha particle energy was known, the masses of the alpha particle, the boron nucleus and the nitrogen nucleus were also accurately known. So energy conservation in these reactions on nitrogen gave him an equation for the mass-energy of the neutron with one unknown, the neutron speed. Assuming that the neutron and proton masses were the same, he then bombarded protons with the same boron neutrons and measured the proton speeds. He then took the measured proton speeds, put them into the first equation as the neutron speed and then he could calculate the neutron mass, for the first time. He got a value of [math]938 \\pm 1.8[/math] MeV, which is close enough. Then all that was left was to name the new particle and neutron is a very natural choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Eugen Goldstein discovered positively charged particles, but with no clear idea of why they existed or whether they had a wider role. Rutherford correctly identified them as being individually the nucleus of a hydrogen atom. And existing in all atomic nuclei. So, it is a matter of definitions who discovered the Proton. In 1932, James Chadwick, an English physicist who had worked with Rutherford, detected neutrons and measured their mass in an invisible game of billiards. He fired the neutrons at a block of paraffin wax, which has a high concentration of hydrogen and is therefore rich in protons. Some of the neutrons collided with protons in the wax and knocked them out. Chadwick could then detect these protons and measure their energy. Using his knowledge of energy and momentum, he was able to work out the mass of the neutrons from the range of energies of the protons that they knocked out. He found that its mass was slightly more than that of a proton. Chadwick, like Rutherford, used an ingenious method to probe into what cannot be seen. ",
