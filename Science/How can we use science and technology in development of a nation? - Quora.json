            "answer_text": "I think what science and technology does is it allows humans to make progress. For example, before there was science and technology, we used to live in caves or hobble around in the wilderness trying not to get eaten by wolves. And now look at us, we live in large houses and drive cars that can go faster than any animal. I think this shows how science and technology has allowed humans to progress. Also, the way humans have evolved to be able to do science and create technology is also a great thing. If it wasn't for evolution there would be no humans. Also, science and technology allows humans to work together in large groups, which I think is important. It's interesting that if there was no such thing as a group of people working together or the concept of 'teamwork' we would have never been able to do things like build complex houses and cars. Also, I think science and technology has allowed humans to do a lot of good things. For example, before there was science and technology we didn't have hospitals or medicine that could cure people when they were sick. But now there are hospitals and medicine, which is good. So I think that science and technology has done a lot of good for humans. ",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology are the way forward. However, it\u2019s not just the knowledge gained and technology developed that will build the future of nations. To truly move forward, the way all nations think has to change. It\u2019s a tiny planet really. What is needed is the development of secular democracy as the norm. This will only happen when people start to think with their minds, instead of their hearts. Theocracies and autocracies are too controlling, self centered, and conservative for the citizens and society to grow freely. To really grow, the citizens and the governments must learn to think more like scientists \u2026 rationally. I recommend Carl Sagan\u2019s Pale Blue Dot monologue. ",
