            "answer_text": "Definitely. That's what I have been saying, and that's what I'll continue to say. And I already know this without using law of attraction. I know it's a scam because it sounds too good to be true. And also the name \u201claw of attraction\u201d sounds really stupid. And to practice such nonsense is not only stupid, and possibly sacrilegious, it puts you out of touch with reality. In the real world, bad things happen. It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not. Bad things happen regardless. We live in a fallen world that is corrupted by sin. That is why bad things happen. If you think practicing law of attraction will make you immune to anything that feels negative, I'd say that you are under strong delusion. I'm not trying to spread hate. I'm trying to tell it like it is. There are all kinds of scams out there. Law of attraction is one of them. There's another scam that I almost fell for: There was a pop-up that was out of the clear blue while I was surfing the internet. It was promising a $1000 dollar Walmart gift card. But you had to take a short survey in order to receive it. It wasn't a real survey. They was phishing for personal information. You would go through a questionnaire. Then in order to claim your prize, you had to go through another questionnaire. Then it sends you to a fake credit score site and asks for your social security number. I realized then that it was a scam. But I got a bunch of unwanted calls and emails as a result. I didn't give out anything like bank account and social security numbers. The only thing they got was my email and phone number (before I realized it was a scam). It was last night when I got the pop-ups. It was today when I got the unwanted calls and emails. The moral of this true story: If it sounds too good to be true, it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. Not even a little. It\u2019s not a load of BS in reality. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re asking this because either the law of attraction is not \u201cworking\u201d for you or either that it sounds way too good to be true. I\u2019ll start with the most troubling one: It\u2019s not working for me: Believe it or not it works for you every time and it still is now. The problem is that it\u2019s on autopilot. The truth is that there can be too many things that can go wrong. Our mind is always unpredictable. You\u2019re not giving enough feelings to it. You\u2019re supposed to visualise it as if you were in it right now and feel what you would feel.Your momentum is all backward. You only think about what is and worry about it. You should not worry about the outcome and act as if it happened.You keep using the word \u201cbut\u201d. I want to manifest this but I don\u2019t know how. I wanna do that but I don\u2019t deserve it. - these are examples. You\u2019re supposed to think much more positively.You\u2019re way too worried about it. You\u2019re waiting too much. You\u2019re supposed to let go of it and just believe that it will manifest in the right time. If you keep visualizing, the risk of worry rises.You\u2019re focusing more on the current situation than the situation that you want to happen.Your subconscious mind is blocked. Try using law of attraction subconscious affirmations on YouTube and listen to it as you sleep.You\u2019re not taking action. - if you take inspired action, the desire comes to you faster because you are open for it.You don\u2019t have enough gratitude for the universe. You need to learn to up your gratitude. Gratitude is the big part when it comes to manifesting something.All of these sum up to one thing: Lack of right momentum. Now, for the proof. There IS proof of the law of attraction, mos notably the placebo effect. It\u2019s the result of the law of attraction. Read up about it and it\u2019s testimonials. There are LOTS of success stories. Read up about the subconscious mind and its power. Testimonials too. They are really inspiring. Reading about quantum superposition tells you how the law works. ",
