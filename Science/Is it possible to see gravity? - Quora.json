            "answer_text": "No ! It is neither possible to see gravity nor gravity wave. You can not see a force-field directly ! It is theoretically possible to see the motion of a particle inside a very strong gravitational field, where it follows the curvilinear path that the heavy mass generates. That curved pathway for a particle with very small mass, and therefore very little inertia would be one way you can indirectly visualize a curvilinear path near a massive object ! We would have to do the experiments in deep space with equipments sensitive enough to follow the trajectory of tiny particles that we could release and see how they move\u2026 This would be getting to see the curved pathways in an indirect manner. The space-time field lines are invisible and there is no way to visualize them. In many ways it is the same as using iron filings around a magnet to visualize the magnetic field lines which show you the amazing curvatures that the iron particles follow. You can do that easily as magnetic field generated by a magnet is so much more powerful locally than gravitational field for the same magnet, or an identical sized mass. The force field with its field anatomy in terms of field line distributions is one of the most amazing things in nature that fascinated scientific giants like Newton, Einstein, Faraday, and Maxwell. Einstein took it wondrously further into the world of gravity which in and of itself is 'space-time curvature' as induced by mass. Curvature of space and time is an astonishing concept that is a 'cornerstone' of the general theory of relativity which took Professor Einstein about a decade to evolve with the most difficult thought processes, thought experiments, and mathematical difficulties that no other scientist had ever delved into before ! And this most remarkable theory and its remarkable predictions have been confirmed by every test that there is ! There is a huge news this month that is being celebrated all around the scientific world\u2026 General relativity's amazing predictions have been confirmed again ! From the gravitational lensing, to the gravitational ring and now the gravitational red shift which has just been confirmed by studying the trajectory and behavior of the star S2 passing by Sagittarius A, which is our Milky way's central supermassive black hole with 4 million solar masses !! The star S2 was studied for 20 years and showed its curved pathway and the gravitational redshift proportional to its speed and inversely related to its distance from the supermassive black hole at any point in time !! Once again General relativity, the great master's theory of extreme genius had perfectly predicted what was to be observed !!! In a very macroscopic level what was observed was the extremely fast curved gravitational path that the star S2 took in its 20 year journey at the average rate of 25,000,000 km/hr, twenty six thousand light years away from our solar system, going partially around our own black hole which was one of the fastest trajectories of any star ever observed also !

            "answer_text": "According to me, No visible particles of Gravity are yet discovered..And it is true, No force is like, Directly visible.. We can see things only when light reflects from its particles and our eyes catch the reflected light... But in the case of any such Force, No solid particle is yet discovered, which we can see..Same is the case of Magnetic force too, no such particles are discovered, which can reflect light during magnetism... And Moreover, nor does the medium in which these forces generate, get any change in refractive indices which can at least deviate the light and show their presence.. Hence, according to me, It is Not possible to see gravity or any such force, it can only be felt...Just like The Supreme Almighty... He is invisible...But still... He too can be felt..  ;) Still buddy, Science keeps on developing. It has no end... So who knows... One day we might reveal the colour of Gravity... ",
