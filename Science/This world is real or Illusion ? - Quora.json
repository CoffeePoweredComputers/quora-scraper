            "answer_text": "The world, the material world, is real in the sense that it happens. It is unreal, and thus illusory, in the sense that it does not last. It\u2019s like a dream - a dream seems real as long as it lasts, but when we wake up, we understand it was not real. Krishna says: Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the non-existent [the material body] there is no endurance and of the eternal [the soul] there is no change. This they have concluded by studying the nature of both. (Bg. 2.16) So according to Krishna's definition, reality is that which is eternal and unreality, or illusion, is that which is temporary. Note that illusion does exist, but it is unreal in the sense that it's not eternal. Someone may object - if I smash my head into a wall, the pain I feel is very real. How can it not be real? But if seen in the light of eternity it is not real. Say, a month from now, it will be no more real, than had it been a dream. Illusion exists, but the reason it is not considered real is because it is not eternal. It's like a dream. A dream happens, but when we wake up, we understand it was not real. Life in a material body is like that - dream-like. We'll realize that, if not before, then at the time of death. Death will be a rude awakening for the atheist. So reality and illusion is defined by time. One is eternal the other is temporary. And if you think about it, it makes sense. Anything seen in the light of eternity will be manifested for such a short time, that it is as if it didn't really happen. Brahma, the god of creation, is said to live as long as the universe lasts - which is calculated to be 311 trillion solar years. So if you live for such an unfathomable length of time, then imagine what a person's life-span on earth of, say, 80 years must look like. I don't even live for a second from Brahma's point of view. How real would a person be to you if he existed for only a second? Think about it. If you take 80 years out of 311 trillion years it is such a miniscule portion of time, that for all practical purposes it might as well not have happened. But then, if you take Brahma's lifespan and compare it to eternal time, it is just as little. However long time is taken out of eternal time, it will still amount to nothing. The duration of the universe will make a lifespan on earth seem completely insignificant, and the cosmic time of millions, billions, and trillions of years seem totally inconsequential and insignificant from the angle of eternal time. So from the point of view of eternity, anything that is not eternal is but an illusory glimpse. That's how one can understand that anything which has a beginning and an end is illusory. Only that which is eternal is real. Now, in this world, what is then real, someone might ask. We don't have any experience of something that lasts forever, do we? Yes we do. The only thing, that lasts forever is the soul - ie. consciousness. The soul is eternal, so in the material world the only real thing is the soul, everything else is temporary and thus illusory. That's why self-realization, according to Vaishnava theology, means to realize one's eternal self beyond the temporary body and mind. Krishna gives a brilliant argument in the Bhagavad Gita to help a thoughtful person experience his eternal self. A person's body goes through different stages of infancy, childhood, youth, old age and finally death. But during all these changes of the body and the mind, the self (the inner sense of I-feeling), or the inner observer, remains constant. That's one way we can logically understand we are eternal. The human life-form is unique in the sense that it allows the self to understand its own eternity. So the purpose of human life is to connect with the eternal self. If one is simply absorbed in the body and its demands, one is wasting this valuable opportunity - an opportunity that is only available in the human life-form. Eating, sleeping, mating and defending, the soul can do in any life-form, only in the human form can the self connect with eternity, ie. reality. Krishna says: Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. (Bg 2.12) As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. (Bg 2.13)  ",

            "answer_text": "This is basically a question about Enlightenment. Let us first try to define Enlightenment as clearly and precisely as possible. There is a very wide spread belief among the spiritual aspirants that Enlightenment is some kind of a grand \u201cExperience\u201d accompanied fantastic fireworks. According to Advaita Vedanta, Enlightenment is Knowledge and Wisdom. This definition is extremely simple and straight forward. It has nothing whatsoever to do with \u201cexperiences\u201d, however lofty these \u201cexperiences\u201d may be. All experiences happen in duality and they come and go and therefore, are not ultimate proof of anything. An experience may surely bring about an insight culminating in knowledge and wisdom. This knowledge and wisdom brings about the deepest possible conviction about the TRUTH, that is far more stable than any \u201cexperience\u201d. Gaining this deepest possible conviction about TRUTH is what \u201csearching for TRUTH\u201d is all about. Now we have laid the proper foundation. Let us discuss some details. Color is a sensation and not a substance. This means that color is just brain\u2019s reaction to certain wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Color is not \u201cout there\u201d as an objective reality in its own right, but it is only an illusion in the brain. The brain is painting the universe. Each brain paints its own universe. Sound is again brain\u2019s reaction to vibration in the air. There is no sound \u201cout there\u201d as an objective reality in its own right. Similarly the other three sensations. So the visible universe as it is perceived by the brain has nothing whatsoever to do with any objective reality that exists independently in its own right. When we look at the universe, through our brains, we cannot help inferring and intuiting that this mighty big universe must be driven by some inscrutable NATURAL LAW. This NATURAL LAW is ensuring the smooth well balanced running of the universe. We cannot SEE or TOUCH this NATURAL LAW but we are totally convinced that IT IS THERE. We can also infer and intuit that this NATURAL LAW must be the ultimate embodiment of INTELLIGENCE. INTELLIGENCE and ALIVENESS are synonyms. All events in the universe happen at the sub-atomic level. What we SEE is what the brain shows us as the effect of furious sub-atomic activity. If an artist does a beautiful painting, it is actually sub-atomic activity that has done the painting. If a sportsman does great in sport, it is sub-atomic activity that has done the great sport. If Albert Einstein showed great intelligence, it is actually the sub-atomic activity that showed great intelligence. So we can clearly infer and intuit that COSMIC INTELLIGENCE is at its highest in the sub-atomic domain. There is truly no artist or sportsman or Albert Einstein, but just furious sub-atomic activity that is going on all the time and creating this awesome universe. The next level down from the sub-atomic level is the cellular domain. Again we see great intelligence in the cellular domain. As we go further and further down the level from the sub-atomic we infer and intuit that the level of intelligence is decreasing. So what is human intelligence when compared to the sub-atomic and cellular intelligence? In Sanatana Dharma, the creator and creation are not two but ONE. According to Albert Einstein\u2019s famous equation E = m * c * c, the substratum of this visible universe is pure energy. So the creator and creation are this PRIMORDIAL PURE ENERGY imbued with great INTELLIGENCE. It is this GREAT INTELLIGENCE that is actually doing everything via sub-atomic activity and there are truly no \u201cyous\u201d or \u201cmes\u201d. Quantum physicists have discovered that the sub-atomic particle is not a particle at all but just a wave that is flickering in and out. That means that this universe is flickering in and out. Since we have seen that there are no people or autonomous entities, it is the COSMIC INTELLIGENCE that is actually seeing this universe and is also the \u201cdoer\u201d as well as the \u201cexperiencer\u201d of everything. In other words COSMIC INTELLIGENCE is all THERE IS. This universe is just a perception in CONSCIOUSNESS and not an objective reality that exists independently in its own right. SEEING this TRUTH and having the deepest possible conviction about it is what is called as ENLIGHTENMENT. When this ENLIGHTENMENT is embodied over time, it becomes very stable and the apparent individual becomes a MAHATMA. According to Advaita Vedanta: CONSCIOUSNESS (COSMIC INTELLIGENCE) is all THERE IS, infinite and eternal. Infinite does not mean extended in space, but beyond space, always HERE. Eternal does not mean extended in time, but beyond time, always NOW. Space and time are just concepts and not existential realities. CONSCIOUSNESS is incomprehensible, but unmistakably REAL. Perception of this universe is a direct proof of CONSCIOUSNESS and not of the universe. Lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu. Om Shantih Shantih Shantih! ",
