            "answer_text": "A sound wave is not a shock wave at any point. A shock wave is a displacement traveling through a medium at a speed faster than the speed of sound in the medium. In solids it is a destructive wave causing breakage of the material. In air the medium compresses at the wave front such that if it impinges on a solid it may cause damage to the solid material. An example you may be familiar with is the shock cones formed in a glass window pane after being struck by a BB from an air rifle. Normally, you can tap on a window sending sound waves through it, but when hit hard at a small point a shock wave moves through the glass fracturing it. A cone of glass falls out of the fracture. Air cannot fracture, but the nature of the shock wave is similar. Unlike a sound wave that has a smoothly rising pressure front, the shock wave front is a step with a sudden pressure rise. There is a great explanation in detail written on Quora by David Kahana, October 10, 2014. ",

            "answer_text": "It is indeed all just on an analog continuum. What's considered a \u201cshock wave\u201d is largely subjective to whatever's being impacted. Keep in mind, sound is simply vibrations transmitted through matter. Some materials (like water) transmit vibrations better than others, and some objects (like tuning forks) will amplify certain vibration frequencies due to shape/material/etc. Some objects (like the infamous Tacoma Narrows Bridge) will be sensitive to damage from specific vibration frequencies, even though the cars driving over said bridge generally suffered no direct effect from the same vibrations.

BIG time We see this in our atmosphere as sonic booms, effects of lightning naturally, or from our tools. Even a bullwhip can do this. In our sun we observe the effects in plasma as ripples of increased fusion, magnetism, and generally very high energy events as things try to flee, but cannot. If you want to get terribly anthropcentric you could look at panic situations in battles or sports arenas Effect > results of effect = shockwave.

            "answer_text": "This is a shock wave. It happens when a wave propagates through a fluid (like air or water) at above the speed of sound in that fluid. The changes in pressure are nearly instantaneous.  This is a sound wave. It propagates at the speed of sound in the fluid, and the pressure variations are smooth and regular, like the familiar waveform below.  The difference between the two, therefore, is not about the frequency (the tone) or the amplitude (the intensity) of the wave. Rather it is completely related to the speed of the wave, and in practical terms, the speed of the original disturbance that produced the wave in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the material density. But usually it\u2019s 170\u2013190 decibels in the air. This is basically the maximum capacity of air to send sound. After that sounds turns into basically an explosion. In water I believe the maximum is 220 or 240 decibels which is how submarines can afford extremely loud sonars without causing any shock wave. So it\u2019s all about the material ability to have sound waves going through it. ",

            "answer_text": "The definition of the phrase seems to suggest that the medium through which the sound is traveling must experience a rapid compression. I would speculate that's related to the decibel level at which the waves become \u201csquare\u201d and this occurs when the peak and trough cap at a certain amplitude. The wave takes on a linear horizontal progression for a time, then resumes its interim cycle. This has the effect, with speaker technology, of creating an actual impact as those \u201cwalls\u201d of energy surge (usually giving that iconic sub-woofer BOOOOM with a pile of static - horribly bad for the speaker, and your ears).

Since each new sound vibration is made ahead of the last one, because the sound maker a supersonic jet for example) is faster than the sound it is making, the sound vibrations overlap, creating the shock wave. Since the wave maker (jet) is moving faster than sound, the overlapping points in the sound waves move rapidly also. ",
