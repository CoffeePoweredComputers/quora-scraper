            "answer_text": "Which delta so you mean? Upper case delta [math]\\Delta[/math] means change between two states. For example [math]\\Delta T[/math] is the change between the initial and the final temperature of a system that has undergone some process that increased or decreased it's thermal energy. If I measure the amount of time the process took [math]\\Delta t[/math], I can calculate the average rate of change of temperature [math]\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta t}[/math] Lower case delta [math]\\delta[/math] is used to mean the infinitesimal change in whatever variable, say, temperature over a very small time (or other domain change). For that same process from paragraph 1, the temperature may have changed quickly at some points and more slowly at other times. The value [math]\\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta t}[/math] is the infinitesimal change in temperature T as a function of time t. It is the slope of the curve at any point along it. It is the tangent. ",

            "answer_text": "An infinitesimal value. The smallest value possible is symbolized by Delta. It is necessary in Maths Calculations like differential calculus. Delta is a way to bridge the gap between the natural world and the human mind. Humans cannot easily comprehend, let alone calculate the concepts like infinity and infinitesimals. So, using symbols is sometimes easy. ",
