            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not a piezoelectric cell - It\u2019s a piezoelectric buzzer/diaphragm/speaker/surface acoustic transducer. For example: CEB-27D44 CUI Inc. | Audio Products | DigiKey The following image somewhat shows the cross-section of the device:  The transducer has the following nominal layers: Silver electroplated/vapor deposited electrodePiezoelectric material; something like Navy type II/5H; some solid solution of Lead zirconate and lead titanate.Conductive adhesive or edge bonding.A frequency/\u201dmode shaper\u201d backing plate. If made of metal, most common, it can be used as the other electrode.There are other ways to attach electrodes and you can also have multiple stacks of dissimilar/similar PZT materials.To use this, you attach it to a plate or membrane or flexural substrate that is coupled to the maximum volume of air. The goal of your AC excitation signal is to generate resonances in the diaphragm+backing plate+substrate \u2018system\u2019. When you hit the resonance frequencies you generate a tone in the coupled air volume because the transducer excites the substrate frequencies. If your substrate is frequency mismatched with the transducer - for example if it is too thick or stiff, your tone will be minimal. The loudness will be proportional to excitation amplitude, you can design acoustic cavities with broadband response to amplify the excitation etc.  A piezoelectric \u2018cell\u2019 is more commonly used to describe \u2018load cells\u2019.
