            "answer_text": "They\u2019re usually considered to be part of the d-block. Mendeleev showed La as being under Y in the 5th (1891) edition of his book The Principles of Chemistry, and since that time nobody has been able to come up with good enough reason for relocating it. It helps that each block starts with the appearance of the applicable electron. So the s-block starts with H; the p-block starts with B; the d-block starts with Sc; and the f-block starts with Ce. That is about the simplest rubric I can think of that produces consistent results i.e., \"The best education is found in gaining the utmost information from the simplest apparatus\". (Whitehead AN 1929, The aims of education and other essays, The Free Press, New York, p. 37). A few people show La in the f-block since the picture with the diagonal lines says that La should have an outer electron configuration of 4f^1. This picture goes by different names including the n + l rule, the Madelung rule, and the aufbau approximation. However, in 20 cases, the picture (from Aufbau principle - Wikipedia) predicts an electron configuration that differs from that determined experimentally. These exceptions could be viewed as turbulence along a flight path; once passed the flight path returns to normal.  La in fact has an outer electron configuration of 5d^1. It is not until the next element, Ce (4f^1), that the first f electron appears. The ionic radius, and hence the chemical behaviour of the lanthanide ions proper, including Lu, is impacted by the presence of f electrons. We know this because the lanthanide contraction runs from Ce^3+, with the configuration [Xe]4f^1, to Lu^3+, with [Xe]4f^14. This is not the case for lanthanum. Hence the f-block is generally taken to start at Ce, rather than La. Among the actinides, an f-electron does not appear until Pa, which is [Rn]5f^2 6d^2 7s^2. The previous element, Th, is [Rn]6d^2 7s^2. However the 5f orbitals demonstrably contribute in metallic thorium (being hybridised with the 6d and 7s levels), and the electron configuration of the Th^3+ ion is [Rn]5f^1, thereby showing that the 5f orbitals are low-lying and available for chemistry. Hence Ce and its heavier congener Th can be said to mark the start of f-block chemistry. ",

(There are a couple more.)Now, we'd expect (Xe) 6s2 4f1. But whats found is there is no 4f electron, but it does have a 5d electron. So this shows how 4f and 5d subshells have similar energies, and electrons change from one subshell to another pretty easily.  You will soon find there are a significant number of these exceptions. In general you just need to understand that these exceptions are a result from similar energies of various subshells. ",
