            "answer_text": "Yes, in systems whose energy spectrum has an upper bound (and the dimension of the space of states is finite, i.e. there cannot be an infinite number of states stacked close to each other at the upper bound or anywhere in the spectrum), this can happen. We have found that the inverse temperature  appears to be a more fundamental quantity than the temperature  (on the thermodynamic scale). So when you heat up a system from the coldest possible state: the temperature starts at 0 (or slightly above 0) and goes up, while the inverse temperature starts out as infinite (or just really really high) and goes down. In this coldest state, the only accessible state is the system\u2019s ground state (or more realistically, in almost the coldest state, the ground state is much more probable than higher states). Then as you go through positive temperatures, the inverse temperature has positive and finite values as well; the ground state is still the most likely, but the excited states have non-zero probability as well, and they increase. The probability of a given state is  where  is the Boltzmann constant,  is the temperature and  is the energy of the state. Now as you increase the temperature to infinity, the inverse temperature gets close to zero and the probabilities of different energy states get closer to each other, until at infinite temperature and  all the states have exactly the same probabilities. Then as you reduce the inverse temperature even further, the temperature sort of \u201cjumps\u201d from positive infinity to negative infinity (like I said, the inverse temperature seems to be more fundamental) and you get into the region of negative temperatures. Now this is actually very similar to positive temperature, but the microscopic behavior is inverted with respect to energy - this time the more energetic states are more likely than the lower energy states. The same formula as given above still applies, but you have to keep in mind that this time the  is negative. And if you go even further, you approach absolute zero again, this time from the other side - from the negative side. Now the situation is again very similar to the one before - except this time, the only state with considerable probability is the one with the highest energy. This is what the concept of negative temperature means. It can only be achieved in some systems - we are used to dealing with gases, liquids which can evaporate, solids which can melt, and these all don\u2019t have upper bounds for energy. But the behavior is very similar to that of positive temperature, except with inverted energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Agreeing with the other answer, temperature is the measurement of the vibration of the fundamental particles of matter. The more excited the particles are, the more they tend to vibrate. Larger vibrations, or excitement, are associated with higher temperatures. Every temperature scale uses a reference point and then other temperatures are graded relative to this reference, thus developing the scale. The Celsius scale uses the freezing point of water as 0 and the boiling point of water as 100 (at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure). Thus a scale is developed and all the other temperatures are recorded relative to this reference. Similarly, the Kelvin scale too uses a reference according to which other temperatures are recorded. What's this reference? It's the absolute zero, or the point at which the vibration of fundamental particles becomes zero. In other words, as per classical thermodynamics, it's the point at which all the thermodynamic activities cease to occur and the fundamental particles are in a perfect state of rest. The absolute zero is taken as zero on the Kelvin scale. As absolute zero is the point below which cooling is not possible, there is no negative on the Kelvin scale. Also, the temperature difference associated with one unit of temperature rise on Kelvin scale, i.e. 1 kelvin is equal to that on the Celsius scale. Hope this helps. Note: This answer is from a layman's perspective. ",
