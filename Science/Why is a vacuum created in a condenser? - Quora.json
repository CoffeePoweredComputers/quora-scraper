            "answer_text": "Vacuum is not created in a condenser. The lowest pressure achievable is the vapour pressure corresponding to the (saturation) temperature of condensing steam(nearly equal to that of cooling water) plus the pressure of residual air (the condensate is not completely de-aerated), commonly referred to as vacuum pressure(as feet of water/millibars below atmospheric).

            "answer_text": "The steam pressure in the last stage of the steam turbine is very low after performing the work. To make the steam flow to the condenser to convert into condensate(liquid/water) it is necessary that the pressure be much lower in the condenser to make the steam flow to the condenser.Therefore, vacuum is maintained in the condenser using either vacuum pump or steam ejector.
