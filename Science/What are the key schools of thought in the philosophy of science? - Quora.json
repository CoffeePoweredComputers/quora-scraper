            "answer_text": "Science isn't a philosophy, it's an epistemological tool. Certain philosophies associated with science-oriented persons are:Materialism, the idea that nothing exists that is not matterEmpiricism, the idea that all knowledge is derived from sense-experienceSkepticism, the idea that all truth claims must be subjected to scrutiny; or the idea that certain knowledge is impossiblePhysical Reductionism, the idea that all things are reducible to physicsDeterminism, the idea that your actions, feelings, and thoughts are predetermined by external conditions i.e. the laws of physics, genetics, and cultural normsRationalism, the idea that opinions and actions should be based on reason and knowledge rather than on religious belief or emotional responseScientism, the idea that the scientific method and approach is universally applicable The concept of evidence is central to both epistemology and the philosophy of science. Of course, \u2018evidence\u2019 is hardly a philosopher's term of art: it is not only, or even primarily, philosophers who routinely speak of evidence, but also lawyers and judges, historians and scientists, investigative journalists and reporters, as well as the members of numerous other professions and ordinary folk in the course of everyday life. The concept of evidence would thus seem to be on firmer pre-theoretical ground than various other concepts which enjoy similarly central standing within philosophy. (Contrast, for example, the epistemologist's quasi-technical term \u2018epistemic justification\u2019.) ",
