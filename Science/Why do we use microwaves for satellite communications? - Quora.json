            "answer_text": "Microwaves and radio waves are used to communicate with satellites. Microwaves pass straight through the atmosphere and are suitable for communicating with distant geostationary satellites, while radio waves are suitable for communicating with satellites in low orbit. Radio waves and microwaves Radio waves and microwaves are types of electromagnetic radiation. Both have communication uses. Radio waves are used to transmit television and radio programmes, while microwaves are used for mobile phones and Wi-Fi. However, they have different properties: Radio waves have longer wavelengths and are reflected by the ionosphere(part of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere).Microwaves have shorter wavelengths and pass through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Radio waves are reflected by the ionosphere, but microwaves pass straight through it Effects of frequency The way that electromagnetic waves behave in the atmosphere depends on their frequency. The table below summarises this.  Different frequencies are used to communicate with these satellites: relatively high frequencies are used to communicate with geostationary satellitesrelatively low frequencies are used to communicate with low orbit satellitesMicrowaves have a high enough frequency to pass through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to reach geostationary satellites - which orbit high above the equator at a height of 36,000 km. However, radio waves with a lower frequency are able to reach the low orbit satellites. Digital signals Digital signals are used to communicate with satellites. Digital signals are affected by noise less than analogue signals, and they do not attenuate (lose energy) as quickly. Information from Earth is transmitted to geostationary satellites using microwaves carrying digital signals. These signals are then retransmitted as microwaves. This may be to another satellite, or back down to Earth. Satellite television dishes are examples of the sort of parabolic receivers needed.  Microwaves are used to communicate with geostationary satellites Communications dishes \u2013 Higher tier The wavelength of the microwaves emitted by satellites is usually between 1 and 10 cm. The dishes that emit them from satellites usually have a diameter much larger than this. This produces very little diffraction, giving a narrow beam that does not spread out. As a result, the transmitting and receiving dishes must be aligned exactly. You can see this by looking at a row of houses which have been fitted with satellite television dishes - all the dishes point in the same direction.  Satellite dishes must be very carefully aligned ",

            "answer_text": "Frequency of microwave bands extends from about one gigahertz to three hundred gigahertz. This large frequency bandwidth can carry huge information through different band. Velocity = wavelength x frequencyFrom the relation we get they have short wavelength. Due to enough short wavelength, they less capable of bypassing the obstacles of dense media like walls, hills etc . But it is a matter of think that microwave propagate through less dense media like atmosphere, free space in satellite communication. Large frequency signal can convey large power and less attenuated. This leads to an essential property of microwaves is that they travel in straight lines through the atmosphere (like a torch light), are not affected by the ionized layers. So they can travel long distance. Also these waves are very less affected by temperature inversions and scattering. But these weather effects limit the distance between the transmitter and the receiver to a few miles. This problem is overcome by usage of repeater stations placed along the propagation path. As they do not rapidly disperse in the atmosphere (less attenuation) so the power does not need to be very high to reach a distant point. Because of penetration and traveling property, main mode of propagation in the microwave range is line of sight. Line of sight means that the transmitter and receiver need to see each other. That is the prime destination of satellite communication. Generation of microwave is not complicated. Simple devices like magnetron can be used. Using metal reflector antennas, they can be easily directed from earth to satellite and vice-versa. Various modulation techniques are available for microwave. So possibility of interference among data is very low. Due to large frequency bandwidth, a huge number of variable services are available without blocking. ",
