            "answer_text": "All these people who write good things about the college are just for the sake of views and upvotes. I'll tell you the sad reality: It is a very small campus which does not even have a total area of 100 acres when compared to other NITs.It does not provide hostel for all the students because of the lack of hostel buildings. Only 25% of the total students recide in the hostels. The other take private rooms outside.It does not have separate buildings for different branches. All the branches are in one block.It has only one VEGAN canteen which remains open from 10AM to 6PM.As there are no hostels,there will be dayscholars. So we are allowed to use motorcycles in the campus which is an advantage.Only 5 of the 12 branches get filled totally. There are mostly vacant seats in other branches. My class itself has a strength of 57 of the total 92 possible intake.Only 2 grounds in the whole campus.No proper gym.There is a railway station nearby which is a disturbance.I guess these are enough for you to know about it. And in the near future the campus may shift to Naya Raipur. Moreover the AIIMS college building could not be taken by NIT Raipur because of it's inability. ",

An exclusive railway station (though local) at the back.  4. Highest intake among all NITs (954 in undergraduate program in my time) 5. AIIMS at less than 1 Km of distance.  6. GLITZ Cinemas at 200 m distance.  7. Most number of under-graduate streams. Total 12 Including latest streams like Bio medical Engineering and Biotechnology which are rarely found elsewhere.   8. In operation from 1956 (earlier called GEC), hence a large alumni base. There are some problems as well. Two of the major problems are : 1. Insufficient infrastructure (mind that its insufficient not poor) 2. Lack of experienced human resource at teaching level. Its not like there are no one, but there is a shortage. This is a prime issue under VISION 2020 of the institute  and the higher authorities are continuously involved to resort it out. (http://www.nitrr.ac.in/downloads/vision_2020.pdf )  NIT Raipur is uprising at a good pace. In last one year, I have seen tremendous developments. There is a fire within everyone, students and faculties (though there are some bottlenecks), to take this institute to even higher levels  ",

Number of seats in hostels are less to occupy all the students and that's why they are building new ones. Medical facilities are average and sports facilities are at basic level. With the long journey (close to 60 years) it's able to produce some of the best faculties. Placements are comparable to any other NITs (not the top 3). Hostel rooms are good enough to live and mess food isn't that bad either. Overall you'll have a feeling that you're studying in an average NIT campus. But yes one point to mention here, you'll not have to study much to score 7 on 10 here. The profs are really chilled out and helps a lot if you mess up any exam(even end term) ",
