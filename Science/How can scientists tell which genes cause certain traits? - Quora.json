            "answer_text": "The first step is determining association by studying heredity i.e. show that a trait has the inheritance pattern you\u2019d associate with one or more genes (and environmental factors). This only shows you that a gene may be responsible; it gives you no information as to which gene. You can, at this stage, assign a name to the gene which might make you feel you\u2019ve \u201cidentified it\u201d but you haven\u2019t really. Next step is to look for genetic differences associated with the trait - a tedious process of gene sequencing and comparison. You can get some idea of what to look for as a short cut if you know of a difference in proteins associated with the condition - for example, sickle cell disease - as this gives you a specific gene sequence to target with your sequencing/probes.
