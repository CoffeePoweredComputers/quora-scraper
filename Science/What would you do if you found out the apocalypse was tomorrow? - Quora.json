            "answer_text": "Now there\u2019s no specification on what kind of apocalypse, so we\u2019ll go on the top five from most likely to least likely. Nuclear WarClimate Catastrophe (Geostorm perhaps)Volcanic Eruption (Yellowstone Caldera)Zombie ApocalypseAsteroid Impact1: This is what I consider to be most likely, especially considering President Trump and his constant provoking of powerful and/or unpredictable adversaries like Kim Jong Un. If this were to happen tomorrow, I\u2019d be screwed in so many ways. I\u2019d try to survive and get to a bunker, but I\u2019d likely be atomized by a missile striking a few hundred miles from my location. 2: Not as likely, but still well within the realm of possibility given the state of our climate and its potential future. Not to mention humans may yet aspire to control the weather, considering our past and present attempts at cloud seeding. This is something that\u2019d kill me very quickly. Not an instant death by any means, but still devastating and next to impossible to escape. 3: This is quite unlikely, but not impossible. Though the caldera has shown no noticeable instability, it is likely dormant, waiting for just the right moment to start its engines. If it were to explode tomorrow, I\u2019d likely survive the initial explosion, but if not prepared enough, I\u2019d end up like the citizens of Pompeii. 4: Now we\u2019re really getting into the improbable. It would take a chain of out-of-control mutations of any number of candidate pathogens to get the perfect zombie infection, and even then, it\u2019s highly unlikely to happen out in the wild. If it is at all probable, it\u2019d happen in a laboratory and somehow break out, like 28 Days Later. 5: Okay, this one likely will never happen in the lifetime of the human race, but if it were to happen tomorrow, humans as a species would likely either be wiped off the face of the planet or reduced to small groups. As for me, I\u2019d be dead, no questions asked. Again, like the caldera, if not dead immediately, I would be later. ",
