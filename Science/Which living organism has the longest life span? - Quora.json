            "answer_text": "There are Actinobacteria found in Siberian permafrost estimated to be half a million years old. There are also endoliths living in a zombie-like state metabolizing so slowly their generation time is 10,000 years, in ocean floor sediment 100 million years old which suggest they may be around that age. But that\u2019s much less certain, so I\u2019ll just talk about the Actinobacteria below.  Scanning electron micrograph of Actinobacteria (not the Siberian Ancients though) What\u2019s particularly interesting about the Actinobacteria specimens Johnson et al (2007) found is that they didn\u2019t lie dormant all that time in permafrost, because true dormancy (i.e. metabolic inactivity, including lack of DNA repair) means genomes will necessarily degrade with time due to spontaneous chemical reactions like hydrolysis and oxidation that finally become fatal, preventing the cell from germinating; even under optimal frozen conditions unrepaired genomic DNA will degrade irreparably within at most 100,000 to 1 million years. Instead the Actinobacteria sustained low-level metabolic activity with genomic DNA repair. How\u2019d they tell the difference? By assessing relative levels of DNA damage, in particular the hydrolytic deamination of cytosine which generates uracil or its analogs. Johnson et al ID\u2019ed metabolically active cells by treating aliquots of the DNA extracts with uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) before amplifying the 4-kb rDNA bacterial fragments. UNG breaks the base-ribose bond in uracil (the product of cytosine deamination) and allows only undamaged DNA to be amplified:  Active in vivo systems can repair this damage. In dead or dormant cells however, uracil residues will be expected to accumulate over time. Now Johnson et al took samples of various ages containing mixtures of low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, which are known to be able to form dormant endospores, and high-GC Gram-positive Actinobacteria, which don\u2019t. No bacteria capable of dormancy were found in the half-million-year age range; the samples were dominated by our friend Actinobacteria:  ",

            "answer_text": "When we move through big timescales, the concept of \u201cspecies\u201d gets fuzzy. Take, for example, crocodiles: they haven\u2019t changed much in the last hundred million years or so, yet even today there are different species, and these are different from the species there were 10, 20 or 50 million years ago. So I think your question might rather be \u201cwhat lineage of living beings has been relatively phenotypically unchanged for the longest time?\u201d Or, in layman terms, what group os species have the longest time span between their latest descendant and their first ancestor that looked pretty much like it. My answer to that would be sponges. There are Glass sponge (a modern class of sponges) fossils dating back to the Cambrian (~540 million years ago). But if we don\u2019t rely on the fossil record, Imd vote for Trichoplax, they are so primitive that they can\u2019t have changed much since the beginning of multicellular life, though no fossils of them are known.
