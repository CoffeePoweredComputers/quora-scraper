            "answer_text": "Was Albert Einstein a philosopher? In a sense any thinking person is some kind of philosopher but usually not a good one. Einstein certainly philosophized on subjects outside of science which he put in a book called \u2018The World As I See It\u2019 in which he sets out his humanitarian perspective on the state of the world & how we must live peacefully together as one not as this religion or that nation being superior to any other. Essentially he was a Humanist. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes he can. He wrote philosophically about his pacifism and was certainly interested in taking up the deeper questions that sit at the edge of modern physics. One could further make the argument as well that on one level physics is philosophy as it comes from the discipline of natural philosophy. Thales was the first physicist/philosopher. Early philosophical questions led directly to physics as they dealt with the critical question - What is the nature of matter? ",
