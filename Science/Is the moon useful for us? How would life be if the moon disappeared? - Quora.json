            "answer_text": "From https://www.insidescience.org/content/what-would-happen-if-there-were-no-moon/3446 If we have no moon?  Nights would be much, much darker. The next brightest object in the night sky is Venus \u2013 but it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to light up the sky \u2013 a full moon is nearly two thousand times brighter than Venus is at its brightest. Without the moon, a day on earth would only last six to twelve hours. There could be more than a thousand days in one year! That\u2019s because the earth\u2019s rotation slows down over time thanks to the gravitational force \u2013 or pull of the moon \u2013 and without it, days would go by in a blink. A moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides \u2013 making them about one-third as high as they are now.   Without a moon the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons. So,it looks it is useful. Edit:The third argument is wrong.\u0130t would be lower than usual.Sorry for wrong informaton. ",

            "answer_text": "Lunar tides probably sped the process of life on its way. They (and waves) sloshed water over lava, cooling it and mixing up some of the chemicals of life. With sufficient time life began. Had there been no Moon perhaps life would have taken much longer to begin. The Moon\u2019s mass somewhat keeps the axis of Earth remaining close to a 23-degree tilt (which causes the seasons). If the Moon were gone the tilt might move more with profound effects on atmosphere, weather and life. Many living creatures depend on the tides and the light of the Moon for the laying of eggs (sea turtles) or navigation (birds). So, yes, the Moon is important: it even provides the lunar month (a word that comes from the word Moon) used by many cultures that lack modern calendars (as well as by many modern societies that do have them).
