            "answer_text": "Roughly, the Earth emits about the same amount of energy as it receives from the Sun, orbital momentum of the Moon, and radioactive decay. The incoming energy from the Sun is largely at too high a frequency to be considered heat but the energy leaving the Earth is almost all in the infra-red range, heading for the cold of outer space. I wish we had satellites set up to measure the real time albedo of our planet and also the amount of heat leaving the planet. Then we could talk sensibly about whether the plant is warming or not. The spot measurements we make and argue about really don\u2019t give us enough information. ",

            "answer_text": "Essentially, yes. The Earth radiates its heat into space as infrared energy. It also reflects away much of the incoming light from the Sun, which would cause heating if it were absorbed. The globe on the left shows the infrared light being radiated away, whereas the globe on the right shows the visible light being reflected away from the same regions.  ",
