All we know as \u201creality\u201d is what we managed to perceive as such with our senses. So what is real and what is illusion, from this point of view are dangerously close to one another\u2026 Personally, I never touch reality\u2026 I difind it waters down the hallucinations. Lol Lemme explain. Some time ago, people asked why my music does not tell about the better world, and well while some songs I like do, the vast and overwhelming majority don't, they only tell of ruin, destruction, suffering, hate and its consequences. Why? I haven't seen the better world yet, so I don't have anything solid to say in a song about it. Currently it's just an illusion, a hallucination, yet I believe we can do a great deal better than this so there. \ud83d\ude01 Cheers Or another way to put it simple and plain (given you know my language)  ",

Full reality can only be seen when many people/cultures contribute to the conversation like light hitting a prism and we learn to listen to and respect our perspectives as pointing to something greater than ourselves.
