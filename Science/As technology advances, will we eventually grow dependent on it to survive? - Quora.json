            "answer_text": "Yes, but that problem began long ago. The moment society formed and people began specializing their skills away from hunting and gathering, we became dependent on others for survival \u2014 at least a thousand years ago. Today the fraction of humans on this planet who can feed themselves and survive a year without shelter is small, maybe 10%? The extension of this question is, \u201cIs our dependence on tech growing greater day-to-day even now \u2014 is the current generation even less likely to survive without it than our parents?\u201d Yes, I think so. Fewer people today know how to learn or perform simple tasks without the internet than did the generation before. With the rise of the \u2018Net, we\u2019re losing the ability to communicate with each other directly and learn by interacting with others. And of course, we\u2019re ever more dependent on external resources and services. How many people don\u2019t know how to prepare a simple meal today from scratch ingredients? Or how to make or repair an essential tool used daily (clothes, appliances, car, or house)? Every time our routine is disrupted (heavy snowfall, power outage, flood, hurricane, etc), due to our increasing dependency on tech (and internet), people are likely to have their lives affected more than ever, since they know less than ever how to adapt to sudden change \u2014 something that was commonplace back when humans lived off the land and routinely went without food for days.

            "answer_text": "I think we have already grown dependent on technology for our survival. If for instance the Earth was struck by huge solar flare. Power and Communications would be almost instantly non-existent, newer machines controlled by computer would not run. Going forward in time with no power we would have no water, no sewer, food reserves will last only a few days. A desperate population would take desperate measures against their fellow human beings. This period will not last very long for the above reasons. Life as we know it would come to an end and most of the human race would be wiped out, except for small pockets here and there. This is just one brief explanation of one event there are others that could cause the same outcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Remember in the day when the pocket calculator was invented? At first, while it was novel, you would add / subtract / multiply / divide using the calculator, but you would always run the numbers by hand to make sure the calculator\u2019s result was correct. Over time, you accepted the calculator\u2019s result without checking; next, when you did a math problem by yourself, you checked your work using the calculator. Now, sadly to say, some people are unable to do math in their heads without a calculator. If it wasn\u2019t for the calculation for the amount of change you should receive after a cash transaction, the cashiers wouldn\u2019t know how much to return to you. So the process you fear, is already happening. It will only get worse. ",
