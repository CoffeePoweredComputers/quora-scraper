            "answer_text": "As far as I see, no one has bothered to answer your question yet. And who cares if you are just trying to answer your homework. And maybe you have an answer and you are just doing a reality check or maybe you are making up your own questions\u2026I don\u2019t care and I can give you at least one answer. Here we go. Ethanol is CH3-CH2-OH. Butanone is CH3C(=O)CH2CH3. It has twice as many carbons as ethanol but half as many oxygens. So, an approach is that half of butanone will come from one ethanol and half from a second ethanol. So, we just need to modify the ethanols so they can be put together. Doing this in a retro-synthetic way, butanone could be made from butanol by oxidation (lots of ways, maybe just use dichromate). CH3C(=O)-CH2-CH3 \u2190 CH3CH(OH)CH2 Butanol can be made from acetaldehyde and an ethyl grignard reagent. CH3CH(OH)CH2 \u2190 C H3CHO + CH3CH2-MgBr Acetaldehyde is made from ethanol by oxidation (again, use dichromate) CH3-CHO \u2190 CH3-CH2-OH. Ethyl grignard would come from ethyl bromide which would come from ethanol (e.g. treat ethanol with PBr3). Lots of other ways. If this is a homework problem, come up with another approach using the same strategy\u2026retrosynthetic analysis. ",

I mean, I can imagine a series of reactions that would do it, but you\u2019re talking about forming carbon-carbon bonds (typically those are not trivial reactions) to produce a compound that is sold by the gallon as a kind of generic solvent or paint thinner.
