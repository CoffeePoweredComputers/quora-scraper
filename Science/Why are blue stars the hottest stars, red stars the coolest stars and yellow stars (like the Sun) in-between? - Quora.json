            "answer_text": "If you look at the coils in an oven as it heats up, you might notice that when you first see them, they are a cherry red. They are approximately 1000K at that time. As they get hotter, you will notice they become reddish orange. If your oven gets hot enough, you might see them become bright orange. At that point they are between 1500 and 2000K. If you have a kiln you could get a high enough temperature to see yellowish orange. Caution: a kiln can be very bright to look into and an eye hazard. If you still have an old incandescent light bulb and a dimmer, try setting it to very dim. Depending on the dimmer, you might get orange or yellowish orange. As you turn up the dimmer, the filament gets hotter. It will become a bright yellow. It is still only about 2500K. Turn the dimmer all the way up. It seems to get white hot. Depending on the wattage of the bulb it may top out at 2700 to 3200 degrees Kelvin. (It is more correct to say \u201cKelvins\u201d but the public finds that strange. I usually say \u201cthirty-two hundred Kelvin.\u201d) Beyond that, the tungsten rapidly evaporates and is not much good. Even tungsten halogen does not get much hotter. Most people don't have access to a sulfur plasma lamp, but most people have seen photographic speedlights or flashguns. These are only on for less than a millisecond but they reach well over 6000K. Notice how they give off a brilliant blue-white flash. As the gas gets hotter, say 10,000K, our eyes don't see much difference in color. This is because our eyes can't really see much beyond blue. We see pure violet as purplish due to a quirk in the human cones, but apart from that, bluish white is the color our eyes interpret from the hottest incandescent objects, like stars. By the way, our Sun is white. When it is higher in the sky than 20 degrees above the horizon, it appears white. Between 20 and 5 degrees it gradually becomes yellowish, and below 5 degrees it becomes very yellow, orange and even red right on the horizon if you are on flat land at sea level. This is due to the amount of shorter wavelength removed by Rayleigh scatter. The coolest stars that you can see are reddish (I am ignoring brown dwarfs) and hotter stars are yellowish, white and finally bluish-white. Personally, I classify them by their apparent temperature, but astronomers have a legacy spectral classification, again ignoring the very cool infrared stars O, B, A, F, G, K, M \u2026 These run from O (bluish white) down to M (reddish) and there are sub-classification to give finer temperature indications and what elements are above the photosphere absorbing spectral lines. For stars in the main sequence (young stars, mostly hydrogen) the more mass, the hotter the photosphere. The confusion comes in when you talk to artists and photographers. They will frequently associate blue with cool and reddish-orange with warm. I think blue is associated with cool due to ice and water. But that's not the way it works with incandescence. ",

            "answer_text": "Some illusions are so realistic that we mistake them for reality. After reading this answer I hope you will note how much of the notion about color of stars is myth and illusion. 1- Our Sun is not yellow. We see it as yellow, since we observe it from the surface of the Earth through a thick layer of atmosphere. If you observe the Sun from the space, like seen by satellites and astronauts, the Sun will be white not yellow. As the sunlight passes through atmosphere, the blue light scatters and is partially absorbed in the water contained in the atmosphere. The light reaching our eyes is deficient in blue and as such it appears to be yellow since yellow is the complementary color to blue. 2- Our Sun appears white from space but what does white really mean scientifically. White color is made up of all the EM radiation in the wavelength range of 0.4 to 0.7 microns (micrometers). If you look at any visible star in the sky from space they all have all the colors in their spectrum. In other words, all stars are white. 3- Physicists, these oddballs of science of which I try to be one, actually state and prove that all stars you see not only are not white but are actually black. Well the actual term they use is blackbody. Physics states that stars very closely resemble and act like blackbodies (which means they have an emissivity very close to one) meaning any light that hits a star will be fully absorbed. By contrast a white body has an emissivity close to zero and reflects all light. 4- But the stars also contain hot stuff (gases and plasma) that can be approximated as radiating with an effective temperature. And this finally brings us to that illusion and misnomer that you refer to in your question. Look at these spectra from blackbody radiation and the position of the spectral peak.  The body is radiating at all wavelengths but as the body gets hotter, the position of the peak of the curve shifts to lower wavelength (toward blue). This is referred to as Wien's displacement law. If when fitting the spectrum of radiation from a star to a blackbody, the spectrum resembles one of the curves above we say the star is that color. For example if the peak of the spectrum is around 700 nm (0.7 microns) it would look like the curve marked above as 4000K and we say this star is red. If the peak is around 520 nm and resembles the curve marked as 5000K, we say this is a yellow star. However, I emphasize all these stars will still look very much white to your eyes. These names come from a fitting parameter. That\u2019s all. 5- We can focus on our Sun because it is a very good representative of the other stars and we have studied it closely. There is a fundamental reason why the spectrum of our Sun resembles that of a blackbody at 5800 Kelvins. It is because the very outer surface of our Sun (called photosphere) where most of the visible radiation comes from has an average temperature in that range. But in no way this means that our Sun is at that temperature . In fact, the photosphere is only 100 kilometer thick compared to a radius of 700,000 kilometers for the Sun. The temperature of the Sun varies from 5000 to 15 million degrees Kelvin. Imagine someone asks you how much wealth you have and you say depending on which bank account you look at I have between 5,000 to 15,000,000 dollars and then focus on just the $5,000 and say so I am really poor. There are some old arguments made for focusing on photosphere. Here are some: One may say, the photosphere is where the energy comes from. Well that is not correct. All the energy of the Sun comes from the core which is 280,000 kilometers in diameter and contains 1/3 of the mass of the Sun. Solar core temperature varies from 10 to 15 million degrees and radiates all the way from radio waves to x-rays , gamma rays, and even neutrinos. We have really a very narrow focus when we focus on less than a millionth of the frequency bandwidth called visible band and only there Sun resembles a blackbody of 5800 K. One may say photosphere is very thin but it is important since it is the outermost layer of the Sun. Well that is not true either. The outer layer of the Sun is the corona which has the temperature reaching 2 million degrees. Corona extends 5 million kilometers into space almost 7 times bigger than the radius of the Sun. If you were travelling to the Sun with current technology, corona is where your journey will most likely end long before you get to the photosphere which is actually less severe. So coming back to the original statement, the fact that stars are called blue or red is mostly based on an illusion and incomplete science dating back to the time of Max Plank. Now we know so much more about the structure of the stars and how they work. ",
