            "answer_text": "Apart from Abhijeet's answer, other answers here have put more focus on post Red Giant stage. I will try to explain what exactly happens during the red giant phase. Let's go through some concepts before proceeding to actual answer. Star, such as the Sun, was a huge cloud of Hydrogen and Helium at one stage.As the gas starts compressing, its temperature increases. We know that when the gas is heated up, its pressure increases.This thermal and radiation pressure causes the gas to expand, i.e. move away from the center, but gravity stops its expansion.Temperature increases and the fusion starts at very high temperatures and pressures.Fusion occurs only at the core area, because  there's a subsequent drop in temperatures and pressures as we move outwards.The core being hotter does not rise up to colder outer layers and the outer hydrogen does not circulate back to replenish the core.Now, what does it mean \"Star approaches its death\" ? :  The hydrogen in the core is completely burned into helium nuclei.Initially, the temperature in the core is not hot enough to ignite helium burning. With no additional fuel in the core, fusion dies out.The core cannot support itself and contracts; as it shrinks, it heats up.The rising temperature in the core heats up a thin shell around the core until the temperature reaches the point where hydrogen burning ignites in this shell around the core.With the additional energy generation in the H-burning shell, the outer layers of the star expand but their temperature decreases as they get further away from the center of energy generation. This large but cool star is now a red giant, with a surface temperature of 3500 degrees and a radius of about 100 solar radii.The helium core contracts until its temperature reaches about 100 million degrees. At this point, Helium burning ignites at the core. Helium is converted into carbon (C) and oxygen (O). However, the core cannot expand as much as required to compensate for the increased energy generation caused by the helium burning.Because the expansion does not compensate, the temperature stays very high, and the helium burning proceeds furiously. With no safety valve, the helium fusion is uncontrolled and a large amount of energy is suddenly produced.This helium flash occurs within a few hours after helium fusion begins.The core explodes, the core temperature falls and the core contracts again, thereby heating up.Even the helium is burning now, however, the reactions are more controlled because the explosion has lowered the density enough. Helium nuclei fuse to form carbon, oxygen.The star wanders around the red giant region, developing its distinct layers, eventually forming a carbon-oxygen core. When the helium in the core is entirely converted into C, O, etc., the core again contracts, and thus heats up again. In a star like the Sun, its temperature never reaches the 600 million degrees required for carbon burning. Instead, the outer layers of the star eventually become so cool that nuclei capture electrons to form neutral atoms (rather than nuclei and free electrons).When atoms are forming by capturing photons in this way, they cause photons to be emitted; these photons then are readily available for absorption by neighboring atoms and eventually this causes the outer layers of the star to heat up. When they heat up, the outer layers expand further and cool, forming more atoms, and releasing more photons, leading to more expansion. In other words, this process feeds itself.The outer envelope of the star blows off into space, exposing the hot, compressed remnant core. This is a planetary nebula .The core contacts but carbon burning never ignites in a one solar mass star. Contraction is halted when the electrons become degenerate, that is when they can no longer be compressed further. The core remnant as a surface temperature of a hot 10,000 degrees and is now a white dwarf .With neither nuclear fusion nor further gravitational collapse possible, energy generation ceases. The star steadily radiates is energy, cools and eventually fades from view, becoming a black dwarf.More details Here : The Evolution of the SunNow, this was about the evolution of a star with mass < 1.4 * solar mass. (Also known as  Chandrasekhar limit). For stars with mass > 3 x solar mass, even the Neutron degeneracy pressure can not stop the compression. The compression continues and it results in a singularity (black hole). Thanks for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "The most important thing to remember when studying the stellar evolution is that during the whole lifetime of a star, its own gravity is putting pressure inwards to collapse to a point, and for its whole life, a star has to struggle to find ways to counteract the gravity for its survival. The Main Sequence: For most of the life-time of a star, it lives in the Main-sequence, where it earns its bread-and-butter by the radiation pressure that arises from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in the core of the star. Life is mostly boring so far. The real fun starts when the star closes its retirement, and starts running juice. This is when they go off the main sequence, to find a second job, in search for extra cash to hold off the inevitable. Once the supply of hydrogen in the core has been exhausted, the star can no longer produce enough radiation pressure to keep off the gravitational pressure, and the core starts contracting. Planetary Nebula: If the star is small to mid sized ([math] 0.5 - 2 \\times M_{sun}[/math]), which are also the most populous in the universe, when they collapse under gravity, they do so in layers which collapse at different rate. The inner layers, closer to the core collapse faster than the outer layers. As the layers collapse, the unused hydrogen gets compressed and gets heated up, eventually leading to hydrogen fusion in these layers, also called shells. This process is called shell burning. This fusion is very rapid because the shell layer is still compressing and increasing in temperature. The luminosity of the star goes up, and the star becomes a red giant. Eventually, the gas sheds its outermost layers due to outward pressure, which forms a planetary nebula around the core of the star. Helium Flash: The core on the other hand has a very different life forward. The core of the star is now mostly pure He, which is also degenerate, i.e. packed very tight & close due to gravitational pressure. The temperature of the degenerate helium core increases rapidly without much change in the pressure, so that eventually the core is dense enough that it starts burning helium into carbon. This is quite an explosive reaction due to positive feedback from the energy given out by the radiation of helium burning. This stage is called as the Helium flash. This gives off energy equivalent of 100 billion times the solar energy, but only for few seconds. Sometimes the core can undergo regular cycles of expansion and contraction as a result of the battle between contracting gravity and radiation pressure from helium fusion, which leads to formation of Cepheid Variable stars. Asymptotic Giant Branch stars: For most sun-like stars, the core never gets hot enough to burn carbon, yet the helium burning releases a large amount of energy. This causes the star to expand again, and as it expands its surface temperature decreases, making it appear reddish. The surface of the core expands significantly as it becomes a supergiant star, which has extreme temperatures. The surface temperature is significantly lower than that of the sun (at about 2000 K, compared to Sun's at 5000 K) while the core temperature is extremely high. This stage lasts for about few 100,000 yrs to 1 million yrs. White Dwarfs: Eventually, the nuclear fusion in the stellar core stops as these cores have ran out of helium to burn but don't have enough capacity to burn carbon. At the beginning of this stage, the core is still very hot and appears blue-white. But eventually it cools off, turning the white dwarf into a red & subsequently a black dwarf. The size of this core is roughly similar to that of the Earth. The lifetime of the white dwarfs is thought to be of the order of the lifetime of a proton, i.e. [math]~ 10^{32}[/math] yrs.  The massive stars ([math] > 5 M_{sun}[/math]) live a very different life than their \"average\" counterparts. And as they say in show business, the bigger they are, the greater the fall! The cores of these stars will undergo successive fusions:hydrogen --> helium --> (red supergiants) --> carbon --> oxygen --> neon --> magnesium --> sulfur --> silicon --> iron If the core is not too massive ([math] < 1.4 M_{sun}[/math]), the fusion would stop at oxygen/neon and the core will form a white dwarf, but with heavy elements instead of helium (in case of less massive stars). If the core is more massive than the above limit, it will eventually fuse to the heaviest possible elements. Once it reaches iron, the core cannot fuse into heavier elements and this leads to a gravitational collapse and an eventual supernova. The pre-supernova phase can last for several 100,000 yrs (depending on the mass), but the supernova is instantaneous. The core collapse at the time of the supernova causes extreme gravitational pressure on the core, which leads to electron capture. The electrons in the orbits around the nuclei are compressed and eventually fall into nucleus to combine with protons & form neutrons. Thus the core of this remnant is mostly neutrons with few atomic elements in the outer layers. These are called the neutron stars and are sustained by Pauli Exclusion Principle.  If the initial core of the star is more massive than the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit, even the Pauli Exclusion Principle cannot keep up with the gravitational collapse, and the star ends up in a black hole.  There are, of course, many other possibilities during various stages of the stellar evolution, especially for the massive stars, which can end up in several different types of supernovae, which either lead to neutron stars, black holes, or no remnant left whatsoever. The details of these processes can be found in this paper: [astro-ph/0212469] How Massive Single Stars End their Life Here are few examples of stellar evolutions:    ^Evolution of sun-like star.   The HR diagram and stellar evolution of different star.  Thanks for A2A Mark. ",
