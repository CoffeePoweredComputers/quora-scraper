            "answer_text": "The basic concept of naturalism is that there is a dichotomy between events which are being represented by two concepts, natural and supernatural. Webster\u2019s Dictionary says naturalism is a word from around 1641 that means \u201cthe doctrine that scientific laws are adequate to account for all phenomena.\u201d Wikipedia says that naturalism is the \u201cidea or belief that only natural (as opposed to supernatural or spiritual) laws and forces operate in the world.\u201d Naturalism is a philosophy that was made to pit science, logic, and empiricism against theological approaches, superstitions, and observations of unique events but the separation between natural and supernatural is not so definitive. Supernatural is a term that is meant to refer to something that transcends the laws of nature. Supernatural is a clunky term that was better served back in 17th century. The problem with its present-day usage is that now we better understand our limitations and things aren\u2019t quite so black and white. Some of the events that were once considered to be supernatural, now can be shown to have a causative effect on the natural world. For example, before we had a better understanding of our universe\u2019s geometry, a solar or lunar eclipse was treated as a supernatural event that could easily have sent various theologies into a tizzy. Before we had a strongly built Earth Science and a more prolific communication of knowledge, the sight of a tornado might have been a supernatural experience that would require a lot of soul searching. We are born as entities who can only assess the world of a small container. If we if was possible to shake off the constrictions inherent to an ape\u2019s ignorance, we would be able to understand that, as far as our physical orientation goes, \u201cscientific laws are \u2018actually\u2019 adequate to account for all phenomena\u201d. An example of a valid supernatural or spiritual element is the part of life that resides at the farther end of a conceptual continuum, a continuum that reaches into greater academic heights from a base that has been erected in the natural pragmatic more measurable world. Essentially, the \u201cnatural\u201d in naturalism makes it a code word for using an ape\u2019s tool box. Supernatural is a code word for either the utilization of a poetic license, the misinterpretation of sensory data, or the attempt to assess that which is beyond our perceptual and intellectual ability to grasp. When we go beyond our tool box, we enter the lands of metaphysics, religion (superstition), or the contemplation of an unknown observed phenomenon. The relationship between natural and supernatural can be illustrated by the need to form a pragmatic relationship with the physical surroundings and the cognizance of the two flag bearers for the \u201csupernatural or spiritual\u201d world: the entity\u2019s awareness of being given a life and the entity\u2019s awareness that its life is going to end. The natural world is built from a spiritual or supernatural foundation. ",
