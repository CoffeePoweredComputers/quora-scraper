            "answer_text": "Calcium is a very important mineral in human metabolism, making up about 1-2% of an adult human's body weight. In addition to its widely known role in bone structure, calcium is used to help control muscle and nerve function, as well as to manage acid/base balance in our blood stream. From this very simple description, you can see how calcium-rich foods can play a role in many aspects of your health that extend far beyond the specific area of bone health. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to eat dairy foods to get the calcium you need in your meal plan. Calcium is provided by a wide variety of foods, and in order to get 1,000 milligrams per day (the Dietary Reference Intake, or DRI for women and men 19-50 years of age), you don't need cow's milk, yogurt, cheese or butter. Consider some of the following examples: 3.2 ounces of sardines contains more than 340 milligrams of calcium, about 2.5 times that of 4 ounces of cow's milk.1 cup of steamed collards and 1 cup of cow's milk are nearly identical in terms of calcium (with collards providing 266 milligrams and cow's milk providing 276 milligrams)100 calories worth of spinach provides you with twice as much calcium as 100 calories worth of yogurt4 ounces of tofu, 2 TBS of sesame seeds, 1.5 cups of steamed collard greens, and 4 ounces of scallops provide you with 1,100 milligrams of calcium, or 110% DV. At the same time, these four foods only use up 394 calories, or about 22% of an 1,800-calorie meal plan.As you can see from the examples above, many non-dairy foods can provide you with substantial amounts of calcium. Particularly helpful in this regard are green leafy vegetables like spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, and kale. Many fish and shellfish\u2014including scallops and sardines\u2014also provide concentrated amounts of calcium. ",
