            "answer_text": "Perhaps the most important factor that affects the stability of a compound is its enthalpy of formation or heat of formation.The standard enthalpy of formation is defined as the change in enthalpy for the formation of 1 mole of the compound from its constituent elements, with all the substances in their standard states at 1 atmospheric pressure (at 25 degree celsius). Standard enthalpy of formation of some organic compounds in kJ/mole:Methane          -74.81 Ethane             -84.68   Propane           -103.9Ethanol            -277.6Isopropanol     -318.1Glucose            -1273 Benzene           +49.1Ehylene            +52.1Acetylene         +227.6  Obviously, the more negative the value of the enthalpy of formation of a compound, greater will be its thermodynamic stability.
