However, for any science, I'd say some of the most important things are probably: PensPaperIf you can, try and get hold of a computer as well. A large part of science is collecting, processing and trying to make sense of data. Writing and statistics are your most useful tools. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends very much on the subject and the topic. For instance, Physics can be accelerators, but it can be dry paper work (theoretical science) too. Academics use in general: paper+pencomputer with internet connection (research/databases/programming etc.) + often Linux & LaTeXlibraryblackboard (especially when you do math or studies connected to math)And most importantly: their head. That is all you need for some sciences and topics. Sometimes you need more. But it really depends on the subject. If you do biochemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, astrophysics, environmental chemistry, partical physics etc. you need very different tools (sometimes the same, but often different ones). PS! Physics use a lot of alu foil. A LOT! ",
