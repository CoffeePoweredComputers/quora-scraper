            "answer_text": "there is no such thing as \u201cthe nerve agent Novichok\u201d Novichok is the name given to a series of nerve agents. Novichok means \u201c newcomer \u201c in Russian.A Novichok agent is characterised by generally being a type of binary chemical agent. A binary agent is one which exists in two components; ( precursors) each one being of low ( or lesser)toxicity , but which when mixed, become very powerful. This makes them easier to transport; and when unmixed, difficult to detect . They were also intended to circumvent the chemical weapons bans, since the two precursor elements were not, themselves, banned elements. ( this loophole has now been largely closed)Novichoks are also chemically much faster acting than more \u201c conventional \u201c nerve agents, due to the chemical bonding structure they employ. This makes them much harder to treat; as time to introduce counter agents to the body is much reduced, and the countering agents ( which are, themselves, quite toxic) have to be used in greater doses.There are many \u201cNovichok\u201d agents, but it is believed that only 5 have been successfully weaponised. They have also been reported as being inspection and pesticides.The currently known ones are typical VX style of agents, being organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In simple terms they inhibit a key enzyme which is vital to nerve functioning; this results in failure of nerves, loss of motor response, paralysis and heart/breathing failure.Novichoks are fast acting, and much more powerful ( up to 8 times) than \u201c standard \u201c nerve agents such as VX . Hence LD50 ( lethal dose ) is much lower.The high power, and difficulty in detecting the precursors, made Novichoks good Clandestine weapons; as the quantity needed is smallTo answer \u201cdifficulty to synthesise\u201d; once you know the formulas , then chemically, it is similar to the synthesis of any other nerve agent or pesticide. The \u201c trick\u201d is knowing the proportions of the two precursors; and the way of mixing them. Because the precursors themselves are much less toxic, then clandestine manufacturing could required much less safety precautions than conventional agents, providing that the precursors are kept completely separate.Note; I have deliberately left out some more technical aspects of this answer, as I have no wish to publish in public, dangerous details of these agents. Other parts are deliberately vague. If you are an organic chemist, you will know ( or can find) more details ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you, Gordon for your question. We have a set of mutually exclusive, contradictory rumors on the agent, used against Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Quora is often a place, where experts could share their knowledge. I am not expert. We have some \u201csofa experts\u201d, so for now, I have to avoid translations of their opinions, and refer to conventional statements. I can only use broadly known sources. Chemical agents like \u201cnovichok\u201d use a very simple sorts of formulas, like Novichok-5, -7, -8 and -9 (mentioned in wiki. ) They are simple if we compare them with achievements of modern biochemistry, that works wits molecules that are hundred or thousand times more complicated. Modern chemical SW demonstrate simulations of artificial and biological objects of nano- scale size that are possible to synthesize technically now. Mirzoyanov makes clear that a large number of compounds were made, and many of the less potent derivatives were reported in the open literature as new organophosphate insecticides (Wiki). Insecticide is a cheap stuff anyone could find in a shop. So, some toxin could be created using standard equipment, used in labs, to work with toxic or hazardous materials in milligram or gram scales. If we mean an industrial production, like tons of materials, that needs a special equipment, and such technology exist in: UK, USA, Check Republic and Sweden (possibly Baltic States) according Alexander Lucashevich http://tass.ru/politika/5035144. He says that development of chemical weapons continued in this countries and is in progress now. IMHO - this activities has no relationship with case, since official experiments are done under very strong regulations. Since 0.5 g of agent is lethal, this is possible for anyone, like secret labs, that are able to produce substances like \u201cacids\u201d, \u201cspices\u201d and other synthetic drugs with much more complex formulas and also could do all required tests (on victims of mafia) in a quantities, enough to kill few persons. Then, such agent could be also available through \u201cdark Net\u201d. (And, why it was not produced few years ago, and then, when everyone forgot and all traces and digital traces are lost, this thing is applied?) Also - there is a huge difference between lab and industrial synthesis. In a lab, to get few grams of toxin, several kilograms of garbage could be produced, and it is easy to utilize this kilograms. But if one needs tons of poison, utilization of dozens of tons of garbage is expensive, so they use much more effective scenarios. With cheap and simple sequence of reactions, poison could be created dirty, but to make its clean, expensive methods of purifying could be held, that is not good for muss production. And this is how \u201cacids\u201d and \u201cspices\u201d are created- they are very dirty and dangerous. I also do know, that in 1990 many brand housekeeping substances, shampoo, and so on were falsified. It was an international industry making tons of materials, and chloride and phosphorus is a part of synthesis, too. This substances could clean old and hard spots on cloth without a traces, but they are really dangerous if we inhale them (headache or vomiting are possible reactions). Brand materials are carefully tested (yes, on animals and volunteers) and less dangerous. So, it is not difficult if we do not need to repeat industrial methods exactly, but only few grams required. And if \u201cnovichok\u201d is dirty, so one could find that it was synthesized using such a cheap scenario, all accusations towards Russia could fail. And this is a one strong reason, why UK refused to give us samples of gas, used against Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Now, on 30 of March, I could not add anything, because good article in Russian, \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0433\u0430\u0437 \u0441 \u043c\u0430\u0437\u044c\u044e written by a true Expert who is making statements, that such thing /it is not a gas, it is solid like wax and melts on 109 Celsius) could be produced by certified labs as well as any criminal lab using freely available equipment and resources.

            "answer_text": "It is true that it isn\u2019t necessarily that difficult to synthesize Novichok agents \u2014 many chemists would have that capability. What is actually rather difficult is purifying and weaponizing such an agent. According to analysis, the agent used was rather pure. It is one thing to synthesize a highly toxic compound, but figuring out how to purify it without killing yourself would be exceedingly difficult. This process would require producing multiple batches and developing a suitable workup that removes unwanted side-products as well as remaining traces of reagents and reactants\u2026a process that would require a very well-funded laboratory. Even after you figure out how to purify the agent, you would then have to figure out how to weaponize it. Since this is reportedly a binary weapon, procedures and equipment have to be devised allowing the two precursors to be combined immediately prior to use. For example, if the binary precursors can be prepared in liquid form then they could be stored in two seperate aerosol containers and then sprayed on a surface to produce the toxin. However, getting such a process to work is exceedingly difficult. The agent needs to be dispersed in a manner so that it sticks to the surface \u2014 if it drips off then it will not work. On the other hand, if it dries too fast than the victim may not retain a sufficient amount of the toxin on their hands. Here there are many minute details to work out \u2014 how to stabilize the solutions in the containers, how to prepare the solutions to keep the nozzle from clogging, what is the best solvent and concentration, what type of metal can be used to store the material, are additional chemicals required to stabilize the precursors, etc). Working out all of these details would require a detailed and quite expensive effort. So while there is potentially a large pool of chemists who could synthesize a toxin like Novichok, there is a much smaller pool of people that could actually weaponize it. It would also be a time-consuming and expensive process, requiring specialists from multiple areas of expertise (engineering, chemistry, fabrication, industrial production). ",
