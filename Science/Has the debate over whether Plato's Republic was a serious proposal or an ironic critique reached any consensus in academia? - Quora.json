            "answer_text": "Unask the question. The Republic is serious, ironic, critical and quite a bit more than that. As Mr. Uebersax says below, it is a normative psychology, but it is far more even than that. It is a theory of Art: it is an attempt to connect politics and ethics; it is an account of Nature; it argues for an architecture within existence; it is a meditation on the politics of music; it is an attempt to create a rational rather than revealed monotheism; it attempts to resolve important intellectual conflicts among the Presocratic physicists and the speculations of Heraclitus, Parmenides, Pythagoras and Gorgias; it is a theory of education, it is a virtue ethics, it is a theory of government, it is an account of the afterlife; it is a theory of knowledge; it is a reflection on the fall of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian War; it is an hommage to Socrates. It is one of the greatest works of art ever constructed. The Republic is the most important single work in the Western tradition. Almost all of Plato\u2019s answers turns out to be wrong, but he asked all the big questions, setting the boundaries of serious thinking for millennia. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but please note option 3: that the Republic is an allegory for right government of the human psyche, that all political details are subordinated to that aim, and the absurd literal details (e.g., triple division of citizens, noble lie, banishment of poets) make sense if understood with reference to the psyche. Proponents of this view (besides me) include Waterfield, Annas and Hoerber (see references). On Reading Plato\u2019s Republic as Psychology ",

It is the description of a theoretically \u201cideal\u201d polity not subject to ordinary human ignorance or weaknesses that make achievement of a perfectly just state impossible. ",
