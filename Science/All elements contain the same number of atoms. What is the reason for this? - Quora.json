            "answer_text": "All elements have the same number of atoms when the accounting is done for the mass equivalent to the atomic weight, expressed in grams, known as the gram-mole or mole. The gram-atom expresses the same concept without concern of the form of an element\u2019s common occurrence. The mole is a term for the count, a la \u201cdozen\u201d or \u201cream\u201d, and while a dozen is 12, and a ream is 500, a mole is 6.022x10^23 (Avogadro\u2019s number). However, the value is clearer, perhaps, when we realize a dozen could be 12 eggs, but that the eggs might be wren\u2019s eggs or ostrich eggs. Similarly Avogadro\u2019s number of helium atoms will weigh far less than the same number of uranium atoms because the ratio of individual atomic masses is small. We just know more in detail about the atoms than most of us do about comparative egg masses. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question doesn\u2019t quite make sense since a single atom of Hydrogen is an element. I suspect what you are referring to is Avogadro\u2019s number, 6.02214076 \u00d7 10^23. Avogadro\u2019s number is a convenient way to organize any item to a common amount. So while a single atom of Hydrogen is indeed an element it is so small it is hard to describe it. The mass of a single item of Hydrogen is so small that it is hard to quantify. But if you take 6.02214076 \u00d7 10^23 atoms of Hydrogen, the mass is easier to make sense of. Thus we use the same number of atoms for each element to help us describe the element. ",
