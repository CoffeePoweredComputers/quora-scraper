            "answer_text": "SO2 is a bent structure (molecular geometry). Sulfur wants 6 electrons, and so does oxygen. Hence, 6\u00d73=18 valence electronsto distribute throughout the structure. Putting 4 for each of two double bonds uses up 8.You can then put 4 electrons on each oxygen and the last 2 on the sulfur as a lone pair. Sulfur can be hypervalent (cf. SF6), but oxygen cannot because sulfur can access its 3d orbitals (it's on the third period/row). If we place this structure on the xy-plane, then the z-axis comes out towards us. Sulfur has one 3s, three 3p, and five 3d valence atomic orbitals (AOs), while oxygen has one 2s and three 2p valence AOs. SO2 MO DIAGRAM  http://image.slidesharecdn.com/ If you stare for a while at this diagram, which shows only the \u03c3 bonds and lone pairs on the depicted structure... SIGMA BONDING/ANTIBONDING ORBITALS The 2s and 2p orbitals on oxygen mix to produce hybridized sp2 AOs for \u03c3bonding (the hybridized orbitals are indicated by the \"O sp2\" label on the far right of the diagram) that are intermediate in energy between the original 2s and 2pAOs.The 3s and 3p orbitals on sulfur mix to produce hybridized sp2 AOs for \u03c3 bonding (the hybridized orbitals are indicated by the \"S sp2\" label on the far left of the diagram) that are intermediate in energy between the original 3s and 3p AOs.Two of the sp2 AOs (2s+2px+2py) from oxygen can overlap head-on with two of the sp2 AOs (2s+2px+2py) from sulfur to form one \u03c3 bonding and one \u03c3*antibonding MO.The \u03c3 bonding MOs are labeled 1 for the left S\u2212O \u03c3 bond, and 2 for the right S\u2212O \u03c3 bond. The antibonding MOs are empty.As a result, we should see that we have accounted for the \u03c3 bonding of the sulfur with each oxygen. So far, our electron count is 2 x 2 = 4.LONE PAIRS OF ELECTRONS (NONBONDING ORBITALS) For the lone pairs of electrons, we examine the nonbonding MOs that have a dashed line connected to one atom's AOs but not the other's AOs. From the structure above, we should examine the diagonal orbitals, which have mixed x and y directions together, indicating a mixture of the 2px and 2py orbitals. One of sulfur's sp2 hybrid AOs aren't overlapping with one of oxygen's sp2 AOs. That is the lone pair of electrons that sulfur has, and you can tell by noticing how the MO diagram shows the black dashed-line contribution from only the sp2 AOs of sulfur.This is orbital 3 and is labeled as the nonbonding \"S sp2\" MO in the middle of the diagram, below MO 10.There are sp2 orbitals of oxygen that didn't overlap with the sp2 orbitals of sulfur. Those account for the two lone pairs of electrons on each oxygen, and you can tell by noticing how the MO diagram shows the black dashed-line contribution from only the sp2 AOs of oxygen.These are MOs 4, 5, 6, and 7, labeled \"O sp2\", and they are right below MO 9.So far, our electron count is (2 x 2) + 2 + (2 x 4) = 14. PI BONDING/ANTIBONDING/NONBONDING ORBITALS Lastly, let us examine the \u03c0 bonds. The additional \u03c0 bond on top of each sulfur-oxygen \u03c3 bond requires two more electrons per S\u2212O connection. The gist is that two \u03c0 bonds are made between the 2pz AOs of each oxygen and the 3pz of the sulfur. That makes sense since we had defined the axis coming towards us as the z-axis, the 2pz and 3pz orbitals both lie along that axis, and we hadn't considered those orbitals yet. They can overlap side-on to form \u03c0 bonds.(I believe they are labeled as MOs 8 and 9 on the MO diagram, but I am unsure why 9is nonbonding when in fact four \u03c0 electrons are needed. Perhaps it has something to do with the 3d orbital access, but that is just speculation.) And our final, total electron count is (2 x 2) + 2 + (2 x 4) + (2 x 2) = 18, as predicted in the beginning.

            "answer_text": "Sulphur dioxide is SO2 The central sulphur atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms. The structure is like this: O=S=O The sulphur atom forms one sigma and one pi bond with each oxygen atom and has one lone pair. Sulphur in its ground state has first two shells completely filled and six electrons in the outermost shell. There are two paired electrons in the 3s orbital and four electrons in 3p orbital (Two paired electrons in 3px orbital and one unpaired electron each in 3py and 3pz orbitals). In order to form four bonds, it needs four unpaired electrons. Therefore, the formation of the excited state takes place: One 3px electron shifts to an empty 3d orbital. Now, there are four unpaired electrons (Three unpaired electrons in three 3p orbitals and one unpaired electron in one 3d orbital). As the electrons forming sigma bonds (and the lone pair) need to be on the same energy level, hybridisation takes place. One 3s and two 3p orbitals get hybridised to form three equal sp2 hybrid orbitals. One hybrid orbital is occupied by the lone pair and other two orbitals have unpaired electrons, which participate in sigma bonding with the oxygen atoms. The remaining 3p and 3d orbitals remain unhybridised. The two unpaired electrons in the unhybridised orbitals take part in the formation of pi bonds. Therefore, the hybridisation of the central sulphur atom in this compound is sp2. P.S. The hybridisation of the two oxygen atoms is sp2 as well. ",
