            "answer_text": "On-and-Off all day and night long. Whenever I wonder about something or if my husband wonders about something, I always say, \u201cWait. I\u2019ll Google that.\u201d I don\u2019t know how we ever learned anything before Google\u2014all those questions that went unanswered or questions whose answers were speculated on endlessly and were all probably wrong\u2026  Usually I wake up with a question repeating in my head. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to the first question of the day, it\u2019s just something that rises up from the mind-chatter that starts the very second one begins to awaken. This morning I awoke wondering, \u201cWhat ever happened to the Lifestyle Lift?\u201d Peed, brushed my teeth and Googled it. Out of Business, spent too much money on advertising. Question answered. Here are only a fraction of things I\u2019ve Googled in the past two days: Wayfaring Stranger (song) Youtube. ~ How many COVID deaths in Chicago yesterday? ~ When was Castle Craig built and who was Craig, in Meriden, CT? ~ 328 Deerpath Road, Lake Forest, IL, Google Street View; ~Recipe for Mexican Mole sauce; ~ Mandelbrot Set, video; ~ Best homemade exfoliator; ~ What has COVID done to the rat population of NYC? ~ New York is My Home/Simon&Dion,Youtube; ~ Quotes by Lao Tzu; ~ Best quality bidets; ~ I think you get the idea. Whatever pops into my head with a question mark at the end gets googled. Why not? But the REAL question is\u2026  How many of my answered questions are remembered after a day or two? Some are forgotten almost immediately after I read them. In the end, it\u2019s really just a quick fix for the ever-questioning mind of very little lasting value.  ",

I have friends and family who live by it, even for inconsequential information as to who starred with who in what film. Think long enough and it might come to you. Doesn\u2019t always work for me, but I try. Someone else mentioned Wikipedia. That is often the first place I\u2019ll go. If I find certain links there that I\u2019m interested in, I\u2019ll bookmark them. Always good for late night reading. I\u2019m watching TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 on Netflix right now. I know just about everything from that era, old enough that when I started college, Vietnam had just ended. I always remember four of the names of those on trial. I remember Yippi8es and the SDS and the Weathermen, but I\u2019ll look them up on Wikipedia first. If it something very specific, then I will go to Google. For example, if in the movie mention is made of an article in a newspaper, Google might have the direct link. But I honestly try and think something through, because I\u2019ll remember it better, or at least the trigger to what made me remember. I wasn\u2019t on my laptop yesterday much, so I never went to any search engine. I\u2019ll actually go to Google Images before the main site. ",
