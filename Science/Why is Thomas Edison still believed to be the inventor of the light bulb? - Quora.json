            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Why is Thomas Edison still believed to be the inventor of the light bulb? Why is Christopher Columbus still believed to have proven that the Earth was round by sailing in the opposite direction and allegedly discovering the American continents? Why isn\u2019t the King James Version of the Bible named after Francis Bacon, who\u2019s reasonably believed to have written it? Why is our current calendar named after a Pope instead of the mathematician(s) who developed it? Why is Henry Ford often mistaken as the inventor of the motor vehicle? Why is the Steam Engine attributed to Watt instead of Trevithick?  I could go on asking a massive long list of questions with mythological answers. Most of what we are taught in school is full of ludicrous errors. Teachers are too blinkered to think outside the system, and students who ask difficult questions are considered disruptive. The greatest myths are taught in the Sciences (like Physics and Chemistry), and the Humanities (like English Literature*, History and Social Studies).* I have seen so many quote something from Shakespeare in order to justify a point about modern mis-use of English. Shakespeare wasn\u2019t writing formal proper English for his time, he wrote \u201cstreet\u201d English. His plays were the Soap Opera of 400 years ago. Evan fabid iff, in 400 years, someone starzz qwoting Eastenders! Universities are place where people are supposed to be taught how to think. Right across the boards, anyone studying a vaguely artistic subject is being heavily indoctrinated into Cultural Marxism, i.e., what to think. In the STEM topics, students are also being indoctrinated into fictional sub-atomic particles that don\u2019t help explain how things work, but make it more complicated. The only way the PTBs (Powers That Be) can stay in control is by dumbing down the rest of us. Even if I disagree with Flat Earthers, I respect their right to believe whatever they want and now that the Internet cat is out of the bag, people with radical ideas are learning, \u201cWe are not alone.\u201d This is what has governments running scared. If I were to discover a cheap and simple device that produces genuinely \u201cfree\u201d energy and saturated the \u2019net with the information to the point that hundreds if not thousands have tried it out and found it works, then it would go viral and the entire oil economy would collapse over-night. The biggest problem is that we cannot wake people up to the reality around them until we\u2019ve finally gotten through their sleeping state, and too many of them are happy to put the blind-folds back on and pull up the blankets.

            "answer_text": "A patent simply says that the invention I have created is somehow unique or different. How do we determine unique or different? We could probably get a few patent lawyers on this question and they could argue about it, but that's exactly my point. The differences between products is something fought out in court room battles, over periods of years. Not only do we fight over what is unique, we fight over who did it first. There are numerous stories of patents filed literally the same day, for the same product. I am not exactly sure what you mean by \"he only purchased a patent.\" A patent is a legal claim, you present your case, and it is processed. Sometimes you hear about companies buying a patent, that usually means they purchased the legal rights to the invention created by the inventor. The company may give the inventor a fixed dollar amount, or perhaps give them a financial reward based on some sales of a product. I have spent my life trying to explain things in simple terms for people. Hopefully no one is over critical for my attempt to over simplify the concept of patents. I am a technology geek, not a lawyer. I've been to numerous seminars and workshops given by lawyers on intellectual property, that's the larger catch all phrase for things like patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Lawyers do their best to make things complicated, I try to keep it simple. Getting back to the issue of Edison. I answer many questions on Quora on what I call \"the eureka moment.\" What I mean by that is, one day something does not exist. Something like, telephone, television, radio, even the light bulb. One mad scientist goes into a lab, turns his new and different idea into a real invention. Eureka! Looking at the light bulb, there were numerous different patents of light bulbs before Thomas Edison. There have been numerous different patents of light bulbs since Thomas Edison. In fact Westinghouse Electric had to \"re-invent\" the light bulb in order to defeat Edison during the War of Currents. It amazes me on Quora how people fight over all the \"who invented it\" mythology. That eureka moment does not happen in reality. Most inventions were an evolution over time, each inventor making some minor improvement to the invention that existed to make it better. ",
