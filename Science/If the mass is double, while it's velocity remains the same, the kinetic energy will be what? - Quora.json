            "answer_text": "You can easily answer this for yourself, and could have done so in a few seconds, rather than wait for the 5 hrs since you posted your question here. Have a look at the expression for kinetic energy. Select any value you want for the mass and velocity and solve for energy. Not replace the value you used for mass with twice as much mass and solve again. Do this 10 times, each time selecting a random value for mass and then resolving with twice the mass. What do you deduce from the result? ",
