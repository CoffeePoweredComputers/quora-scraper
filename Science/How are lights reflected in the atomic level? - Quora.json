            "answer_text": "Light can only be absorbed and emitted by matter. Electrons absorb light, causing the electron to jump to a higher energy state. This is called the excitation. Almost instantly, the electron falls down to a lower energy state by emitting the light. This is called a de-excitation. As a whole, this phenomenon is called a quantum jump or quantum leap.  At a macroscopic level, this phenomenon appears as if the light is bouncing off the matter, which we call reflection. But light does not bounce off matter. Reflection does not happen. Matter cannot \u201creflect\u201d light. It is an approximation we are taught at the school level physics. The molecules/atoms of glass or metal or any object merely absorb light and then emit light. We see things around us not because objects are reflecting light but because light falls on objects and then the electrons of atoms and molecules of the object undergo quantum jump and then emit light in every possible direction. For more information, look for Richard Feynman\u2019s lectures on Quantum ElectroDynamics: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter. ",

            "answer_text": "What we consider reflection is the collision of light with a shiny and smooth surface and bounce back. but at atomic level it is so much strange.  At quantum scale light is absorbed into the atom causing the electronic transition of an electron from lower orbit to higher orbit (energy level) from higher energy level then electron return to the low energy level and it emits again the same light and this light can be seen as reflection of light.  thank you for asking question.

            "answer_text": "At the atomic level, it is the metals that are the best mirrors. The reason is the large number of almost free electrons at their upper layer making these good electric conductor. Like any wave, electromagnetic waves reflect when encountering a large impedance mismatch. Similar to a wave bouncing back when reaching the end of a string, the reflexion of light by metal starts right away on every parts of a single oscillation. ",
