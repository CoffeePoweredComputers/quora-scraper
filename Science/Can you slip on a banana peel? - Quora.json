            "answer_text": "You can slip on anything technically. Slipping is a matter of friction coefficients. Lower yours enough with liquid or something else on your feet that has a lubricating effect and yes you will indeed slip. If the peel is mushy enough then it might also be able to decrease the friction between your foot and the surface you're stepping on enough to make you slip. ",
