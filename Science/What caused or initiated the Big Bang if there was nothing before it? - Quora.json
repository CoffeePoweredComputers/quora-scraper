            "answer_text": "THE \u2018PRIMORDIAL STATE \u2018 /\u2018NOTHING \u2018 / A \u2018QUANTUM VACUUM \u2018 GAVE BIRTH TO THE UNIVERSE. The\u2019 nothing\u2019 undefined region which is a Quantum Vacuum or an \u2018undefined dimensionless void \u2018 caused the Big Bang , or the Big Bang caused itself as a Phase Transition in and from the \u2018primordial state \u2018 but not completely overtaking the \u2018primordial state\u2019 , which is \u2018nothing\u2019 or as close to \u2018nothing \u2018 as Nature can get . My theory is that the [nearly] \u2018nothing \u2018 state came before [ paradox alert -we understand that there was no time or space as we know it here in the Universe - so technically - there was no \u2018before \u2018 but for understanding - we allow \u2018 before \u2018 ]. Why do I say \u2018nearly\u2019 nothing ? Because the most likely explanation is that \u2018 nothing \u2018 did come before but is not a perfect vacuum , no space as we know it , no time as we know it , many of the laws of the Universe did / do not exist \u2018 there \u2018 except one thing in common with the Universe which emerged from \u2018nothing\u2019. Spontaneous quantum particles sometimes appear and disappear similar to how they behave here . I did not learn or theorize this by studying Stephen Hawking , but I quote one of his terms to reinforce this idea - he referred to a \u2018quantum vacuum \u2018 as the primordial state \u2018before \u2018 [ paradox alert ] and currently \u2018outside\u2019 the Universe. The commonality between the \u2018primordial state\u2019 and the Universe is quantum particles appearing and disappearing - not necessarily the same exact particles as here in the Universe but appearing and disappearing as they do here. Where did the \u2018 nothing \u2018 come from ? \u2018Nothing \u2018 always exists because it is the absence of everything the Universe has \u2026.almost . So the Universe emerged from the \u2018nothing \u2018 but is not completely infinite and did not completely overrun the\u2019 nothing region \u2018 which the Universe emerged from - a \u2018quantum vacuum \u2018 or an\u2019 undefined dimensionless void \u2018 one of my terms . I was just reading an article by a noted Physicist talking about the very beginning of the Universe and inflation then expansion with some very clear explanations and size restrictions of the very very early Universe the first micro trillionths of a second. But then he said the Universe might be infinite now - which makes me wonder about his other calculations , frankly . The Quantum Vacuum [ another term for \u2018nothing\u2019 or \u2018primordial state \u2018 - the prior state to the Universe and possibly other Universes still exists and always existed \u2026the Universe did not completely \u2018take over \u2018 the \u2018undefined region \u2018 or \u2018 quantum vacuum \u2018 or the \u2018nothing \u2018 it emerged from it = simple. But how can a whole Universe emerge literally from \u2018nothing \u2018 ? Two reasons : 1]The \u2018nothing region\u2019 is as close to \u2018nothing \u2018 as Nature can get but different tiny quantum particles pop in and out of existence as they do here. 2] This Universe is probably a temporary condition - in a few hundred trillion or few thousand trillion years or million trillion years - the Universe will probably dissipate back into the \u2018 quantum vacuum \u2018 when there is only less than 1 quantum particle per 50 cubic light years and it is absolute zero everywhere with no energy or mass structures , no gravity , no time no black holes , and finally no space . This is the simplest explanation for this Universe I have seen and also aligns with Hawking\u2019s ideas about the Universe creating itself . Now - I have left out [ because I don\u2019t know yet - lol ] exactly how there came to be a huge concentration of quantum particles in a plasma state ( similar to what is probably at the center of Supermassive Black Holes - but probably higher mass/density at early Big Bang ). Nonetheless the primordial , before \u2018time \u2018 state ( which still exists ) is well defined here and does/did NOT need to be created . \u2018Nothing \u2018 does not need to be created - it always exists and [paradox alert] is still exists \u2018outside\u2019 this Universe and existed \u2018before\u2019 this Universe . Interesting that when we observe degenerate matter - crushed even further beyond the density of Neutron Stars into Black Holes - we get close to the original hyperdense plasma state of the very early Universe before and during \u2018inflation\u2019 - although less massive Black Holes with the type of degenerate matter at their center - are the closest thing to the early plasma state of the Universe. Not for reproduction outside Quora and I reserve all rights to the most likely beginning of the Universe / Big Bang from the\u2019* primordial state \u2018. For now I reserve all rights to the concept of the quantum particles in the \u2018nothing\u2019 or \u2018primordial state\u2019 and \u2018undefined region \u2018 as the prior state to this and any other Universes or structures and that is exists in Nature now , and our Universe came from it and eventually this non infinite Universe will dissolve back into the \u201cvoid \u201c or the \u2018nothing \u2018 or the Quantum Vacuum . I especially reserve rights to this term \u2018primordial state\u2019 as explained here and that the \u2018primordial state \u2018 must still exist. ",

            "answer_text": "There wasn't \"nothing\" before the so-called \"big bang\". There was Space. If you were to superheat space, and enclose it to prevent it from expanding (aka the \"cosmic furnace\" experiment), you would have the conditions for producing a \"big bang\" (the whole universe was in a hot, dense state, as the song goes).  When the \"cosmic furnace\" was removed, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. It was able to do so because matter did not yet exist. Without matter, there is no gravity, and without gravity, there is nothing to put the brakes on.  As the universe cooled, particles of matter began forming- quarks in a free state, because energies were still high enough to allow this.  As the universe cooled further, quarks assembled into pairs and trios (protons and neutrons). At this point, gravity comes into play, and puts the brakes on Cosmic Inflation.  Now, to answer your question, \"What was there before?\", the answer is Space. There was no matter, but one important thing you have to remember is that matter and Space are one and the same thing. Matter is dimensionally-entangled Space.  The question is really, What is Space?, and that is something we're only just beginning to figure out. Space isn't nothing. It has properties we can study in a lab. Space pushes matter together, in the same way that objects floating on water are pushed together.  Also, the phenomenon we call the \"big bang\" is ongoing. New matter is burbling into existence all the time. Most of it comes into being as virtual pairs that cancel each other out. The rest burbles into being as new matter.  Space itself is theorised to consist of Branes, or massive fields of . . . whatever it is they are. The \"big bang\" itself is theorised to have been caused by a collision of Branes.  Some erroneously claim that Black Holes had something to do with the Big Bang. This is not a possibility, as Black Holes consist of collapsed matter, and in the beginning, there was no matter from which to form Black Holes.  ",
