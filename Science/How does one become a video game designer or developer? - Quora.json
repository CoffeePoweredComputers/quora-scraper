            "answer_text": "Step 1: Learn how to use search functions. Asking the same question that has been asked multiple times a day for the last 4 years on here shows a lack of work effort. Game development is hard and you are expected to be able to figure things out. Asking someone for help without even doing the basic ground work yourself is just lazy and not going to keep you employed. The better route is to search and read and have specific questions about YOUR situations. Ie \u201cI\u2019ve read that to be a game designer I need a degree and a portfolio. I can\u2019t afford a degree. How much better of a portfolio would I need to qualify for an entry level job.\u201d See - that shows that you\u2019ve done the basic leg work, comprehended the answer AND were able to apply it to a specific situation. Someone asking a question like that would be far more likely to get help. I\u2019ve been known to directly mentor people who can act like that and quite a few have jobs now as a result of their hard work. Step 2: Clarify the question Are you asking how to start your own team/company? How to find a hobbyist team that will take you? How to get a job at an indie studio? A professional team? A top AAA team? Those all have very different steps and much of what would help you get one either won\u2019t help or will hurt you for the others. Step 3: Location, location location. It matters where you are located. Some teams are more likely to hire remote work but not for entry level. This is especially true on the high tier teams. For making your own team you really want to have people you can sit around and jam with. Yes yes you can Zoom or whatever. It isn\u2019t the same. Especially for your first project. Details matter. Share the details. Everyone has an origin story. Many of us have been around for a while and our stories won\u2019t match yours. The industry has changed dramatically the 20 years I\u2019ve been doing this. I would have had a much harder time getting a job with the route I took. And I won\u2019t have taken that route because changes in the industry and technology would have completely changed how I solved this. Broad strokes: Education matters. AAA teams rarely hire people without degrees these days unless they have significant experience making critically or commercially successful indie games where they played a significant role in the development (lead level.) Part of the reason education matters is showing you have grit - that you can survive a 4 year degree and stick to it. Most people in their late teens/early 20s have never needed to show grit. Well, it's important and this is one way to demonstrate that important skill. Ability matters. People talk about passion and heart like it matters. In the end it really doesn\u2019t. It matters what you can do. Yes, prediction of future skill is important too but a large part of it is your skill right here right now. This is demonstrated by having a solid portfolio that showcases the exact skills that the job posting asks for. If you apply to a level design job posting with a portfolio of your writing then I\u2019d wouldn\u2019t bet on getting through to even the first interview. If you show a programming portfolio when applying to a character modeling position then you\u2019ll be in the same boat. Although it would likely get redirected to an engineering recruiter who would talk to you and try to understand what's going on and why you are trying to be an artist. Skilled programmers are extremely hard to find. All the ability and skill in the world doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t demonstrate it. This is what your portfolio is for. Part of this goes back to grit - if you are an artist and you\u2019ve been modeling people for a few years you\u2019ll have a portfolio that shows how you\u2019ve progressed. That you stuck with it and got better over a period of time. Design skills can be much harder to showcase. Level design might be the easiest since you can include overhead screencaps of the level editor and had annotations about what is there and why. But showing how it evolved over time - that you have grit and stuck with it - now that is hard. And no, I don\u2019t have an easy answer for you to solve this. You have to personalize your portfolio to the role you want and the skills you\u2019ve been honing. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The first step is to decide on the game design role you want to play: Designer, Programmer or Artist. Each position demands a different set of skills, learning plan, personality traits and passions. Here's an excerpt from an article I wrote for ITCareerFinder.com that breaks down the video game design job roles (from http://www.itcareerfinder.com/it-careers/video-game-designer.html): DESIGNERS are the video game dreamers. Game designers imagine all aspects of the video game before the programming and artwork begins. Game design duties include plot writing, conceptualizing the characters, and planning game strategies & objectives. Once a video game is in production, designers work closely with programmers and artists to ensure the design is being followed. Popular job roles for video game designers include content writer, game mechanics designer, level designer, and lead designer. Skills to look for in a video game design college education program to become a designer include game theory, storytelling & storyboarding, game planning & strategy, scripting, brainstorming & creative thinking, and game design project management. ARTISTS are responsible for a video game's aesthetics and visual style. Video game artists create all of the artwork in a game, including worlds & environments, characters, weapons, vehicles and other items. Popular job roles for video game artists include animator, modeler, concept artist, lead artist, motion-capture artist, and art director. In-demand skills and courses to look for in a video game design college education program to become a game artist include computer animation, 2D and 3D modeling, camera & lighting techniques, environment design, lines & perspective, Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator, and life drawing. PROGRAMMERS write the code that tells the computer how to handle everything from gameplay rules & physics to the user interface & graphics. Video game programmers utilize one or more programming languages and development platforms to bring the game art & design to life. Job roles for video game programmers include artificial intelligence (AI) developer, graphics programmer, physics developer, UI programmer, and network programmer. Top skills for programmers in a video game design college education program include user interface (UI) design & usability testing, simulation programming, Adobe Flash, object-oriented programming languages (Java, C++, etc.), online multiplayer game development, AI programming & collision detection.
