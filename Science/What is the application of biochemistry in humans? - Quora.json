So the study of biochemistry has myriad applications in Man. Drugs are all chemicals which alter some aspect of human biochemistry. For example NSAIDS like ibuprofen block the enzymatic production of arachidonic acid from omega 6 fats. Newer biologic drugs like Humira, block TNF alpha which is involved in inflammation. Immunity relies on both antibodies and a complement cascade of polypepties to defend ourselves from pathogens. The biochemistry of cholesterol, lipids, and their respective carrier proteins is a huge field. Genetics and evolution revolve around the biochemistry of DNA and proteins. Inborn errors of metabolism are defects in biochemical pathways leading to disease. In fact just about all diseases or derangements of the human condition are rooted in biochemistry. The interaction of our bodies with the environment and sunlight are elucidated by biochem. Your alcoholic patient turns yellow, biochem. Person loses night vision, biochem. Got poisoned by a russian spy, biochem. Nerve agents, biochem. How the brain works, biochem. How your organs, muscles, and nerves function, biochem. How we digest food and produce energy is biochemistry. New agents to cure cancer are biochemistry. Allergic reactions are an aspect of biochem. Coagulation is a wonderfully complex aspect of biochem. How your body carries oxygen is another fascination component. Blood types and antibodies, that biochem. Psychiatry seeks to understand psychpathology through the study of brain biochemistry. How you taste and smell is biochemistry. In fact all the senses rely on bichemical detectors and transmission of that data to the brain via biochemical processes. Learning and memory are biochemically mediated. How about cosmetics and their development relies on biochem. Medicine, in fact might be considered a specialty within biochemistry. Indeed we ARE biochemistry and our selves merely emergent phenomina. All bood wishes, Dr Z ",
