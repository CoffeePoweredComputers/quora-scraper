            "answer_text": "A \u2018lifting\u2019 force is countered by a gravitational force. If the lifting force is greater than the weight of the object- the object will move upward. One can also \u2018Pull\u2019 up or \u2018push\u2019 up but pull/push can also be ascribed to forces that act horizontally (perpendicular to a gravitational force). So, \u2018lifting\u2019 is reserved for forces acting opposite gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "Let the wt. of the body = Mg, and the lifting force be F.e of attraction down Then when it is lifted the force upward is F and the force of attraction is Mg downwards. The resultant force is | F - Mg|. If there be friction while pulling or pushing force is P (horizontally) then the resultant force acting on the body will be |P - mu. R| where R is the normal reaction on the body = Mg. ",
