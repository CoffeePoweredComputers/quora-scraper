Salts that produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water are called Alkali salts and salts that produce acidic solutions in water are called acidic salts. Some examples of salts include sodium chloride, cobalt nitrate, copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, nickel chloride etc\u2026 The chemical name of common salt is sodium chloride. The chemical formula of sodium chloride is NaCl. The melting point of sodium chloride is 801 degrees celcius or 1474 degrees fahrenheit. Its molar masses are 22.99 and 35.45 g/mol respectively. ",
