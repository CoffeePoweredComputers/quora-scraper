            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a generalization. To a first approximation: evolution. We evolved to have this aesthetic. Another thing is that the appreciation of natural aesthetics/beauty is only a recent development in society in the last couple of centuries. Landscapes only happened centuries after human portraits and religious images. Nature evoked more fear in a lot of people. It was only the appearance of crowded cities that any sort of natural aesthetic occurred. Art got hung up on the human form. Art started basically as another word for man, hence artificial. I didn\u2019t come up with this. I got this from Rod Nash\u2019s book Wilderness and the American Mind, an incredible book for its time (1967). You only see beauty because of urban events (exposure to people, classes, reading, etc.). Most humans get repelled by alligators, snakes, and other reptiles. Hard to call those beautiful. Then, you have to consider the aesthetics of a place like Everglades National Park (much harder). It resulted in a form on conservation called aesthetic preservationism which reached its pinnacle with National Parks and Lady Bird Johnson. The more serious phase came with Rachel Carson pushing ecology. It\u2019s not about looking good. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe nature is much more, It ain't just pretty. It is a part of us. We are a part of it. The way the river flows just like our emotions. The wide wide.. sky with changing colors just like   our mood . The constant cycles within it like circulation of thoughts in our body. The productive quality just like all the talent one possess. INFACT WE CAN RELATE WITH IT, IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. It is one of the ways by which the universe tells us to adapt the goodness within oneself and try to be better. AND YES IT INDEED IS PRETTY .... But it does have its dark times. Everything just to teach us things, to instigate thoughts amongst ourselves, which we generally overlook.  It is pretty because it wants us to envy it. It needs us to be complete! We need it to be complete! ",
