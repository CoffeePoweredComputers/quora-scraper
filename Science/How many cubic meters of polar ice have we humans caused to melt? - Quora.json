            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t make sense to measure ice melt in square meters (cubic meters perhaps). Essentially this is an attribution problem. Data suggests that ice loss has accelerated by at least a factor of six since the 1970s. Assuming that all that additional ice loss can be attributed to human-caused climate change then the order of magnitude would be around 7.5 trillion tonnes, so roughly 8 trillion cubic meters. An ice cube 20km x 20km x 20km. ",

What\u2019s taken out as a core is of course still solid, but the cutting process melted some at the perimeter. I have no idea how long the cores are stored frozen. ",
