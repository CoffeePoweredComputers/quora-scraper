            "answer_text": "As density increases, Kinetic energy of the system increases, which is true in case of speed as well.Density does not have a minimum value (base value), and neither does speed of a particle. A particle is in a constant motion, even if the temperature hits absolute zero.Density cannot exceed certain value (different for different elements in classification), and so does the speed of a particle.Density cannot stay at a constant low value. It slowly decreases with time. But the speed of a moving particle is almost the same and never changing. Yet there is a recorded drop in Kinetic energy of the particle. In both scenarios, the culprit is entropy.",
