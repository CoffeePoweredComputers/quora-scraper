            "answer_text": "As others have said, you need to see a doctor to determine the answer. But I will tell you about an interesting thing I observed at my dentist\u2019s office the other day. The dental hygienist, a person I have been going to for a long time, suddenly seemed to be in discomfort and started swallowing and rubbing along her jaw and neck under the ear. She said she had little \u201cstones\u201d that would form and that she was able to rub or express them out. I had never heard of such a thing, but then I thought of tonsil stones which you can dislodge by using the end of a toothbrush. I looked them up and discovered that salivary stones are called sialoliths, small deposits of calcium and other minerals. They can form in the ducts of any type of salivary gland. Larger stones can block the flow of saliva and cause the glands to swell and be painful. According to research more than 80 percent of salivary stones form in the submandibular gland at the bottom of the mouth near the jawline, while 6\u201315 percent occur in the parotid gland which sit below the ears on the inside of the cheeks, and 2 percent are in the sublingual glands underneath the tongue. As my dental hygienist did, you could try some gentle massage around the affected area in case it did happen to be a stone, to encourage it to pass through the salivary duct. Or you could suck on a wedge of lemon or orange to increase the flow of saliva, which could also dislodge it. Wouldn\u2019t hurt to try. AND see a doctor. ",

Yellow vegetables like carrot and green leafy vegetables help As a patient, the 2 most hurtful messages you get are, \u201cno cure\u201d and \u201cplease see a doctor\u201d, when you\u2019re just asking to help you understand what your health problem is. Doctor can help but if you\u2019re looking for immediate action to your problem without side effects, self-education helps. The problem with our society is that we were sold with the idea that the answer to health problem is going through many diagnostic tests or getting the most expensive and advanced treatment. When in fact, most health problems are resolved through common sense and simple habits. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way anyone can answer your question without determining the causes or the pain you have. Once the cause is identified then and only then can proper treatment begin. Kitty I must advise you in very strong terms to make an appointment with your doctor and your dentist to have the testing done and the diagnostic process begun. You should make the appointment as soon as possible especially if the pain has gotten worse or there are other symptoms in addition to the pain you\u2019re reporting. Above all, do not ignore this but rather go to your doctor and find a what is going on and what you can do to stop it!! ",

If you suspect a tooth, gently press on the gums above each tooth and see if there is soreness anywhere. If yes, go to a dentist. ",
