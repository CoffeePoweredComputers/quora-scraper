            "answer_text": "The evidence for a universal common ancestor is very strong. Every examined form of life has a genetic code that is identical or ~99 percent identical to the genetic code of every other examined form. Analogously, if you discovered that every book in the world was written in English, with the most variation being the difference between American English and British English, you would not think that English was invented independently in multiple places. There is a common origin. Furthermore, many of these books (organisms) have identical sentences and paragraphs - some have identical chapters. Short strings to text may match by coincidence, but sharing identical strings of progressively longer texts drastically increases the odds of relation. In modern times the differences can be literally counted in the genome. If you take the sequence for, say, hemoglobin, and compare that sequence in multiple species (human, chimp, dog, bear, cow, whale, etc.) you will generate a tree of more and less similar forms. If you then consider another sequence (say, for insulin) you will get the same tree. The number of possible trees between a bunch of organisms quickly grows to be colossal, but the same tree is drawn and redrawn. If this is not a family tree we are being asked to call this a coincidence, or a conspiratorial move on the part of a designer t make organisms look evolved. This analysis furthermore applies to the introns, the parts of a gene sequence that are edited out and do not contribute to protein structure. This eliminates concern about accidental resemblance based on convergent evolution. Two authors writing about the same subject might converge upon the same sentences, but it is hard to believe that they would independently have the same spelling mistakes and the same first drafts.

            "answer_text": "We don't know its from a single cell. But we have very strong evidence that it was a single \"something\". All life on earth uses the exact same DNA code, shares common genes, and encodes much the same proteins. Many of these choices are completely arbitrary. The chances of two or more self replicating organisms evolving which are identical in all these respects is infinitesimally small. So we know there must have only been one such self replicating organism - or at least only one such organism that still had living descendants today. ",
