            "answer_text": "If all the ice in the world melted would there be any land left? Yes. The Cretaceous was so warm as to melt all polar ice (probably) but there were dinosaurs a-plenty romping about on the continental landmasses. There is enough water to submerge all the land in principle but that is not going to happen any time in the foreseeable future. The reason being that Earth is still tectonically active because of internal heat and all that tectonic action pushes up land masses and mountain ranges. When the Earth\u2019s interior heat engine shuts down, mountain building will cease and the existing mountains will eventually be worn down by weathering into the seas and then we will have a waterworld Earth. However this is way in the future and we have more immediate problems to think about. ",

            "answer_text": "Sea levels could go up as much as 239 feet. So all seaports would be flooded, but upriver there would be lands left for new seaports. I\u2019m from Syracuse, so I looked at Survey Maps and saw that water would go up the Hudson from New York City to Albany. There are hills with an elevation of 200 to 300 feet where the Mohawk River runs into the Hudson. I can\u2019t remember now how far up the two rivers the sea will run, but I think it\u2019s a considerable distance. The hills are steep and villages and towns upstream on the Mohawk are already built up high from the river. So Amsterdam or Canajoharie or Palatine Bridge or Utica could all be seaports. ",
