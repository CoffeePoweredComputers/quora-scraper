            "answer_text": "The melting point is the temperature at which the solid and the liquid phase of a given material can exist at equilibrium with each other. It is often also called the freezing point. The melting and freezing point depends on pressure in a small way because there are density differences between the two phases. So, we generally refer to the melting point at one atmosphere pressure as the normal melting point (or normal freezing point) The word \u201cMelting\u201d refers to the process (not at equilibrium) where solid phase is actively changing into the liquid phase. This occurs when the ambient temperature is higher than the melting point and so supplies energy to the solid to break the intermolecular forces and thereby melt it. While the melting is happening, the system (solid/liquid mixture) will remain at the melting point as heat continues to pass into it from the warmer surroundings that heat goes to melting the solid instead of raising the temperature. Eventually, all the solid will be gone and as more heat continues to pass into it from the warmer surroundings, the (now melted) liquid will increase in temperature. That\u2019s why we put ice in our drink if we want it to remain cool longer. ",
