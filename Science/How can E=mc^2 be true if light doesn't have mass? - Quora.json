            "answer_text": "E=Mc2 is what Eistein defines as energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. The mass is the matter that have electrons proton neutron as atom and Light is the wavy-particles different from matter as they are smaller than electrons and they are made from photons, gluons, bosom, higgs\u2026as quarks. E=mc2 is also the Function of the Nuclear atomic Bomb after Einstein made a contract with the government for creating the 1st Atomic bomb and He regrets it before he Died for another country to copy it and developed it because it was extremely dangerous for all Humankind. E is the energy and M is the Mass and C to the power of 2 is the Celerity steradian of the Energy where the photons of Light are derived from the study of the electromagnetic fields radiation so they are empowered by themselves as 2 vectors line multiplied by each other to make the formula of c x c = c2 as a steradian sinusoidal empowered Light through space dimension and time. When you multiplied C by C you are augmented the power to the C itself and you make a dimension in space. a 1 Line vector x 1 Line vector give you dimension power in Mathematics. Then He multiplied it by the mass because they are in proportion to each other but with different element of Nature. So without Light there is no mass and without mass there is emptiness but without emptiness there is Light and energy. The other E=1/2mv2 is the energy of Matter with a speed v and mass m. m=m0 /\u221a1-(v2/c2) is the formula of Mass as its final state while m0 is the initial mass at rest and when the speed of the mass approach Light and become equal to C the formula inside the square roots become V2/C2=C2/C2=1 when v2 approaches c2 and \u221a(1-1)=0 >>>the final mass tends to infinity because a number divided by zero tends to infinity so m tends to infinity. All of both formulas give you the energy E tends to infinity when the Mass approach the speed of Light like when the Light goes to the extreme Gravity of a Black Hole. And those all discovered by Einstein. Furthermore Light is not a mass it is a wavy-particles made from photons that have a constant celerity, wavelengths and frequencies. E=hc/\u03bb is the energy of Light created by Einstein and Planck Where E is photon energy, h is the Planck constant that is equal to 6.626 X 10-34 J\u00b7s. c is the speed of light in vacuum and \u03bb is the photon's wavelength. As h and c are both constants, photon energy Exchanges in inverse relation to wavelength \u03bb. Since f the frequency of Light is equal to f=c/ \u03bb, as f the frequency, the photon energy equation can be simplified to E=hv Maxwell is also a theorist Man that discovered the speed of Light in vacuum that is equal to C=1\u221a\u025b0\u03bc0 where the permittivity of free space is \u03b50 and the permeability of free space is \u03bc0 And he approches the sinuosity of a meandering river to \u03c0. The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, and increasing the overall loopiness of the river. It creates an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of \u03c0 between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth. On another hand, someone came and add to the equation of Planck-Eistein the number of photons n as he wants to define the quantity of photons inside, to derive its energy and the formula became E=nhv. There is a lot of debates and formula other than that after all, based on Einstein theory of relativity E=mC2 that changed the world till nowadays. All those formula are corrected but they humanity is still have a lot of mystery for example for the gravity, Pions, what we have after Higgs?, black holes, tunnels connection, hologram, mathematics unsolved problems like infinity is a number in the end and it could not be without a solution and a lot of other jigsaws problems. For Me, after 25 years of discovery through the quantum mechanics, science, mathematics, chemistry and too many studies non stopping I have found that the speed of Light still miss something that couldn\u2019t be exactly as it was before Like they used to say it is in vacuum equal to approx. 300 000 000 m/s. Besides, the atomic bomb are too small in front of Universe too epsilon smaller explosion in a giant space. On another hand, Humankind in 1 century years only have those technologies in their hands. There is more to come for the Future. I have discovered the speed of Light in absolute emptiness from the Time I was in School till I grow up Today, searching for the Truth of Light in emptiness, for which one is before the other. As I see, the speed of Light in absolute emptiness differs from the one in vacuum as vacuum diminishes the speed of Light in the absolute reality. C=\u03c0 Megameters/Centisecond is the theory discovered by myself \u201cAlain Georges Serhal\u201d. It is the revolution and evolution of mankind and it simplify all the studies of quantum mechanics, artificial intelligent Ai, hologram, so mathematics will become easier for everybody, quantum computers, SUSY Complexity world, anti gravity, Black holes and futuristic technology development. It is that theory that should be accepted by everybody today as Light move in a constant irrational \u03c0 ratio that is equal to 314 159 265 .3 m/s because Celerity = Time x Gravity = time that earth moves around the sun in 1 cycle x center of gravity of earth = 365.25 x ~23.9Hours x 60 Min. x 60 Sec. x 10 m/s2 = 314 159 265 .3 m/s There is a lot of other things that tell you that the speed of Light is the distance of a the spin photon itself divided by its mirrored 1 unit of secant time Length inside to be outside \"straight Infinity Line with the curvature of space in absolute emptiness\". So if you take the circumference of a photon movement spin around itself or in its sinusoidal movement divided by its Length of Time diameter that is equal to 1 as a unit of existence, the circumference should be equal to \u03c0. A Circle big as universe or smaller as quarks or atom, you divided by its diameter time that took the point of departure spin to its point of arrive is the same equality Length for all its mirrored Line inside which is equal to \u03c0 as a circumference spiral path even if it is closed or open in n & n-1 dimension. so when you divide the universe by its timeline curvature diameter it gives you \u03c0 as constant the same way its quark infinity singularity circumference divided by its extremely smaller diameter time distance 0 in x Dimension. And this is the speed of Light that could be extremely fast in emptiness 0 as in infinity to the n spherical dimension or n-1 torus dimension. Speed= Distance / time = Speed of Light in mathematics emptiness= distance of quarks infinity trajectory / Time Length curvature of Space dimension=\u03c0 / 1 = \u03c02/ \u03c0 = \u03c0. From where the Light begin and start it will turn back and come back to the same point of departure. If Light goes and does its energy and come back to its place, is the same way as if Light didn\u2019t go to anywhere and did its same energy to create the emptiness. Emptiness is in Light and not Light is in emptiness. but we as human can not predict it easily, but Light is there eternally so if you remove the mass then emptiness you see the Light. For Me, in the Light world, the Energy of Light E is also equal to C=E=\u03c0 as the photon speed creates the ora energy roots of the mass by the exponential power of its particles. So the speed of Light is the energy of itself after all. It is by virtue that Light propagates in the emptiness of gravity and eat darkness. It is the commander of the electrons that have half 1/2 spin that made the masses. C= \u03c0 Mm/Cs will challenge the world forever. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are asking how does light have energy without mass. The energy in E=mc^2 is often call the \u201crest mass energy,\u201d but it is not the only kind of energy a thing can have. If you factor in kinetic energy, the equation becomes [math]E = \\gamma mc^2[/math] where [math]\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}[/math] Which can, with some algebra, be written as [math]E^2 = m^2c^4 + p^2c^2[/math] where p is the movementum. Light doesn\u2019t have mass, but it does carry momentum. and technically, the value of [math]\\gamma[/math] would be infinite for light, so in the first equation I wrote, you have an infinite values times zero, which mathematicians will tell you, could be anything. In summary, E=mc^2 tells you that light can not exist at rest. [math]E = \\gamma mc^2[/math] tells you light can only exist at lightspeed. And [math]E^2 = m^2c^4 + p^2c^2[/math] tells you that the energy that light carries is directly proportional to its momentum. ",
