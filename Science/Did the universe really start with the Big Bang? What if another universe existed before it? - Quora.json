            "answer_text": "In fact, if you can set aside Big Bang theory and all the confusion that it brings, consider the very possibility that our universe - in fact, all universes - come from progenitor universes. The mechanism, like this concept generally, are purely speculative, of course; however, they are not more speculative than Big Bang theory itself. One such mechanism would be inflation, which is a familiar cosmological concept by now. Usually, it is presented as occurring after the advent of our universe. However, none of the evidence supporting a Big Bang argues against inflation s the mechanism of creation. In its scenario, a pre-existing universe undergoes rapid expansion in one region. This inflation results in an autonomous new pocket universe with its own physical laws separated dimensionally (i.e. mutually inaccessible by any means except, possibly gravity). Another mechanism, and the one that I prefer, is the emergence of a \u201cvirtual universe\u201d, akin to virtual particles, also utilizing zero point vacuum energy to generate an instability. The instability would presumably have a counterpart, just as virtual particles do. Typically, virtual universes would pop into and out of existence, much like virtual particles consistent with their nature as instabilities. However, in Guthian fashion, some improbable number of such virtual universes will undergo a transformation that resists their instability (i.e. tendency to self-destruct). Inflation (or something very much like it) has been proposed for such a transformation. These mechanisms are fundamentally \u201cmany worlds\u201d scenarios that explain our multiverse in existential terms. It is also possible that both mechanisms could be extant to populate an infinitely expanding multiverse. The reason that I tend to prefer the second mechanism is that the best proposal to date for a cause for inflation is the separation of the weak force and the strong force, initially united in a GUT field at inception, which separation gives rise to an energy burst sufficient to power something like inflation. Such a field and the separation of those forces is easier to imagine in a universe that pre-exists, even for an instant, an inflationary epoch. It is harder to conjure inflation in an otherwise \u201cstable\u201d universe without such a dramatic source of energy, and no other has been credibly proposed to my knowledge.. All of this would tend to support the notion that one universe is preceded by another, in fact, a lineage of predecessor universes. It does not answer the perennial question, however, of identifying the source of the earliest progenitor universe. To subscribe to the notion of universe lineage seems tantamount to accepting that time *did* precede our universe. Presumably, the universe from which it sprang had its own space-time.* This imbues a multiverse with time, space-time, really, which is borrowed or at least catalyzes a new space-time when each new universe is spawned. I don\u2019t mean by this that time in one universe is necessarily coincident with time flowing in any other universe. In fact, differences in the flow of time could be the/a means for keeping universes divided from one another. Nevertheless, there could be an overall flow of time on a multiversal scale grander than that of any particular universe. It would mark the sequencing of universe formation (and maybe evolution and ultimately decay). *Multiverse conceptualists tend to assume that different universes have different physical laws and constants that result in features different than our own. Fior example, some may not have 3+1 dimensional space-time as we do. Such a universe would, presumably, be a \u201cfailed universe\u201d, unable to grow and evolve or manifest cause and effect. Accordingly, space-time for a progenitor universe need not be same as that for universes it spawns. ",

We in effect, are swimming in the darkness of space in a mostly contained orbital, but even from where we sit we watch cycles of star life and death. And dig up evidence of our own planet experiencing changes and rebirths over time from cataclysmic events such as asteroid impacts,Dinosaur and giant mammal extinction, Ice age, large scale flooding, etc many lives existed before our time and so will after our death. The universe would likely reflect our small example in ways currently unthinkable to some, but I would say, I think you know the answer by thinking the question.Our local universe started with a big bang, which was never the only nor the first bang.

            "answer_text": "\"Nothing\". Thats the answer you are seeking. Now, why nothing? Because time did not exist before the Big Bang, according to Hawking-Hartle Model at least. In simple terms, the universe just came into being and with it came space and time. Universe, pre-Big Bang, is a singularity in both space and time. So, initially if there was nothing, no space or time, then it is pointless to think about something that existed before it because 'how can it?'. If there was no space-time then there was no time for anything to exist, because even if something existed then when would it exist? Its as simple as that. Also, according to M-Theory, there exist multiple universe, or rather 'multi-verse'. Each universe has its own laws and dimensions. Some universe are not even capable of supporting intelligence because some of these universe do not have time as a dimension, for intelligence to exist there needs to be some concept of time. Some universe even have multiple dimensions of time. But as far as our universe is concerned, we have only one dimension of time (there also something called 'Imaginary Time'. Here it does not mean 'Made-Up' time. It means a dimension of time which runs perpendicular to the real dimension of time. This plane, created by these 2 dimensions of time is similar to the complex or argand plane). Now, if we assume that something existed before the big bang then a question arises that 'what created it' and thus it converts into a loop or 'Infinite-Regress' and has been discussed in many other models. Till date, Hawking-Hartle model is the most well-regarded model, and gives a good and logical explanation of pre-Planck epoch universe. Hope it was helpful.Cheers! ",

(NOTE: this image is just an artist\u2019s vague idea of how the Big Bang would have looked like) Whether there are other Universes out there, co-existing with ours, is a more complicated question. It could be possible that there were many other Universes before ours, and one of these possibly gave rise to \u201cour\u201d Universe.
