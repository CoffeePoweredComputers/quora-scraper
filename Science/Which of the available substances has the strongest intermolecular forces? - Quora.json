            "answer_text": "For the purposes of this discussion, boiling point will be correlated with intermolecular bond strength. You can pretty much rule out all the non alcohols because they don't demonstrate hydrogen bonding, the strongest intermolecular force. Now that you're left with MeOH EtOH and Isopropanol, it gets a bit more challenging. Each of these only have one hydroxyl to produce hydrogen bonds (you can only H-bond with Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Fluorine). I believe that all things being equal, the boiling point will increase with molecular weight, so Isopropanol will have the strongest of the three, and methanol will have the weakest of the three. Methanol will have stronger forces though than acetone, because although it has an Oxygen, H-bonding requires that it break the very stable C=O bond to form the carbocation and an O anion, to form ethanol. So because it doesn't readily dissociate to form ethanol it doesn't count here as an h-bond. Aside - This requires an attack at the carbonyl carbon, with an acid or a Grignard reaction with a R-Mg-X compound. If my memory serves me right. Correct me if I'm wrong. As for the rest of these alkanes, boiling point increases with molecular weight so the smallest one will have the weakest forces. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming that these are acetone, ethyl alcohol, heptane, hexane, isopropyl alcohol and methyl alcohol. There are four types of intermolecular forces in chemistry (the list is from strongest to weakest): Ionic forcesHydrogen bondingdipole-dipoleLondon forcesYou don\u2019t have any ionic on this list, so that one you can rule out. The Heptane and the Hexane do not have dipole-dipole nor hydrogen bonding so they are the weakest and only experience London forces. The acetone is a dipole-dipole force because of the bond with the oxygen. The alcohols all have an Oxygen-Hydrogen bond so they are the next strongest. Now you have to determine which of the alcohols are the strongest. The more Hydrogens the stronger the forces. In this case they each only have one. If you count up the carbons you can pick the one with the highest carbon count (more stable). Ethyl alcohol has 2 Isopropyl has 3 Methyl alcohol has 1 The most stable and the strongest intermolecular forces is isopropyl Here\u2019s a good link: The Four Intermolecular Forces and How They Affect Boiling Points Good luck on your exam!
