            "answer_text": "Is this a \u201ctrick\u201d question? LOL! Photons ONLY travel through energy. That energy is the energy of spacetime and the energy of any other particles that are also co-existing within the region of spacetime. You do not need to say time, spacetime, space and fourth dimension. All you have to ask is\u2026 How fast does a photon travel through energy? Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything reveals that a photon MUST travel through energy at c. A photon moves through a specific amount of energy in a specific amount of time The specific amount of energy along a path in spacetime is the energy that exists along a path in spacetime and is defined as a quantum distance (Qd). The specific time is called a quantum time unit (Qt). The speed of light is defined as c = Qd/Qt. If there is more energy along a photon\u2019s path in spacetime, then the quantum distance becomes \u201crelatively\u201d shorter while the quantum time units always remains the same. This would seem from the outside perspective that the speed of light relatively slowed. The photon still is travelling at Qd/Qt but is perceived from outside this region as otherwise. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything introduces the concept of the \u201crelative constant\u201d where the speed of light is a \u201crelative constant\u201d and the quantum distance is relative to the amount of energy along the path in spacetime.
