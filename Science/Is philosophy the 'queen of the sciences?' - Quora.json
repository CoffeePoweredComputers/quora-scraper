            "answer_text": "Loosely interpreting \"philosophy\" and \"science\", I would definately state YES. in the west, you have the logic/ linguistic philosophers, like russel and Ludwig Wittgenstein, getting to the limits of understanding what are objects and language with the use of conventional human thinking.On the other end of western philosophy, you have psychology, which investigates mostly the sub conciouss motives that move people and craft their relationships. This field is loosely related to philosophy and can only pretty loosely be described as a \"real\" science, but still it is an important part of the way we are living today. But philosophy, as it should be, is much greater than that. it is not an isoteric field with little or almost none real life implications. also, it is not a loose theory who loosely (sorry for using this word all the time) ties some mythical representations of human passions (edipus, and others) and has no real understanding of what is the mechanism that you keep referring to as 'i', just like knowing how to drive a car, but no tools (such as pure logic) to understand how it actually works under the engine. Thus - the philosophy which is truly the queen of science, is the philosophy which asks what is 'it'? and has the tools to go \"under the engine\", and to see the relationship between \"under the engine\" and to how to drive the car - meaning, how is it right to use this precious time that we have as sentient beings in a right way. if this philosophy hasn't been found yet, it has a place as the queen of science, when someone will find it. Fortunatlely though some philosophers did stumble upon such philosophy. And it is mostly known to us as Buddhism.Buddhism (awaken-ism) is all about: what is perception, what is the thing that we name 'i' (both intuitively, and scientifically), what is suffering, what is happiness, what are objects, what is the relationship between our conciousness and \"objects\", et cetera.... I think it is not unaccuerate to state that Buddhism dares you, to find the 'I' you keep using (and imagining) intuitively, in a scientific way. But for doing this you have to find (or not find) it yourself, through a lot of practice, and not just do a thought experiment, because a thought experiment wouldnt change your thought process to what you know by philosophizing about it. but meditation can do that. and that is why it is importand as a part of philosophy (besides exposing you to finer and finer parts of your mind).

            "answer_text": "I have studied both philosophy and science and never came across this term before. Googling \u201cScience of all sciences\u201d actually revealed more sites that place mathematics as a contender for that epithet than philosophy. That being said, I will now make a case for how this could make sense for philosophy, using the term \u201cscience\u201d rather loosely, but since this is my own argument, I cannot answer why anyone else might think of philosophy in that way. Speaking very generally, science can be thought of as the study of the external world subject to certain methods, using arguments that pass certain criteria for being \u201creliable\u201d or \u201cbelievable\u201d. Whatever the \u201cscience of all sciences\u201d, it would have to be that field of study which focuses on that aspect of the external world that is concerned with studying the external world subject to certain methods etc. In other words, it is a second order field of study. It turns out, philosophy is often conceived as a second order field of study. A first order scientific field of study like physics is concerned directly with objects in the world, like atoms or stars. A second order field is concerned with studying aspects of the first order field, like, in the case of physics, how we know that atoms or stars exist, or why we think that they have the properties we ascribe to them. Philosophers of science are indeed often concerned not directly with the objects of concern of the first order field, but with understanding things about the first order field of study. The physics example I just gave is actually part of a a big subfield of philosophy called Epistemology. However, to be fair, this argument has some shortcomings. First, it is not always the case that philosophers of science are concerned with first-order scientific fields of study, they may well include as part of the scope of their investigations questions which are also asked of scientists, though often from a different perspective. A good example of this is Ontology, the study of being, which is part of a subfield of philosophy called Metaphysics. One can ask whether atoms or stars exist from a metaphysical perspective, in which case, though, the methods employed and considerations brought to bear may be quite different from those that physicists use. For this reason, I think, it is fair to point out that philosophy is not always confined in its conception as a second-order field of study. Second, it is somewhat of a stretch to call philosophy a \u201cscience\u201d. Part and parcel of what distinguishes the sciences from all other fields is that one conducts observations and experiments subject to certain constraints meant to help prevent arriving at erroneous conclusions. Though there is an emerging field called Experimental philosophy, experimental methods are still very foreign to philosophy. So calling philosophy a \u201cscience\u201d is to reduce the concept of \u201cscience\u201d to a more generalized version in which the end of the scientific method, namely, arriving at more reliable and correct conclusions, is substituted for the means, namely the method itself. In that sense, philosophy is as much a science as mathematics is (There is no doubt mathematical conclusions are often far more reliable than philosophical ones due to the rigor of the methods demanded by the former, but the conclusions are also often much more narrow, if not completely different, for the same reason). Third, one could use a similar argument to argue that it should be mathematics that should be considered the \u201cscience of all sciences\u201d. Normally, mathematics is thought of as the language of science, not as a second-order field that has a science as its subject of study. However, it is at least in principle possible, using for instance the methods of Category theory, to formalize all relevant aspects of the first order field and then treat it as a formal object subject to rigorous formal manipulations. The kind of questions asked and conclusions derived will usually be very different from those of philosophy. Indeed, I consider them incommensurable to each other. If that is correct, then there is no absolute criterion by which one has more of a prerogative to that epithet than the other. Given all the aforementioned considerations, then, I think the best answer is as follows: There is really no scientific field of study that has all other sciences as its subject matter, and therefore there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as \u201cthe science of all sciences\u201d. However, if one loosens the definition of \u201cscience\u201d sufficiently, then there are at least two possible contenders, philosophy and mathematics. Which one of these one considers to be closer depends on the type of questions one is interested in. As a rule of thumb, if one is more interested in semantic-type questions, then philosophy may be considered a closer contender, and if one is more interested in formal-type questions, then mathematics may be considered to be closer, though I am sure there are many exceptions to this rule.
