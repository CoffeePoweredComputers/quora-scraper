Whether one \u201cbelieves\u201d in climate change or not, were all along for the ride. Take the weather every day as it comes. People don\u2019t think in climate terms day to day unless they are traveling. The sun will rise the next day. (look up conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, conservation of energy) For time immemorial there have been floods, drought, and migration. People adapt, well those who are left adapt. The grim reapers swift sword of evolution is funny like that. There will be the young women and men putting on the rigging and going to the inspect the windfarms. Maybe put the breaks on a turbine and grind out some resin from a lightning strike and fix a foil. Someone is baking artisan bread using a charcoal stove. Kids will go to school and learn about the barbaric times and how they changed the landscape. They won\u2019t be listening as they experience youth. It\u2019s just a normal day to them. Grandparents think of that beach front land that was once inland but the kids have only so much time for old peoples stories. Someone else looking at taking a sail cruise to go sand surfing down the side of the NYC dyke, the pit is great this time of year. All the hussle and christmas bustle on a 22\u00b0C day in the big apple. Whether people adapt or not, the world will go on. ",

            "answer_text": "Sea levels would rise by around 250 metres. That would drown beyond saving 90% of our major cities, all our ports and their infrastructure and swallow a vast area of farmland. It would initially cause terrible ocean pollution because if the cause is the expected runaway global warming, we would not have enough time to clean up before the inundation. We would lose most of our industrial production. There would be billions of climate refugees. A breakdown of human civilisation would be an almost certain outcome. I would imagine new nations would be forged and there would be intense wars to protect what the fortunate areas held. Disease would be rampant. The dramatically reduced trade and access to resources would take us back hundreds of years, except for leftover infrastructure. Much knowledge would be preserved, but it would still take a long time before civilisation recovered, especially given the staggering loss of species and bio-diversity that such huge climate change would cause.

Once that happens, ocean temperatures will go up rather quickly, perhaps to the point where most sea life cannot survive. That\u2019s a big deal if the phytoplankton are among the casualties, since phytoplankton supply about half the world\u2019s oxygen and are the foundation of the ocean food chain. Once the ice is gone in the Northern hemisphere, the ocean will no longer be a heat sink\u2014it won\u2019t be absorbing some 90%+ of all heat. Land temperatures will go up pretty quickly as well, perhaps to the point where food cannot be grown. ",
