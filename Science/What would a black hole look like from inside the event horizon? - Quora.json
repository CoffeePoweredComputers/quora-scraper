            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, as I understand it, you really are likely to see nothing. I get most of the answers here aren't really answering your question \u2014 being reminded about spaghetification doesn't answer the theoretical aspect, and isn't even accurate in the case of a supermassive black hole, which won't have such extreme tidal forces at the event horizon. The biggest problem is the behavior of light itself. Immediately before you cross the event horizon, space will be so curved that ahead of you is nothing but the ultimate blackness of the horizon itself, while behind you the entire 360 degree field of view is closing off to a pinpoint as even light from the other side of the black hole curves back around to you \u2014 all seeming from one direction. Crossing the horizon, space itself is now \u201cfalling\u201d or stretching faster than the speed of light itself. This means light from objects ahead of you, though still moving at c, will never reach you. For those photons, it's like swimming 2 mph against a 4 mph stream that's accelerating faster still. The same in reverse for objects behind you. You are now accelerating too quickly for light from them to catch up to you. You may certainly see some weird incredibly warped visual effects to the sides from light orbiting down with you, but this is the point where spacetime breaks down too far for my understanding. At the horizon itself there should be a photon sphere where light orbits so fully you could theoretically see the back side of your own head, at least in a non-rotating black hole, but in the more likely rotating kind, I don't know the math well enough to predict the effects of frame dragging on this. Likewise, once past the event horizon, the singularity is now a time like point encompassing all directions, so light that could conceivably still swirl around towards you from the sides might do so \u2014 or it might just advance directly to the singularity that much faster. Of course, eventually even in a supermassive black hole, the tidal forces will tear you apart into atomic spaghetti well before you hit the singularity. This makes even the medieval rack torture sound like a gentle, relaxing morning stretch though, so I don't highly recommend it. ",

            "answer_text": "No known object in existence has as clear a division between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d as a black hole. We live and see the outside, and no probe will bring us information about the inside. We can send radio messages or robotic spacecraft, but once they cross over into a black hole\u2019s interior, we\u2019ll never get back those emissaries \u2026 or any information about what happened to them. The boundary of a black hole is its event horizon. It\u2019s not a surface in the usual sense\u2014there\u2019s no physical barrier\u2014but it\u2019s very much a real thing. Outside the horizon, an object can escape the black hole\u2019s gravitational pull if it\u2019s moving sufficiently fast; inside, it would need to move faster than light-speed, something forbidden by the laws of nature. In a meaningful sense, a black hole is its event horizon, since we can\u2019t observe anything inside it by any method. The interior is nature\u2019s biggest secret, enshrouded by a barrier that lets everything in but nothing out.   To make black holes even more enigmatic, they are also perfectly featureless, according to general relativity, our best explanation of how gravity works. They may be born from situations as different as the deaths of stars and the gravitational collapse of huge amounts of gas in the early universe, but the result is the same. Even the chemical composition of what gets sucked into and forms it is irrelevant. The only properties a black hole exhibits to the wider cosmos are its mass and how fast it\u2019s rotating.  ",
