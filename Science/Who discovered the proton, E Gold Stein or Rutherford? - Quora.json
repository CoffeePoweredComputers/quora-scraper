            "answer_text": "As far as my knowledge goes, Ernest Rutherford discovered and named the proton. However, this was nit the first time it was observed. Eugen Goldstein did work with H+ anode rays and with that came the first time a proton was observed. It is disputed, though, because it was not technically him that did the experiment - it was a bloke named Wilhelm Wien. So the dude who cleared the way? Goldstein. The dude who first observed? Wien The dude who actually discovered and named it? Rutherford Peace ",
