            "answer_text": "Soil that has not been plowed, dug, scraped, compacted, amended, etc. within recent memory.  This most often comes up when preparing a soil sample for laboratory analysis:  you want a representative sample.  On the other hand, if all the land you will be cultivating has been similarly amended, the representative sample should include the amendment(s).   \"Undisturbed soil\" is also required as the base for some building projects, even if it requires digging down to earth that has not been disturbed.  In this case, the ground has settled as much as it is going to from natural weather cycles.  Soil that has been disturbed is likely to shift or compact when rained upon or bearing additional weight due to the construction project.   Whether laying a foundation or septic tank field lines, an unsteady base will crack the new installation. ",
