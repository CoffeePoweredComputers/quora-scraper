            "answer_text": "It is a very interesting process, so its worth to read this answer completely.  Well, it all starts with a star. Star, just like our sun, are huge mass objects primarily made of hydrogen(later they start producing heavier atoms). Due to this huge mass, gravitational force at the centre( due to the surrounding atoms of the whole star) crushers the atoms together at the centre and increases the temperature of the core. The whole stars seem to collapse at its primary stages. But when this temp increases beyond 100 million Kelvin then nuclear fusion starts. The interesting thing about fusion is that it releases more energy than it takes to start itself(up to the production of the iron atom). This nuclear fusion produces a huge amount of energy and each explosion produces a huge pressure which balances the gravitational force of the whole star and protects it from collapsing more. So there is an equilibrium between these two forces  After that helium fuses to form carbon, carbon fuses to form Nitrogen and so on. And produces a lot of energy. But when there starts production iron, Its fusion takes more energy and it releases none. Hence there is no more energy to further start the fusion of iron. So the hydrogen, helium, carbon etc. starts consuming more to balance the forces, but a critical point reaches when the sum of pressure releases in these different fusion reaction happening at different parts can\u2019t balance the gravitation force of the star and the whole star starts to collapse in its centre. The whole star collapses so much that even the electrons of the atoms starts crushing each other and starts experiencing repulsion. This repulsion is called Pauli's repulsion. Which is based on the fact that no two electrons can have the same quantum state  If the mass of this stars is huge enough than the critical mass(1.4 - 3 solar masses), then even the Pauli\u2019s force can\u2019t prevent the stars from collapse and all the electrons and nucleus starts crushing with each other and proton fuses with electron to form neutron with a production of neutrinos and antineutrinos. This process produces a huge amount of energy and a huge explosion happens, known as \u2018nova\u2019, if this explosion is high enough we call it supernova or hypernova.  Most of heavier particle dust spread out due to this explosion. So now all there is left is a pure mystical gem, soup of neutrons and some charged particles. Which are so closed and packed with each other, that the size of the stars becomes so small(about 10 km radius) and density so high 10^17 kg/m^3, which makes it the most spherical and dense object of the universe. This star is made up of a dense substance of neutron, we call this substance neutronium. This is how neutron stars are formed.  pulsars Now what happens when a spinning ball suddenly shrinks, well it starts spinning more rapidly. Here is an example  The same happens with this collapsed star, the former star was not spinning so fast. But when it gets shrunk, its spin rapidly increases to conserve its angular momentum. The neutron stars start spinning so rapidly(1000 rotations per second), that some charge particles in it start to produce their own magnetic field. These magnetic field produces a huge force on charge particles inside it, about the axis of the magnetic field of the star, hence ejecting a large amount of charged particles in the form of a jet. We call this spinning jet of charged particles, pulsars. These pulsars are also an interesting thing to talk about. But for now, this is more than enough.

            "answer_text": "So before going through anything, let\u2019s first go through Life Stages Of A Star:-  (Image Source:- www.cyberphysics.co.uk) If there is a star same as that mass of sun, then it goes through following phrase throughout it\u2019s stellar evolution:- Stable Stage:- It is a phrase when star form of hydrogen, due to immense pressure and temperature squeezes hydrogen nuclie together to form helium atom, this process is known as Nuclear Fusion. It is a phrase where star is quite stable and keeps fusing hydrogen into helium, and releasing immense energy\u2026Dying Star (Red Giant):- After a time star\u2019s core runs out of hydrogen and the inert helium atom began to get colser and core becomes denser, resulting in expanding sun, which at at last changes into nebula.White Dwarf:- after that it has a peaceful ending changing into white dwarf.But, the stages are not same for the star having greater mass then sun about 3 to 4 times more donot go through these stages their stages are as following:- Massive Star>RedSuperGiant>Super Nova>BlackHole or Neutron Star Now wheater a Massive star will become a Black Hole or Neutron Star depands on the mass of star if mass is enough, then it will become black hole or else it will become a neutron star. So the brief the answer is:- \u201cwhen a massive star (3 to 4 times that of sun) runs out of hydringen and undergoes supernova explosion it can either change into black hole or into a neutron star depanding on mass of star\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Any star in the universe has two major forces acting on it, the force of gravity and the force of radiation pressure Both forces counteract each other. In the core of any star hydrogen is fused into helium at very high temperature and pressure, but eventually these hydrogen reserves are limited and one day they will get exhausted, but when that happens the helium gets converted into carbon, which then gets converted into neon, which is then converted into oxygen, oxygen to silicon and finally silicon to iron. Now iron can\u2019t be converted further so this causes a decrease in the radiation pressure, now the star is no longer in balance so the gravity becomes so strong that it comes crashing down to the core so hard that it even overcomes the fundamental forces inside an atom. This forces the protons and the electrons to fuse together with the neutrons to become densely packed atomic nucleus. The outer layers of the star is blown off in a violent supernova explosion.On a much grander scale, a type 1a supernova explosion gives off 1 to 2 x 10^(44) joules of energy, which is about 2.4 to 4.8 hundred billion yottatons (24 to 48 octillion (2.4 to 4.8 x 10^(28)) megatons) of TNT, equivalent to the explosive force of a quantity of TNT over a trillion (10^12) times the mass of the planet Earth.What is left behind depends upon the initial mass of the star A star which has a mass of 10 to 20 times the mass of our very own Sun will give you a neutron star and if the mass is more than that, then it will give you a black hole but unlike a black hole we can see the neutron stars directly it.The major difference between a black hole and a normal object is not that it is black in colour but something related to its geometry called Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes historically referred to as the gravitational radius) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal to the speed of light. That means it becomes a black hole.  ",

When one neutron is hopeless at singing and dancing, can try to become a stand-up comedian. If it isn\u2019t funny either, it works in juggling pumpkins. In case of being a waste of space, it is dedicated to inducing nuclear fission. Generally, neutrons have a squeaky voice, that's why they often sing in playback or lip synch. This is frowned upon among particle physicists, but we condescend and do not deny them a chance. Now, the rise to stardom is never easy and there is a lot of competition between neutrons. Only a few of all neutrons that pursue stardom reach what, in quantum slang, is called their \u201cneutron magnetic moment\u201d. Sometimes, all the neutrons of an atom associate and form an \"atomic ensemble\" in which everyone plays an instrument. The \u201cneutron number\u201d of an atomic ensemble may differ.

            "answer_text": "It is well known that stars have a very high gravity and because of that the centre of the star, which is also called it\u2019s core, is under an immense pressure from that gravity. Why doesn\u2019t it collapse? Because there is so much pressure that the hydrogen present at the core is fuses to become helium releasing so much energy in the process that it actually balances the inwards force of the gravity. This fusion keeps going on preventing the star from collapsing under it\u2019s own gravity and keeps forming heavier elements by fusion in the core. Now, fusion of elements heavier than iron do not release energy, they absorb it. So when the star runs out of hydrogen and there\u2019s nothing at the core to release energy by fusion, the star collapses fusing the core even further. Now, had the star been a very massive star, it\u2019s collapse would have compressed the core to a singularity forming a back hole. But if it is not very heavy, then the collapse doesn\u2019t form a black hole. It forms a less dense relative of singularity called a neutron star. The iron rich core is not producing any energy to stop the star from collapsing. So what stops it now? The electron degeneracy pressure. Simply put, two electron cannot occupy the same place at the same time. But the outer shell is still burning and the further deposits mass on the core. As it increases, the immense gravity out-powers the electron degeneracy pressure and the core collapses further. Temperature at this point is very high which causes protons and electrons to combine and form neutrons. Now as the star collapses further, these neutrons are getting packed into smaller and smaller space. At this point, neutron degeneracy pressure comes into play which is in principle, exactly how electron degeneracy pressure works. Neutrons cannot occupy same place at the same time. This force is stronger (if the star is not very heavy) and halts the collapse. Other stuff is flung into the space in a supernova by the outburst of the neutrinos created during the formation of neutrons from protons and electrons. And then this structure of super dense material hold\u2019s its shape. Basically the remnant of the core of the parent star. It\u2019s density is similar to the density of nuclei of atoms. This is practically a 10 kilometres wide nucleus. This is how a neutron star forms. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Pick a star of the right mass and wait. Slightly longer answer: A neutron star is the collapsed core of a star between 1.4 and 3 times the mass of the Sun. All through its life the core is trying to collapse under its own immense gravity, but that collapse is being balanced by the outward pressure of the radiation that the core produces. As time goes by the core creates heavier and heavier elements, until it reaches the iron stage. At that point, radiation stops, because, up to then, creating the elements lighter than iron has released energy, but iron absorbs energy, so, like flipping a switch, the core turns off and immediately collapses. The shockwave from the collapse blows the remainder of the star out into the galaxy in a supernova explosion, the elements created during the star\u2019s life eventually merging with interstellar clouds of dust and gas to form new suns and planets. The core collapses to the most dense form that it can \u2013 a neutron star, about 16 kilometres across, in which the gravity is so strong it crushes the atoms together to form neutrons. ",

Born from the explosive death of another, larger stars, these tiny objects pack quite a punch. Let's take a look at what they are, how they form, and how they vary. How are they formed- When stars four to eight times as massive as the sun explode in a violent supernova, their outer layers can blow off in an often-spectacular display, leaving behind a small, dense core that continues to collapse. Gravity presses the material in on itself so tightly that protons and electrons combine to make neutrons, yielding the name \"neutron star.\" A little more about them- Neutron stars pack their mass inside a 20-kilometer (12.4 miles) diameter. They are so dense that a single teaspoon would weigh a billion tons \u2014 assuming you somehow managed to snag a sample without being captured by the body's strong gravitational pull. On average, gravity on a neutron star is 2 billion times stronger than gravity on Earth. In fact, it's strong enough to significantly bend radiation from the star in a process known as gravitational lensing, allowing astronomers to see some of the back side of the star. ",

When a massive star collapses and explodes in a tremendous supernova explosion, the dense inner core is all that remains.    When the dying star is collapsing, the core gets progressively denser. Eventually, the elementary particles in the core (protons and electrons) cannot withstand the force of gravity, and they fuse together to form neutron. Eventually, all of the material in the core is converted into neutrons and voila!   ",

The neutrinos easily escape the contracting core but the neutrons pack closer together until their density is equivalent to that of an atomic nucleus. At this point, the neutrons occupy the smallest space possible (in a similar fashion to the electrons in a white dwarf) and, if the core is less than about 3 solar masses, they exert a pressure which is capable of supporting a star. For masses larger than this, even the pressure of neutrons cannot support the star against gravity and it collapses into a stellar black hole. A star supported by neutron degeneracy pressure is known as a \u2018neutron star\u2019, which may be seen as a pulsar if its magnetic field is favourably aligned with its spin axis. ",
