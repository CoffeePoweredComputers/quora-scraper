            "answer_text": "Ok. I\u2019ll bite. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s pretend I have invented a temporal camera that I can use to watch the history of a cell - throughout time. We shall start by focusing this camera on some cell in your body, and then playing time backwards. Now, all the somatic cells in your body, at some point came from specialized stem cells, which came from undifferentiated stem cells. which came from your gemline cells when your egg was originally fertilized. So, if we choose a cell in your body right now, and watch it \u201cbackwards\u201d, instead of splitting over and over, it will keep merging with some neighboring cell. Eventually - without break - we will be looking at a stem cell of some kind. and we can watch that \u201cunsplit\u201d a number of times, until it becomes a germ line cell.We are, through this process, watching your whole body in the peripheral of our viewscreen, get younger, shrink, become a baby, a fetus, a clump of cells, and eventually merge into the single cell we are watching. The cell we are watching will eject a sperm, migrate back up a tube, and join a number of sister cells in an ovary. Gross. The cell that will eventually be you is now just a waiting egg cell in your mother. Now we watch the same process play out (backwards) - this cell chills doing not much of anything for most of your mothers life, until suddenly your mothers body shrinks around it and she becomes a baby, and shoots back into your grandmother. Ewww again. But - the point is made - your mother was born with all the egg cells she would ever have, so you have, in essence, been born twice. Now, the continuity of this cell\u2019s reverse history is unbroken. We could argue that each time we see it merge with some other cell, the result is the parent cell of two child cells but, unlike humans\u2019s where children pack their parents in a retirement home, in cells, the parent cell becomes the children. Anyway, we are still watching this one cell, that will, if we turn this video around and play it forwards again, one day become your fingernail or whatever it was we started with. In the fetus\u2019s final moment, a bunch of other cells merge with the cell we are watching until just one cell is left. a single sperm is ejected (gross! your grandfathers) and the egg migrates up a tube to join a bunch of other egg cells in your grandmothers ovary. So now we have imagined watching the continuous history of a cell from you, to your mother, to your grandmother. And we could just keep on going back, generation after generation after generation. Noting that, each time we go back another generation and \u201ceject\u201d another sperm there is a potential for the cell to lose a few mutations. become a little simpler.And after we have gone through thousands of generations we might notice that the human shell that protects our cell each time looks a little different. And if we keep going, the cell has ejected \u201chuman\u201d dna carrying sperm so many times that the dna the call carries is distinctly not human. And the creature that houses it - still very much the cell that will become you, the cell that will become your fingernail - is not human, but some apelike creature. some shrew like creature. Some amphibian I think. if you just keep on going, Persistently keep on watching this one cell. it eventually won\u2019t even migrate back into the ovary of a particularly complex multicellular creature. Just a small number of somatic cells to protect the immortal germline cells in the center. And, eventually, it is going to go back to a cell that - while it definitely isn't a bacteria, if you did play the camera forwards from here and took a certain path, would after thousands and thousands of splits - be a bacteria on a cloth you just wiped off your kitchen sink. Or, if you played forwards the path we just took backwards - would be a cell in your hand holding the cloth doing the wiping. \u2014 Some people view evolution as a process that \u201cCreatures\u201d that live and die undergo. I don\u2019t think so. I think the creatures are the side effects - they\u2019re just the protective shells evolved to house the immortal germline cells that have been continuously alive for literally billions of years - cells that have evolved a strategy of creating complicated shells of disposable somatic cells, and swapping dna with with surviving neighbors.There is a lot of waste in the process and somehow the creatures think the process is about them - even though they are comprised literally of somatic cells that are programmed to die after their job, of mixing up the dna of their precious cargo, and providing an environment to let it grow a new host - is done. \u2014 In case it isn\u2019t clear, in relation to the original question human beings coming from \u2018bacteria\u2019 - I wanted to convey - by building a sense of the continuous identity that cells have - the relationship between the person, and some bacteria. I found when I was originally introduced to these ideas they were rather hard to grasp, because the single celled thing, in some ancient pool, was theoretically some kind of precursor thing. But it was very easy to get confused about the relationship between things until I realized that, for all of the last billion years, no matter else what happened, there was always some thing, some creature, that was my - in the style of Kipling - my ever so many greats grandfather - probaby many. but at least one.

            "answer_text": "Q: Who believes humans came from bacteria as science claims? A: Creationists. Well, technically, that\u2019s what creationists think that science claims and accuse non-creationists of believing. And it\u2019s a nice strawman to attack, so they stick to it.  However, that\u2019s not what science claims. It\u2019s more complicated, of course, and also much much bigger. Science suggest that life \u2013 all life \u2013 shares a common ancestor. This is what Darwin inferred from his original theory of common descent.  Bacteria are likely not that common ancestor, but instead constitute a separate branch, which share a common ancestor with everything else, the Last Universal Common Ancestor or LUCA.  By comparing genomes and measuring differences and similarities in the genomes, we can create a timeline when species diverge. We can see that Archaea and Bacteria went separate ways very early on, about 3.5 billion years ago; and Eukaryota and Archaea separated about 2 billion years ago. And this is not limited to humans, but to all life on the planet. Humans are just a small sliver of Animalia to the bottom right of the relation diagram above.  So, the big question, is this what science believes and claims? Well, not in the religious sense. The theory of evolution works fantastically well in just about all biology, so to the point that it is the foundation of biology for a century or thereabouts. So when the theory of evolution implies a Last Universal Common Ancestor, that becomes the default hypothesis. However, it is not accepted without merit. Although the hypothesis has strong support from evidence, it also has a lot of gaps to it. What LUCA would be is not known. We know of some 350 genes (mostly about cell metabolism) that are common to all living creatures today, so it is suggested that LUCA should have these genes. And it ought to be more primitive than bacteria. We also don\u2019t know where LUCA came from, or even if there was just one LUCA. It is possible that what we call LUCA is actually an entire group of really primitive cell populations \u2013 too primitive to even be called \u201cbacteria\u201d \u2013 who thanks to some kind of interaction (most likely eating one another) came to share genomes. LUCA could actually be some kind of microbiotic Voltron: a group of even more primitive life-forms that joined up to battle off the hostile pre-bacterial empire and came up victorious, and then never separated again.  Note that science isn\u2019t actually afraid of saying \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d, because, well, there are a lot of gaps about the origin of life. Instead, science says \u201cthis implies that\u201d, or \u201cit is likely that\u201d, and so on \u2013 phrases that Creationists utterly loathe. Creationists think that science is like building a house on sand, which can collapse at any moment. Science does have a solid foundation: that which can be observed. That everything on top of that foundation can be changed if we observe something different is the strength of science: a flexibility and self-correcting quality that revealed knowledge completely lacks. But what science does not do is to say \u201cwe don\u2019t know, hence a god must have done it.\u201d That would be unscientific (you follow the evidence, not the dogma), unimaginative (\u201cI cannot imagine how this would happen naturally, so a god must have done it\u201d), and ultimately dishonest, (\u201ca god must have done it\u201d is absolutely not the implication of \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d).
