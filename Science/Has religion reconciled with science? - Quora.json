The question should be: Has science reconciled with its Creator?\u2014and the answer is an resounding YES. Of course, scientists, the people who do science, might have problems about the existence of their Creator\u2014but that is not HIS fault. However, scientists today will always follow the facts where they lead so, while scientists peruse the volumes of data on NDE experiences handed to them by doctors, and examine DNA, some are already concluding that \u201cwhere science ends spirituality begins\u201d \u2014which was spoken by Dr. Mary Neal, former Head of spine surgery at the University of Southern California.

            "answer_text": "Religion and Science aren\u2019t individual minds. There\u2019s a wide range of perceptions. Some religious people embrace science. Some religious people reject any science that contradicts their religious beliefs. Some scientists are religious. Some scientists reject religious beliefs because they have no proper basis in fact. It\u2019s certainly impossible to validate religious beliefs as having scientific validity. Any thing identified as religious belief that was validated as science would in practice become recognised as science and people would stop referring to those things as religious belief. Most people recognise religious beliefs vary from person to person but good science is as close objective fact as can be synthesised. That inevitably means that if people seek to justify their beliefs having them recognised as science will have them accepted by the widest audience. In that sense where it is possible science \u2018drives out religion\u2019 including the God of the gaps phenomenon that if science has an answer for most people religious answers are abandoned. Some religious beliefs are cultural values that aren\u2019t of a nature that could be validated scientifically. But religious beliefs about supposed objective truths can be seen as beliefs that can\u2019t be justified as knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHas religion reconciled with science? Of course not! Judging by some of these answers, religion is intellectually stumbling around trying to explain supernatural events in a scientific context where the supernatural is so totally unnatural it has never been scientifically documented. One answer claims that science has not reconciled with itself. That\u2019s because science is a ruthless process of discovery\u2026not a fixed repository of unproven beliefs. Science is way more honest than religion\u2026because it will openly tell everyone what it does not know. Religion seizes on the honest admissions of science in order to discredit science for working the way it was designed to work. Science is about discovery\u2026religion is about reinforcing that which science has long made obsolete. Religion will go on\u2026but as a source of usable information about reality, it has been displaced by science. Religion will never recover. ",

            "answer_text": "***Hinduism and Science*** Please read below The most complex Hollywood sci-fi movie concepts were well known to us atleast Thousands years back! In a part of the movie Interstellar of Nolan, astronauts went to some Miller planet (orbiting a Gargantuan system) on which 9 hours on the planet are equivalent to 63 years on earth. Astronauts also lost one of the crew member there (named Doyle).  A similar story is mentioned in many Hindu scriptures including Mahabharata, Harivansh Purana, Devi-Bhagvata, related to time travel.  Kakudmi was the king of Kusasthali (ancient name of Dwarka, Gujarat). Beauty of Kakudmi\u2019s daughter Revati made him think that no one is eligible enough to marry his daughter, so along-with his daughter he went to Lord Brahma to seek his advice about a suitable husband for Revati. When they arrived Brahma was listening to the musical performance by the Ghandarvas, so both of them waited patiently untill the performance ended. Then they humbly asked Brahma for help and to select anyone from the shortlisted candidates. Upon which, Brahma laughed and explained that, time runs differently on different planes of existence, and that during the short time they had waited in Brahma-loka to see him, 27 chatur-yugas ( 108 yugas or age of man ) had passed on earth and all those persons whom Kakudmi shortlisted are died in course of time, even son and grandsons of those people\u2019s died too. And also he is now all alone and all his friends, ministers, wives, kinsmen, treasures, armies swept away by the hand of time. King Kakudmi was overcome with astonishment and alarm at hearing this news. However, Brahma comforted him, and added that Lord Vishnu was currently incarnate on earth in the forms of Krishna and Balrama, and he recommended Balarama as a husband for Revati. Kakudmi along-with his daughter then returned to earth which they regarded as having left only just a short while ago. They were shocked by the changes that had taken place. Not only had the landscape and environment changed, but over the intervening 27 chatur-yugas, in the cycles of human spiritual and cultural evolution, mankind was at a lower level of development than in their own time .

            "answer_text": "Because science has surpassed religious ideology in accurately describing what the world is and how it works, there appears in some peoples\u2019 minds that it is a competition, a contest for which system can provide the best answers to our questions on reality. They are two completely different realms; science is about knowledge and religion is about faith. There is no overlap; that is forced, most likely because some religious people are attracted to science and some scientists are still attracted to religion. What has happened in the evolution of the religion narrative is that as science makes advances in knowledge, religious ideology must retreat, moving the goal posts, so to speak. For example, first we all thought that thunder and lightning was the result of angry gods up in the clouds, pissed off at us, again, for some perceived transgressions. Now we know that thunder and lightning are caused by electrons moving around. So the role of God or gods moves from human-like beings dwelling in clouds to occupying the entire sky. At some point there will no longer be any use for religion based explanations of physical reality; then it will be confined to a form of psychotherapy, a pile of words to comfort us in our endless suffering.
