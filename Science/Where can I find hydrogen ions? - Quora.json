            "answer_text": "Hydrogen ion, strictly, the nucleus of a hydrogen atom separated from its accompanying electron. The hydrogen nucleus is made up of a particle carrying a unit positive electric charge, called a proton. The isolated hydrogen ion, represented by the symbol H +, is therefore customarily used to represent a proton. Hydrochloric acid is completely ionized to H+ and Cl-. The concentration of H+ ion is measured as pH (the negative logarithm of H+ ion concentration). ",
