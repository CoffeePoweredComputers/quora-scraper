I see these people on Quora all the time answering questions about God, and the essence of the answer is, \u201cHar har har, you\u2019re so dumb! God is for dumb people, not smart atheists like me! We believe in science!\u201d And these guys are all acting like the belief in atheism or science makes them all smart, as if they\u2019ve personally verified the Theory of Gravity or something. I mean what, are they going around all like, \u201cHey, you know, I was messing around with some math shit the other day, and you know, that Einstein was really on to something! E really does equal mc^2!!\u201d That\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s going on here. It really is just a matter of faith, it\u2019s just that these people have faith in the modern conventional wisdom, instead of faith in God, and they\u2019re all posturing like that makes them smart or something. In a prior age, all these people would have been Christians because that\u2019s where the herd was at. Science is something different. It\u2019s the gaining of knowledge through the application of the scientific method. As to the other, I appeal to the Gods of Block and Mute, and, what do you know, they come through every time! I eagerly anticipate getting some volunteers for that right here! \ud83d\ude03 ",

            "answer_text": "Science is a process of asking questions, forming a logical hypothesis, testing that hypothesis with experiments, seeing if the hypothesis is correct, or incorrect, and the drawing conclusions about the world from that data. This process is called the scientific method. As long as science sticks to conclusions based on observations, it is not a religion. However, some scientists do not base assumptions on scientific observations. For example, some scientists would base science on the idea that all things in our universe are explainable by purely physical processes and deny that anything spiritual exists. That assumption cannot be verified by scientific study and so is not scientific. In fact, such an assumption is a belief, and as such is on the same footing as religion. Interestingly, a religion can use the scientific method to explore the implications of its spiritual principles. Although, spiritual principles do not usually lend themselves to scientific study, such principles can still be logical in nature and produce rational results when studied. For example, it is very difficult to use science to study love, happiness, or friendship, and come up with reasonable rules to describe how these spiritual conditions operate, but nobody seriously doubts that these spiritual conditions exist and are important to everyday life. The fact that almost all peoples around the world have a strong sense of the importance of the spiritual side of life makes it very difficult for us to accept the idea that the spiritual world simply does not exist. Some religions may require blind faith, but not all do. Some religions, Christianity in particular, are internally quite logical and rational and can be studied as such. Also, some religions make claims about the world that can be examined using the scientific method. For example, the Bible teaches that the Universe had a beginning. For a long time this was held as \u201cproof\u201d that Christianity was false as the accepted \u201cscientific\u201d view was that the Universe was eternal and had no beginning. However, by the scientific method, data showed that the Biblical view was correct in what was perhaps one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 20th century - the Big Bang. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. Religion is the belief in a set of rituals and/or a supernatural being. While some people may argue that science is a belief, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Science makes a guess about something and puts that idea to the test. By learning from those tests, a scientist comes up with better guesses and better tests. Nothing in science is ever concrete, it is constructed from a bunch of best guesses and tests to support them. As more of the same tests are completed with the same results, the guess becomes more and more reinforced. What\u2019s more, anyone can test these guesses and get the same results. A theory is about as close as you can get to an absolute truth in science. It means that the guess is supported by mountains of tests by tons of people. Any person on the planet can demonstrate to you that a force called gravity exists. I can lift a pencil into the air and let go of it. When I let go of that pencil, it\u2019s going to fall. Anyone else can do the same thing and get the same result(assuming they\u2019re not a magician or something). There is not currently any religion in existence that can rely on that process because everyone has different results from their religions. Not everyone has the same experience with a religion. Religion doesn\u2019t test and demonstrate its beliefs in a way that can be duplicated by any person. Such a religion couldn\u2019t exist because if it did, it would be a science. ",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR: No and No. Science isn\u2019t a religion. It has no gods or ritual beliefs. It isn\u2019t a belief system and doesn\u2019t involve believing mystical things with no basis in fact. Science lacks any of the features commonly used to identify something as a religion. Unless all beliefs are religious beliefs and the word \u201creligion\u201d is stretched so thin it loses any useful meaning, science isn\u2019t a religion. In light of that we need to recast the second part of the question as \u2018does science work and do religions not work\u2019. Science works. But so do religions. Science is an effort to synthesise useful knowledge and indisputably works. Religion is more nuanced. In part religion is an exercise in believing mystical things with no basis in fact and derive comfort from those beliefs. Religion is also an exercise in adding apparent gravity to beliefs, opinions and prejudices by attributing them to some higher authority. Religion has also indisputably succeeded. Judged on the same terms as science, religion is a flat failure. But judged in its own terms of what it actually does its success is evident. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is tried true tested. If in Science you could raise your hands to the clouds and invoke rain on a regular basis, scientists would actively be finding out why that actually worked. If in Science you could prick a voodoo doll and affect people on a consistent and demonstrable practice, then that would become science. If in Science you could slaughter your first born to Moloch and that made you wealthy and prosperous over a long period of time and that repeat performances would continue with this conclusion, that would be science. However again, since Science works on tried true and testable, then you are left with what can be reflected under test conditions, making an allowance for known variables. Science is not a religion, and is not a belief system. It works on what is known, and what is a known and workable practice. For instance vaccines are a known, in that taking a vaccine and being inoculated against certain bugs, will prevent you getting diseases and consequences related to these specific bugs. It will not protect you from bugs that are unknown or not provided for in the vaccination. Science does not exist as a religious framework and practice, and should not be credited with such benefits.

            "answer_text": "Not really the Ancient Egyptian Religion used science in their culture, which had science, religion and art combined. Science today does not really work it is technology that does, or if technology does not work it can be fixed so that it does work. Science is mainly Theories and many had a shady past. Isaac Newton for example said it was a waste of time for science to study time and space and that if a fact was not simple then it couldn\u2019t be a fact. Einstein threw the time and space opinion into the rubbish, but believed the second opinion and tried to find the single, simple equation that would \u201cexplain\u201d all and everything in the universe. So science has characteristics of a religion in that much has to be believed on faith. ",

Science is a method of learning about the world. It's not a life philosophy or a religion. And the theories it produces have enormous explanatory and predictive power. It's a process involving observation and experimental data, not a static finished religion. ",
