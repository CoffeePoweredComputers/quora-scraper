            "answer_text": "In Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), you use a primer to bind to the DNA to start the replication. (The DNA polymerase used cannot start a fresh piece of DNA, only add onto another piece of DNA.) Usually, you want to amplify a specific piece of DNA, so you design your primers to only bind around that piece of DNA. In contrast, in degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR (DOP-PCR), you use primers that can potentially bind to many sequences. This is accomplished by two things: degenerate base pairing and using a low annealing temperature in the first two or so cycles. Degenerate base pairing is accomplished by using bases like deoxyinosine that can bind to any other base pair. The low initial annealing temperatures stabilize the binding of this primer to the DNA, despite the fact that with only a 6bp match, the bond between the primer and the DNA is pretty weak.  The primer generally has 6 regular base pairs on the 3' end, a bunch of degenerate nucleotides, and 6 regular base pairs again on the 5' end. The specificity of the probe is given by the 6 bps on the 3' end.  Since it is much easier to match 6 bps than 16 or more, as in a regular PCR primer, this degenerate primer amplifies many more sequences in the genome than regular PCR primers do. Therefore, you use DOP-PCR when you want to amplify multiple loci. You can use it in chromosome painting, for instance, when you just want sequences to bind anywhere along the genome, as long as they bind about 4kb apart from each other. Or, you can use it to amplify large sections of the genome. For instance, forensic analysts compare DNA samples at 13 loci or more. DOP-PCR can be used to \"pre-amplify\" whole-genome DNA before the real analysis. Furthermore, because DOP-PCR is species-independent, you can use it to amplify DNA sequences that are from species whose DNA is not characterized. Since this method amplifies many sequences- many papers call it \"whole genome\" amplification- it would not be a good method for finding gene homologs. You could use it to \"pre-amplify\" your DNA if for some reason you had a low starting amount of DNA. However, to find gene homologs, you would want a more specific tool. For example, you could compare the sequences of currently know homologs and generate a primer or a few primers with a few degenerate bases that correspond to where known homologs are known to diverge. Applying that kind of primer would likely pull out new homologs when applied to uncharacterized species. However, doing this is not called DOP-PCR, despite its use of degenerate bases. ",
