            "answer_text": "Did Albert Einstein plagiarize Hendrik Lorentz? Not really. His 1905 papers are not great at citing others work, Einstein definitely is rightly criticised for tgat, by modern standards. However, he does mention Lorentz's dynamics as being consistent with those he derived. Basically, an admission they are the same. Einsteins approach however was massively different to Lorentz's, so it is hardly as if he copied the equations (I imagine he was pleased with his derivation though). Indeed it is different enough that it gave far more important insights that the form developed by Lorentz (& Fitzgerald, Larmor, Poincar\u00e9 etc - it was not Lorentz alone). Poor Poincar\u00e9 has a bit more of a claim to being plagiarised. He had proven that Lorentz's theory implied the principle of relativity, while Einstein basically proved the principle was sufficient to derive the dynamics. This then put the whole thing on a more principaled basis. This is quite a fundamental change from the work of Lorentz or Poincar\u00e9, though the latter was tantalisingly close (I suspect his compatibalism philosophy restricted him here). Poincar\u00e9 was rather upset about the omission of his own work, certainly he deserves being better remembered than he is. Still that is the lot of great researchers. Einstein did correct the omission in later papers, but this was not enough for Poincar\u00e9. ",

            "answer_text": "The only thing done by Einstein was that he conceived the idea that relative constancy of speed of light was like an inverse interpretation of Length Contraction of Lorentz. Basically he reconciled his own imaginations of light speed with Length Contraction idea of Lorentz. Then he \u2018rightfully\u2019 realized that same Lorentz mathematics was equally workable to explain the relative light speed stuff and its consequences. For relativists, Einstein was a magician who would create or invent those things that were already generally known to other people of his time. ",

Physicists were fully aware of the Lorentz contraction and is connection with special relativity, and if there were any question of plagiarism it would have been brought up more than a century ago. No, Einstein did not plagiarize Lorentz. He provided a sound physical basis for Lorentz\u2019s equations. Did Albert Einstein plagiarize Hendrik Lorentz? ",
