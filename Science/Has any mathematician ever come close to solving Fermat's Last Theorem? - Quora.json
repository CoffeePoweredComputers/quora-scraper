            "answer_text": "Andrew Wiles solved it. He was determined to do it since the age of 10. \"In 1963, when he was a ten-year-old boy growing up in Cambridge, England, Wiles found a copy of a book on Fermat's Last Theorem in his local library. Wiles recalls that he was intrigued by the problem that he as a young boy could understand, and yet it had remained unsolved for three hundred years. 'I knew from that moment that I would never let it go,' he said. 'I had to solve it.' \" Fermat claimed that the formula [x^n + y^n = z^n] has no whole number solution when n is greater than 2. He claimed to have a proof of that, but never shared it. \u201cNow a professor at Oxford University, Wiles was at Princeton University back in 1994 when he worked out a proof for the theorem that had famously bedeviled mathematicians for centuries. As Princeton notes today, Wiles spent years attacking the problem, eventually working out the final proof with a former student, Richard Taylor.\u201d Read all about that here and how he won the Abel Prize in Mathematics for his solution: Professor Who Solved Fermat's Last Theorem Wins Math's Abel Prize ",

But in responding the question in these circumstances in Quora, I accept to show here my approaches, there are few, not many, and here, one it is : By basing to the Fermat\u2019s equation Z\u00b2 = Y^4 - X^4 the development went through directions finally end up to Z\u00b2 = Y\u207f - X\u207fWhen it comes to expand from z\u00b2 to z\u207f the exponent (\u00b2) is constantly invariable. After checking and verification, finally I abandoned the concept process. And the main problem Z\u207f = Y\u207f - X\u207f is still there. I show that here so some students can learn some tips, ideas.PS. Hope to come up new venture with the final solution of Z\u207f = Y\u207f - X\u207fPS2. Many readers come for tip so I may suggest to make a link between the two equations Z\u00b2 =X\u00b2+Y\u00b2 and Z\u00b2=X^4+Y^4 then advance to find a proof.PS3.If the demonstration included Z\u00b2 =X\u00b2+Y\u00b2 in the proof, the higher of its performance. ie: in Z\u00b2, existence of solution and in others cases Z\u207f inexistence of solutions.",

After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995; it was described as a \"stunning advance\" in the citation for Wiles's Abel Prize award in 2016. So yes, some mathematician not only came close, he solved it - 25 years ago!! ",
