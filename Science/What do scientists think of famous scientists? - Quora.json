            "answer_text": "If you mean science popularizers, I have mixed feelings on them. On the one hand, they get people interested in science. On the other hand\u2026they often use hyperbole to an extent it ends up confusing people, and do stump speeches for things that aren\u2019t really science, and thereby creating a misconception in the population about what science is. For the first problem, I\u2019ve bumped into many people who just because they read The Elegant Universe, think they can do string theory. They hear all these quantum mechanics processes described as \u2018spooky action at a distance\u2019, \u2018teleportation,\u2019 \u2018everything that can happen, will happen\u2019, and come to the conclusion that quantum mechanics is some magical fantasy world where everything is everywhere and you\u2019re bathed in fields of energy that connects us to distant galaxies. Eh\u2026not really. Quantum behavior is severely limited by the phenomenon of decoherence (which is more realistic than the \u201cwavefunction collapse\u201d everyone likes to share as a mindblowing fact), but you almost never hear science popularizers discuss this. There are many other facts rarely discussed, like the fact that the behavior of the wavefunction is deterministic, or the fact that two particles can be entangled simply because of conservation of angular momentum, no spooky action needed. Since the public does not get exposed to these more mundane ideas, people come across with a view of quantum physics that is much more magical than it really is. Similarly, I\u2019ve encountered people who are convinced (based on popular explanations they have heard about relativity and quantum mechanics) that classical mechanics has been proven completely irrelevant, useless, and fictional. It still is very much valid for most situations, and much research is still being done on classical systems. But you don\u2019t get this impression from popular science\u2014-it\u2019s all quantum and relativity now, and all other physics is dead. All of these misconceptions stem from the fact physics popularizers are forced to use flawed analogies, when to truly understand the physics you must use math. You need math to do physics. Analogies can only go so far, and I wish science popularizers would make that clear. For the second problem, I\u2019ve been put off from joining many science fan communities because they consider New Atheism to be a prerequisite for scientific thinking. So many science popularizers nowadays are stumping for it, it\u2019s gotten to the point where many people think you have to be an atheist to be a scientist. People now equate reason with science, and science with being against religion, when in reality logical validity is not a guarantee of truth (and so, saying \u201cin Logic and Reason We Trust\u201d like this one Facebook group that keeps being recommended to me, is not really a good idea*), and much of the sociological evidence actually points against the conceit of religion being unique in its corrupting influence. The Catholic Church was actually the primary institution that preserved science during the Dark Ages, the literal interpretation of the Bible has been seen as the lowest level of analysis amongst theologians for a long time, and most wars (including the deadliest like WWI, WWII, and the Mongol conquests) have had secular causes. Myths that paint religions as being anti-science have been perpetuated by many science popularizes who should know better, including Carl Sagan (who linked the destruction of the Library of Alexandria to Christianity when they weren\u2019t linked.) There are also times where science popularizers take it upon themselves to attack not only religious belief, but the very idea of religion, and end up looking completely out of touch as a result, like that one time Sean Carroll proved that the soul cannot have a Standard Model coupling to the electron gauge field (who was making the claim it does?), or when Lawrence Krauss argued physics means the Universe can be created all on its own from nothing (never mind that it requires the presence of quantum fields in the vacuum, which are still something). These sorts of rants do nothing to win new people over to Team Science, and actually end up pushing people away. There are so many people who refuse to accept science because they are mistakenly convinced that you cannot be religious and a scientist at the same time, and these arguments only add fuel to their denial. [This will probably get me a ton of hate in the comments, but let it be known that I am not arguing against atheism, but rather against the idea that religious belief is some great societal evil that is fundamentally at war with science. It has not been historically, and it still isn\u2019t.]** In short, while I appreciate their efforts to make science more popular, I have to wonder whether people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Michio Kaku are really making people like science, or whether they\u2019re just giving the public snazzy soundbites that can now be used to seem smart and superior to others. We are stardust, but so is toxic waste, and quantum mechanics doesn\u2019t have much to do with consciousness, because you\u2019d need to cool your brain down so cold for quantum computing it\u2019d be dead. And you don\u2019t need to subscribe to a particular belief (or lack of belief) to do science. Science is a system and a methodology. Get your courage where you can\u2026science just gives you the tools to do something with it. *Of course reason and logic are good things. I am not questioning that! What I am trying to get at is that they are not perfect guides to truth, and so putting all your trust in them isn\u2019t much better than blind faith. A true scientific skeptic is skeptical of everything, even things that are reasonable or logical. **Building on the above note, the fact many New Atheist science popularizers make statements about religion that are not in fact supported by historical and sociological evidence is the main reason I dislike their arguments. If they just argued why they personally don\u2019t believe in God that would be fine, instead they have to claim that religion is child abuse/anti-science/responsible for almost all violence/uniquely single-minded/etc. THAT is not supported by evidence, and so a true skeptic would reject these arguments.

            "answer_text": "Science popularizers, of which Neil deGrasse Tyson is arguably the best in this generation, play a crucial role in getting the public excited about science, distilling difficult concepts to their most exciting essence, and adding some warmth to the public\u2019s perception of scientists. I am deeply indebted to \u2018popular\u2019 scientists for their PR successes and deeply inspired by their communication tactics. I only wish that there were more of them, spanning a broader spectrum of physics (its not just strings and cosmos) and science (its not just physics) in general. There is some misunderstanding both among young scientists and among the public about job \u2018popular\u2019 scientists have. Popularizing science is a different job from making new science, and both of them are important. People who work on creating science shouldn\u2019t be concerned that someone with a lesser publication record has more twitter followers, and consumers of popular science should not assume that a \u2018popular\u2019 scientists is the most productive at creating new science.
