            "answer_text": "It is clearly hereditary. That means that if those contributory genes/gene fragments can be isolated, they can be replaced. But we don\u2019t have that going for us just yet. One thing they all need is early medical intervention. Most dementia\u2019s can be mistaken for Alzheimer\u2019s, but final diagnosis is usually dependent on autopsy findings. It\u2019s development can be insidious and slow, or much more sudden. When people at work ask me about what \u201cstage\u201d a person is in, the answer is not clear. Some people have different characteristics overlapping. Unfortunately we don\u2019t see most people at the beginning of the disease, loved ones can be in denial, and are hesitant to have a label placed on mom or grandpa. Sometimes you need a label in order to get the right kind of treatment. Commonalities in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease are: #1 The person tries to compensate or over-compensate. They know that something isn\u2019t right. They try to continue on as always. Those closest to them see a change and neither party wants to really admit this is a problem. #2 Eventually they no longer know they have a problem. If they drive, they can get lost easily, forget where they are going and why. They may show signs of personality change that are completely out of character. They cannot carry out tasks like paying bills, or care for their own health. #3 Family/spouse begin to realize that this person is truly in trouble, they may want to fight or do unsafe things. They leave the stove on. They don\u2019t take their medicine. The patient stays up all night and may wander, do purposeless things. It is around this time that we often see them being admitted for help. Take the car keys and prevent the person from driving. Often their doctor will tell them, but they don\u2019t want to stop driving anyway. #4 These victims become verbally and/or physically aggressive to caregivers. Of all people. Sometimes those who may have been gruff during their life get worse. Those who were kind people emerge aggressively. The patient, in my opinion, is frightened. The family has lost their loved one. We definitely get people in this time period. Keep in mind that spouses of most of these victims are older people, too, and cannot manage themselves as well as they used to, let alone care for the Alzheimer\u2019s afflicted day and night as well. This person my not know your name any more, but will curse you and push you around and blame you for everything. Soon they stop eating properly. Families want dad or grandma back. #5 They become incontinent, and lose their ability to verbalize thoughts, have difficulty processing the spoken word. They words they say don\u2019t make sense to us. They may be delusional, hallucinate. Very common. They are combative, can\u2019t take care of their hygiene. I have not numbered these observations as stages. The victims brain is changing physically, and chemically. The brain can even become clogged for lack of a better word, obstructed by deposits that block neurotransmitters, hence thoughts. I\u2019ve seen people that, when we get them, improve in terms of manageability, sleep and nutrition. I\u2019ve seen people with sudden onset changes. Those people are often slipping toward imminent demise. I had a friend who had sudden onset like that. His wife of nearly 70 years he suddenly didn\u2019t recognize-it was during a social activity, and they were surrounded with people they both knew. She lost him that day. He soon passed on. She lost him, again. Some people cannot be helped. Some decline gradually, other in stair steps. In all, this is a very cruel disease no one should have to witness or suffer. Thank you, Idris, for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease starts with a pre-existing condition which impairs brain energy systems. This energetic impairment affects both ATP production, which drives enzyme activity, and NADH production, which recycles antioxidants and fuels ATP production. I list then in that order because the former is widely considered and the latter not. Or not so much so. The mechanisms of this impairment are categorized by Dale Bredesen (author of The End of Alzheimer\u2019s) in four types (he says 3.5 types because of some overlap), if you want them itemized for practical purposes (for somebody you care about who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease). But regardless of which particular mechanism underlies a particular person\u2019s case, the gradual brown-out of brain energy causes a cascade failure of glutathione recycling (the active conversion of oxidized glutathione back into reduced glutathione). This reaction is NADPH + GSSG (oxidized glutathione) >> GSH (reduced glutathione) At this point, the Alzheimer\u2019s disease cascade begins, but is is mostly subclinical at this stage (the symptoms are actually quite common, so they are \u201cnormal\u201d by normative standards). As it manifests, several things happen. Glutathione-bound mercury begins to \u201cleak\u201d from glutathione to sulfhydryl enzymes. This inhibits those enzymes. They become progressively inhibited, and in the overt (symptomatic, or clinical) Alzheimer\u2019s disease, reach 50% to 95% inhibition. This is the \u201csmoking gun\u201d for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that sulfhydryl enzymes are selectively inhibited and ONLY sulfhydryl enzymes are strongly inhibited. Creatine kinase, for example, is the energy backup system for the human brain. It converts ATP (adenosine triphosphate) into creatine phosphate when ATP is plentiful, and back-converts creatine phosphate into ATP when ATP is low (i.e., when adenosine diphosphate is high). Creatine phosphate is catastrophically inhibited in full blown Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is one of the reasons why Alzheimer\u2019s disease can be sudden onset in the face of a gradual process; the loss of creatine kinase adds a new, synergistic aspect to the pre-existing energy crisis. A second failure happens when the transfer of detoxified (glutathione-bound) mercury ions affects protein kinase C and four different phosphatases. The inhibition of these enzymes causes, among other things, the freezing of the brain\u2019s phosphorylation rhythm. Prior to Alzheimer\u2019s onset, the brain cycles between an over-phosphorylated state to an under-phosphorylated state every 90 seconds. This is a massive investment of brain energy and a necessary consequence of having such a large and hyper-branched central nervous system. The balance between kinases (phosphate-adding enzymes) and phosphatases (phosphate-removing enzymes) is a delicate one. Some phosphatases increase their prosphate-removal activity when phosphorylated by kinases, and others decrease their activity from phosphorylation. And kinases likewise, and vice versa. This creates an elegant system where the tide of phosphorylation reverses as it approaches high tide, to become a tide of dephosphorylation, which also reverses when it reaches low tide. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this tide stops. The phosphorylation cycle freezes, which is noted clinically by the accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, and at autopsy by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (a precipitated hyper-phosphorylated tau protein). At this point, the Alzheimer\u2019s disease cascade is clinically measurable beyond the presence of cognitive dysfunction symptoms. A third failure is to the brain\u2019s microtubules. These are the transportation infrastucture for the highly branched neurons and dendrites of the human brain. As it turn out, the beta-tubulin protein subunit of microtubules is a sulfhydryl protein with a sulfhydryl group immediately adjacent to the GTP-binding site on beta-tubulin. The microtubule is composed of alternating alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin fibers, thirteen of which \u201cbundle\u201d into a microtubule. There are motor proteins which \u201cwalk\u201d up and down these microtubules to transport bundles of \u201cstuff\u201d from the cell nucleus to the nerve termini, and \u201cbackwards\u201d from the nerve termini to the cell nucleus. As mercury ions leak from glutathione to beta-tubulin, the alpha-beta linkages break apart and the microtubules disassemble. This has been observed under a light microscope by the dental scientists that cracked the Alzheimer\u2019s code. A \u201cmere\u201d 0.5% increase in mercury concentration completely depolarizes the growth cone of the marine snail neuron, which is so huge by comparison to a human neuron that it can be seen without an electron microscope. But within minutes, glutathione synthesis has \u201cmopped up\u201d the added mercury ions, the microtubules have re-assembled, and the growth cone resumes its forward progress. After all of these enzyme systems have collapsed, beta-amyloid builds up and eventually precipitates into plaques. This is one of the later stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and one of the first discoveries. It is because it was the first discovery of an Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology that it is usually placed at the beginning of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease process. But it is not the beginning. It is more the end. The central role of reduced sulfur in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease process is a natural consequence of human evolution of increasingly larger brains, and possibly (I believe) more important, of more highly branched neural networks. As humans have grown our more intricate manifestation of the central nervous system, an increasingly higher amount of energy has been invested in maintaining it. The human brain consumes 20% of our total body energy, despite it being only 3% of our body mass. This puts it at or near the top of the brain-energy pyramid. This makes us especially sensitive to mercury ions, which is well known in toxicology circles. It also makes us susceptible to less catastrophic energy restrictions of the brain. As a result, many scientists now believe that this issue is the evolutionary driver of ApoE proteins, of which the ApoE4 protein is the oldest and contains no sulfhydryl groups. There certainly is a correlation between ApoE sulfhydryl (SH) groups, which mimic glutathione, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk. ApoE4 has zero SH groups and has the highest risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, ApoE3 has one SH group and has a medium risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and ApoE2 (the newest and rarest ApoE) has two SH groups and the lowest Alzheimer\u2019s risk. Before anybody reading this goes off and blames mercury for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, let me baldly state the each and every human alive today already has enough mercury in their body and brains to easily cause Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is NOT the mercury per se, but rather the mercury-containment (or mercury detoxification) system which determines the risks and outcomes. Mercury containment is accomplished by glutathione (GSH). The glutathione pool of SH groups is the largest concentration in the body, exceeding other SH pools by orders of magnitude. Glutathione binds to mercury to prevent it from reacting with SH groups in more important places, like sulfhydryl enzymes of the brain which control the energy backup system, the phosphorylation cycle and the transportation infrastructure of the cytoskeleton. So we get Alzheimer\u2019s disease NOT because we are exposed to mercury by evil industrialists, careless dentists, or old-fashioned anti-fungal paint. It is because our glutathione robustness fails. This SH-based defense system sets the redox potential of the body. It regulates our immune system activity (antibodies are sulfhydryl-disulfide systems). Redox potential is a bio-physics necessity for life. Redox (an inverted contraction of OXidation and REDuction) may not get the respect it deserves in either biology or biochemistry, but it is a hard reality equivalent to a concrete post on a freeway overpass under which you are driving. Many people understand the concept of \u201coxidation is bad\u201d due to the popularity of antioxidants in our pop culture. But the concept of reduction eludes many. Reduction is not the absence of oxidation, but rather the reverse of oxidation. Oxidation is the \u201cstealing\u201d of electrons from one set of molecules by another. And it is the \u201cdonation\u201d of electrons to glutathione by the body\u2019s energy systems which stabilizes us against oxidative stresses and the omnipresence of mercury. The electron flow\u2026 Mitochondria (Krebs cycle) >> NADH >> NADPH >> GSH > ascorbate >> vitamin E is the critical path that prevents Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and its restoration is the path to reversing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Yes, reversal. If you have not been paying attention to the fringe of new developments in Alzheimer\u2019s disease reversal, you can (1) watch my nine-part video series on YouTube (the swfowkes channel, go to playlists), and/or (2) read Dale Bredesen\u2019s book, The End of Alzheimer\u2019s (Avery, 2017). Then, if you are still skeptical, use the references to dig into the primary literature. But the good news is that roughly 90% of Alzheimer\u2019s patients are being reversed today in clinical practice over a therapeutic period of a year. Even Bredesen, who is his own skeptic, has been surprised by the responses of some of the most seriously impaired patients. I believe this is because the primary manifestation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the unconsciousness of affected neurons, not their death. So when they \u201cwake up,\u201d the person re-emerges from their pseudo-coma-like prison of biochemical dysfunction. I\u2019m sure that I missed some aspects of answer to your question in this dissertation, but I believe it provides the high points. Please feel free to add to this answer. ",
