            "answer_text": "There\u2019s nothing special about the disks. They\u2019re just storage, nothing else. I\u2019m not going to comprehensively explain how CDs and DVDs work. In short, the CD/DVD contains data. The CD/DVD reader reads the data from the disc. It could as easily be a hard disk or a thumb drive. The PC or game console reads the data from the disk and just uses it. It\u2019s normally just a program that uses assets (art, sound) that are also stored as data on the disk. So the computer/console: Starts reading the diskFinds the programRuns itLoads any assets it\u2019s told to loadUses them to \u201cproject a virtual world\u201dThat\u2019s Game Execution 101. The disk isn\u2019t special. It\u2019s just a medium to store and deliver the game\u2019s content. ",
