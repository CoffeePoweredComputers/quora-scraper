            "answer_text": "Yes, since it hasn\u2019t been falsified by experiments yet, but things aren\u2019t looking particularly good at the moment. String theory is a model that attempts to describe reality. It remains to be seen if it actually does it. The problem is that it does not provide us with any falsifiable predictions at the moment, but it has some qualities that give it potential, such as the fact that the graviton (the particle-carrier of the gravitational force) unpredictably popped out of the theory. String theory has not been falsified yet. To be falsified, a theorist must find a way to predict something through string theory that other theories that we hold dear at the moment do not and the prediction has to be testable, i.e. it has to be such that we can conduct experiments that are within our technological reach in order to falsify the theory or give it a much needed win. There have been some predictions that are made only by string theory, although we are not able to test them at the moment. In any way, I think that any physicist who has learned string theory will agree that, at least as a mathematical model, it is elegant, sophisticated and it has also provided us with powerful tools that will help us in our quest to describe various phenomena in nature. The grandest example of one such tool is the AdS/CFT correspondence (or gauge/gravity duality). One can read the following very brief article on its usefulness: After almost 20 years of AdS-CFT, what have we learned? Now back to string theory, as a theory that describes our world, it has some serious problems but all incomplete theories have these. One such problem is that it needs Supersymmetry and we didn\u2019t find any evidence for its existence in recent experiments conducted at the LHC in CERN. I believe that the consensus even among people working on string theory is that it is far from being complete and it has gone through and will continue going through a rough ride. To conclude, for me the correct answer is that you can\u2019t write string theory off, but you can\u2019t be very confident about it describing our world. It has already been useful to us but maybe we should start viewing it as a pretty great tool rather than a model describing reality (i.e. being the quantum gravity theory). P.S. For the non-physicists: there are more models, like Loop Quantum Gravity, that can\u2019t be written off. They have their own serious problems but on certainly should not read things only about string theory..! ",

            "answer_text": "I think it can be disproved \u201cIF\u201d a theory comes along which can be shown to answer all the actions in the universe in three dimensions. And I have a suggestion or an idea about that. It\u2019s a brilliant but quite simple idea. WHAT IF SINCE, Einstein\u2019s concept of a vector force\u2019s strength in general relativity is exactly the same as if the fields are low energy, radiating from mass and colliding forming larger and larger fields and since Hubble discovered that space was expanding and since the observations published in 1998 show thst each galaxy cluster is increasing in acceleration, THEN, We change the gravitational field in general relativity from a static gravitational field of infinite range concentrated around every mass to mass being in a constant state of static equilibrium absorbing photons while radiating its own gravitational field and these fields SIMPLY obey Newton\u2019s laws of motion including superpositioning of radiating gravitational fields. In other words, space is a phase transitioning process from every dipole, starting out as the radiating magnetic field then photons hop on board and concentrated the force into the inverse square law. If true, everything is easy to understand and the legs of string theory are gone. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A @Rajat Dutta Now this one is easy to answer since you have edited \u201cproof\u201d to \u201cconfirm\u201d. String theory is basically the theory of Everything. It is an attempt to unite the Quantum Field Theory (which I am madly in love with) whose foundations were laid by Planck, Bohr, Schrodinger, Feynman, etc and the General Relativity solenmly compiled by Albert Einstein and both the theories contradict each other\u2019s result when applied to each other\u2019s domain. So the string theory is \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d There is a basic principle in Physics called the \u201cUnification Principle\u201d according to which all the laws of Physics can be reduced into one. All we have to do is to find the links among them. So far we have been successful in uniting the Electromagnetic force, Weak force and Strong Nuclear force however Gravitation is still an exception. Walkthrough No. 1: Finding Graviton As Electromagnetism is exclusively governed by photon, a similar particle called graviton is suggested to serve the same purpose for gravitation however, its still yet to be discovered. If some day LHC finds any signs of graviton, we will wittness the unification of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. Walkthrough No. 2: Finding the Hawking Radiation. A black hole\u2019s event horizon can be a site where both of these contradicting theories work together and the consequence is the well known and controversial at the same time, \u201cThe Hawking Radiation\u201d This one is not the complete walkthrough but if the Hawking Radiation is discovered, we would be just one step before the unification. The empty space contains free energy of order of magnitude 10\u2212710\u22127erg. This is due to the fact that as per quantum theory particle and ant-particle particles pop in and out of existence. Both of these particles are virtual as they are short lived. Since they are opposite in nature hence none of the conservative laws of Physics is violated. When this happens at the event horizon then the things get pretty interesting. The anti-particle is attracted by the black hole and mass of the black hole is decreased (since the anti-particle is negative energy). Now since the possibility of this anti-particle to combine with its particle is now vanished and hence this particle now becomes a real particle and is a new member of this Universe. This implies that the black holes undergo continuous vapourisation and cease to exist at one point. Unfortunately even if we succeed in discovering Hawking Radiation we won\u2019t ever wittness a black hole going out of existence in our life time or even the entire universe\u2019s life time as this process is very slow. Walkthrough No. 3: The Cold Spot If you are in anyway associated with the Physics, you might know what\u2019s this.  It is the childhood snapshot of our universe :p It is better known as Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. We can clearly see the cold spot here. One of the consequences of the string theory is that this Universe is a part of a bigger multiverse and there are many universes like ours and this cold spot can be a result of a collision between our and any other universe like ours. This hypothesis if proved, would be the biggest walkthrough towards the unification. Thanks for reading! Physics is beautiful, ain\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "This opinion comes from a person not so familiar with the theory, yet\u2026 No, it can\u2019t be true. Simply speaking, the main elements of this set of theories are chosen wrongly \u2014 dimensions and hypothetical strings are very abstract and physically \u201cexpensive\u201d terms to play with, that\u2019s not how a universe works, but something way simpler. To my understanding of it, the initial intention behind these theories was to reuse a mathematical formalism of general relativity extended to even more dimensions (as partially demonstrated in Kaluza\u2013Klein theory), while having rules of quantum mechanics included. Various elementary particles should have been quantum-mechanical vibrations of these strings or whatever. So, is it a good recipe for a successful theory ? No, simply no \u2014 the approach is too simplified, pretty much blindly reusing theories we don\u2019t understand (sorry, I am not aware of a more politically correct term to say this). The concept of dimensions (all alone strings) is highly abstract and applicable only in a limited range of scales. Notice also here that applying a certain set of formally developed mathematical tools (tensors or whatever applied to a continuum) inevitably and automatically constrains the theory ! If you start with linear spaces and differential equations (pretty much everywhere in contemporary physics), you have already made a hard decision on how your physical model might behave and what its physical interpretation might be. Despite all being said and unsaid here, is it possible that such a theory might \u201ccatch\u201d something ? Unlikely, except approximately at some scales. Simply, it\u2019s a wrong type of space trying to describe another kind. For example, try to describe a discrete space in terms of geometry \u2014 the relation is somewhat similar here. ",

            "answer_text": "First, physical theories are never proven. They're confirmed by experiments. We do not know whether string theory can be experimentally confirmed or not. The issue is that string theory is (possibly) the theory at the shortest distance scale. There is a property of physical theories known as decoupling, which says that as a function of distance, the effects of short distance physics behave as\u03b4OO\u221d(\u2113short\u2113O)N\u03b4OO\u221d(\u2113short\u2113O)Nwhere O is some observable and lshortlshort is the short distance scale and lOlO is the distance scale associated with the observable and N is some power that is strict >=0. Frequently N=2 or 4 -- which means that if lstringlstring is 10^18 GeV and l_O = 1000 GeV (LHC observations), we're talking about immeasurable small discrepancy. There are a classes of observables where N=0. This is obviously good, but you must come up with processes where _only_ string theory contributes to the observable. So far we don't know of any. Finally, the cosmic microwave background radiation can have imprints from inflation, which if the BICEP-2 results are correct, took place at a distance scale that is only a factor of 100 or so from the string scale. This is one of the excitement about the BICEP-2 result -- it would indicate the shortest distance scale probe of physics that we will ever have. ",

            "answer_text": "According to String Theory, there are 9 physical dimensions of space all rolled up together as illustrated in the diagram below. The innermost layer consists of 2 types of strings: closed loops of strings/energy (monopoles) and open ended strings/energy (dipoles). Monopoles in aggregate form the basis for gravity and dipoles are associated with electromagnetism. And what\u2019s really interesting is that when monopoles collide due to their strong attraction for each other, they break apart to form electromagnetism. And thus the connection between G & EM (or G & QM).  Then throw in Time = 10 dimensions, and one more the Multiverse = 11 dimensions of Space-Time, also known as M Theory. So to answer your question: yes, this explanation, which is a brief summary of many ideas, represents a possible chance for string theory to be true.  ",

It also neatly explains the diversity of subatomic particles as different excitations of multi-dimensional \u2018string\u2019. Its older forms failed to develop.

(History of string theory - Wikipedia) It remains the favoured broad interpretation. The most likely to be true. ",
