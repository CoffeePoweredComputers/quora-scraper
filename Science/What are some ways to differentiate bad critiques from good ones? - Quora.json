            "answer_text": "The most reliable way to to better differentiate good critique from bad critique is to filter it through a basic formalized structure. I\u2019m going to briefly outline the structure that\u2019s most familiar to me. Everything that follows is derived from personal experience and cribbed from the book Discussing Design by Aaron Irizarry and Adam Connor, which I highly recommend. My personal experience is almost entirely in the field of professional design, with some training in film and art history, but this framework generalizes well to most critical applications. Good critique is an analysis in which participants work together to determine whether or not a piece of work satisfies a set of objectives. It sounds deceivingly simple, but it\u2019s difficult to practice, especially when critiquing \u2018creative\u2019 solutions. A coherent, complete critique will always include these three things: It will identify a specific aspect of the work to be analyzed (bad critique lacks focus and tends to devolve into sniping from the peanut gallery when it\u2019s not constrained by specificity)It will articulate a clear relationship between that specific aspect of the work and the stated objectives (bad critique fixates on superficial properties of the solution rather than the context of the objectives where the solution is meant to be situated)It will include a determination as to whether or not the specific aspect of the work successfully addresses the objectives that ultimately boils down to a true or false statement (bad critique results in ambiguous conclusions about the solution that leave room for misinterpretation or regressions in the next iteration; this can be an especially pernicious result of overly diplomatic critique)It\u2019s reasonable to have nuanced, divergent conversations throughout the process but ultimately the discussion should adhere to the above structure and yield a binary judgement about whether the work being analyzed is fit for the specific objectives at hand so the discussion can proceed accordingly. If a solution is found to not satisfy its objectives, a good critique will center on clarifying and improving the relationship (#2) between the work and the objectives. Good critique is a dialogue where the giver and receiver work toward evolving the fitness between the solution and the objective. Bad critique commonly resembles a panel judgement or adversarial debate. Good critique may come bundled with constructive suggestions, but they\u2019ll be in service of tightening fit rather than generating objections. Bad critique will often produce a list of perceived flaws and prescriptive directions for what should be fixed. There are a variety of legitimate alternatives to the structure I\u2019ve outlined here when you\u2019re soliciting and providing feedback on ideas, decisions, or work, but it\u2019s a safe bet that none of them are good formal critique.

            "answer_text": "Good critique should be feedback that is aimed at improvement. Bad critique is vague, useless, and has no suggestions on what to improve. I have an acquaintance that I\u2019ve jammed with on several occasions. He is a good guitar player, but he can\u2019t read music, doesn\u2019t know the names of chords, and has never written or recorded anything of his own. I sent him 2 songs I recorded. How it goes:  His response? \u201cReverb needs work.\u201d Nothing specific. Just fix the reverb. I sent him this song. I had finally got the distortion exactly how I wanted it to sound. I was going for a 60\u2019s feel, but with my own riff.  His response? \u201cDistortion needs work.\u201d Finally, out of frustration I called him an armchair quarterback. His response? \u201cI\u2019ve never written or recorded anything, so I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Now, if he had a great ear and just knew how music was supposed to sound, or he was a great sound engineer, I\u2019d appreciate it if he said, \u201cUse xyz on this setting.\u201d But since he doesn\u2019t know how to write music and doesn\u2019t know anything about sound engineering, I take his feedback as coming from someone who thinks he needs to have an opinion, even when he\u2019s not asked. The guitar solo sound I was going for? Love removal machine from the Cult.  The rhythm guitar sound? Just 60\u2019s fuzz. What\u2019s the point of this answer, other than to shamelessly promote my music and voice my frustration with an armchair critic? My point is that if you call them out, some armchair critics back off. Good critique would start with, \u201cWhat sound are you going for here?\u201d If it\u2019s just subjective, and there are no concrete suggestions, it\u2019s useless. Overly harsh critique that has no feedback on how to improve is useless. And sometimes it comes from jealousy. ",
