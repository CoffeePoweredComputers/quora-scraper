            "answer_text": "\u201cIs magic real? Can someone tell me about real magical spells?\u201d No, it\u2019s not, and no, no one can. \u201cMagic\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. Period. Let's take this very simply. Can you point to a single, verified case of someone doing magic, under controlled conditions, and actually getting results? No, you can't. I know this because if someone could, if someone EVER had, we'd all know about it. It would be all over the news, it would be historic! Universities, if \"magic\" was real, would have entire departments dedicated to it, and they would be studying it and teaching it. But they're not, are they? Military organizations around the world would be researching it, developing it, etc. But they're not, either, are they? Large corporations around the world would have \u201cMagicians\u201d on their payroll, and they would be using \u201cmagic\u201d to give them an edge over their competitors. But again, they\u2019re not doing so either, are they? And nowhere, throughout the entire history of the world, can you point to a single verified case of someone doing \"magic\". That tells us something, doesn't it? Everyone who's claimed to be \"psychic\", or a \"witch\" or able to do \"magic\" has been revealed to be a fraud. Not one person has ever been able to verify their claims of paranormal abilities, ever. That's pretty solid proof right there. You have to ask yourself, in the midst of this desire to believe in something unseen, despite this desire to \"know\" something that the rest of the world doesn't...how real is this? How real CAN it be, when every shred of available evidence is against it? The answer is simple: It's not real. Outside of games, books and comics...it simply doesn't exist. It can't hurt you, it can't help you, all it can do, the extent of its \"magical\" power, is to make your time and money disappear. If \u201cmagic\u201d was real, if \u201cspells\u201d actually worked, the world would be far different than it is. The fact that we don\u2019t see the differences, the things that would have to exist if \u201cmagic\u201d were real, tells us more than anything else that it\u2019s not real. It doesn\u2019t exist. Never has, never will. Anyone telling you otherwise is selling something. ",

            "answer_text": "My mother has a story she likes to tell at parties. When I was very young, my parents and I lived in Bali, Indonesia. Our home was nothing to look at, just a delapidated shack really, but at least it was close to the beach. One evening while we were all out, our house got robbed. We didn't have much of value - appliances, some cash and cheap jewelery - but it meant a lot to us at the time. Nobody saw anything, and the local police weren't much help either. Without any further clues to go on, the locals recommended we visit our local balian (medicine man / healer). My father was a stubborn pragmatist who dismissed this idea as superstition. But my mother was a bit more open-minded and decided to consult with the balian.  (Pic somewhat related: a traditional Balinese rangda costume) The balian brought her into a darkened room filled with incense, and a small boy was led into the room. The balian chanted and conducted a brief ritual, during which he painted the child's fingernail with black nail polish. My mother was invited to gaze into the shiny painted fingernail, and to this day she swears she saw a reflection in the fingernail - an open doorway with light spilling out, and the silhouette of a man.  As it happens, she recognised this man as an acquaintance of ours. The next day, my father spoke to this acquaintance and discovered that he had, in fact, stolen our belongings and sold them for drug money. A magic spell had solved the crime. It wasn't the first time we encountered magical or supernatural happenings in Bali, and it wouldn't be the last. As an aside: Do I believe in magic? No, I don't. But I do believe that humans are credulous creatures. We look for patterns and meaning in all things. Some people will seek to take advantage of this to scam us for money. Others genuinely believe, to some degree or another, that what they are doing is \"real\". What my mother \"saw\" is an important lesson in the power of suggestion. Mediums and other practitioners of the supernatural use a combination of common sense and psychological tricks to create the illusion that something magical or numinous has happened. In the case of our robbery, the balian had asked my mother a series of questions as she gazed into the fingernail: Do you see a man? Do you know this man? Is it someone who has been to your home before? Is it someone who may have a reason to steal from you? Common sense questions that lead to a conclusion. The human mind fills in the rest. It's a neat trick, very cool, and in this case, it got results. But is it magic? Sorry, my friend. Magic 8-ball says  To this day, my mother cannot be persuaded that she did not actually see the man reflected in a child's fingernail. And that's okay. Beliefs like this are mostly harmless - ways to bring excitement into our lives and to make sense of a crazy mixed-up world. Not to mention fantastic stories to tell at parties! ",
