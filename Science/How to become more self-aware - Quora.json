            "answer_text": "Here are 10 ways to radically improve your life by becoming more aware 1. Practice mindfulness Mindfulness is a huge topic in-and-of-itself, but I feel obliged to briefly discuss it here. It is one of the philosophies that has recently taken the world by storm. Everyone has a version of what it is and how it can help. To me, it is all about maintaining constant awareness of your body, mind, and feelings. Mindfulness is meant to create congruence between how you feel and think, and how you act. A lot of people actually lack a simple back and forth in this regard. For example, they will have their meal, and completely miss the point when their body was signaling to them that they\u2019d had enough. Consequently, they\u2019d overeat and regret it later. It comes out of a lack of awareness of one\u2019s body. Or, they will be working, bent over a desk, only to feel pain in their neck and shoulders, at the end of the day. Only then, will they realize that they\u2019d been sitting hunched over, and feeling discomfort throughout the entire time. Most of the things I am about to cover can help you improve your mindfulness, but perhaps the best way to do so directly is through meditation. Try to devote several sessions out of your day to do this. The way I do it, is by closing my eyes and trying to completely clear my mind of all thoughts. I only focus on my breath and as soon as something creeps in, I try to let it go. It\u2019s surprisingly difficult, yet refreshing. 2. Always try to see something new in something old This one I also like to call my secret to happiness. If you actually pay attention you will see that no two moments are ever the same, even if you are doing the same thing for the five-thousandth time. There is always something completely unique about the present. What\u2019s great about this is that it also satisfies one of the six human desires, according to motivational guru and personal development coach, Tony Robbins - the need for variety. He correctly points out that the human mind requires not only a certain sense of stability to function, but also variety, excitement, and new experiences. The great thing about seeing something new in something old is that you don\u2019t need to seek out variety, because you can always see it around you. You can never look at a thing in the same way twice, and that helps you appreciate every moment that much more. I was first introduced to this idea, when a mentor of mine gave me the advice to completely cover my ears the next time I am in the shower. This forced me to experience this thing that I was doing every day in a completely new light. I could suddenly hear very clearly, the water dancing off of me and hitting the floor in an entirely new way for the first time; that sensation stuck with me even after I had removed my hands. I had turned something ordinary, into something magical. There are tons of ways to create a habit out of this, but starting small is always a great option. Perhaps the shower trick will help you see the value in it as well. 3. Place yourself in other people\u2019s position This concept gained a lot of prominence due to Harper Lee\u2019s iconic novel \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d, but it has been around since the Native Americans. As she put it, \u201cYou never really know a man until you understand things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it\u201d. Or, as they put it, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a man until you have walked a mile in his shoes\u201d. Whichever way it is you prefer the sentiment, there is little doubt that applying this concept will allow for some much needed perspective in tough situations. To remind yourself often of this, is togrow and expand your capacity for empathy - arguably one of the most important skills in today\u2019s world. Studies have shown that it is the key component of emotional intelligence. What is emotional intelligence? \u201c[It] is defined as the ability to perceive and express emotion accurately and adaptively, the ability to understand emotion and emotional knowledge, the ability to use feelings to facilitate thought, and the ability to regulate emotions in oneself and in others\u201d (Salovey & Pizarro, 2002). So ask this question often, and consider what it can help you uncover about your peers. 4. Ask why 3 times I\u2019ve written about this at great length before here, but it is important enough to shortly discuss it again. With anything you do in life you first have to start with \u2019why\u2019. Chances are you\u2019ve heard someone say that before you do anything, you should decide what you\u2019re trying to get out of it. That\u2019s true, because when you do something with a clear focus and intent, that is a clear sign of your awareness. The opposite is also true - when we see people around us acting like sheep or zombies - not truly thinking and not really living - it is almost always because they fail to think about \u2019why\u2019 they are doing the things they are doing. I know, because I used to be exactly like that. This idea of asking why changed everything. We all do it when we are young, but we are often told to stop asking questions, or our questions are dismissed way out of hand - \u201cyou don\u2019t know enough about this world yet, if you are asking this\u201d, we are told. At my last job, they were doing things in the most inefficient way possible. It took a newcomer like me, willing to question why, to shake things up. Asking why is the best way to ensure you don\u2019t get set into ineffective patterns. Start to apply this and you will see how much of an impact a simple thing can make and how surprisingly few people do it. 5. Think about how things work This is undoubtedly one of the best ways to increase one\u2019s capacity to actually think. Regurgitating the facts is one thing, and is about as far away from thinking as it goes. True thinking is about connecting the dots. To do that you have to first know what makes up the dots. If you spend some time to consider how things come together and what makes them work you will become much better at noticing the underlying patterns that make up this world. You can see what direction things seem to be headed and plan accordingly. You can grasp a new idea much quicker and be able to consider its significance. That\u2019s what true innovation is all about. Finding an application for a new idea in such a way that seems obvious after the fact, but that others hadn\u2019t even thought of before. I\u2019ve noticed my capacity to connect different seemingly unrelated things improve greatly, by simply thinking about how things work. I like to spend some time each day to just relax, not do anything and let my brain wander around. I find this sort of deep thinking invaluable. 6. Look at the implications So, first you ask why, then you ask how, and finally you say, \u201cso what\u201d. This goes off of what I was saying about how things work. If you know the how, and you know the why, it is much simpler to connect the dots. These components are what makes up the whole innovation process. It is also what makes up the learning process. Think about it. When you learn a concept successfully, it tends to start with you realizing that it is important to learn in the first place. This is the why. Then you know it is important, so you decide to learnhow it works. Finally, for true learning you have to be able to place it within a context. How does it all fit with everything else you already know? It is nearly impossible to forget something learnt in this comprehensive manner. That is how you build up yourmind map - the framework you use to guide you throughout your life. 7. Become super curious I\u2019ve just outlined a way to think for yourself, by using why, how, and so what. Now, I want to say a few words about the thing that helps kickstart the whole process - becoming really curious. Quick quiz, you are most likely reading this on a computer - without looking or pressing the button, what does F5 do? I\u2019d venture to bet that most of you had no idea - that\u2019s okay, neither did I, when I was first asked this question. It made me realize that there is this amazing technology, that most of us use every day, perhaps much more than is healthy or useful, yet I didn\u2019t even know what the buttons do. The least I could do was learn how this thing works, why it behaves the way it does, and get more familiar with what it can do. It is a shame, and it is not because the F5 button will save my life, or because it is crucial knowledge. It is because, I\u2019d never even thought to consider it. I\u2019d never even cared to wonder. The shame is in the pattern of thought I was building up. The world has a lot of wonders to offer, and there are tons of things to learn. BUT, learning doesn\u2019t happen without curiosity. If I never take a second to become curious, how can I hope to expand and fulfill my potential. How can I improve and better myself, and my life? 8. Turn hardships into opportunities \u201cIt ain\u2019t about how many times you can get hit, it\u2019s about how many times you can get hit, and keep getting up\u201d. Every single thing that happens to us can be viewed negatively, or positively. Remember, life is not so much what happens to us, but how we respond. How you choose to perceive an experience, often determines that response. I had a friend in high-school, who could use both of his hands equally well for everything. I was quite surprised, and impressed, because I can\u2019t even draw a proper stick figure using my left hand. When I questioned him how he is so good with both of his hands, he responded that it was because he had broken a hand when he was young, so he forced himself to learn using the other one. It\u2019s quite the attitude. Consider that 95% of us, would\u2019ve most probably just taken it as an opportunity to relax and evade work. Being able to adapt like that and use a disadvantage as simply a chance to improve, is an invaluable skill that can stick with you. It\u2019s inarguably a much better way to live. Hence, when something unpleasant happens pay attention to the way you respond, and try to control it. If you can\u2019t do that from the very beginning, at least pay attention to why not, and to how it made you feel. It might be hard in the beginning, but after a time, it will become automatic. 9. Slow down All of these topics are important enough for their own post, and this one specifically already has one devoted to it. The point is, that doing something slowly, requires you to use your full attention on that thing. The key is that you can only do your work slowly if you do it deliberately and that means to focus on the process and on the current moment. By slow, I don\u2019t mean to do everything in such a way as to bore yourself. I mean at a speed that will allow you to pay absolute attention to what you are doing at any moment. The paradox is that even though it will seem that you are doing the task slower, since all of your energy is being channeled into what you are doing, it gets accomplished much quicker and with less effort. Working slowly goes against everything we\u2019ve been taught. You will see as soon as you try it that your whole mind is revolting, screaming at you to start doing things faster. However, by maintaining your concentration you can silence your brain and produce truly outstanding work. You will know you are there when your mind is no longer panicking that the results are not coming fast enough, because you are so engrossed with the process. Anything you do in a rushed state is much easier when you slow it way down. There is no more rush, no more stress, only success. 10. Reflect Any list like this, that attempts to do something so important, would be incomplete without a fair warning - all of this is useless, if you forget to reflect on your experiences. You can\u2019t read this once and remember, learn, and implement everything, all the time. The greatest teacher is yourself. You have no ulterior motive - you will only do this step, if you truly want to improve - nobody can force you to do it, and nobody is going to blame you if you don\u2019t, except perhaps, you. Incorporate the idea of experimenting into your life. There is a reason that scientific breakthroughs happen after extensive testing - it\u2019s good to have a goal, but if you are not experimenting with ways to achieve it, testing, and writing down your results, you can\u2019t hope to nail down what will get you there. For example, I had the idea last year that I needed to get much more out of my day, so I researched for ways to achieve that. I found something related to polyphasic sleeping (sleeping several short times a day, instead of one big time at night). It seemed like a tall task, but I knew that I would never forgive myself if I didn't try. So for the next two weeks I followed the schedule to the dot - I slept for two 40 minute periods during the day, and one hour and 30 minute period at night. By the end of the first week I was feeling terrible, I was walking around like a zombie, and I was extremely close to the point of simply falling asleep at random points during the day, even while walking. So, I terminated the experiment after a while and I instead looked for ways to get more out of my day, through using the time I had better, instead of trying to create more time. The important point is that I had an idea, I went for it, I tested it, and I saw for myself whether it would work for me or not. Nobody is going to do all the hard work to see what works for each and every one of us - we need to do it for ourselves. My advice is to set up daily, weekly and monthly goals, for each of the things that matter to you. Set up clear criteria for what success would mean and what failure would mean. Then, record what worked out well and what didn\u2019t. Adjust and repeat, adjust and repeat.  I hope this list can be at least one-tenth as useful to you, as it has been to me.

            "answer_text": "How To Make Your Life Better By Becoming More Self-Aware  Can self-awareness really help us reach our goals? Most people do not want want to be labeled as narcissistic, as someone absorbed with themselves 24/7. Yet the focus on self, or self-knowledge, is the single most important trait we can develop in life. Self-awareness allows us to understand our needs, fears, desires, habits\u2014everything that makes us tick. Like it or not, the more you know about yourself, the better and faster you can adapt to the changes that happen in business and life. Change is inevitable, and the better you can handle it, the quicker you\u2019ll land on your feet and move on. There\u2019s a big IF, however. Self-awareness is not self-absorption. Self-awareness assumes that you\u2019ll collect information and insights about yourself so you can make improvements. Self-awareness isn\u2019t a magic bullet, but it\u2019s the place to start. It isn\u2019t the empty promise of a self-help book, either. It means you will need to take a close look at the good, the bad, and the ugly, and honestly assess what you find. Socrates was famous for his quote: \u201cknow thyself,\u201d but it takes more than intellectual self-reflection to unravel the can of worms that forms your personality. Self-awareness expects you to pinpoint your emotions and spend time with all of them, not just the warm and fuzzy ones. There\u2019s one thing you do not need in life\u2014an inappropriate emotion that pops up without warning and sabotages your promotion or ruins a relationship. For myself, I learned early in my career that I\u2019d better get a handle on how to manage my emotions if I wanted to live long enough to collect my retirement. As part of an arrest team in the uglier part of Oakland, my job was to cover the back door while the FBI SWAT team crashed through the front door with a battering ram. These were the sort of criminals who did not hold day jobs\u2014we had waited until 5:00 am to make certain they had made it back home from the night before. I heard, \u201cFBI, come out with your hands up.\u201d Fear was the emotion that caused my hand to shake as I watched to see if one of the suspects would run out the back door. Even after months of firearms training, I reacted like a mewling newbie. Crap, at this rate I wouldn\u2019t hit the side of the building as my hand shook so bad. I wore a bullet-proof vest and knew I was surrounded by highly skilled FBI snipers, but that wasn\u2019t enough to calm my fear that something could go wrong. Then a scuffle, shouts, and the back door opened. One of my colleagues stepped out and gave me the OK sign that the suspects were in custody. As I lowered my weapon, my fear immediately calmed down\u2014the pressure was off. There\u2019s a good reason to focus on emotions if we want to become self-aware. Our brains are hardwired to make us emotional creatures\u2014first and foremost. No matter how tough and self-controlled we think we are, our first reaction will ALWAYS be emotional. We can dampen or deny our emotions, but we are kidding ourselves if we think we can actually control the way in which our brain processes emotions. You do have total control, however, over the thoughts that follow an emotion. If you are in control, you also have a great deal of power over the way in which you react to your emotions and the situation that created it. Mental toughness is managing your emotions by controlling your subsequent thoughts and behavior in ways that will set you up for success. Are you mentally tough? Take this FREE assessment. The key is to be aware of your emotions. If you are not fully aware of what you are feeling, you\u2019ll be clueless about how to handle it effectively. You cannot change what you do not acknowledge. 1. Look At Yourself Objectively No wants to admit they\u2019re a wimp in the face of trouble. On the day of the arrest in Oakland I had to acknowledge that I needed to do a couple of things. First, face my fear. Second, find a way to overcome it. Self-awareness is not some touchy-feely exercise that is meant to make you feel better about yourself. You\u2019ll need to face who you really are, without the pretense of illusion or vanity. It takes a strong mind to not let your emotions jab you in the stomach when you admit to yourself that you are not Superman or Wonder Woman. If you are not in control of your emotions, you can feel like a loser and give up. How To Make It Work For You: Remember that no one is perfect. The idea is to be honest with yourself and identify those areas that need improvement. Study your reactions to situations that bring up different emotions. Look at this as a critique of your performance, not a criticism. I critiqued my performance at the arrest, acknowledged it sucked and knew right then and there I needed to find a way to turn shit into sugar. 2. Keep A Record Of It If we keep in mind that self-awareness is really about self-improvement, writing in a journal makes it easier to record our reactions. A journal allows us to revisit past situations and reactions so we can gauge our progress in the future. Another advantage of a journal is that it\u2019s full of facts, not memories that get distorted over time. A journal is also an excellent place to record responses that serve us well. It\u2019s not all bad news! If there\u2019s a record on how you kept your emotions under control or expressed them in a way that made a difference, it\u2019s a good way to be reminded that you can keep a lid on it when you need to. How To Make It Work For You: Journals are a private place where you can record your honest feelings. This makes it easier for you to push yourself as you figure out what you want. What would be a better response? How can you respond rather than let loose a knee-jerk reaction. Knowing that I had flirted with a coward\u2019s heart at the Oakland arrest, I rehearsed all possible scenarios and outcomes in my mind before the next one. If the suspect ran, I mentally rehearsed my response. If the suspect shot back, I mentally rehearsed my response for that as well. Bottom line: by continually placing myself (mentally) in a situation where I would feel fear, I was able to control my fear when confronted with the real thing. 3. Pinpoint The Triggers Self-awareness enables us to identify what triggers 1) positive and healthy emotions, and 2) negative and unproductive ones. Once you understand what triggers them, you can begin to notice, and then control them. How To Make It Work For You: Here are things to think about: Stop treating your emotions and feelings as either good or bad.Admit each emotion has something to teach you, even negative ones.Recognize that pretending a negative emotion doesn\u2019t exist doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not still there, lurking beneath the surface and ready to sabotage you when you least expect it.Put yourself under surveillance. Notice what event, person or situation provokes a good emotion. Notice what event, person or situation provokes a negative emotion.Keep a journal of what you\u2019ve noticed.Explore why you experienced a good and positive emotion.Explore why you experienced a negative and painful emotion. Did I mention: Remember to journal what you\u2019ve noticed and explored\u2014no matter how unpleasant the emotional experience.Work your way through positive and negative emotions.Express what you are feeling in less than 3 words if it\u2019s a negative emotion. Be honest and stop pretending you aren\u2019t feeling jealous, envious, angry, etc. Do NOT engage in dialogue about these negative feelings, however, as it will only increase your anxiety.Drill down and ask yourself why you do the things you do.Revisit your values.Spot your emotional reactions in others, including movies and books.Use stress as a time to get to know yourself better.Ask for feedback from people you trust.One more time: are you keeping track of this? \u00a9 2020 LaRae Quy.

            "answer_text": "Really an important question! If we can be aware, don\u2019t call it \u2018self-aware\u2019; because if you are aware, you will automatically be aware of yourself as well. If you become just \u2018self-aware\u2019 and not aware of the people and things around you, it would not help you really. Awareness must be holistic, 360 degrees. To be aware, to live in the present, to cultivate witness attitude, are all one and same thing. The first thing you need to realise is: What is it that\u2019s keeping you from being aware? The answer is - continuous train of thinking that one is used to. Our mind is conditioned to travel in the pre-existing grooves. So we just look through life, seeing it with existing lens of familiarity, and we avoid being aware. As soon as an object, or person, or piece of wisdom, comes in front of us, we see it from the lens of what we already know. \u2018Oh, I know this! Oh, I know that! He is like this. He is like that.\u2019 This is dangerous. This means we are closed. We can\u2019t be aware. To be aware, we have to forget what we already know and see again. The tree that we pass daily seems the same but it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s changing. If you are attentive, you will notice. The person you know very well and see daily, seems the same, you know him, but he or she isn\u2019t the same\u2026 if we are attentive, we can sense. But, for you to be attentive, you need to go slow. A person in a hurry cannot be aware. To be aware requires spending more time with the same things, and using all our senses and the mind more purposefully. We cannot just pass things, we have to see them, feel them, experience them carefully. But we can\u2019t become slow suddenly. To become slow, we should practice stop-and-go method with everything. For everything, just stop and perceive. Between things again, stop. Don\u2019t make life continuous. Stop in between to get your bearings. Every five or ten minutes. Unless you stop, how can you be fresh and spontaneous? Good, you started being slow, and you started stopping regularly to just relax and with that calmness sharpen your perception in order to be more aware. Now, life will again come back to you and ask you to hurry. The mind will try to convince you that the world is moving forward and you are left behind. It will try to tell you not to stop, not to relax. These signals are fraudulent. Pay no attention to these. Nothing is being missed by going slow, in fact if you run fast, everything is missed. No moment will return for you to be live again. So honour it with your slow grace and full attention, and no hurry. Salute the moment by not hurrying. Salute existence by paying close attention. Record everything, feel everything and don't worry about what\u2019s the use of recording and feeling? There\u2019s use. Living itself has no use because anyway we will die one day along with all the purpose, all the use. But if you lived through all moments, you would have used life to experience it. That is very, very, very fulfilling. Now, go back to the beginning and read again. No hurry. Carefully, see what you can take from this message and become aware. ",

            "answer_text": "One thing I've recently started and find extremely useful is starting up a regular journalling habit.  I first tried this with a physical journal but eventually ran into several problems  I found staring at a blank page on a journal, waiting to be filled up too intimidating. I either ran out of things to write or just had too much to write that journalling took too long. Journalling became a hassle and too tiring to keep up.   Because of this, the sleek Moleskine journal I bought with amazing plans to chronicle my everyday's life's journey became unused.  Along the way on the Internet, I discovered this amazing free app called Grid Diary (Page on griddiaryapp.com) which solved my problem of being too intimidated by a blank page.  The app has helped me maintain a daily journalling habit and take stock of my day for these 3  simple reasons. 1. It uses prompts to start your writingCan't think at the end of the day? Grid Diary uses a \"fill up the form\" type of approach which you can customise and fill in as you like.  This has saved me valuable mental energy of thinking of what to write at the end of the day.  Journaling has helped me become more self-aware by forcing me to actively think of how I've spent my day.  Some of the questions I set for myself to answer include: - What are 2 things I am grateful for today? - 1 thing that can be improved- What have I learnt today?- Did I come across anything memorable today?  2. It is easy to access and establish a journalling habit Sometimes at the end of a long work day, you just want to lie in bed and do nothing. I set up a daily reminder near my usual bedtime to write in my Grid Diary, ensuring that I keep writing in my journal no matter how tired I am by the end of the day.   3. I can use other forms of media to document my day Don't feel like writing today? Take photos, screenshots, shoot a video / vlog, voice record  and attach it to your journal entry. I love using photos and screenshots in my journal entries, especially if I come across memorable quotations or quotes on social media which I want to save for future reference.    Like all habits, journalling takes time to reap any benefits for yourself. What I've noticed in myself after establishing this journalling habit are:  - My memory of the day's events has improved. By forcing myself to remember the day's events, I avoid the \"sleepwalking through life\" type of feeling. - Regular journalling gets your thoughts and feelings out on paper (or on the screen). Only you get to see these words. They can be as eloquent and articulate as you want, or as incoherent and vulgar as you want. What truly matters is that you get the words out on the page.  -  By remembering the day's events, you bring to mind what went well in a (potentially crappy) day. Sometimes all we need are little reminders during a shitty day that \"hey, it isn't that bad after all\". You'll get through and tomorrow will be a better day.  Want to be more self-aware and reflective? Start a journalling habit today. Use whatever medium and media you are comfortable with, but what is more important is establishing a regular habit for self-contemplation and reflection after each day.  One site that has completely changed my concept of journalling and the potential of this activity is Kaizen Journalling (kaizenjournaling.com)  which you can refer to for more inspiration and ideas to start your journalling habit!

            "answer_text": "By necessity, humans had to evolve to become more \u201cself-aware\u201d in order to better support the continuity of the increasingly more complex social system they created. Perhaps during more primordial periods of human existence, self-awareness was not so critical to the survival of a group. During such times, nature and natural instinct were the primary drivers of behavior and group survival, and consciousness or self-awareness served little purpose. Imagine yourself as now back during the primordial period of human existence sitting around the campfire during dinner with a bunch of primitives. Your self-awareness just might turn out to be a big headache for you as you watch and hear your dinner mates rip mostly raw meat from bones with their canines between grunts. No matter how much you\u2019d say to yourself, \u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s gross! I can\u2019t imagine myself doing that\u201d it\u2019ll probably be best that you kept your complaint to yourself\u2026 because they would not care a hoot about that or any other aspect of your self-awareness. Now fast forward: First day on a new job. You\u2019ll need to quickly reflect on who you are as a person so as to meet and relate with they type of workmates you\u2019ll best get along with. You\u2019ll need to re-appraise your skills and abilities to once again consider if they are right for the job. And-oh\u2026 when the boss comes around, you\u2019ll need to be especially aware of what you say, how you say it, and how you behave\u2014all for the purpose of continuing to put on a positive impression. As such, your self-awareness serves your ability to succeed on the job, and con- sequently\u2014survive. Additionally, the job you work for, by employing a self-aware, cognizant individual, supports its chances of survival through success. Now do you seriously think that this would also be the case if it were to hire those same \u201craw- meat-on-the-bone\u201d snacking primitives you sat around the campfire eating dinner with earlier\u2014 who might have snacked on you as well had you expressed any self-awareness toward them.

            "answer_text": " Others Might Know You Better Than You Know Yourself Here\u2019s Why and 4 Practices to Improve Your Self-Awareness How are you perceived by others? How can you become more self-aware? A study conducted at Washington University in St. Louis shows that the people around you sometimes know you better than you know yourself. Here\u2019s an example from my life: I\u2019ve always believed myself to be a compassionate and caring individual. But one day someone pointed out to me that I can be intimidating and intense. I was a bit shocked. I didn\u2019t feel intimidating (in fact, quite the opposite). Trying so hard to focus and help others, I would furrow my brow and look intently at the other person. Someone described it as a \u201cconstipated look\u201d on my face. It portrayed an intense and at times intimidating demeanor\u2026I had no idea. I\u2019ve had many more of these blind spots revealed in my life\u200a\u2014\u200aand I\u2019m sure more are yet to discover. What about you? What gaps do you have between your self-perception and how others perceive you? It\u2019s not easy to know and here\u2019s why.  How Is It That We Are so Self-Unaware? There are several reasons knowing yourself can be challenging. It might be because you lack certain information about yourself. In my case, I never thought to look in a mirror while I was conversing with another person (that would be strange if I did). Or you might possess too much information about yourself. Thoughts, feelings, habits, beliefs, and past experiences are all swirling around in your body and mind. This whirlwind makes it hard to decipher what is true. Most of all, the reason we don\u2019t know ourselves is that we are prone to self-deception. Research shows that people often distort reality to fit their self-image. Our egos seek to protect us, resulting in a natural tendency to justify what we already believe to be true. Why do we have such a divisive culture in the world today? Because our ego spends all its energy conjuring up reasons for why I am right and you are wrong. If you want to improve your conversations and connection with others, then come back and ponder this one later. It\u2019s hard to be self-aware, but a skill you can develop nonetheless. Here are several ideas.   Four Practices to Increase Your Self-Awareness \u201cMan, sometimes it takes a long time to sound like yourself.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMiles Davis Here are four practices to increase your self-awareness\u200a\u2014\u200anone of which involve living in a mountainside monastery sipping green tea (I\u2019ve never done anything like that, but it might be helpful too) But let\u2019s start with something practical. 1. Self-Distancing Studies show the best way we can see ourselves clearly and make sound decisions is to create distance from our perceived challenge. Instead of asking yourself, \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d Ask, \u201cIf a friend was experiencing this situation, what advice would I tell them? \u201c This is an example of self-distancing. Another exercise would be to journal about what\u2019s going on in your life, but as if you were writing about someone else. Writing in the third person is a great way to distance yourself so that you are more objective in deciding how to best move forward. If you want to understand a personal challenge or navigate a difficult situation, then its best to do so without being entangled in all your thoughts and emotions. Self-distancing is a great way to do this. 2. Practice Mindfulness What would it be like if you could observe your thoughts, emotions, and experiences in the moment? What if you could choose what\u2019s helpful and let the rest pass? This is the result of practicing mindfulness for as little as 20 minutes per day. Mindfulness develops your ability to observe and respond to life, rather than swept away by it. Mindfulness allows you to \u201cperceive with clarity the path you are actually on and the direction in which you are going\u2026so that maybe you will be in a better position to chart a course for yourself that is truer to your inner being\u200a\u2014\u200aa soul path, a path with heart, your path with a capital P,\u201d says Jon Kabat-Zin, leading expert on mindfulness. He defines mindfulness as \u201cthe awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment\u200a\u2014\u200anon-judgmentally.\u201d Mindfulness has so much to offer you and is worth exploring deeper.  3. Focus on Your Own Mortality (Seriously) What\u2019s the reason you get distracted? How often do you find yourself going through the motions instead of fully engaging with life? \u201cIt\u2019s not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSeneca Often, what\u2019s at the root of apathy is a lack of clarity and meaning. A great way to re-center yourself on what matters most is to know that death is waiting for you. You don\u2019t know where you are on the spectrum of life. But wouldn\u2019t you want to be sure you use the time you do have to its fullest potential? Snap your life into focus by asking yourself these four questions. You\u2019ll bring into your mind\u2019s eye what matters and where you desire to make a difference. The self-awareness you gain will help you create urgency to start today on that thing you\u2019ve been putting off. 4. Work with a Coach An accelerant to your growth is the feedback you receive and the intentional action you take to create what you want most in life. A coach is a great resource for you if the stakes are high and your development is critical to future success. Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO, says finding a coach when he was running Google was one of the greatest decisions he made. \u201cEvery famous athlete, every famous performer has somebody who is a coach, somebody who can watch what they are doing, and say is that what you really meant? They can give them perspective,\u201d says Schmidt. \u201cThe one thing that people are never good at is seeing themselves as others see them. A coach really really helps.\u201d \u201cThe one thing that people are never good at is seeing themselves as others see them. A coach really really helps.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aErick Schmidt, Former Google CEO Professional athletes take their personal development seriously. Their careers benefit greatly from it. How are you any different?  Conclusion While it can be hard to know yourself, it is possible. With practice, you can learn to see yourself more clearly. You can learn to separate the signal from the noise. Doing so will bring your life in alignment with who you are meant to be. \u201cOur job in this life is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSteven Pressfield The future holds your opportunity. Are you self-aware and ready to seize it when it shows up? ",

            "answer_text": "There are many different layers to self-awareness, so it all depends on how deep and/or complex you want to go. It also depends on why you want to develop greater self-awareness, what you want to achieve with it. For the purpose of this answer, I\u2019m going to assume you want: To be a good personTo have more effective relations with othersTo feel good about yourselfSo then self-awareness relates to identifying areas of your behaviour, attitudes, perceptions, and inner workings that inhibit that. A lot of people are unaware or undiscriminating about the inner forces that drive their behaviour and attitudes. So they may fall victim to ugly traits like arrogance, vengefulness, hatred, extreme selfish greed, excessive lust, envy/jealousy, fearfulness, etc.. These things can drive your behaviour and nomatter how cleverly you think you can mask it, ultimately people pick up on your vibe and they feel where you are at. So being self-aware means seeing these types of mechanisms in operation within you, deciding whether that\u2019s the way you want to be, and then if you deem it necessary, making some adjustments, genuine adjustments to the way you want to be. And that usually means adopting a new approach e.g. instead of being arrogance, start trying to be more respectful etc.. There is another side to self-awareness that you possibly didn\u2019t think about: What is the self? Am I a collection of cells made of atoms and molecules? Or am I something more? Where does my unified field of consciousness come from? Is it an epiphenomenon arising out of the neural activity of my brain? Or is it something more? My contention is that conscious beings are something more than the physical biological machines we inhabit. We are in essence a type of non-physical or spiritual energy - just as real as matter but existing on a different plane of existence and interacting with the material world through the interface of this body and brain. This being the case, a huge step in self-awareness is being aware of what the true self is - and that is the beginning of a huge journey. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that the quickest way you can become more self aware is by sitting with uncomfortable emotions. When someone has hurt you, or when something doesn\u2019t work out for you, allowing yourself to actually feel those feelings instead of wanting to run away from them, can give you greater understanding of yourself, how you react to situations outside of yourself and how to manage them better. I have to say that this is the single most effective way I worked on my anger problems. Instead of beating myself up about how I lost my temper yet again, I would start to ask myself what I was feeling physically when I was getting to that space of anger, (hot ears, tension in my shoulders, etc) and then from there doing my best to listen to the voice in my head and what it is telling me. During that process, sometimes I would calm down, other times I would end up losing it, but what it taught me was to stop judging myself, to understand that this is a defensive mechanism I had created for decades, and I was in the process of slowly unlearning it. Now, instead of getting mad every other week, I can count how many times on my one hand how many times I get unreasonably angry in a year. So 1: Notice your feelings and thoughts when you are in a space of discomfort 2: Start journaling- write down what you are feeling and going through. Do your very best not to judge, berate or criticize yourself. 3: You will start to notice a pattern, especially the way you react to certain situations. 4: Read or watch videos on YT about solutions to those specific feelings and reactions you feel. Talk to someone you trust deeply about what you are going through, someone who you know very well that can offer you new perspectives and points of view. Rinse and repeat. This formula has helped me out in ways that even I cannot believe. I hope it does for you too! ",

You'll be able to hear the voice of your heart and soul.Write a journal every day. And re-read it to understand your consistent thoughts and behaviours. Write about your priorities, goals, fears and insecurities as much as you write about your feelings or how the day went. And you'll know your priorities and fears better.Be completely honest in your thoughts, words and actions. And you'll become aware of all the lies you tell yourself and others.Live mindfully. Try to do everything mindfully. And you'll become aware of your mindless, compulsive habits of checking your phone every 10 mins, the need to have coffee 4 times a day etc.Be disciplined. Following a good daily routine leads to a healthy body and a healthy mind and does wonders. Being self aware requires time, dedication and consistency.Be courageous enough to be vulnerable in your relationships. No more concealing / hiding anything about yourself from your closest friends, family or partner. That's the first step towards emotional awareness and growth. Then ask them. People who've known you for years know a lot more about you than you probably think. Many hesitate to tell you your shortcomings for different reasons. Just ask them.Romantic relationships bring out the worst in you sometime or the other. Your romantic relationships often reveal your deepest insecurities, worst behavioral patterns, habits and unresolved emotional issues. You'll be surprised to see how strongly your parents' relationship and childhood experiences influence your approach to love.Positions of responsibility and power also reveal yourself to you. Anonymity also does the same. Do you actually have integrity? Do you do the right thing even when no one is watching?Doing all this mindfully will help a lot. All the very best. ",

            "answer_text": "Activity in the main resting network of the brain \u2014 the mind-wandering default mode network (called the \u201cdefault mode\u201d because it activates when you stop trying to do stuff, so it activates \u201cby default\u201d) \u2014 is appreciated as sense-of-self. Reduce that activity and sense-of-self tends to go away. Practice a form of meditation that enhances and lowers the noise of DMN activity and sense-of-self becomes stronger and less-noisy. All the positive traits associated with DMN activity automatically improve as DMN activity becomes lower-noise and more efficient. See: Default mode network - Function All the negative traits associated with imbalances in DMN activity automatically become less. See: Default mode network - Pathophysiology Not every one of those specific points has been scientifically investigated yet, but those that have, show the trend I asserted: positive aspects of DMN activity improve and negative traits due to DMN imbalance/pathology become less, as DMN activity becomes lower-noise due to practice of Transcendental Meditation. This includes both physiological measures and behavioral traits associated with Attention Deficit Disorder and autism. Another way of saying \u201cless-noisy\u201d is to say \u201cmore balanced\u201d and so [more-balanced DMN activity is associated with eudaimonic (self-actualizing) attitudes.](Pleasure attainment or self-realization: the balance between two forms of well-beings are encoded in default mode network) So improving sense-of-self at the level of its physical basis \u2014 more efficient resting activity in the DMN\u2014 leads to dramatic increases in positive traits and dramatic decreases in negative traits, even in normal, healthy children. So sense-of-self \u2014 self-awareness \u2014 emerges out of DMN activity, and the quality of DMN activity impacts behavior and mental health in myriad ways which can easily be improved (most especially if the issues are stress related rather than due to structural damage or developmental malfunctioning) simply by accustoming the DMN to rest more efficiently.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the individual. Search the web and be open to try things that appeal to you. It can help to understand the obstacle to self-awareness: the stress we have accumulated by growing up in a highly stressed world. Mild unhappiness, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, low self-esteem, procrastination, inability to focus, being overwhelmed, depending on relationships for your happiness, distraction, restlessness, lack of patience, \u2018brain fog\u2019, repeating thoughts, misery, irritability, and anger can be dissolved relatively quickly at home through deep enough rest. The same thing is true for lack of self-awareness. These symptoms are all typical of growing up in a dysfunctional world. The dysfunctions of the world get reflected in the dysfunctions of our nervous systems, and these cause us to suffer limitations and psychological disorders that are easily corrected by eliminating those dysfunctions. The nervous system can be strengthened and normalized by adding to our usual waking, dreaming, and sleeping states the fourth state of the physiology and of consciousness, a state of deep restful alertness. For such mild or associated stress-based mental health disorders, or to reach fulfillment in life, my advice is to take the 6-lesson Natural Stress Relief\u2122 (NSR) course, available inexpensively through the mail. Relief begins at the end of the very first lesson, and grows and is sustained over time. NSR is practiced for 15 minutes twice a day while sitting in a comfortable chair with the eyes closed. It is easy, natural, and pleasant to practice, and requires no belief or change in your lifestyle. It is not religious and it does not conflict with any religion or belief. It is completely effortless. NSR refreshes mind and body, eliminating stress-based disorders and bringing peace and happiness to every life. NSR is accepted by many as an alternative to the well-known Transcendental Meditation\u2122 course. But NSR is not TM: it costs only 7% as much, and does not require traveling to a meditation center many times during and following TM instruction. NSR brings a very deep and unique state of rest that dramatically eliminates stresses from the nervous system until all stresses are gone. Free from stress and limitation, life is lived in love and joy, strength and success. Unsolicited testimonials from some of the many thousands of clients and published, peer-reviewed research on NSR is described on the NSR website . Note that Natural Stress Relief is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) research and education charity by the U.S. Department of Revenue. We are a volunteer-run organization, part of a worldwide project. We take no salary for our work in teaching the knowledge of transcending. We do this for the pleasure of helping individuals, our countries, and the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Lately I\u2019ve been writing about a few things, between the lines this came up my mind How can I become more self-aware?  To answer this, I have to define \u201cSelf-Aware\u201d The idea of self-awareness can be more than one interpretation, and I\u2019m referring to two online definitions while giving this answer \u201cThe capacity for introspection and ability to recognize oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals\u201d - Source(https://goo.gl/J2xLor) \u201cHaving a clear perception of your personality as to understanding other people and how they perceive you, as well as your attitude to them at the moment.\u201d - Source(https://goo.gl/6mTWMQ) A layman\u2019s definition would be; self-awareness is just knowing your self better. A friend told me months back, \u201cJude, know thyself\u201d, over time I figured this required me being self-aware (Knowing my habits, quirks and overall character). So the key to being self-aware is being more mindful. As you know; Mindfulness doesn\u2019t imply spirituality or meditation rather it means bringing attention to yourself and your surroundings as you act on purpose with a purpose. *Observe your thoughts: When and opinion or judgment is passed through your mind, introspect and wonder why you thought that way. For instance, you see a photo of Jane Doe on Facebook and she seem to be leaving an expensively rich life and you think, \u2018She must be really rich.\u2019 Don\u2019t just stick to that thought. Ask yourself why you thought that way. Consider how she might have ended up with enough money to afford that life also consider how hard she might have worked (if she worked at all) to live that soft. Realize that having negative thoughts does not make you a bad person, as you can observe these thoughts and dismiss them. *Observe your emotions: If someone\u2019s pissed and shouts at you, you may want to return the favor and shout back at them, Pause and consider why they are yelling at you. Possibly because they\u2019re having an awful day and you turned out being the victim of circumstance or maybe you did something that got them disappointed or annoyed. Realize that you can\u2019t always control your feeling about what\u2019s happening, but that you can make conscious decision to act based on what\u2019s important. *Observe your actions: An instance; remember that street beggar you saw coming towards you then you looked the opposite direction and your immediate thought was \u201cI don\u2019t hate him but he irritates me\u201d or whatever your thought may be, think about this thought, what you are doing and what you need to do. You have the power to make a conscious choice and do what you need irrespective of your thoughts The core idea behind this is to learning self-observation. It\u2019s not a complex skill.

            "answer_text": " There are two forms of self-awareness. The first is awareness of your internal state. The second is awareness of your external state. Both are crucial for your success and happiness. Internal awareness is when you are able to watch your thoughts and notice your emotions. It involves watching your thoughts as if you are separate from them. This form of awareness is important in learning what drives you and what your purpose is for doing what you do. External awareness involves being able to see yourself through the eyes of someone else. This form of awareness is important for knowing how other people think about you and how they react to you. If you\u2019ve ever been trapped in a conversation where you\u2019re showing all the signs that you want to leave but the other person just keeps talking, you have witnessed a lack of external awareness. So how do you get both forms of awareness? Luckily, you can work on both at the same time. Here are the five methods you can use: 1. Writing. I can\u2019t stress enough how great writing is for your self-awareness. Even if you never want a single word to be seen by the public, start writing your thoughts. Nicolas Cole got me into writing and it\u2019s been a game-changer for understanding myself. Start with a journal or an empty Word document and just starting writing your thoughts. I call this a \u201cBrain Dump.\u201d When I have a difficult decision to make, I\u2019ll open a Word document and start spilling my thoughts on the options. For some reason, every time I do this I leave the session having a much clearer idea of what to do. 2. Walking. My newest self-awareness trick is to take \u201cfocus walks.\u201d Throughout the day, I\u2019ll have many things on my mind. However, I never have time to give these thoughts all my attention because something always interrupts my thinking. A focus walk is the cure. Have your topic in mind and go for a 15\u201330 minute walk, alone and with no phone. Just you, the sidewalk, and your thoughts. Try to only think about your one topic. If you get distracted, bring your attention back to the topic. Do this over and over as you walk. You would be very surprised how much you can learn about yourself on one of these walks. I recently went to answer a question about what I want most out of life. This question was so deep that it made me realize I actually didn\u2019t know what I wanted in life. So I took a walk around the block to ponder it and ended up realizing exactly what I wanted most in life mid-way through the walk! 3. Meditation. I honestly think meditation is one of the reasons I know myself so well. I\u2019ve done over 200 meditation sessions and learned a lot through them. Unlike before, I know notice my emotions and my impulses. For example, when I get angry now, I notice my mind say \u201cYou\u2019re getting angry right now, what do you walk to do about this?\u201d instead of being caught in the impulse. I also know catch myself when I start judging someone. Instead of immediately calling someone names in my head, I think \u201cDon\u2019t judge him, he is no different than you.\u201d Try an app like Headspace to start (they have a free ten day trial I believe.) I\u2019ve been using it for over a year. 4. Body language. You never want to be the guy or girl who doesn\u2019t notice when he/she is talking way too much or getting strange looks from others. Start paying more attention to the body language people use when they talk to each other. If someone is talking to you and repeatedly breaking eye contact, they might not be that interested in the conversation. Don\u2019t hold them there, give them an easy way out. Check out the book How To Win Friends and Influence People has some good tips. But you can also just start reading about body language online. 5. Lifting weights.

And the second definition is \u201cbecoming more aware of what ones mind does.\u201d Turns out, this is not increasing self-awareness. It\u2019s merely creating memories of the processes of the brain. Later the brain dies. See the problem? We want to walk into every situation like James Bond. Minus the cigarettes, the chauvinism, the sexism, the license to kill, the history of having killed, and the disturbingly twisted predatory sexuality. But otherwise we want to be Jimmy who never has even a single stray thought in his perfect clarity about what\u2019s what. Let\u2019s face it. Ian Fleming didn\u2019t stint when he created James Bond\u2019s core: high smarts, educated, experienced, potent, fit, tested, respected, honored, authoritative, and ready for anything. So, yikes, you came to the wrong person for a number 2 answer. Everyone you meet, however, will tell you a thousand ways to become as splendid as Bond. You know the to-do list. But the first self. Yeah, I can\u2019t help you with that either. I notice you already have all the self you could ever have. Just sayin\u2019 you are the self and at the exact heart of every moment. I don\u2019t know how you could miss this fact. Kinda thinkin\u2019 you\u2019re not lookin\u2019. And I\u2019m running short of words here, so I\u2019ll just put this poem I wrote in high school to fluff up this essay. WHO IS THAT MAN? I say, old sport, who\u2019s that manSo young and debonair?Oh, now just who is he?Have I seen him somewhere? So handsome, and agileSo tall and strong is he.Oh yes I know that man!Now just who could he be? Was it at the Statler?Or was it on a yacht?He must be very wealthy.Look at the ring he's got! He's a Duke or something.He looks the part I'll say.Maybe an Earl or Count.He's majestic anyway. He's so poised and perfect.Yes, a real gentleman.Watch him help that lady,Doing what 'ere he can. What a man! What a man!All good words fit his fame.And though I am trying,I just can't catch his name. Yes, though I know that man,It\u2019s never to remember, I fear.Oh now just what is his name?Oh wait. . . It's just a mirror! ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to be self-aware you need to get to the other side. You cannot stay on the same side of the thinking mind and still be self-aware. You can be self-aware all you want from the silent mind and with that I mean not just of yourself but also access the Universe and experience it and its natural laws and feel the force of your True Self come up against You and your Mind.  There are 2 sides to your mind. If you stay within the confines of verbal thinking you will never see that unseen side of you where all the magic happens in your life. The shift is very easy to do. Please look up Quora as they are many ways to make this shift. I myself use a simple method: I stop verbalising my thoughts. I watch the flutter of my vocal cords all the time I want to go silent in mind. It is like a mantra to me. In fact, I think that is why the mantra was created in the first place in cross-legged meditation - to distract you from verbal thinking. So you go to the source for silencing the mind. Just stop verbal thinking or that silent self-talk that you need to do of what you want to think so you can think at all. What is this about us, it is as if the brain has to hear us to know what we want to think so it can process our thoughts. So if it does not hear us then it processes nothing in the mind and hence NO (verbal) thinking. When the mind is silent there is still pictorial thinking (silent thinking by images) and intuitive thinking where at times can be like a silent \u201csense of knowing\u201d going through the mind. You need to deal with these types of thinking in the silent mind, especially image-making in the mind before it can go completely silent. Then accessing the Universe is all yours.  ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of self awareness can have more than one interpretation, and I\u2019m referring to two online definitions while giving this answer. Having a clear perception of your personality, which allows you to understand other people and how they perceive you, as well as your attitude and perceptions to them at the moment. (Source: Self Awareness)The capacity for introspection and ability to recognize oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals. (Source: Self-awareness - Wikipedia)In the simplest terms, self awareness is just knowing yourself better. This can be broken down to gaining more immediate self awareness or being in the moment(like recognizing your current state of being and emotions) or being self aware over a longer period of time(knowing your habits, quirks and overall character). The key to self awareness is simply being more mindful. Mindfulness doesn\u2019t imply meditation or spirituality. It rather means bringing attention to yourself and your surroundings to act with a purpose. Observe your thoughts. If an opinion or judgement passes through your mind, introspect and wonder why you had that thought. Say you see someone large, or bulky pass by, and you immediately think, \u2018Gosh, I bet they eat really unhealthy.\u2019 Don\u2019t just stay with that thought. Ask yourself why you thought of that. Consider that they may have had a genetic disorder or problem with their body that made them look that way. Realize that having negative thoughts doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, rather, you can observe these thoughts and dismiss them.Observe your emotions. If someone\u2019s angry and is yelling at you, you may have the urge to yell at them back. Pause and wonder why they might be yelling at you. Maybe you really did something to disappoint or annoy them. Maybe they just had a bad day and are bringing out their feelings on you. Realize that you can\u2019t control your feelings to what may be happening, but you can make a conscious decision to act based on what\u2019s most important.Observe your actions. This is something you can control. If you have a daunting task you need to do, an immediate thought you have is, \u2018Nah, I\u2019ll just do it later.\u2019 Think about this thought and what you need to do. You have the complete power to make a conscious choice to get up and complete that task irrespective of your thoughts.",

And self-awareness simply means looking at yourself - not achieveing something called \u2018self awareness\u2019 Having thought about this for a long time, I am conducting a workshop that I have been designing for a long, long time. My goal was to not teach about self-awareness, but actually help you become more self-aware. The workshop is called \u201cUnderstanding YourSelf: Pathway to freedom\u201d. I am conducting it from 14\u201316 Aug 2020. 6 hours spread over 3 days. The pricing is on a \u201cPay what you can\u201d basis. You can register here. Self awareness is something that I have always thought is the first step to many other ripple side effects that percolate into your life. The focus will not be to teach you about transformation - but to actually help you transform. What will you discover during the course?

This is a 100% experiential workshop. The focus will not be to teach you ABOUT how people operate. It will be to help you discover first-hand how YOU operate.

The precession of the equinox is the 12 different geometrical energy alignments that planet earth and humanity experience because of the precise magnetic alignment that we \u201cthink of\u201d as a wobble. Each one is roughly 25,000 years. We have been in this third density state for 75,000 years and in 2012 we shifted. The purpose of third density conscious within the developing system\u2019s of the universe is to shift from the animal stage of second density consciousness into becoming human enough to choose the path of our future, individual development. Each one of the 7.8 Billion humans on planet are now making a choice, either consciously or unconsciously. By 2030, planet earth will be well into being a positive, fourth density consciousness planet and the humans on her will also be developing along the same path. There are Two conscious choices. \u201cService to self\u201d and \u201cService to others\u201d, as well as not choosing and progressing in third density until becoming ready to make a choice. There have been people in charge of the mass\u2019s of humans who know about the choice and have decided to follow the negative path of \u201cService to self\u201d. This is why kings and queens are classed as having \u201cdivine right to rule\u201d. It is also the reason for the many difficulties we are going to face over the next year and a half because of their lack of grace to let go. Most likely their greed and need to remain on the negative path is too strong. Now is the time to become SELF-AWARE of your own unique consciousness and to make the choice of which path you desire following. The negative path is as legitimate as the positive path, but not on planet earth. The positive path is based on self-respect and unconditional love so that there is no room to control others for your own need of greed and become a supreme minion of a higher negative GOD. ",

            "answer_text": "The main idea is to learn self-observation. It\u2019s not a complex skill. Formal sitting meditation is the most \u201cpure\u201d form of that, and that\u2019s a good place to start. But there are many kinds of meditation, some of which do little or nothing to improve self-awareness. So you shouldn\u2019t assume that just because something says \u201cmeditation\u201d on the label that it will help with awareness development. To \u201cobserve\u201d anything involves attention without reaction. You want to notice your thoughts and feelings, in particular \u2014 although it\u2019s also helpful to notice the here-and-now sensory input, body sensations, and other content of your experience. The thing to watch out for is reactive thinking: when you start to self-observe, the mind\u2019s conditioned tendency to \u201cchase thoughts\u201d becomes very apparent. This is reactive thinking, in which one thought triggers another which triggers another, and before long you\u2019re ruminating \u2014 trying to figure things out, fantasizing, etc. That\u2019s not observation, that\u2019s thinking. Observation is like watching something. You don\u2019t get involved with what you\u2019re watching, you don\u2019t try to stop it or keep it going, you don\u2019t try to figure it out or analyze it, etc. You just watch. This takes significant discipline\u2026 there\u2019s a distinct urge to do all that other stuff, and that must be restrained. As you build skill at observation, you can then start to see patterns, such as associations between certain kinds of thinking and certain experiences or feelings. This \u201chigher level\u201d kind of observing is where you start to understand the mind \u2014 what is it trying to do? What is the underlying driving force of this thinking and feeling? etc. I like certain kinds of questions as \u201cstimulators\u201d of awareness. I call them \u2018probe questions\u2019. Once you\u2019re able to stabilize your attention so that you\u2019re not chasing thoughts all the time, it can be useful to add a practice of tossing in these questions occasionally. This is similar to koan practice in Zen (I was a Zen student years ago.) An example of a probe question is \u201cwhat am I addicted to?\u201d The idea is to ask the question silently, but then return to observation. Don\u2019t ruminate or analyze, just watch. Acknowledge whatever comes up and let it go. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re sending something down into the unconscious mind \u2014 you can\u2019t control where it goes or whether it falls into the void, etc., you just drop it over the side and let go of it. Over time, those parts of the mind do tend to respond. Sometimes the response is sort of random and irrelevant, and sometimes it\u2019s right on the money and clear. So that\u2019s a practice that I like for \u201cflushing out\u201d the unrecognized patterns and beliefs and so forth. The most important thing in all of this is a recognition of the power and value of awareness to untangle the knots of false identity. When you don\u2019t know who you are, life is a struggle and it\u2019s hard to be satisfied. So untangling that mess should be a top priority for everyone, and awareness practice is the #1 tool for untangling the mess. Persistence counts. ",

            "answer_text": "There seems to be some vagueness with this question. First of all, there is an \u201cI\u201d in this statement. This \u201cI\u201d acts as the center from which you like awareness to radiate out. I think if you see closely, this centered \u201cI\u201dness is the root of all dissonance and fragmentation you might be feeling due to which you might be having the thought of cultivating self awareness. Secondly this is a wish, a desire to cultivate self awareness which is laced with some hope. It means you are not self aware now, whatever that means. But, do you know you are not self aware now, as a fact? And if you are not sure, would you be sure when something like that, if it is real, happens to you, appears in front of you? May be you can start by stripping off all the bookish knowledge and concepts about self-awareness that is written or said by somebody else. Even ignore this answer after you read it. You have the sensory perceptions, the mind, the intellect and the millions years of inherited conditioning of being a human being. In a clear space in the mind, meditate on the moment as you live it, as you live your daily life. Self awareness cannot be any more or less significant than your response to an ordinary event of everyday life. And to \u201ccultivate\u201d it, is to suck out the life off of a moment and make it a habit to be practiced. It is like employing taxidermy to make a stuffed animal head and hang it on the wall of your mind. You are constantly reminded of a deer by seeing the lifeless stuffed head on the wall, but nothing else. Stop attaching extraordinary significance to the phrase \u201cself-awareness\u201d. You may be able to touch something new, a renewing quality to your mind that keeps shining every minute of the day. ",

Image by Stefan Keller from Pixabay I am not going to go deep into this rabbit hole today but the most important way to become more self-aware is to spend time with yourself. But I don\u2019t mean spending time watching tv or playing video games. If you want to become more self-aware then you need shut yourself off from all the distractions which are holding you back of becoming more self-aware. You need to cut off the noise around you. How? Start learning meditationStart learning contemplationStart reading books (personal development books)If you become more self-aware then you will live a much more content and fullfilled life. Self-awareness means nothing else but being more connected to life and to deeper understand reality. If you are not self-aware, if you don\u2019t understand life, how then do you want to live in this life, tell me? What do you want to do with your life then anyway if you don\u2019t have a single clue what it is all about? Chasing money, sex or fame based on your cravings and desires? Life is not only about simple surviving, it is not just about eating, sleeping, shitting and fucking. That\u2019s for chimps. So more self-aware you become so less desires you will have. You will becoome more free. Self-awareness means freedom. Freedom from your mind playing all sorts of tricks on you, deceiving you. Self-awareness brings clarity. Self-awareness is about living the good life. Hope I could help. Please visit my profile page for more info! Thanks, Marcel ",

            "answer_text": "By testing yourself in situations that push you to the limit. Skydiving and hang gliding are pretty good for making one feel alive! Getting into a situation where your attitude is determining your survival. I know that beating an illness that has nearly killed a person, has given them a new zest and vigor for remaining alive, so to me this serves as an indication of what it takes to hold ones life in real value. Learning to live in the moment brings one into focus with the immediate reality and creates a sense of presence and belonging as your interface with matter is a measure of ones, determination, commitment, progress and abillity. You see before you in real time what you are or are not capable of and what you have achieved stands as an indication of how well you are doing. This creates a great feeling of self worth. I panel beated my van passenger door last weekend. It had a shoulder sized ding in it, that was caused by some inconsiderate bastard in a car parking building and my panel beater wanted $1000 to replace the entire door. I didn\u2019t have a clue if I could fix it, but I piled into it anyway and by the end of Sunday afternoon it looked almost like new. Not perfect but close. The sense of satisfaction I got from attempting to do this myself was worth far more than the money I saved. This effectively raised my self awareness considerably, because I had no idea I also had a panel beater living inside me! See how it works now? ",

Mindfulness of \u201cego\u201d Well sort of. That constitutes more awareness of more of our parts. As we become more aware of our feelings (some are gross, some subtle and some very subtle) we become more self-aware.

We can recognise that self is a mental construct that does not exist in the way it appears to. Mindfulness of sunyata. We can recognise that self is mere appearance and mere name. Mindfulness of the Middle Way. Ref Madyamika Prasanghika We can recognise that we can impute \u2018self\u2019 onto any object. It is arbitary even though that\u2019s the last thing it seems to be. Ref Buddhist Tantra. We can, if we wish, then impute \u201cself\u201d on to the primordial consiousness. Ref Advaita Vedanta and Rigpa. But recognising self is only a label, a word, nothing more. Some of the above can come from meditation in general, some from Buddhist meditation, some from Hindu meditation, some from Psychotherapy/Counselling and understanding dysfunction. We can learn to receive feedback about our faults and weaknesses by asking skilled friends and family (tread carefully). All of the above can be explored and realised directly. It\u2019s just parts, aspects and definitions of self. This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list. Happy discovering. ",

So having said that, I ask you, what does self-awareness mean? It means that you know yourself. So this time, I ask you, how do you get yourself to \u201cknowing\" something? You explore. Explore yourself by experiencing new things in life. By doing that, you will have to deal with new challenges, ones that you have had no clue about. In those sitautions of cluelessness, you will start working on possible solutions to understand and handle those situations, good or bad. It is in those moments, that you truly discover what you are made of. The only catch is that you can't give up working on it. Focus is the key to every thing. Kudos if you don't lose your way. Complete self-awareness is the condition for attaining Moksh (liberation). This is what my Hindu culture has preached for thousands of years. Thus, it is what I believe to be the ultimate goal.  You see, doing anything new means change. Change is the most fundamental of terms one can use, to even remotely characterise this universe. Change is the process that starts when something new comes into existence and is on the verge of being experienced. So when change occurs, new things happen. And when they happen, they break down the old you, and build a stronger, better you. It just remains to see how open and accepting you are towards change. So to put the bow, ability to adapt and to accept change is the way to self-awareness. ",

Any thing that is self-aware could not gain that awareness unless it could never attain it, by exactly the same reasoning.Understanding that understanding is arbitrary by virtue of the lack of a metric that is not invented by the individual in order to assess their own assessment. Scales that determine the relative value of themselves are quantitatively meaningless - just as \u2018one unit per unit squared\u2019 actually describes nothing apart from the concepts of magnitude and dimensionality.Seeing that in order to see oneself one requires a mirror and a radiation source such that an image that is correspondingly representative can be communicated via the interactions of that transferring radiation with the substances of both the object under observation and the reflective plane. In such a scenario there is no sense in which what is observed is ever exactly indicative of actual state, by virtue of the latency of transfer and the alteration of the radiation according to refraction in media. Mirrors present the past according to angles that are askew, such that a tiny proportion of rays enter a pupil that is sampling something that it in itself cannot possibly be.Thinking about thinking and in that thought appreciating that appreciation of the perception of perception is an infinite regression such that ignorance of ignorance is ironically the only conclusion that allows any conclusions.Deciding that discrete determinations such as numerical identities depend upon the division of continuities, such that \u2018four\u2019 only exists in the sense that \u2018one\u2019 can be added unto itself in a way that is separate from itself, again indicating that whatever is being used to represent the identity cannot be identical to it, unless there is in truth only one One in the world such that Two can never be. Self-awareness is the imagination of the self. Either this imagination is virtual and thereby dependent on things that are non-self, or the eye becomes its own illumination as an infinite echochamber, thus becoming an impossible contradiction that results in senselessness. Although that sounds Zen, again it cannot happen over time unless it is already the case. ",

Practice vigilance against being seduced by the old way of looking, in separation from the phenomenal objects and events in your environment. Practice acceptance without reacting [either by resisting- making judgments, or adhering- having preferences] to \u2018what is\u2019. Understand that \u2018what is\u2019 includes both the \u2018inner and the outer\u2019, i.e., feelings, emotions, sensations\u2026 thoughts, equally with what you used to call \u2018external events\u2019. \u2018What is\u2019, is not \u2018yours\u2019 but you, consciousness. They all happen in you, as a whole and none in particular is you . Practice detachment- be the \u2018space\u2019 within which \u2018what is\u2019 happens [as yourself]. Practice withdrawing attention into yourself- attention arises from the \u2018space\u2019 you are; don\u2019t let it arise. Shift the focus from the content of events to this \u2018space\u2019 in which the stream of events arise and vanish [without leaving a trace- traces are left only if you indulge in hanging onto the transitory events by giving them your attention]. Be that \u2018space\u2019 and see that you are present in all that happens and continue being present after happening ceases. Keep \u2018looking\u2019 and you\u2019ll find your own practice that works for you. However, be not mistaken and always remember that the one who practices is just a joke, it has nothing to do with reality. Despite this, take the practice seriously. It may look like a paradox but that\u2019s all I can offer\u2026 ",

The brain rewards negative emotions, such as dislike, envy, jealously, anger, impatience, racism, and hatred. Why? Because they often lead to these behaviors (which are also rewarded): Being mean, bullying, showing off, shouting in anger, and striking out at others. Because they all demonstrate/display dominant behavior. We live in a materialistic world, because showing dominance and accumulating wealth raises our status. Individuals with high status are able to attract high status mates, which improves the odds of survival, of their offspring. Just for attempting to raise our status, the brain rewards us. If it didn\u2019t, then we would never attempt anything. We give a bunch of idiots, the power to make us miserable, with their hurtful words and hurtful actions. The idiots don\u2019t even know why they\u2019re acting that way. Subconsciously, they are trying to raise their status, by lowering yours. All of the above, is part of our primitive, 1.0 human operating system. If you learn to control your emotions, and can refrain from making dominant displays, then you will upgrade to 2.0. By being able to think, rather than react, you will have many more options, in which to respond to the world. Your status will rise above 99% of the world\u2019s population, and your brain will reward you. You will become smarter, more productive, and happier. Google \u201cstickleback fish study\u201d. It also applies to humans. Women choose their mates, based on smell. Subconsciously, women can detect their scent, and prefer the man, with the greatest diversity, from her own. Everyone\u2019s scent represents our entire immunity to bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It\u2019s how we (and every vertebrate) evolved to combat the greater adaptability of micro organisms. Children get both parent\u2019s complete immunity. Greater diversity increases the odds of survival. Not in the study: When a woman smells a good subject, her subconscious will provoke her to make physical contact (usually very brief) with the male. If she is emotionally unavailable, then nothing happens. If she is available, then her brain rewards her. It may not sound like much, but it\u2019s kept humanity alive for millions of years. Also, the reward makes it a learned behavior. From then on, everything about the male - his voice, face, and hearing his name, will be rewarded.

If so, have you asked yourself about the inborn talent , potential , what is lacking etc and I have mentioned few questions as an eye opener: Who am I? Why I am here? Do I have a purpose to live ? What is my value ? Whats my worth? What can I deliver to the world as part of development ? Am I selfish or generous ? I am coming across this question frequently which is posed by many students. The real fact is, everyone waste time in seeing others and not oneself. This is a blunder everyone makes in life. Do you agree? Think about empty land. Do you know what grows over there ? You need to do research and apply practical ideas to get the best out of it. Similarly, our mind and heart are a wonderful parts of human body created by God, we should thank him always. It has tonnage of useful things. It\u2019s an unexplored oasis! Every one should explore its potential. It means, you should explore yourself. You should know, what you are interested ? No one can say, hay! Do this , do that ? If you follow blindly, then you are trapped. You are the most important to explore yourself ! You should know your worth. Once you create worth for yourself, then value comes automatically. For example, think about actors , VIPs , Influencer etc. How are they rated ? Do they born with silver spoon? So you should make yourself worth to create value as per the needs. Do your mind maps by writing , what are you interested in? You can write big list and start reviewing and screening. Then start do x one by one based on possible or not possible or important or essential etc. Then you could arrive some most important points to work on. For example , if you are keen in reading , start reading good books, articles etc , but decide which subject are you interested with? Then build your passion. Once you develop it , you may become subject matter expert (SME), then go ahead to explore further on it . Your experience brings a fortune , you could become author for your expertise , it pays you royalty for the books you have published , you will also be invited to attend meetings as a keynote speaker or speaker , then it brings money. It\u2019s one area , I have explained for your understanding . There are plenty. So go and explore yourself. Once you understand this hidden secret, then you will bring yourself in a right track and drive smoothly. Hence, Explore the unexplored in you ! ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question we have to first distinguish between Pure Consciousness and Conditioned Consciousness. Pure Consciousness is awareness per se. Consciousness on its own. The aware-ing factor. It has no limitations. It has no boundaries. It is eternal and infinite. It is not aware \u2018of\u2019 anything. It is just only awareness. The Upanishads declare it as God. It existed before the Big Bang and Multi-Universes and is the common factor in all Universes because it doesn\u2019t acknowledge anything other than itself. It is blind to conditioned consciousness. Just as a mirror reflects infinite objects but can't see any of them. When It contacts energy-matter in any form- thought, emotion, perception, intuition etc. it becomes Conditioned Consciousness. Pure Consciousness becomes \u2018conscious of\u2019\u2026..thoughts, emotions, intuition, perceptions, sensations etc. Its point of contact in humans is in the electrochemistry in the brain. Thats when Pure Consciousness becomes conditioned. Of course the conditioning factor and point varies from species to species. Even so called \u2018dead\u2019 matter has consciousness. It is well known that even sub atomic particles have a \u2018will\u2019 of their own. There is no real contact point between Pure Consciousness and energy-matter, because Pure Consciousness, by definition is Whole, One, Infinite, Eternal. Conditioned Consciousness just appears to be, like a mirage in a desert or a sound or sight heard or seen by the mentally ill. The world is therefore only an appearance and not real. Hindu and Buddhist philosophies call it \u2018Maya\u2019 (Illusion). The only reality in this or any universe or before the universes were formed is Pure Consciousness. God. You and I and everyone and everything is, in reality, only that Pure Consciousness. And your physical and mental personality and the world, is a result of Conditioned Consciousness, which is an illusion and a delusion. ",

            "answer_text": " Self Awareness means awareness of oneness of self or \u0100tman with the universal spirit called Brahman or self realisation. So first start by being a seer. Being aware means to become a \u201c\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u201dor seer just like we sit in a movie hall and watch a movie. So in being aware we are just a seer of our thoughts and have \u201c\u0938\u092e\u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u201d or equanimity in terms of emotions that is we are not influenced by positive and negative feelings or emotions. So to improve awareness, practice meditation. Sit quietly and just like a seer see your thoughts which your mind throws at you, don\u2019t involve yourself in thought process. Just like we sit in a movie hall to watch a movie. Better to concentrate on breathe as it enters through the nostrils and be with it till it leaves or goes out. Slowly thoughts will start decreasing and simultaneously breathe will become thinner. Eventually after some practice one will enter state of thoughtlessness and will no longer be able to feel breathe. This state is state of no mind. And in this process awareness increases day by day. The state of no mind is the state where we go into dhyana. Regular practice of dhyana will expand our consciousness. And as our consciousness expands so we first become aware of our subtle body (\u0938\u0942\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930) which is our permanent body. We do astral projection via our subtle body. It is with us through our cycle of births and deaths. Our physical body is impermanent. It is for present lifetime. By further expansion of consciousness we reach the state of samadhi.

According to verse 20 of the Brahma Jnana ValiMala(\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e) the work attributed to Adi Shankaracharya the progenitor of Advaita Vedanta philosophy \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091c\u0917\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0925\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091c\u0940\u0935\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0948\u0935 \u0928\u093e\u092a\u0930\u0903 \u0964 \u0905\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0938\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0921\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093f\u092e\u0903 \u0965 Brahman is real, the universe is mithya(it cannot be categorized as either real or unreal). The jiva is Brahmin itself and not different. This should be understood as the correct Shastra.This is proclaimed by Vedanta that Brahman alone is ultimately real, the phenomenal transient world is an illusory appearance (maya) of Brahman, and the true self \u0100tman is not different from Brahman. According to Brahma Jnana Vali Mala(\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e), \u201cThere are two things which are different from each other. They are the seer and the seen. The seer is Brahman and the seen is mAyA. This is what all Vedanta proclaims\u201d. M\u0101y\u0101 pre-exists and co-exists with Brahman \u2013 the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness.Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious.The term Maya has been translated as 'illusion,' but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned. Brihadaranyaka Upnishad, describes Maya as \"the tendency to imagine something where it does not exist, for example, atman with the body. Thus Meditation is one of the way to become more self aware or move forward towards self realisation or enlightenment. ",

Is the \u201cI\u201d different from the Self and wants to be more Aware? Is there two? If there is not two what is there to be more aware of? What is Awareness? Paul Bush's answer to What indications do we have that a fundamental theory of consciousness manifesting itself on any material matrix (including but not exclusively biological) is more mathematical in its essence than anything else, like physical or neurological? Paul here makes it clear Awareness is fundamental thus how could one have more? We are Awareness! Let's look at it from another point of view. You are walking around a fair grounds packed with people screaming and yelling. Vendors hawking their goods, the noise of the rides with screaming kids. Ever notice how wonderful it is to leave and then walk on a quiet beach. Recognizing the Awareness is simply being without the noise and confusion. Sitting quietly with your essential nature in the Awareness. Becoming more self aware is being more aware of your own Awareness your essential nature. Now sit in meditation enough to be yourself. The interesting feature is once recognized then it is also recognized Awareness is always present even in the noisy confusion of daily life and the noisy fairground. Meditation is sitting quietly wlith oneself, to find ones true nature - Awareness. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a possible confusion over the definition(s) of self awareness. Awareness itself is always a good thing, but to become overly conscious of all your little actions and behaviors can be debilitating. That sort of definition of self awareness is really \"other awareness\" in that we are self aware only in the sense of how we think we are perceived by others, or how acceptable our behavior is.  Self awareness in the sense of being aware of our feelings, motives, thoughts, fears, hopes, etc.... is in my opinion always a good thing. The real key is to allow that awareness to just be and not to constantly try  to consciously evaluate and examine it. When that happens we are not AWARE of the self, but rather neurotic or obsessive over the self. Awareness is good, conscious analysis on the other hands should be limited or you can find your self swimming up river in an attempt to understand the depths of who you are; an attempt that conscious thought is possibly not capable of understanding at an intellectual level, which can lead to neurosis.

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t just Humans. Animals that live outside water are shown to have greater consciousness or awareness of their environment and their place in it. This appears to be linked to increased vision of the world around us. We see higher up, we often see for much further distances. Our eyes have evolved to have better clarity at distance rather than immediate dangers. This also affects our relationship with time. If we can see further, we can plan ahead, and we can gauge better our sense of place in a location and how we can alter our situation. These are essentially elements of self awareness. Knowing more clearly our position, what are options are, and how we attain them in various ways, we increase our understanding of ourselves and our environment. Bigger brains also allow more space for thinking and planning, so mammals have a higher sense of self awareness than spiders. Apes - of which Humans are one - have an appreciation of their environment beyond mere survival. They have developed pleasures outside of just staying alive. Gorillas have been observed walking miles to watch waterfalls for hours, rather like we might go to the cinema for an entertainment experience, or listen to an album to gain pleasure or even meditation beyond what\u2019s immediately around us. Dogs and cats get bored, or overly excited at doing something simple like chasing a stick, etc. Having a greater understanding of our environment changes our relationship with time, and how we use our time aids self awareness. Bigger brains provide us with more opportunities to spend that time, whether it\u2019s a squirrel storing up food, or a Human enjoying sex rather than just doing it just to procreate. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question invites different sort of answers, because of the term \u201cself-awareness\u201d which can be interpreted in at least two ways: 1) being aware of oneself as a being (including one\u2019s body, thoughts, feelings, etc. as well as one\u2019s behaviour and actions) and 2) being aware of one\u2019s character, qualities, pros and cons, etc. The first involves mainly observation \u2014 there\u2019s no evaluation or whatever thinking involved. The second also includes thinking, reasoning, evaluation, judging, morals, etc. Then, it\u2019s the word \u201cfactors\u201d that kind of threw me back. In order to be objective in my evaluation, I looked up the word \u201cfactor\u201d. Dictionary.com defines it as \u201cone of the elements contributing to a particular result or situation\u201d. So, my reaction I was right Which I believe is quite irrelevant to self-awareness, in either of its meanings. So, the question actually has no meaning at all, has it? Yet, people ignore this and go on answering. It\u2019s very rare that people answering in Quora clarify things like these before they answer. They take one or the other meaning of the terms for granted and they answer. Well, this obviously creates problems: a) some of the answers are off-topic, b) the questioner doesn\u2019t get all answers related to what he or she really means and c) people who read the answers don\u2019t know which is on- and which is off-topic! What a mess! And this is the case here. The two older answers refer to the meaning #2 and the most recent one (about 1 h ago) to meaning #1. And I don\u2019t take the \u201cfactors\u201d into account! So I will answer as if the question were \u201cIn what does awareness of self consist of?\u201d (That is, using the 1st meaning of self-awareness that I described above, and which as it seems is also used the recent answer (by Carl Bozeman). Awareness of self consists of being conscious of oneself in the absence of any thinking and feeling activity. One can observe or sense one\u2019s thoughts and feelings but not getting involved in them, indulging in or following them. So any \u201cnoise\u201d that comes from them disappears once they are observed and let them go. Mind is silent. These are some of the main attributes not only of being aware of oneself, but also of the environment around oneself. ",

Just so we are clear self-awareness is basically bringing awareness to your subconscious programming, understanding who you truly are and embracing your spiritual side. You might think that you know yourself but the reality is you have no idea who you are!  We all live in an illusion that is created by our minds. We think we have control but we don\u2019t. Everything we do is based on past experiences, habits, beliefs and cognitive biases we are not even aware of. 95% of our actions are subconscious and unless we implement practices that will help us become more self-aware and understand why we do what we do, we will never be able to take control of our life. When I realised that I was just sort of letting life happen to me instead of taking full responsibility I decided to change that immediately. I wanted to understand what is causing me to behave, feel and think in a certain way. I wanted to use that to improve my life and be stress-free. So here is what I did: Technique number 1: The number one thing that helped me become more self-aware was journaling!! Forcing yourself to respond to questions and writing them down is really like you are having a free session with the psychologist! Really, I mean it! With self-inquiry, you give yourself a chance to really think about the things that you do, bring your habits to light and help you really define the root of your problems. It helps you become clear on what you actually want in your life and puts things into perspective! Don\u2019t believe me? Very successful people both from the past and now, from Albert Einstein to Oprah Winfrey to Tim Ferries to Marie Curie to Thomas Edison are suggesting that journaling is definitely a must! In my last episode, I gave tips on how to journal properly and I give away the list of journaling questions I have developed over time, which helped me so much understand myself at a deeper level. So definitely check it out if you want to know more about journaling.  Technique number 2: The second thing I did was to learn more about how my mind works. Regardless of who you are, you are a human who has a mind that has certain properties that apply to everyone!! Your mind is your most powerful tool, but it\u2019s worth noting that YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND! You have to make this distinction! Learn how your mind is programmed and what triggers your thoughts, emotions, and actions. Get veeery deep into this topic, it will immediately tell you so much about you that you had no idea about. I will actually create a mini-series on my youtube channel about it to help people as much as I can to understand how their mind works so be sure to watch it when it\u2019s out- premier 22nd of November. Technique number 3: Get in touch with your spiritual side! Start meditating every day! When you close your eyes you shut down the external world. You shut down the external stimuli, the illusion. Try to observe yourself. Can you actually quiet your thoughts? Focus on your breathing. Can you do it? Become the watcher! Bring awareness to everything that pops up but don\u2019t react to it\u2026 just observe. You have no idea what meditation and observing yourself can teach you. This is really my top 3!! Please note that the route to extreme self-awareness is long and it won\u2019t happen from one do to the next. If you commit to that for 1 month you will be surprised by the amount of stuff you discovered about yourself. If you need any help with it just reach out to me :) ",

            "answer_text": "Not in the true sense of that term. Someone could become too caught up in knowing details about various aspects of their body, mind, life, etc. - but that is essentially the opposite of true self-knowledge. Genuine self-knowledge arise from becoming consciously familiar with the full range of consciousness. From the surface-most physical and mental activities, to deeper layers of memory and intuition, and all the way to original, unconditioned awareness - the awareness that\u2019s aware of everything else. Unconditioned awareness is also referred to as the ground (meaning foundation) of being, because there\u2019s nothing deeper than it. Everything in experience, thought, memory, etc. is contained within the field of awareness, in which everything is experienced. Unconditioned awareness is also known as the \u201cnatural state\u201d - because it\u2019s the natural human condition, prior to the obscuring that comes from over-focus on thoughts, feelings and outer circumstances. It\u2019s called the natural state, because it\u2019s always already here. Any experience would be impossible without it. But everyone in the modern world has been conditioned to be aware of all the objects in awareness, including the most subtle thoughts and feelings - but not on the awareness itself, that makes any experience even possible. And so, self-knowledge doesn\u2019t need to be gained. Everything that\u2019s in the way of it it just needs to be removed, by not longer fueling conceptual obstructions with attention and emotion. That\u2019s why processes and practices such as meditation, self-inquiry (noticing what is not actually you; uncovering what is prior to all thoughts, emotions, etc.), presence (simply being aware, in the present moment, of direct sensory input) are powerful tools: they all help to become consciously aware of original, unconditioned awareness - which is the self-realization that is beyond self-knowledge. In certain ancient writings, knowledge is referred to as bondage. That\u2019s because specific knowledge is an object in awareness, which creates the sense of being a subject - the \u201cI\u201d that has the specific knowledge - all of which takes place within the original, unconditioned awareness that is actual self-knowledge, when directly, consciously experienced. And the only thing needed to do that is to withdraw attention from everything - just let attention rest. What remains is unconditioned awareness, aka self-knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "It's as simple as this: think about how you're feeling more frequently.  Throughout the day, take a moment and ask yourself \"How do I feel?\"  If you keep track of your patterns, and especially if you write down your answers, you will soon have a map of your feelings.   Keeping a journal is a great way to become more self-aware as well.  When you have no choice but to reflect on yourself, you become more self-aware. Seeing a therapist, like keeping a journal, also forces you to reflect on yourself.  Soon this consistent reflection becomes a habit and changes the way you think, making you more conscious of your actions. Many people spend their lives distracting themselves from how they feel because their real feelings are uncomfortable for them in some way.  Coming to terms with the way you truly feel is a very important skill, and can make you healthier both psychologically and physically. ",

            "answer_text": "Source: The miracle of Mindfulness  by thich nhat hanh.Every day and every hour, one should practice mindfulness. That's easy to say, but to carry it out in practice is Not.in principle, of course every day should be your day, and every hour your hour. But the fact is that very few of us have reached such a point. We have the impression that our family, place of work, and society rob us of all our time. So I urge that everyone set aside one day each week. Saturday, perhaps.If it is Saturday, then Saturday must be entirely your day, a day during which you are completely the master. Then Saturday will be the lever that will lift you to the habit of practicing mindfulness. Every worker in a peace or service community, no matter how urgent its work, has the right to such a day, for without it we will lose ourselves quickly in a life full of worry and action, and our responses will become increasingly useless. Whatever the day chosen, it can be considered as the day of mindfulness.To set up a day of mindfulness, figure out a way to remind yourself at the moment of waking that this day is your day of mindfulness. You might hang something on the ceiling or on the wall, a paper with the word \"mindfulness\" or a pine branch - anything that will suggest to you as you open your eyes and see it that today is your day of mindfulness. Today is your day. Remembering that, perhaps you can feel a smile which affirms that you are in complete mindfulness, a smile that nourishes that perfect mindfulness.While still lying in bed, begin slowly to follow your breath - slow, long, and conscious breaths. Then slowly rise from bed (instead of turning out all at once as usual), nourishing mindfulness by every motion. Once up, brush your teeth, wash your face, and do all your morning activities in a calm and relaxing way, each movement done in mindfulness. Follow your breath, take hold of it, and don't let your thoughts scatter. Each movement should be done calmly. Measure your steps with quiet, long breaths. Maintain a half smile.At lunchtime, prepare a meal for yourself. Cook the meal and wash the dishes in mindfulness. In the morning, after you have cleaned and straightened up your house, and in the afternoon, after you have worked in the garden or watched clouds or gathered flowers, prepare a pot of tea to sit and drink in mindfulness. Allow yourself a good length of time to do this. Don't drink your tea like someone who gulps down a cup of coffee during a work break. Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the whole earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future. Live the actual moment. Only this actual moment is life. Don't be attached to the future. Don't worry about things you have to do. Don't think about getting up or taking off to do anything. Don't think about \"departing.\" In the evening, you might read scripture and copy passages, write letters to friends, or do anything else you enjoy outside of your normal duties during the week. But whatever you do, do it in mindfulness. Eat only a little for the evening meal. Later, around 10 or 11 o'clock, as you sit in meditation, you will be able to sit more easily on an empty stomach. Afterwards you might take a slow walk in the fresh night air, following your breath in mindfulness and measuring the length of your breaths by your steps. Finally, return to your room and sleep in mindfulness. ",

I hear the traffic behind me and the sea gulls, ocean, kids playing, people talking, in front of me, somewhere. horns beeping a block away. I also hear construction going on several blocks away, just barely, but I hear it. The sun slams my forehead, so I better have sun block, if I\u2019ll be a while.

She\u2019s not having a good time! Time for an apology and a gallon of water! Quick! You see; it was all about me, to this point. Pretty dumb! It happens, but now I have to be creative. I start asking gentle questions and giving compliments of appreciation to her. I\u2019ll be taking notes on anything that works. It\u2019s the small things that can add up big. I will do everything I can to make it up to her, because I neglected her. I never beg unless it\u2019s a con game. I beg really well! I win most times, because I know she wants to please me.

            "answer_text": "On the whole no. Knowing yourself cuts to the inner most meaning of life: To Learn. To be the wisest (about why) with cleverness (about how) its eternal servant. Then there\u2019 the truth All happiness results from living your life from the inside/out. All misery comes from doing so mostly from the outside/in. This means you need to figure out who you are or nothing can ever truly make sense. Introspection & self awareness are therefore nonnegotiable. There are neural pathways embedded in your unconscious composed of negative and positive emotions. The good news is they can be rewritten when necessary & the good ones given precedence. Consider it a sign to attend to the core principle underlying all Psychological heath - paying attention to your emotions as they come up & positively dealing with them. Doing so can resolve virtually all issues but it is very much like building a pyramid, building the strong base on which to build a life sometimes goes up slowly - but soon enough it goes up very quickly indeed. Then you will always know that you are never part of the problem of all the ugliness in life and are instead part of the solution. Finally use all your creativity & passion to look for the beauty in everything you encounter & all you meet. There is a something however to make this all work better & faster. Realizing that thinking about the future is often an excuse to worry & obsessing about the past only amplifies regret. Staying in the right now empowers all of the above unspeakably. It keeps your subconscious anxieties from interfering & being self sabotaging, allowing you to access your personal power as described above. That\u2019s the core truth all the talk of mindfulness is about, appreciating the beauty of where you are right now. Anything beyond that is frequently superfluous. To really get to the heart of the issue & accelerate your progress, regular and/or daily meditation will heal you on the deepest levels & assist you in accessing your strengths most directly & quickly. That\u2019s because all healing takes place during sleep (when the conscious gets out of the way) & meditation is like turbocharged sleep. Lying or sitting down relax all the muscles of your face down to your toes & repeat until you are in a flat even place. Stare into the void & notice any thoughts that come up & let them go, concentrating on staring into the void. Eventually your eyes will flutter open & then physically move sloowly coming out of it This works especially well if you make a fervent prayer to whatever higher power you are drawn to beforehand for healing. Also before you go to bed so your unconscious can open up to the healing you request in your question & deepen it during sleep. ",

Whenever we learn something new, we go through this cycle, so patience in the beginning really pays off.  The Dunning Kruger effect won a nobel prize because it highlighted how people can overestimate themselves as much as 40% in the beginning so the earlier in the process, the further away from mastery, the more they think people who mastered it are idiots. There is zero benefits except angst and frustration for the people who mastered anything to teach people in the beginning. It\u2019s only people who explore enough to \u201cI\u2019m never going to understand this\u201d stage that can even start to see the value and stop thinking the other person is the problem. Because most people push away information in the early stages, they might be defensive and attack someone for telling them what they need to hear, people who care are often accused of giving unsolicited advice or being nosey, generally people can\u2019t be bothered since they already know the large amount of investment required to master it, only they have a true gauge of the value. Growth lays beyond your comfort zone so tolerate the discomfort, the most confronting opposites can show you the most about yourself, yes women or yes men do not, if you need someone to be aggreeable all the time, congratulations, you have just killed off your potential.

            "answer_text": "In my experience the best way to develop self- awareness is by developing a clear definition of what a self-aware individual is, define it and find individuals who embody those characteristics and skills. For example, the dictionary defines Self-Awareness as having conscious knowledge of one's own character and feelings. Build off the definition, fill in the blanks so that you have a somewhat clear image of what it means to be self aware. Give your question more context so that you can narrow your range of focus to start your search. For example, if i were to define a self-aware individual the first trait that comes to mind is someone who is accountable. Accountable in a way that reflects their perspective and understanding of themselves and their environment. Shifting their perspective and challenging themselves to understand and accepts responsibility for all of their actions big or small and repercussions that will come from them or have come from them and, they do so free of judgement. They understand that experiences whether they are good or bad our an opportunity to learn and grow. Self aware person works on developing their communication skills in order to develop themselves and hold space for others. Someone who loves to learn and creates opportunities for themselves to learn. Then, define why those skills are important in a self aware individual. After you\u2019ve created a definition that you can work with write it down. You\u2019ll come back to it over time has you deepen your understanding of what it means to be a self aware individual. Add to it remove things start a new one, as you grow and change it will to. Now the fun part; make a research a practiced ritual and research how to develop these skills, how others have developed them and where they started. Then find 3 skills that appeal to you the most at this time and begin defining them. Then simplify. Boil everything down to its simplest form of active practice, and I mean so simple that you not doing it would be like, not closing your front door when you go to work and no ones home. So simple you can\u2019t fail. Here\u2019s what I did for a characteristic of an individual was self aware. A self aware person is someone who is always seeking out opportunities to learn something new, set a reminder in my phone to watch a Tedtalk every night. Then download the TedTalk app. Make the goal so easy you can\u2019t fail. Then I listened to it segments through out the evening while your cooking, eating, brushing your teeth, using the restroom whatever you are still completing the goal or right before bed. Committed to at least one a week, if everynight felt overwhelming or I didn\u2019t have time. Then at the very least I saw one, and learned one thing for the week. For a month continued this practice, keeping a record of every video I watched. At the beginning of the month I rewatch my favorites, except this time wrote about one thing I learned or was inspired to write about form each video. The only requirement was that it was at least sentence. Sometimes that\u2019s all it was a single sentence, sometimes it was long, or poetic simply, or a parargaph about what I enjoyed, learned, or shocked by, our board me. Or I asked questions about the things I didn\u2019t understand. Then the answer to the one question was my minimum one sentence requirement. Continued the practice for another month, adding new videos has I went. By the end of the ear it, learning new things was a meditative practice. At the end, of each quarter I go back over what you learned during those past 3 months and Reflect. Reflection, when done properly with the same depth of accountability I had highlighted in the beginning of this post, helps deepen our understanding of what we learned and practice viewing the information from different perspectives. Final piece, I would recommend adopt a meditation practice of some kind. Give yourself an opportunity to be where you can see yourself through your own eyes free from the filtered view\u2019s of the world around you. Has you deepen your practice of developing your self awareness, yes it is a practice, you\u2019ll be amazed at how amazed at what realize. Sometimes the stories we tell ourselves are written from the view point of others and we never realize or question it. You\u2019re asking the right question just need to add a bit more context, it\u2019s a bit vague. I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck in your search. P.S.

This makes premises objective. It is also the easy part. The more difficult part begins with the objective definition for become. The issue from that vantage point may require the objectification of being, which is not initially identified but is perhaps a hidden assumption. Frankly, I would not recommend it. I can recommend becoming aware of other selves, but I would not approach this from the vantage point of a question. I would not seek the \u201cways\u201d because I doubt that any \u201cway\u201d would be distinct from general knowledge. General knowledge can be identified as states of anger, resentment, fear, worry, compassion, affection, and general habits of virtue and vice. So, as I understand such subjects, there may be a difference between simply knowing something and knowing the \u201cways of knowing\u201d. The subject is rather puzzling. Howsoever the case may be, I will insist uponld discrimination between conceptions and perceptions. ",

This aspect is never delved into, because it is taken for granted, I am aware , this notion is cleaving or sticking to the body, the self in being.

The moment any form comes into its being , like the above mentioned mote formed, it becomes self aware, it reacts accordingly. The stimuli is a form that makes this mote, this I self aware. If one sees in sleep , the awareness in the body exists, but the mote the I is not self aware. This concentration of awareness in the mote form, is to be dissolved, absolved . Its as if it is nailed there, it is a self driven nail, hence it is not easy to find its depth,size etc, but it is there. It has to undergo a calcining process, This nail is formed of words, see,if some one calls one by a given name, the self, this mote becomes aware, it stirs ,same is the case with any or all objective phenomenon, the moment a form say dog comes into the field of awareness, the word dog, stirs up in this self, I , the name , replaces dog, each objective self awareness is nothing but stirring up of words in awareness. This calcining process, is a process of silence, its toughest of all , but this calcining is possible, the words in being, the words that stir as self in being along with form, form that posits I, form that posits dog etc , this words when get melted, when they get dissolved into nothing, there exist only awareness, this awareness for the first time is not in concentrated form, it is absolute in being, its absolution of form from head to toe is one instant, its one instance that is being.This awareness is one whole silent awareness which has a form in its presence, this form of body in being is self awareness .

I had to become more interested in what was outside of me\u2026and my place in it. I had to see I was one among many and we all were connected and came from the same place. I then began to realize that the disgust and dislike I had about anything or anyone was coming from inside me, and my perceptions toward the outside. This explanation is a very short version to what could be symposium topic. I began to understand that I couldn\u2019t change anyone or anything, but I could change how I perceived people and things. The more I saw a more complete picture, the more I could see myself as a component part of that big picture. It was then back to the drawing board\u2026the getting to know myself, to excavate myself to as much authenticity as I could muster. This meant brutal self-honesty, no slipping anything under the rug. Facing it, understanding it and myself more in the process. I started my blog, liferays.net in 2015, at age 78. The good part of all of this is that one gains self-worth and self-esteem and faith and trusting self. I also began to see my absolute connection to Source Energy, the Universe, God, Creator, whatever you call it. My three books are renditions of my experiences which began in 2015. My life is this continuum now and I am happy, I enjoy the privilege of living my life and I see no endgame in sight. It is wonderful to know that my thoughts create my world and I can change them instantly to better ones.

These four powers are Self awareness - Humans experience emotions like any other animal but humans have awareness about those emotions and their impact on their actions. Animals experience emotions and forget. Imagination - We can imagine our future. We can imagine things which are not there. Animals cannot imagine. They cannot think beyond the present. Conscience - Humans have ability to differentiate between right and wrong. Other species cannot differentiate. Independent will - Humans have independent will. They can choose their response even in worst situations. No one can change the situations but humans have ability to choose response irrespective of situations. So humans have evolved because of these four powers, self awareness is one of them. Without any one of this power, humans wouldn\u2019t have evolved. ",

            "answer_text": "This question can be taken many ways, but one of the most fundamental interpretations was answered quite beneficially by a teacher in my high school. He noticed that I had trouble focusing on the topic of discussion at times in his classroom in high school, and that I would become easily distracted, looking out the window and thinking of other things. One day after class, he suggested that it might be helpful for me to take an intentional break at moments during class, shutting my eyes and taking a couple of deep breaths, and then scanning my body from my head down to my toes, noticing any tension and relaxing each area as I moved down. If needed, I could do this a couple of times and I could do it as often as I needed to to become more relaxed and focused. He said I would have his blessings to do this, so that I shouldn\u2019t worry about what he or anyone else in the class thought about it; I should just feel free to do it. I practiced this regularly from that point on, and much later in life I realized how beneficial this had been for me. I recognized that most people are barely aware of their bodies at all due to their focus on their thoughts, and those that are aware of the body may often experience the reality of the saying, \u201cthe left hand doesn\u2019t know what the right hand is doing.\u201d In contrast, I became increasing able to be aware of the entirety of my body as a whole unit while still talking out loud and thinking, which makes for a very unusual degree of \u201cpresence\u201d in your awareness, which people are affected by. At the same time, someone who becomes this clearly aware of themselves will also become more clearly aware that others are NOT aware of their own bodies, and if they have trouble feeling themselves, they will also have trouble feeling you\u2026 if you feel me\u2026 ; ) ",

            "answer_text": "To me, life is a labyrinth and self-awareness is a high perch above that labyrinth that we can climb up to and look down on what is below. To have fulfilling, meaningful experiences, it is essential to climb up there and see what is happening. After all, if we did not, we would not only get lost, but become blind about just how lost we'd become. However, if we stay up there too long, we can lose touch with what is going on below. We can forget about pain, suffering, and confusion. And, like this, when faced with a suffering person, we might be prone to seeing that big picture that we've become used to seeing on that high perch, and start to give advice or encourage a larger perspective, when that person just needs some loving compassion. We might stop listening to others, feeling with them, and start trying to fix them instead. Without getting back into that labyrinth, we might forget the importance of empathy, because we won't feel that we need it ourselves.  So, yes, I think there is such a thing as too much self-awareness. I believe that the big picture must be balanced with the small picture within each person, because it is already balanced within the realm of reality. More so, I believe that each discipline of human thought must balance awareness with empathy in order to best serve human beings. We must know how to think about something as well as we know how to feel with someone. That, I believe, will make a better world for all of us. ",

Then look at your thoughts, are these the thoughts you want to be having? Notice the thoughts you haven\u2019t even notice before, why are these here? Look at memories you have and see the emotions that come up from them, why do I still feel these emotions even though they are in the past? Recognize that the emotions from the past are effecting your emotional state. Dreams tell you what you need to know, knowing what you the soul wants is a big step to becoming more self aware. Distinguishing what the soul and ego are is also helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I will let you know based on my real life experience as I struggled with it for years.  First \"BE\" beingness means just exist imagine you in a universe that exist and does it's thing. Who am I ? And there is nothing wrong with you.  Start with I do not know the things I do not know I do not know :). Next do not over analyze life. Life is empty and meaningless ,in a sense all meaning comes from language, context and interpretation.         Resolve childhood issues and other unresolved fear  issues also keep your ego in check. As much as you need your ego to do practical things it's not always your friend it likes labels and being superior it's just a meaning.      Be non judgemental of what happens do not mind it suspends your conditioning and judgments.      Spend quiet time meditating and in nature.  Observe small things like the smile on your niece and Colors of flowers and scents of trees or the soil after rain. Just take in do not give it a name. Be aware of your fears. Have compassion for the world and people it is what is it is.    Move away from labels and meanings describe things as is.      If you have an anxiety disorder or think too much just start by learning to listen to understand not just content but the persons world and real meaning behind  why they saying what they saying it's subtle. Observe more than what's apparent. A person  may say I am ok but maybe he has a tear in his eye. Be in the moment not ahead not behind but here in the now. The power of now. Time is a practical tool but still just a concept. Learn from kids like 2 year olds they just observe no more no less. Be curious and do not believe meanings someone gives but do your own observations. Be aware of your own body language, tone, and posture yoga or tai chi is a good starting point so is vipasana or zazen practises. You cannot be aware of the outside if you not aware of yourself.  As the other poster who has a beautiful answer suggested maintain a journal. Observe what's triggering you within when you get angry or upset it's not what someone said but that vulnerable spot within you or fear of something. Breathe and take a moment within to feel before reacting. That brings me to next point as a man growing up in India and now living in California I learnt feeling was bad. Learn to feel your emotions in your body they are part of you and just feelings not true always but still they are real feelings.  Ask why you want to say or do something does it make things better help anyone or you doing it to get approval or just feel good. Understand people's motivations, conditioning, meanings, beliefs etc may not be same as yours and it's ok. Lastly realize it is a life long process and you were naturally born to be aware :).  This has worked for me. ",

            "answer_text": "The question with self knowledge and spiritual wisdom is: what can you do with it? I know of a number of people who have attained a very high level of understanding but who have been left isolated as a consequence. Most people in the developed world have no place in their lives for deep insight or for people who offer alternative vision. One is simply expected to follow a conventional, capitalist, conforming path: learn, earn, purchase, reproduce, borrow, repay, spend, decease. The idea of spending months in an ashram, consuming ayhuasca, or in some form of meditation that enables access to an unusual level of self knowledge is very attractive but essentially is valueless in terms of others: they don't care, they don't want to know. In this sense, it might be more practical to learn to live with a high level of denial. By understanding that your feelings and opinions do not matter and are not valued by others, you're likely to find life easier. The herd protects the followers, not the strays. Society rewards those who conform and seldom those who follow the callings of the Self. So, knowing yourself too much could easily cause you problems. ",

            "answer_text": "It may take some time to develop self-awareness but below are some simple ideas for practices that I have worked more in-depth with my coaching clients.   -Meditation, if you\u2019ve tried it before, try it again, just for 10 minutes, sit alone in a room, focus on your breath, if you mind wanders it\u2019s ok, just keep coming back to the breath. If something comes up in your head, ask your brain, do I really need to worry about it right now? (there\u2019s more to it, but that\u2019s just a quick trial haha) - Write down goals, plans, and priorities that first come to mind. Writing down what you want and tracking your progress each week is a huge way to improve self-awareness and self-power. Keep a daily journal is an add on step as well. -Step back and look at yourself from an outside point of view. How are you seen from the outside? Further step is getting feedback from friends and co-workers. -Create a habit of acknowledging your mistakes and taking full responsibility for them. The more responsibility you take for your actions and your life overall, makes others seem less in control of your life because it\u2019s yours, as well raises your accountability levels \u2013 improving self-awareness Those are a few to get you started, hope that helps a bit   Keep the love going, -Chris ",

            "answer_text": "Awareness can be acquired in several ways- one may achieve it through knowledge, experience, or intuition. However, in this context ,awareness is mainly related to self-realization or an inner transformation. It maps the journey, which starts with discovering that we are limited in our mental capacityand trapped in ignorance. The ignorance of our own selves believing that we are the doers makes us live in the illusion of dualities and dichotomies, suffering from fear, sorrow, and contempt. We ordinarily remain detached from universal awareness of oneness and live in a world of our own: me, mine, and myself. Even God has been invented by our limited minds for our own convenience. Reaching for awareness relates to the supreme knowledge that as you object; body and mind and God as the subject, both having absolute energy as the constituent, are the same, and you should become aware and live within the collective consciousness of this oneness to be in bliss.

The microcosm of our inner reality has different rules and laws that apply to it like quantum mechanics and physics. Those psychic rules and principles are taught different for different faiths.

            "answer_text": "In short, no. What does it actually mean to be completely self-aware? It's an ultimate extent or absolute, and reality doesn't function on absolutes. What would you be aware of when you are completely self-aware? Aware of all that constitutes your character and personality? Aware of the mechanism by which your brain functions? Aware of all that constitutes you? Aware of all that constitutes you and how you relate to reality? If we were to come even close to any of these, that would be rather profound already. I would say to be completely self-aware means there is no way to function at all; we function exactly because we are not aware of everything \u2014 interior or otherwise. Our experience of reality is an inherent reduction (this is called the Phaneron), and so is self-awareness. This couldn't be overcome by any organism. And what does it mean to be 100% aware? To be 100% aware would mean locally you pick up all of reality that could be perceived or experienced, and no longer an inherent reduction. This would take an insane amount of computing power, way beyond the capacity of our brain. To be 100% self-aware wouldn't be quite as demanding, yet I postulate it's still a physical impossibility. To be completely self-aware you likely need more computing power than the brain can offer; the sufficient amount of computing power to know itself would likely expand the required computing power to know itself beyond the initial requirement, and so you could never actually reach such a level of self-awareness unless you outsource some of that computing power. I suspect the only way in which one could even attempt to become completely self-aware in theory would be to expand the body by artificial means, extending the functionality of the brain and outsourcing computing power. The problem however is that if you extend the computing power, you extend the system itself and so there would be more to be self-aware about. Unless you don't count the extended system as part of what should become self-aware, this leads to an inherent infinite regress. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I think the best way to become self-aware is to realize how much power interpretation has on our conception of reality. Try to read multiple perspectives on news items, subjects of contention in the media and among your friends, and really try and set aside your personal feelings in order to understand what might cause a person to see each of these perspectives as true. When you realize that every person's perceptions are colored by their prior experiences and see how personal narratives can cause the same situation to be read differently by different people, you'll likely start to apply that same multiple-lens approach to your judgments about yourself, too. In my opinion, that's what being self-aware is\u2014seeing how other people see what you do, how you look, and how you speak and being able to shift your point of view to stand in front of each of those mirrors at different moments. People who are self-absorbed are incapable of seeing anything but their own interpretation of themselves, what they meant by the action instead of what the impact of that action was on others, how they think they look versus how someone else (and potentially everyone else) sees them. And that's how you end up thinking your mullet is cool. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Caspar. There is a way to train the brain and it\u2019s thoughts to stay out of your way as you become more self aware. I have been doing this for 35+ years. It is an active method of separating from ego (the thinking that thinks it is you). The tools are simple, but they only work if they are used. Few are able to do this without guidance from someone that has come out on the other side. A very simple non-thinking Live Now technique for getting out of your head is: Before beginning any activity ask yourself OUT LOUD: \"what do I need to do now?\" wait for your intuition to answer or to know what to do and do what the intuition says. Don't think! When you finish that activity ask again OUT LOUD \"what do I need to do now?\" and again wait for the intuition to say or feel what to do and do that. You will hear the voice between your ears think what do, but just do what the intuition says. The intuition is not the voice heard between the ears. It is often felt as a knowing in the upper chest area where you feel your breath. You can go through your whole day this way from moment to moment without thinking. It is important to use the exact words \u201cwhat do I need to do now\u201d to keep the thinking out of the process. If you are around people you can whisper or move your lips to the question so they don't think you're strange. This technique begins the process of separation from ego (the thought created self) and centers you in your true nature/ consciousness/ higher self/ inner knowing. The second tool is talking OUT LOUD to the thoughts. Saying the words OUT LOUD prevents the thinking from saying them. Give the thoughts and the \u201cthinker\u201d that thinks them a name. Calling them \u201cbrain\u201d is very effective. So, when the thoughts say \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this\u201d tell them OUT LOUD \u201c you\u2019re not doing it brain, I am\u201d. When the thoughts say \u201c this sounds silly and can\u2019t work\u201d tell them \u201cwhat do you know about it brain\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re just a 3 pound organ in my skull\u201d You\u2019ve never done anything in your life but think\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even have a body and you are only a small percentage by weight of my body\u201d. When the thoughts say anything you can respond by telling them \u201cyou\u2019re not me brain\u201d. If they say they have problems you can tell them OUT LOUD \u201cthose are your problems brain; not mine\u201d. Then ask OUT LOUD \u201cwhat do I need to do now?\u201d and do what the intuition knows to do. You will be doing what needs doing and not what the \u201cbrain\u201d want to do. The more you talk to the thoughts the better you will get at it. This trains the \u201cbrain\u201d that it is not you. The third tool is simply to observe everything from your awareness, especially the thoughts. Don\u2019t emotionalize anything. That is more thinking. Talk to the thoughts that are emotionalizing. Consciousness doesn\u2019t emotionalize. Daily activity becomes a opportunity to see. As you \u201cdo what you need to do\u201d your life becomes clearer and more in order. You become centered in your intuitive knowing consciousness and the \u201cbrain\u201dor ego falls away thought by thought. It takes what it takes to do this and it is worth doing. Feel free to experiment with this and let me know if you have any questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Can one be too self-aware? This stated question is like asking, \u2018Can one be too mature?\u2019, \u2018Can one have too much understanding?\u2019 or \u2018Can one be too healthy? Self-awareness is \u2018kind of\u2019 like peeling the layers off an onion, that whatever we discover on one layer, becomes irrelevant on another as we realise how little we actually understand about ourselves (well, this is true for anyone who is relatively self-aware anyway). The more we understand about our thinking, the more we understand how little we understand our thinking. The more we understand the relationship between our choices and our emotions, the more we realise how little we understand about the relationship between our choices and emotions. The 21st century is facing a \u2018mental health\u2019 epidemic, in part, due to the American Psychiatry Association and their passion for creating new \u2018mental illnesses\u2019, but mostly in response to the general public\u2019s lack of self-awareness and understanding of the mind-body-behaviour-maturity-emotional connection. Regardless how deep we self-reflect, there\u2019s always another new layer of insight to be found underneath, and the deeper we go, the more layers we peel back, the more likely we are to become balanced and mature individuals. Only scared human beings would be intimidated at the though of \u2018too much\u2019 self-awareness, and it\u2019s never wise to trust scared people - scared people are generally inconsistent and unreliable at best. Self-aware people however, can usually be trusted to listen, respond appropriately in complex situations, be honest about themselves, be aware of how the are for others, and have a higher chance of inspiring others to grow and improve. Being self-aware only exposes us to our flaws, imperfections and the opportunity we have to improve as human beings. This is unquestionably a good thing. The only people who won\u2019t benefit from \u2018more\u2019 self-awareness, as those who are perfect. Will all the perfect people PLEASE stand up and share your memoirs about how you\u2019ve done it! To summarise, those devoted to the process of personal growth and maturing know the importance of self-awareness. Those who aren\u2019t on this journey, wont. ",

Self awareness begins where you start introspecting yourself. First step in self awareness is to control and regulate your emotions. You should not react by seeing a particular situation but you should start observing it and then you should respond to that situation because responding is always better than reacting. In responding you control your emotions in adverse situation but when you react to at that time emotions regulate you. To develop self awareness you must do SWOT analysis because it will help you to find your strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. ",

A core principle of Stoicism is to become a \u201clover of wisdom\u201d. Wisdom essentially equates to self-awareness - since the only way we can learn about ourselves is to try something on and see how it feels. There\u2019s a substantial distinction between wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge is at its root, but there\u2019s another element to the formula to yield wisdom: personal experience. If you learn about some cool new concept and don\u2019t try it, you just moved a deadbeat tenant into a room in your brain. It\u2019s useless knowledge; it doesn\u2019t pay any rent to take up space in your head. On the other hand, if you consciously choose to try on a new concept, you can discover how and if it works for you. Maybe it doesn\u2019t work at all. Or maybe it is like a big AHA! lightbulb - like that new self-awareness I got from reading about Stoic philosophy.  Either way - whether your new concept works, or doesn\u2019t - it leads to greater self-awareness. Also known as wisdom. Back to your question: How do people actively learn to gain self-awareness? They search for and read about interesting concepts. Then they try them on. Namaste! ",

            "answer_text": "I think a person by birth is self aware. He makes more and more relations and start losing self awareness. As he starts growing up he starts thinking more and more. If someone thinks more, he never thinks about himself but he always thinks about others. Thats how more person he meets in his life more he loses his self awareness. I'm not in favour of breaking all relationships and making Himalaya your home. But I think one should always live present moment not past. I can explain this by an example. Suppose one day you are observing your thoughts from start of day till the night. Every person you meet in your day. You will realise that when someone leaves, you don't stop thinking about him even when he is no more there. That is the time that you are losing yourself. If you want to become self aware, don't think about someone who is not in front of you. It has several disadvantages like as you think, you waste your time, you make wrong decisions, you make wrong perceptions about them and most importantly you lose self awareness. So what I have learnt from my life is that, one should totally focus on present and never think about the things which are not in front of him. This will make him more self aware. He will realise that what matters most in his life. I hope it will help. ",

            "answer_text": "Keep track of your thoughts and opinions and observations over a long period of time and compare them. Most of the time when people lack self awareness it means that they are inconsistent. They say they think something one day, but then the next day they say they think something different. For example, someone might think that we should abolish Welfare, but then defend Medicare, based mostly on the fact that they personally use one and not the other.  Learn about common fallacies. Memorize their definitions and at least one example. Then keep them in the back of your mind and make sure you're not making obvious mistakes. A popular example is the fundamental attribution error. Our natural instinct is to excuse what we do because we are responding to something outside of us (I'm late) but blame other people for what they do because that's just who they are (that person is just an asshole).

            "answer_text": "Before getting down to what is the best advice it may be useful to consider how you know your self-awareness. To know it is increasing you must know the starting level and have a means to determine an increase from this starting level. It doesn't seem useful to put effort into increasing self-awareness if you are not certain of your current level of self-awareness. It doesn't seem that useful or helpful to put effort into considering the best advice without being certain how it's known an individual possesses self-awareness or not. When taking advice and putting effort into following it you need to know it is working; you need to know that you have self-awareness and that the self-awareness is being affected by things you are doing. An internet search may be useful At this point, an Internet search can be useful as the search engines use machine learning and algorithms to give the most relevant and popular results. If there is a standard or universally agreed means to determine the possession of or level of self-awareness it will be obvious in the first few pages of results. Try searching around self-awareness, what it is and how it's known an individual has it. From the search results is it obvious there is a universally agreed means of determining if someone actually has self-awareness. t more than likely you come across links to a variety of assessments, tests, quizzes and the like. It will be obvious there are many different views around self-awareness and many different tests, quizzes and the like for self-awareness. However, there will no universal agreement of any test or quiz being the standard for determination of self-awareness. No universally agreed standards means no common standards between tests. With no common standards, we cannot compare results between different tests, assessments and the like as they will use different questions and calculations. This creates difficulties for individual and groups to be sure they have self-awareness. For example, if a group of people each take different tests or quizzes indicating that each person has self-awareness and you are asked to determine which of them actually has self-awareness, how do you do it (knowing there are no standards between the test and quizzes)? How is each individual assured they have or are increasing self-awareness when there are no standards between test and each individual knows someone who is an advocate of another test may disagree with the result of the test they used? Ask the experts There are many people who encourage others to improve their self-awareness and the like. We would expect those encouraging others to make efforts towards increasing self-awareness to be able to articulate how they know their level of self-awareness, how they knew it was increasing And how they know they possess self-awareness in the first place. Otherwise, they are prompting others to do things towards something they themselves don\u2019t know they have achieved. It can be interesting to ask advocates of self-awareness, increasing it and so on how, simply and in practice, they clearly know they have self-awareness and that it is increasing or decreasing? On Quora 39 answers to the question \"What Is Self-Awareness?\" are similarly diverse. Help and advice may only be relevant to particular views self-awareness. Are those views clear in advice? If not, it will be difficult to assess how useful the advice will be to you, in your situation with your view self-awareness. If you are completely clear and sure how you will know you actually have self-awareness, that's great. However, if you find it difficult to pin down self-awareness it may be useful to consider why there is so much promotion of the need for self-awareness without the ability to clearly know the basics, to simply know if an individual has self-awareness or not.

            "answer_text": "Your question is the best start. In order to formulate a question like that, you already observed your degree of self-awareness and found it is not enough for you. Now you want more. This is how it begins. Our consciousness is really just a little \u201csliver\u201d of bio-electrical energy issuing from the Raphe\u2019 nucleus in the brain stem, in humans that is located directly behind the eyes and in between the ears. Try to sense that location. When the attention pays attention to itself for one moment, it is freed from being drawn into what some folks call the \u201cpsychological self\u201d which is basically a running narrative in the cerebral cortex, a story being told about what one is experiencing moment by moment. For the attention to pay attention to itself, it is necessary in the beginning to not be doing anything, either just sitting quietly, or while waiting for something to happen, a time when we usually just daydream, fantasize, rehearse something, speculate, worry, so it\u2019s an ideal time to practice self awareness of ourselves as energy, not objects in space with stuff to do. Check it out, be cautious about any self improvement agenda; self awareness schemes can be elaborate self improvement agendas and that is not the same at all as energetic self awareness which is based on neutral observations, not judgmental ones. Let me know, please, if you tried this method and what it did for you, thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, meditation is crucial in becoming more self-aware. Certain types of meditation are better at this than others. Specifically, Mindfulness meditation and the Buddhist paths are the best at this because they focus on developing the ability to watch the mind think. When you practice this regularly, you begin to realize that there is a \u201cyou\u201d and there is a \u201cmind\u201d. You can literally watch yourself, your feelings and your behavior.Once that starts to happen, it is very important to develop the neutral mind. We can become overly positive and not see ways in which we can improve, or we can get stuck in the negative mind, and get depressed and hopeless with what we see.These skills from meditation then transfer to life, and as events unfold, you have the skills to realize when you are reacting, when you are over-reacting and have the mental and emotional space to evaluate alternative responses from a neutral place. When I leaned to do this, it was a life-changer for me. I used to do a very stressful job, really high pressure with lots of stressed out people. I can still remember the first time that I realized that I didn\u2019t have to yell back at somebody that was yelling at me for no good reason. It felt great to just relax, and let the other person calm down on their own. As I did that, I had a great idea that solved his problems and my company\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "To me to be self-aware means to be aware as soon as my mind becomes active. My mind becomes active whenever it is engaged in perception, evaluation, assessment, conclusion, about events, people, situations, problems, difficulties, conditions, challenges, interactions, and results of interactions with others. I have evolved this process where by my awareness has gone up from once in a while to almost always. It is a short process which lasts at most half a minute. First I ask myself this question. What is this mind thinking? I keep exploring for 10 to 15 seconds without concluding or giving an answer. I then ask this question. Is there a need to think? I keep exploring for 10 to 15 seconds without including or giving an answer. I then firmly say \u2018no\u2019 there is no need to think.  In the beginning I used to run this process roughly 5 to 10 times a day. Then gradually it started coming to me by habit. Then the question came now that I know how my mind functions what do I do? I have evolved this method of talking to my mind to give it permission to give up thinking, feeling, being emotionally hyped or other similar. What I do is I tell my mind this. Hey my mind, I notice that you are presently engaged with this thinking / feeling / and emotionally hyped state of . . . . . (anger fear anxiety dislike and other similar as examples). I give you permission to let go of it. Come on, give it up and return to the state of restful peace. I will do the needful in the matter. And rest of the mind gives up its engagement with the thinking, feeling or hyped emotion.  Another meaning of self awareness is: Being aware of the self, which is the universal self, the omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient being. This I believe is what we mean by God. Show the other meaning of self awareness is being aware of God on an ongoing basis. It has been an exploratory practice I have been at it for more than 50 years. Today I enjoy it experientially as being: The Universal presence. The substrate that manifests variously. The being of existence small or big. The is-ness of being. The principle behind change. The non ending expanse that holds and permeates. The beginning and end in a cycle no matter where we assume it starts. All knowing and knowledge itself. The blissful joy that is mind-less The giver receiver causer. The consciousness that lends experience. Many thanks for reading through. ",

Once we make a commitment to ourselves to become self-aware, we can do some of the following or all: Listen to the words and thoughts in your head.Notice your reactions to others.Notice how many negative thoughts you are thinking in a day. Carry a book around and write them down just for one weekend.Breathe slowly and deeply and be present in each moment.Notice what you are feeling.How does your body feel? How does your heart feel?Are you getting upset easily by other actions or words?Instead of getting upset by what others say and do recognize the judgment of self and others present in your mind.Begin to find something every day to be grateful for as soon as your eyes are opened. Gratitude will help you focus and open your heart.Rather than condemn yourself for your actions and words just begin to notice them.Sit in silence every day. Find an upright chair and do it at the same time daily. Your body will begin to get used to this and welcome it. While sitting, close your eyes and breathe slowly and deeply.If you prefer to lie down in silence you can do this exercise: Put the palm of your hand on the center of your chest to bring more focus to your heart-mind. Breathe slowly and inhale to the count of 5 and exhale to the count of 5. This will bring your heart and mind into coherence. Then float the feelings of the words Care, Compassion, Appreciation, Gratitude for about three minutes each through your heart. This exercise is very beneficial for slowing down the mind and getting you into your heart. It also creates a natural state of healing in your body for six hours after you do it.",

There is orientation of attention - when it is turned outwardly, there\u2019s world-awareness; and, when it is not turned outwardly, it is in its natural state, which is what self-awareness is! Self-awareness is not continuous; there are intervals of it. Continuity is not even required. There are periods of silence; there are gaps between stimuli (causes) and responses (effects). In those gaps & intervals, you become aware of what you have been (in relation to the world). There\u2019s nothing you can do about what you are when you become aware of yourself (or, your self). But, because by your persistent ignorance of self-awareness, you have completely lost to yourself. To regain, just attend to the moments of silence, gaps, intervals; pay intense attention just as you do to your worldly affairs like movies, holidays, etc. As the intensity of this attention grows, world will not fall from you but you will regain your true self, which is now lost to you.

What I do to become more self aware is focusing on every action I take and basically making an effort to become aware of everything that is happening. At first it might be uncomftorable(and I havent mastered full awareness), but from a book I read called \u201cThe power of now\" it is something very achievable and once it is achieved it is your responsibility to maintain a high awareness if that is what you would like. Although, just because it may be straightforward and simple, doesn't mean it can't be challenging, but there is my answer for you. ",

So its\u2019 simple, but not necessarily easy to be much more self-aware. Ask yourself questions. Where did this belief come from? Sometimes, I can remember the very moment a belief took hold. I was a very inquisitive kid and fund a large \u201cpiggy bank\u201d tucked on a shelf in my parents bedroom. It had no access. (The bank, not the bedroom.) The idea was to fill it, and THEN break it open like the visual clich\u00e9. So I learned to save money, and don\u2019t touch it. Although I tried by pitting a knife in the slot and holding the pig bank upside down and shaking it in the hopes a coin, a quarter would slide out. A quarter was enough to go to the Rose Theater and see two movies and two cartoons. I don\u2019t think those basics ever leave you, but you can augment them, polish them, tweek them.

Your question is a great one Brian, b/c all of our success or lack thereof, is directly related to the level of self-awareness we have! As someone who values efficiency, objectivity and reliability, I increased and developed my self-awareness aka thoughtful sophistication using a behavioural science assessment tool. These personality profiles, when shown how to understand, process, action, shave years of trial/error/hit/miss. Am so impressed by this took and the insights it affords that have been using it with my clients for almost 2 decades, to help them increase their self-awareness. This isn\u2019t to be a plug for it or me, you asked me this question and therefore, I am answering it the way I steepened my thoughtful sophistication. There are surely longer, more laborious ways to do it, but this took me 20 min to complete and then I studied it, asked questions etc etc. until it became my compass. Now i only set myself up to win. Yuck still happens, but i know how to roll with it and not let it slow me down now. Imagine, just by taking 20 minutes to complete my profile. Who knew! Of course, more time was spent on it later to ensure understanding, but it was my game changer. If you\u2019re curious about it Brian, fire me off an email.

            "answer_text": "Chanting Hare Krishna under the guidance of an authentic Gaudiya Vasinava is the only effective way of achieving self awareness that I have ever come across. Understanding that you are spiritual is only the first step in self awareness. The next step is to understand the Supreme Spirit, and the final step is to realize your relationship with Him. Chanting Hare Krishna achieves all these simultaneously because it engages the self in its natural position. Because it is natural all that needs to be done is to remove all that is unnatural. Whatever is unnatural is due to the influence of the three modes of nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. The Hare Krishna mantra is a purely spiritual sound vibration which cleanses the heart of all contamination and allows the natural qualities of the soul, knowledge, bliss and eternity, to manifest in a loving relationship with the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. Chanting the Hare Krsna mantra cleanses one of all material contamination. By constantly chanting the holy name of the Lord, one transcends the distresses of the world of duality and thus becomes happy. Chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra frees one from the miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease. The Hare Krsna mantra is especially suited to deliver us from material existence in the Kali-yuga. The transcendental sound of Hare Krsna can end material entanglement Chanting of the holy name is sufficient in itself for achieving liberation. Even a faint light from the holy name brings liberation. To establish ourselves on the spiritual platform, beyond the modes of nature, we must chant the maha-mantra. Even if one chants the holy name imperfectly, he still easily attains liberation. The holy name frees one from false bodily identification. The Holy Name dispels the illusion of maya. The holy name enlightens one with perfect, transcendental knowledge. Revival of love of God does not depend on mechanical hearing and chanting, but on the Lord's causeless mercy. Anyone who addresses the Lord by chanting His holy name attracts His attention and obligates Him. If Krsna sees that one is chanting Hare Krsna sincerely, He helps internally and externally. To always remember Krsna and never forget Him is possible by constantly chanting the holy name. harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha \"\u2018In this Age of Kali there is no other means, no other means, no other means for self-realization than chanting the holy name, chanting the holy name, chanting the holy name of Lord Hari.'

After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for the age of Kali than the chanting of Hare Krsna.\" --- Kali-santarana Upanishad ",

My ego was shattered and I started off humble after that. I realized I had 3 children who still needed me and loved me. So I became gracious and grateful for the blessings I still had. I learned that beauty is only skin deep and your real beauty comes from within your soul. I started to pay attention to other people's inner beauty and how it made them shine. Commiting beautiful acts of kindness to others less fortunate and how that touched me. Giving every person my time if they asked no matter what their appearance was. Judging people by their actions and treatment of others less fortunate then them. I took a long hard look at my life and the problems I faced and my responsibility in all of it. I took responsibility for my bad actions without offering excuses. I gave heartfelt apologies to the love ones I didn't always treat well and I took responsibility for my behavior. I apologized and I changed how I treated them each and everyday. I made a real commitment to seek help for my faults and not stop until they were fixed. I'm still under the care of a mental health Dr. four years later. So I keep working at it. Self-awareness was just completely clear one day after all this work I put it to making life changes. When it becomes clear you know and at first it can drop you to your knees with regret. That does pass and you become a more enriched person lifelong for having this skill. ",

            "answer_text": "1.Understand he drive of conflict. The source of all conflict is the concept that we operate in a world of lack and need to fight to pool limited resources (clients, money) to pay for our survival. To survive in this space and remain competitive we must protect our identities as the \u201cThe smartest\u201d, \u201cMost competent\u201d or \u201cI am a warrior\u201d 2. Meta-cognition The practice of being a neutral observer of yourself. This means that while going throughout your day you notice what thoughts and emotions arise within you in different interactions, and resist making a judgment about them, but instead just making mental notes. 3. Identify Self Limiting beliefs / Insecurities Another device of the ego is the internal dialogue it uses to perpetuate our fears, false beliefs and feelings of inadequacy. It is that little voice that whispers \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough\u201d, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve that kind of success.\u201d or \u201cThey will think I am imperfect.\u201d This voice of false self-limiting ideations that can only be undone by identifying the neuro-program\u2019s origin, challenging its credibility then redefining it to serve one\u2019s desires and full potential 4. Introspection The practice of thinking about what you have observed and finding correlations in thinking patterns. Again, not using judgment, guilt or shame, but getting to the root of what and why behind the thinking patterns you have developed. 5. Practice gratitude. It\u2019s easy to focus on the negative, we all know that. But, by setting aside some time each day to count your blessings and to be grateful for what you have in your life, it will make it easier to let go of the negative and begin to live a life of fulfillment. 6. Paradigm Shift The practice of realizing what patterns of thinking no longer hold value for you. Things that are based on what you believed were valid that were possibly expected of you from someone else, rather than aligning with your innate value system. 7. Safe Place Practice (Forgiveness of Self and others) Another powerful technique for self awareness is forgiveness. What are we judging about ourselves? What act or past deed are we still hanging ourselves for and refusing to forgive? These are some of the questions we need to ask. The old saying \u201churt people, hurt people\u201d, exemplifies that people in their own perceived survival will do whatever they need to do to survive. Similar to the idea of a drowning man getting rescued will, in his fear, inadvertently drown his rescuers. 8. Recalibration The practice of self-inquiry or asking yourself what you truly desire in life for yourself and others. Making a commitment to following your values and not being swayed by other\u2019s expectations or value systems. 9. Re-alignment The practice of creating thinking patterns that are in harmony with what you value, so that what you think, say, and do are all in agreement. 10. Seek to understand, not to be right. Leading on from the above, you owe it to yourself to put your ego aside and to understand what you can learn in each trying situation. As soon as you feel a negative emotion arise or you want to argue your point, decide to remove yourself from the situation and become an observer of yourself or choose to sit in the feeling for a moment and then let it go. 11. Personal Empowerment The practice of becoming stronger because you now act from a place that resonates with what you believe in and have removed the mental clutter and confusion of what \u201cshould\u201d be done to what you want to do. 12. Explore differences As human beings, we tend to gloss over the differences of those we see as \u2018more like us\u2019, or those we want to aspire to be like, and accentuate the differences of those we view as \u2018less like us\u2019 or want to be more distant from. Rather than seeing differences as the criteria for in-group vs out-group membership, take time to think about and explore those differences \u2013 they will help you understand yourself and others more deeply. 13. Remaining in Love The practice of staying in a grace relationship with yourself and others. When negative feelings of hate or bitterness arise, to be able to consciously notice them and chose to transcend the situations that cause these feelings and stay grounded in self-worth which promotes love. http://viralgossiptalk.info ",

            "answer_text": "How can being aware change your life? If you want to change your life, the first important step is to be aware of what is currently happening in your life. Ask yourself these questions- What are you feeling and why? Are you happy and content with your current circumstances? Do you think that someone else is controlling your life? What happened in your past that makes you think so? What do you really want? What is your goal? What triggers you to behave or act in a certain manner? What are the patterns that recur constantly in your life? Once you are aware of your emotions, thoughts, actions, goals, challenges and aspirations, you are in a position to identify the changes that can make your life better. Now, ask yourself - Do I have the power to change my life? Accept and acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses and grab every opportunity that comes your way. Maintain a log book to check your progress at the end of each day and see if you are on the right path. Being in a constant state of awareness is critical to your development and growth. It helps you identify the need for change. It helps you confront your fears and weaknesses and triggers you to overcome them. It helps you to take desirable actions that will lead you towards your dreams. For, unless you are aware of where you are, how would you know where you want to reach? I am a life coach and healer.

A simple exercise to illustrate your Observor persona: mentally count backwards by threes from 100, and keep track of your mistakes. How many mistakes did you make? How do you know? If no mistakes, how do you know?? The Observor knows!! ",

You simply take the time to notice the thoughts that are going through your mind and decide if \u2018the essential you\u2019 really agrees with the related point of view. You will quickly realize that you automatically reject many because they do not connect to who you want to become. Then, just mentally assign them a label of rubbish, or garbage, or even nonsense. Then move on. It helps a lot to start to learn to meditate (although some gentle sort of contemplative prayer is very useful to some - no religious connotation is required). It is also helpful to adopt the following viewpoint, without having to totally agree with it; just see if the following helps! The vast majority of thoughts that come into your mind are not even your thoughts, but those of others who are having deeply-troubled thoughts and emotions. We exist is a \u2018sea\u2019 of such thoughts and emotions that are not yours. Just saying \u201cNot my Thought!\u201d can be enough for you to quickly release it.

There is a well-written book by Susan Blackmore called \"Consciousness - An Introduction.\" Amazon.com: Consciousness: An Introduction (9780199739097): Susan Blackmore: Books. It has a series of practical exercises one can undertake to increase self-awareness; for example, asking yourself from time to time, \"Am I conscious now?\" Blackmore's approach is much more effective than what has come to be called \"mindfulness,\" because rather than passively observing your thoughts, you're actively engaged in stimulating them. So I would avoid the mindfulness literature and focus instead on the consciousness literature. ",

Use your journal every day to collect great ideas and information from the great minds behind many great books. Read. Write. Read. Write. And then.. learn to enjoy your own company. Not only that, learn to thrive in your own company. Two great quotes to support both of these suggestions: First on investing time in yourself and in your own company, and then on learning to ask and answer your own questions... \"Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man's ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.\"- Seneca \"You must constantly ask yourself these questions: Who am I around? What are they doing to me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most important, what do they have me becoming?

The world we see is grounded in the mind. Mind is grounded in nature. We mistakenly think that mind is grounded in the world (body or brain is a part of the world). World is a representation of nature constituted by mental concepts. First step of self awareness is to find this ground (kshetra). This is called Atma-jnan.

What you are expected to do with this awareness in this life is to take care of this \u201cYOU\u201d, physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually! If you have come to understand this much, then you have become SELF-AWARE! If you didn\u2019t make your-self, and you didn\u2019t, then you have a Creator. If you are conscious of this fact, and you are happy being a human, then you owe your Creator both your gratitude and servitude and to no one else. Affirming this fact and working on it will help you to actualise the true potential and purpose of your SELF and your life on this Earth. Denying this fact will make you forget your SELF and you will lose your self. ",

            "answer_text": "Having self-awareness means that you have a sharp realization of your personality, including your strengths and weaknesses, your thoughts and beliefs, your emotions, and your motivations. Many people assume that they have a healthy sense of self-awareness, but it is best to look at a relative scale to see where you fall on it compared to others. Being aware creates an opportunity to make changes in one's behavior and beliefs. While you develop self-awareness, your own personal thoughts and interpretations will begin to change. This change in mental state will also alter your emotions and increase your emotional intelligence, which is an important factor in achieving overall success. Becoming self-aware is an early step in the creation of the life that you want. It helps you pinpoint what your passions and emotions are, and how your personality can help you in life. You can recognize where your thoughts and emotions are leading you, and make any necessary changes. Once you are aware of your thoughts, words, emotions, and behavior, you will be able to make changes in the direction of your future. plz visit the web Fashion items | Home ",

That is being self-aware. To be aware of you means that you can identify you in interactions with others and you are, of course , the self and you know it. Within our awareness we can build different models ourselves which interact with others in models in our minds. We may exaggerate our importance and create a self image which others might not recognise. This is still being self-aware. But we are using our mind to investigate our relationships as we would prefer them. This self belief model can leak out into the real world and is usually detrimental (ego , delusion, dreamer etc) . This is a case were a self-image does not coincide with self knowledge. One can know oneself with little difficulty and so present themselves honestly. If that can\u2019t be done then seek help. ",

Even after one dose, you\u2019ll notice the world looking different to you. Everything is the same afterwards, but it\u2019s like a veil is lifted and you can see everything more clearly. If you get into this, tripping alone (or at least some point in the night) is very beneficial. That\u2019s where you have no external stimuli so you focus on the internal. You discover who you are, what you stand for, the kind of person you want to be. There are a lot of ways to become self aware but I think shrooms are one of the best. ",

In other words, when you are EXISTENTIALLY AWARE you become constantly SENSITIVE to YOURSELF & the WORLD simultaneously from moment to moment. 2)But there cannot be any PHYSICAL or MENTAL PRACTICE, nor there can be any Gross or subtle exercise like YOGA and all that which can help you in this EXISTENTIAL AWARENESS - ENCOUNTER with the world. Do not get trapped by the idea that self awareness means that you get to know or realize some FICTITIOUS ENTITY or IDENTITY called EGO, SELF, or SOUL, that is nothing but the LINGUISTIC - MYTHOLOGICAL NARRATIVE. 3)Hence, you can only examine, re-examine and keep on re-examining all that you have learnt so far SOCIALLY, CULTURALLY, SPIRITUALLY and so on and on without any rest. Do not get trapped by IDEOLOGICAL - ENLIGHTENMENT ADVERTISING PROPAGANDA and all the stuff of it. If you are Sensitive, serious, sincere and simple, well! that would be the beginning of your being EXISTENTIALLY AWARE. Ashok Nanotkar. India. ",

Example we can take a word let say jesus,if we can focus each and every word of jesus without letting any other word cooked in mind then we can be aware of consciousness emitted by self,thats the self awareness which meant awareness of consciousness emitted by self.

When you are feeling any kind of intense emotion, such as anger, try stopping for a moment and becoming aware of how you are feeling and why you are feeling that way. Once you are aware of what you are feeling, control the way you express it. If you are in the middle of class, you might have to express your anger later. Or if you are at home, you might be able to go to your room and express anger, and then talk about it with your parents. Essentially, you have to put some space in between the feeling of anger and how you display it. This way you can prevent yourself from doing something you regret later. Learn the lessons from tough situations or failures. Analyze what went wrong and what you should do differently next time to become successful. Be careful about the effects of interruptions, particularly from electronic devices. Rather than multitasking, prioritize and finish tasks one by one. Read motivating articles and books and explore why someone acted in a certain way. For instance, Manu Bhaker, a 16 year old became the youngest Indian to win world cup gold in shooting. ",

But your intellect, emotion and will only form the outer sphere of your mind. The inner-most, central sphere, is your heart, or some call it conscience or presence or consciousness. This heart is the impulse to give and receive love, the source and motive of love- which empowers life. If you focus on central presence, then you can observe your own outer Circle, the thoughts, feelings and actions that you take. There are several systematic methods to developing awareness, and they each have some benefits. Whatever method you choose, be patient. Years ago, I participated in a weekly Awareness Group. It took 8 months. These groups can be found in Universities, maybe a community college, and sometimes large churches, which can afford to support small-group ministries, while giving them wide nonsectarian independence. One final thing, decrease your consumption of cheap pop-culture, which is like junk food, and which takes you in the opposite direction of self-awareness. ",

I\u2019ve been acutely self-aware of these for many years and it seems to be pretty constant, except when I\u2019m blind drunk or otherwise overly intoxicated. It takes me more of an active decision and focus to also become aware of my mood state and any subtle reactions.

They can teach you a lot about yourself without judgement. Learn to rely on yourself to make impulsive decisions in unfamiliar places, and trust that you made the right decisions. Travel to unfamiliar places alone with multiple paths (options), and when you reach them, intuitively decide which paths to take. Just go with what feels right. You may be surprised what you find and what message you make of your experience. Enjoy yourself. ",

In that are the lessons that bring us to the understanding, it is almost like passing through the veil of mist to see yourself from the other side of time. When you find the one inside of you, you will see in that moment the truth of reality only to find the absence of remembering leaves you with a lost knowledge. In this you find the path to self awareness. It is not such that the self is, but that in the self you begin to see all things with clarity. This is a movement that involves no movement. You see everything without doing anything. You become but you are not. Self awareness is seeing the outside from within yourself. :) ",

Not listening so much to what another is saying as how they express it,eye movements,arm,hand and foot play. Listen for the silence of the desert sands. The silence between the wind blown tree leaves,etc;. Reminds me of an old Zen Temple Koan: Listen for the sound of one hand clapping. In other words,if you would become more self aware,avoid all navel gazing! While you watch yourself-you will not act like yourself.( you will act perhaps better than you really are). Again I say: No navel gazing! CHEERS! ",

            "answer_text": "First let me point out that I am not saying I know how you can learn self-awareness, but maybe if you follow with me in the examination of the question, we will see the answer together. Can one learn self-awareness? Is one not already self-aware, conscious? If one is not aware of oneself, then it would seem that one is either in some altered state, asleep or dead. So it seems that one is either aware, as one\u2019s self(whatever one is actually aware AS), or one is not. But perhaps I am misunderstanding your use of self awareness. The google definition of self-awareness is: conscious knowledge of one's own character, feelings, motives, and desires. Doesn\u2019t the answer seem to be observation? Can one observe one\u2019s own behaviour in relation to the world? Through relationship to the world and society, one\u2019s character is revealed. Through reactions to the world and society, one\u2019s feelings are revealed. Through actions taken in life one\u2019s motives are revealed. Through that which one pursues in life, desires are revealed. If one observes one\u2019s own life in relationship to the world, won\u2019t knowledge of that which one is aware AS(self) become apparent? ",

It implies to be observer of your physical body-body at rest, body in mostion, bodily activities, walking, standing, seating etc. This leads you-your awareness /consciousness -to state of thoughtlessness. When you don't practice aforementioned method called body awareness, you may practice to be remained aware /conscious to your ongoing thoughts/thinking.This too will lead you to state of thoughtlessness. It is advisable to practice by both approches, one after another, all the time. It, slowly, allows you to taste awareness in contrast to your ordinary state of either scattered attention or state of concentrated attention which is associated with ego, identification and mechanically running thoughts.
