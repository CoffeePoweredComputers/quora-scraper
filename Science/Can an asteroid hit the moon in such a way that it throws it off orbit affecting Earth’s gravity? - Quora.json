            "answer_text": "Funny to say, it's just like saying if I drop a big body on earth will it be digging down the earth or will it create an impact on the earth surface. So to say if an asteroid hits the moon. It will only first affects the moons orbit not the earth.According to Newtons inverse square law of gravity pull, acceleration due to gravity on earth is surface 9.81 m/s^2 and that it exerts with the moon is 2.72 \u00d710^-3 m/s^2, so its effect is almost weightlessness to affects the earths gravity.So earths gravity is more of its weight and space it occupies in relation to the sun and not the moon.",

            "answer_text": "Depending on how it hit the moon it might knock it into a higher or lower orbit if it was big enough. But I can\u2019t see how that could possibly affect the earth\u2019s gravity, unless it sent the moon crashing into the earth, which would increase earth\u2019s mass. ",
