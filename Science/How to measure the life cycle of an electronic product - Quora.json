            "answer_text": "I am not sure about getting the point of your question. In your question you ask about \u201cthe life cycle of electronic product\u201d. Because we are in the PLM domain we talk about the Product Life Cycle from the first concept to end of life. A possible measurement would to measure the time between the first appearance of a document related to an electronic product in your organization and the last activity regarding that product in your business process. You can measure the time, because this process is under your control and you can select events to have a starting and an ending point. Consequently you do not measure the complete life cycle.To answer the question how to measure, it is important to know the purpose of the measurement. If you want to improve e.g. the procedure execution in a certain life cycle phase say quotation phase, you look for the first event in the PLM system regarding that procedure e.g. storage of request from a customer, and the last event e.g. approval of quote. Again you have 2 points in time you can measure.In general: Define the purpose of the measurementSelect indicators under your control, which pursue the desired purposeMeasure time or count during a certain time frame, etc.I did a lot of measurements regarding process execution in a PLM system for continuous improvement activities of procedures. First we figured out, whether the as-is procedures are executed as described. If this was not the case, we aligned the documented procedure with executed procedure. Then we selected events: approval of documents, release of products, finalization of workflow, and similar to get indicators. At the end we measured the time between the events. Then we developed the to-be procedures, deployed them and measured again.If this does not answer your question, don\u2019t hesitate to specify your question and ask again. ",
