            "answer_text": "If polar ice caps melt, the mass of water around the equator would increase thus increasing the moment of inertia about earth's axis of rotation.Since angular momentum of Earth's rotation is always constant. An increase in moment of inertia would mean a decrease in its angular speed. Since T=2\u03c0/w, time period will increase and so the day will become longer. ",
