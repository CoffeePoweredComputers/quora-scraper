            "answer_text": "I can answer this as someone who has been in college for a LONG time and as someone going BACK to college. DISCLAIMER: talks of self-harming behaviors and similar symptoms. Also, sorry it\u2019s on the longer side. I got diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) during my first time in college as a sophomore. Prior to the hospitalization that led up to the diagnosis, I was struggling quite a bit. I was on the varsity swim team even though I hated it and was fighting severe bulimia and depression. I started cutting myself my freshman year and would hide everything from my roommates, denying anything was wrong when they tried to talk to me about it. I started seeing a therapist there in the school, but my issues were severe and their staff overbooked and underexperienced. I also participated in my first group therapy which was ok but not frequent enough. It did not take long before my therapist called an ambulance when I said I was feeling unsafe to leave her appointment (I had a history of attempts on my life). This ended in my dropping out of the #1 dream school in America (NYU). Fast forward several years to my second (and, spoiler, successful) attempt at college. I had been through the wringer of treatments in Boston, MA and was ready for a second try. I attended UMass Boston part-time at first, terrified of a do-over of my NYU days. I am a super perfectionist (or so I\u2019m told :P) and also wanted to get all As. Going part-time and ensuring it was a good pace for me was really great. I started a major that I thought was \u201cpractical\u201d (since art isn\u2019t, of course. Hint: sarcasm) yet interesting (Psychology), and also pertained to me (research = me-search) and took only classes I thought would be really engrossing. I couldn\u2019t handle doing something boring or agonizingly difficult. The school allows its p/t students to take as few as one class a semester and, even though I had a lot of self-judgment about not being able to do more, kept firm on the idea of not overdoing it. It was a mentality of: Start with nothing and slowly add one thing back at a time so I can better understand my limits. This worked for a while, but because all of the possible electives I could have taken were filled by transfer credits from NYU, I couldn\u2019t take any \u201cfun\u201d classes the whole time and felt really burnt out by my senior year two years later. At this point I just wanted my degree and to get on with my life. And I would say I\u2019m someone who genuinely enjoys academia. I decided to quit my part-time job and just go all-out in school to graduate. By this time, I\u2019d been doing so well I thought it would be a great idea to tempt fate and apply to a dual-enrolled Master\u2019s program on top of my undergraduate work AND be in the scholar\u2019s program that required a 30-page thesis paper. By the very last semester of school, I decided to quit all of the extra stuff: the Master\u2019s program and scholar\u2019s program, the PhD track I was on, trying to get all As, and just cross the finish line. I was so spent I wasn\u2019t even sure if I could complete the last 2 or 3 classes I needed to get all of my credits. I was so resentful toward the American institution of academia that I was prepared to say I was just a few credits shy of graduating for the rest of my life. When people would ask what I did, I could just say I am a college drop out and that was all I was destined to be (this coming from a family of post-grad excellence by every single person). But I did it. I ended up graduating with ONE B. It brought my GPA down to a 3.9 which to this day I am disappointed about. But I did it. I didn\u2019t have any special chords on graduation day, I didn\u2019t write anything special on my cap, not even my whole family showed up to celebrate this momentous occasion. But I did it. And you wanna know what? I\u2019m applying for school AGAIN. I am going back to get my BFA after realizing that it\u2019s what I should have done back when I first went to college. For this time, I am doing things a bit differently. I am staying close to home even though I\u2019d love to go to a school in California. I am asking questions about the mental help availability before even deciding where I\u2019m going. I am going to go with the knowledge that it\u2019s ok whatever happens. I get sick and can\u2019t finish? That\u2019s ok. I struggle and have to take medical leave for a year? That\u2019s ok. My work isn\u2019t as good as my peers because I have a mental health condition and they don\u2019t? Well, bully for them that they don\u2019t have to go through what I do. My work excels because I am a mature adult who has gone through some tough sh*t and now has a story to tell? Great. I will work with whatever scenario comes my way. The biggest realization one must make when asking questions like the one posed above is of his or her own judgments and assumptions going into each scenario. You want to \u201cdeal\u201d with mental illness while in college? Acknowledge it. Address the extra help and support you will need. Know yourself well enough to guess accurately. If you don\u2019t know yourself well enough, then be gentle with yourself. Don\u2019t push yourself past limits based on what your peers are doing. They could be struggling just as much as you and you will be better off for taking care of yourself. Be ok with the idea of taking a break or taking it easy. Maybe know that what is a \u201ctypical college experience\u201d will be different for you but it doesn\u2019t make it any less valid or incredible of an experience. Get in touch with the disabilities department and see if they have any accomodations for you. My best advice is to take all the preconceived notions, assumptions, prejudices, stigmas, and expectations of what a college experience SHOULD be and tell them to just COOL IT for a while until YOU have defined what your college experience IS. Don\u2019t be afraid of obstacles and barriers: they will come. Just know that you have more than one way around them and any option you choose is OK. Say it with me: \u201cI am enough.\u201d And then take that advice into the rest of your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Always remember to utilize in school and out of school resources IE: therapists, your social network, social media, psychiatrists, family, and diet and exercise. So why are these important you ask well first off, your therapist can level off any unwanted urges, desires, thoughts, and behaviors. What's even better he/she can give you valuable tools or food for thought for a healthier mind to work on while you are in school. Utilizing your social network(s) can also be vital due to the amount of support and positive words of encouragement. The psychiatrist not playing so much a role of confidant but regulating the chemical imbalances maybe taking place. Family first they always say just not on this list ( this was in no specific order), but family knows you best and can give you valuable insight on yourself and situations! Last but not least diet and exercise or so to speak the icing on the cake, diet regulates a large portion of your mood and energy which is key. Along with exercise which releases those natural endorphins along with muscle and bone health, that's about all I can offer in a nut shell, keep on chuggin\u2019. ",
