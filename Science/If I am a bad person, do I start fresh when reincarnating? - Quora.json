            "answer_text": "When you die, your soul, mind, and body become one energy before they leave your corpse to join God, where you will have a chance to decide whether to stay in heaven with God or to come back to earth for another life with the same experience or a different one, and this process goes on forever. Every soul that decides to come back to earth for another life is made to forgo all memories of all previous lives and comes back with an agenda of what kind of life they would like to experience, God places you at the right place, in the right environment and gives you all the tools necessary for your soul to experience everything set int the agenda, and when the soul\u2019s objectives, goals have been achieved, it informs the mind and body of the fact and all three deliberate until they are in total agreement after which they decide to go back home to God. Nobody is destined to be rich or poor, a king or beggar, die young or old. Nothing is written. Everything that happens in the universe is a reaction to an action and each reaction is a precise mathematical formula and a universal law laid down by the Creator of all things big and small, seen and unseen in the beginning of time that never changes and will never interfere with. You go out in the rain without an umbrella; you get wet. You put your hand in the fire; you get burned etc, etc, etc. For every masochist in the world there is a sadist ready to oblige, why would we need light if there was no darkness. One person wished to experience what is like to be raped and another person wished to experience what it is like to rape someone and the above universal laws make it possible for these two persons to meet at the right place, the right time and under the right circumstances for both their wishes to be realised .

            "answer_text": "Or, consider you may be thinking about this all wrong. I am quite sure you are not a bad person. I bet you have done bad things, as have we all. And the belief in karma and reincarnation is certainly not a belief in a fresh start. Instead, it is the belief that what we do in this life, that is out of balance with karma, must be re-balanced in the next life. But, it is also the belief that everything is so out of wack, for everyone, it takes many, many lives. Don\u2019t worry about all that. Better, simply start now, not to bad things. Next, very important, forgive yourself for all the bad deeds, in detail. You already have them in your mind. Review again, each act, forgive yourself, and forget it. One by one, and you are free. No need to re-guilt ourselves time and time again. Here is one way to understand how not to do bad things. Nothing else matters, really. Just try to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. That is the up current and it takes us away from the down current of life. Remember the 4 Noble Truths of Buddhism. They are the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering. Lead a life that is true to you. These Nobel Truths apply to you and us all. This could be the only life you ever get. ",
