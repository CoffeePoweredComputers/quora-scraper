            "answer_text": "Edit your question this way If you undergo time inversion, what happens to everyone else? Where do they go? Do they undergo time inversion with you? From my mere knowledge in these type of things which I got from other quoraians answers ofcourse. I can say that time inversion is user specific. Firstly I would like to tell what time inversion actually mean to the readers. All of you might have seen Doraemon sometime in your life. I assume so. One of the frequently used gadgets of Doraemon is time wrapping cloth. It reverses the object condition to past or future. But theoretically future is undefined. So let's only consider half part of it. I mean the past. So if you can transform your age-old refregerator into new in every aspect without changing any of the part then it might only be by time inversion. Now coming to the question, the answer is right below. Keep scrolling \ud83d\ude09 I read that scientists recently made an element undergo time inversion by nearly one billion part of a second using quantum theory. Yet they didn't state any time inversion of others. So you can safely assume that by undergoing time inversion others other than you would not get affected. Thanks for reading :) Forgive me if I went wrong somewhere. I am an amateur learner of science. Comment some interesting facts of quantum mechanics please \ud83d\ude05 ",
