            "answer_text": "Every living thing has a degree of choices that need to be made, in order to simply survive. Granted, as humans, we feel our decisions are much more complex and important, than other living things. But, in the grand scheme of things, we\u2019re really not that different from a mouse in a maze, trying to find our way through the twists and turns of life. In essence, we all have to make tough decisions, from time to time, but we all should take a step back and reflect, sometimes, about what solutions we have really chosen. Sometimes, things just happen to work out. Other times, more complex strategies are necessary to work through an obstacle. It\u2019s life. ",

            "answer_text": "Chemical reactions are very much faster in solution than as a solid. In solution substrates will be bouncing around making it much easier for them to meet and react. This is important for life as well, since it allows substrates like food to come into contact with enzymes and be converted to energy. ",
