            "answer_text": "If you have measuring spoons, there are 16 tablespoons or 48 teaspoons in a cup. Or if you have bar tending equipment, you probably have something that holds one ounce. Or, a standard coffee scoop is one ounce. There are 8 ounces in a cup. Very experienced cooks (and to a lesser extent, bakers) can measure by \u201ceyeball\u201d but I don\u2019t recommend this until you have made the same recipe or measured the same ingredients many times. For example, I can \u201ceyeball\u201d a teaspoon or half teaspoon of salt. But I don\u2019t even try to guess at a half cup of flour, I measure it. If you know the capacity of a measuring vessel, it\u2019s not too hard to do the math for measuring larger amounts. ",

            "answer_text": "You can use a scale if you know the weight of what you are measuring. Remember that a cup of one food isn\u2019t equal to the weight of a cup of another. You can also create your own measuring cup using known weights or measurements (such as having a 750 ml and a 1000 ml water bottle). Empty that amount into another bottle and mark the line where it ends up. Lastly, for some recipes which are ratio based, just use any cup or bowl, as long as you still keep the ratio (ex 2 parts water 1 part chocolate can become 2 Starbucks tall cups water, a Starbucks tall cup chocolate).

So you can simple find out the volume using the formula Density = mass / volume Kg / m3 = kg / m3 And the changes can be made in this using simple maths. I hope you like the answer \ud83d\ude09 ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on what you would like to measure and for what purpose. If it is cooking related, you would need to make some approximation. If it is a calibrated experiment, you need to find replacement measure. If you would like to add sugar to your coffee or coffee powder to coffee, you can make some approximations by using spoon, any other cup, etc. You may make an error but you would learn at least for next coffee.You would like to add chemical for testing, better to have a weighing scale or replacement volume measurement, else error you would commit may spoil your experiment and worse case scenario, you could have an accident.",

When you fill them to just below the rim, about where you normally would fill it for a drink, it comes to 4 ounces or a half-cup. Fill it twice and you\u2019ve got a cup!    I use these all of the time to measure things when cooking, especially things that are messy to clean up, like vegetable oil or corn syrup or peanut butter. ",

So if you have a pint glass, or know about how big one of those is, fill it up halfway. If you have a scale you can use weight. 1 cup weighs exactly 0.5 lb, or around 237g. If you're really in a pinch, I just measured it and the most water I could hold in my two cupped hands is about 1/4 cup, whereas the most I could hold in my mouth was about 1/2 cup. ",
