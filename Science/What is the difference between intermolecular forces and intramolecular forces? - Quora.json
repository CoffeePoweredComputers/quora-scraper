            "answer_text": "Inter means that the forces are between atoms in different molecules. Intra means that the forces exist between atoms within the same molecule. The kinds of bonding are all exactly the same. They are still hydrogen bonds etc, the two terms just refer to \u201cwhere\u201d they are in relation to atoms. The prototypical example of intermolecular bonding are the hydrogen bonds that water forms. The prototypical example of intramolecular bonding are proteins, like enzymes. Enzymes are essentially a straight* polymer of amino acids which on the chemical scale are enormous and really very long if you were to stretch them out. Enzymes fold into very specific 3D shapes because of the interactions that the amino acid units in the same enzyme have with each other. There are a wide range of intramolecular interactions including hydrogen bonds. You may have heard that heating an enzyme beyond a certain point leads to denaturization. Chemically speaking this involves putting in enough energy to break these intramolecular bonds without breaking the stronger covalent etc bonds in the molecule. The enzyme is still chemically intact but is now is just a straight \u201c2D\u201d chain. I hope this helps! * straight as in an unbranched chain. ",
