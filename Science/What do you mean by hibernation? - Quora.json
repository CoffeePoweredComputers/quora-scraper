            "answer_text": "Many animal hibernate in winter when food is not available or estivate in the driest seasons when water is not available. The animals go into a low metabolic rate sleep where the energy use is reduced, body temperature floats above freezing and they can survive on the fat they have stored for their long sleep. Most hibernators periodically wake up to defecate or urinate and then return to the lower body temperature of hibernation. ",
