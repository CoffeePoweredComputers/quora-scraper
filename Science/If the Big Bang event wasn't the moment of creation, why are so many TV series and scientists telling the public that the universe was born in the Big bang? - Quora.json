            "answer_text": "If the Big Bang event wasn't the moment of creation, why are so many TV series and scientists telling the public that the universe was born in the Big bang? When speaking to lay people, such as on TV, documentaries, etc, scientists tend to use poetic language, metaphor, analogies, etc, as using math or physics would typically be over everyone\u2019s head\u2026 IE: If they would understand the actual terms, etc, they would;d not need to learn about this on TV, etc. :D The easiest way to understand the scenario though, is that we use the term \u201cuniverse\u201d for a few things, and, without clarifying which context, it is very confusing. For example, the universe itself, as a whole, is infinite in size and age based upon the evidence. The stuff in the universe that we can observe for example, was in a hot dense state about 13.8 billion years ago. The Big Bang is the nickname for that hot dense state. This hot dense state was observed to be everywhere, in all directions, no matter which way we looked\u2026. wherever the light left it\u2019s source about 13.8 billion years ago. We cannot see THROUGH the hot dense state (A Plasma), so, while we can see the hot dense state, we cannot see what was going on BEFORE that. We also call the visible universe, the part we can see, as light from things can still reach us, the universe\u2026 and that leads to the afore mentioned confusion quite often. As a rule of thumb, if a discussion includes hard measurements, dimensions, speeds, distances, ages, etc, the context is the visible universe. Things can ALSO apply to the universe as a whole, as the only difference between the visible universe and the rest of it, is if the light can still reach us\u2026. there is no actual boundary. In fact, due to the expansion, roughly 20,000 stars, per second, leave our visible universe. For perspective, when they are leaving our visible universe, we are leaving theirs. So, when we leave their visible universe, we are not \u201cgoing somewhere else\u201d, and neither are they when they leave ours, etc. :D As matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, but, can be in different forms, and, matter and energy are two forms of the same thing\u2026. \u2026 nothing was \u201ccreated\u201d in the way most imagine it. So, \u201ceverything\u201d existed before the Big Bang\u2026 but, not in the form it is now. The stuff we see now, such as these stars and planets, etc\u2026 formed after the hot dense state began to cool enough. We OBSERVED the stars and planets form, as we can see the light from them, when it reaches us. That is the \u201ccreation of the universe\u201d they refer to. :D ",

            "answer_text": "Because \u201cmoment of creation\u201d is a useless term. You\u2019re employing the concept of time to an \u201cevent\u201d (of sorts) that generated time and space. You can\u2019t have \u201cthe moment of creation\u201d when the process isn\u2019t so much \u201ca moment\u201d as an expansion of space-time from an infinitely dense singularity. There is, of course, some kind of moment where time must have began, but saying \u201cthe Big Bang is the current model for the early formation of the cosmos\u201d is one thing, calling it \u201cthe moment of creation\u201d is pointless, though poetic, speak that is meaningless in the scientific context. Here is a failing we all have, you have it too. Many things in the natural world around us cannot be imagined or visualized. Our brains cannot grasp more than four dimensions to the cosmos. We can\u2019t really imagine \u201cforever\u201d. We can\u2019t really deal with the potential absence of length-width-height on the quantum scale or the lack of causality. Everything for us, and the medium in which our brains evolved, exists to comprehend the Relativistic portions of the cosmos. We don\u2019t have the mental tools to step too far beyond that. To do so, we require a different language than most of us are capable of jumping into (mathematics) while eschewing passion, desire and our ability to visualized a thing, because those things will only confound us. This is why understanding the Big Bang is counter intuitive while our minds are highly intuitive. They evolved on the steppes of Africa to imagine and address the physical pressures we faced there. There was no pressing adaptive need to imagine the formation of the cosmos or the sub-atomic physics. So our brains do what our brains have always done when confounded by reality \u2014 deny it\u2019s veracity, continuously Sealion obsessively to try to punch a hole in it so we can lean back and say to ourselves, \u201cYeah. Those dumb scientists don\u2019t get it. But I do. I get it. It\u2019s all garbage. God or Allah or [insert force here] did it. See how easy that was?\u201d The truth resists simplicity. It doesn\u2019t exist to make it easy. That is our task and for some subjects, \u201cmaking it easy\u201d means 10 years of professional study. That kind of task is too hard, so emotionally, many people will create a fake reality superimposed on top of ours to get those answers but without the hard work. ",
