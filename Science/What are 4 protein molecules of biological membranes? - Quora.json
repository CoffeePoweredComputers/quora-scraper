            "answer_text": "Basically a biological membrane has 3 main types of proteins: 1)Integral membrane protein- permanently anchored or part of the membrane 2) Peripheral membrane protein- only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins 3) Lipid-anchored protein  Now the integral membranes are of 2 type- Integral polytopic proteins-transmembrane proteins which can span across the membrane.Integral monotopic proteins-attached to only one side of the membrane and do not span.The Integral polytopic proteins are of 3 types: Transmembrane \u03b1-helix proteinTransmembrane \u03b1-helical proteinTransmembrane \u03b2-sheet protein There are 4 types of interaction between Integral monotopic proteins and cell membranes: 4. Interaction by an amphipathic \u03b1-helix parallel 5. Interaction by a hydrophobic loop 6. Interaction by a covalently bound membrane lipid 7. Ionic or electrostatic interactions. So finally, to the question, the 4 types of membrane proteins are : The two types of integral protein- Poly and MonotopicPeripheral proteinsLipid Anchored extrinsic proteins.",

            "answer_text": "Proteins can associate with the membrane in one of three ways.  Single Pass Integral Proteins: Intrinsic or integral membrane proteins embed in the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer. Transmembrane proteins are the classic examples of intrinsic membrane proteins. These span the membrane, typically in an \u03b1-helix conformation and can span the membrane multiple times.Multi Pass Integral Proteins: Some intergral membrane proteins use \u03b2-barrels to cross the membrane. These structures are typically large and form water filled channels.Monotropic Proteins: Integral monotopic proteins, are permanently attached to the membrane from one side.Extrinsic or peripheral membrane proteins: associate loosely with the hydrophilic surfaces of the lipid bilayer or intrinsic membrane proteins. They form weak hydrophobic, electrostatic or non-covalent bonds, but do not embed with the hydrophobic core of the membrane. These proteins can be dissociated from the membrane without disrupting it through application of polar reagents or high pH solutions. Extrinsic membrane proteins may interact with the inner or outer leaflet.",
