            "answer_text": "The warmth is generated by the person, the blanket simply slows the rate of heat loss. The less heat lost, the warmer it feels. The key to this is air trapped in the blanket itself. Air is not a good heat conductor, so the more air trapped, the greater the insulating value and the warmer it feels. In general the thicker the blanket, the more air it traps and the warmer you feel. This is why down comforters feel so warm. The down in them traps a great deal of air because they are very thick, so they feel very warm. Multiple blankets (layers) also tend to feel warm because of the air trapped between the layers in addition to the blankets themselves. Also, for a given thickness, lighter blankets will be feel warmer because they will have less conductive heat loss. Reflective \u201cspace blankets\u201d are a quite different. They are usually impervious so they trap air (and moisture) under them and they are also shiny which reduces radiant heat loss. They are not ideal for daily use because of their moisture entrapment.

Without the blanket, you lose body heat. But the blanket serves as a barrier, keeping the warmth you create trapped beneath where you can enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "The air trapped between the skin and the blanket provides insulation to keep in your body heat. Same idea as with clothing. The blanket and clothing material have some insulation effect as well, but air has much more insulating affect because the thermal conductivity of air is so low. That\u2019s why multiple layers of thin material are better at keeping you warm than one layer of thicker material because more air is trapped. That\u2019s why covering yourself with a newspaper keeps you so warm - multiple layers. ",
