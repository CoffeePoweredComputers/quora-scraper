But they are all at at a pretty safe distance\u2026  So the major threat to your health is probably going to be if you have the misfortune to use the word \u201cnebulas\u201d within earshot of a swivel-eyed, dyed-in-the-wool, classical-trained, Latinist grammar-nazi! You could find yourself getting stabbed with a gladius; strangled with a laqueus; or beaten to death with all six volumes of Gibbon\u2019s History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire - all while being harangued with screams of \u201cNEBULAE! It isn't nebulas - it\u2019s bloody NEBULAE!!!!\u201d Photo credits: Nebula from CBR - The World's Top Destination For Comic, Movie & TV news.

            "answer_text": "There are several types of nebulas. Planetary nebulas came into existence when a star went nova. Being nearby when that happened would be inadvisable. But otherwise there is no conceivable reason why anyone would think a nebula dangerous, unless extremely frightened by clouds. A nebula condensing to form a star and planets isn\u2019t dangerous unless it forms a planet hosting flesh eating Znargs ",

They are created when a star ends and expels gas. The closest nebula is the Helix nebula. It is about 600 light years. Is is so far away that it couldn't be dangerous to us even if it wanted to. ",

Nebula is giant cloud of dust and gas formed from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. We can say that nebula is not as such dangerous as it just an empty space where stars get formed. But it can be dangerous if our spaceship gets damaged in the area of a nebula! ",
