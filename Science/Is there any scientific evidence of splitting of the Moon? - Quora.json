            "answer_text": "Claims don't have to be rational, only arguments do. With that in mind:  There is no scientific evidence that the moon was ever split in two. The NASA evidence in question is roughy on a level with the material that crops up now and then from the Curiosity rover on Mars: visual images that give the impression of fossils, people, animals, or (in Apollo's case) a rift on the moon. People often jump to unsupported and unwarranted conclusions based on solitary observations when those observations confirm things they already believe. That is one of the hardest moments in critical thinking, saying: \"Yes, that confirms what I thought, but can I really believe it?\"There is no remotely reasonable natural process that could cause a body the size of the moon to split in two to a degree sufficient to be visible from earth without catastrophic effects for both the earth and the moon. The Qu'ranic line in question is far to vague to constitute a description for practical purposes, and given its place in the surah seems more like dramatic emphasis than literal exposition. As best I can tell as an outsider, the first few lines are saying like: \"The moon itself could split asunder in front of these people and they would still turn away and ignore the sign,\" which is a common enough religious sentiment in all religions. I have no problem with people wanting to interpret religious texts closely, because I understand the motivations behind it. For some people, faith is far more salient and important than science; they want to live good, righteous, blessed lives, and science doesn't help with that at all. But those who want to believe in miracles shouldn't try to make them scientific; that cheapens the science and destroys the miraculous quality of the belief. ",
