            "answer_text": "If I'm reading your question right, you want to know how to automatically extinguish an electrical fire as soon as it ignites. There are several simple ways to accomplish this. The first and until recently most common would be an automatic Halon extinguishing system. Halon is a family of gases that chemically prevent oxygen from combining with flammable materials. It was commonly used in ship engineering spaces and computer datacenters to extinguish fuel oil and electrical fires, respectively. The stuff works amazingly well; alas it's also terrible for the environment and so is rarely, if ever, used anymore. Next best would be a simple CO2 extinguishing system. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, but it's ubiquitous in the environment so the tiny amount contained in a fire suppression system wouldn't make a difference. It knocks down electrical fires quite well, though not as well or as quickly as Halon. Either way you go, one thing to consider is automatically disconnecting power to the burning thing before trying to extinguish it. If you don't, there's a really good chance it'll reignite after you've used all your extinguishing agent. ",

            "answer_text": "Some buildings are fitted with stations in every room that release a fire smothering agent when the detectors sense smoke or heat from a fire. The agent is a dense, highly brominated gas that sinks to the bottom of the room, forcing the air upward, and quenching the flames in the lower part of the room. It\u2019s more effective than water sprays. ",
