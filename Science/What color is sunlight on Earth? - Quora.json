            "answer_text": "There are two answers, the subjective one and the objective one. Subjectively, our eyes and brains interpret a mixture of light frequencies as white, if the mixture is correct. If you look at your computer screen with a magnifying glass, you will see that each white pixel is made up of a triad of colored dots: red, green, and blue. Your screen isn\u2019t really white at all\u2014it only displays tiny red, green, and blue dots. Depending on the brightness of the dots, it fools your eye into seeing millions of different colors. If they\u2019re all turned on to the maximum brightness, it looks white. Why red, green, and blue? Because these are the basic colors that your retina can detect. If you look at yellow light, your red and green detector cells in your eyes will fire, but not the blue detector cells. Your brain will, correctly, determine the light to be yellow from the combination. To your brain, light coming from the sun appears to be white or yellow-white, except in certain atmospheric conditions. The reason it\u2019s a little bit yellow is that a) yellow is the brightest part of the sun\u2019s light; and b) the gases in the atmosphere scatter some of the blue light, making the sky blue. If you take out the blue from white light, you\u2019re left with yellow. Objectively, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cwhite light.\u201d It\u2019s a phenomenon created by our brains. \u201cWhite light\u201d is really a mixture of colors of light as I described above. Here\u2019s the radiation curve of sunlight:  So, sunlight above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow, along with X-rays, radio waves, gamma rays, and everything else along the electromagnetic spectrum. Without any gases to scatter the blue, it appears to our eyes as plain white. However, as you can see, the amount of the different frequencies of light coming from the sun varies. It doesn\u2019t produce all frequencies in equal amounts. Yellow is the brightest and the others are less bright. So objectively, the color of sunlight is \u201call colors of the rainbow, but yellow most of all.\u201d When the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to pass through more gases and more of it gets absorbed. It also gets absorbed by dust in the atmosphere. All the blue and green and some of the yellow are scattered, and so you see the sun as dimmer, and in shades of orange and red. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the solar spectrum above the atmosphere and below the atmosphere when the Sun is at 90 degrees elevation angle (straight overhead).   The color of the Sun, perceived at the bottom of the atmosphere is white.  This is a color photo I took of the Sun just before the Solar eclipse August 21, 2017 at Fort Laramie, WY. There is a little bit of a red fringe on the upper part of the solar disc due to chromatic aberration. My focus was slightly off.  Here is a picture that Tim Cole took of the Sun on a different occasion. You can see a bit of chromatic aberration in the turquoise fringe on the upper left of the Sun.  Here is a picture during totality just to show, it was a color picture. The clouds and the snow are illuminated by the Sun. If the Sun were yellow, so would the snow and the clouds be.  The Moon is illuminated by the Sun. If the Sun were yellow, so would be the Moon. The Moon does appear slightly reddish because it reflects 11% of blue light, 13% of green light and 16% of red light.  The Moon has a slightly reddish tinge. The over all reflectivity of the Moon is 11% for blue, 13% for green and 16% for red. Why do people say the Sun is yellow? Here is what clouds and snow look like when the Sun is yellow:  When the Sun is a low elevation angle, it is yellow. The clouds and the objects on the ground are yellow, also. The atmosphere exhibits Rayleigh scatter, water vapor absorption, ozone absorption and other losses. The total of these losses is shown below:  The atmospheric transmission due to the losses mentioned above.  Sunlight must travels through a much longer path through the atmosphere when the Sun is at low elevation angles.  The air mass represents the proportion of atmosphere that the light must pass through before striking the Earth relative to its overhead path length, and is equal to Y/X. (Credit: Air Mass | PVEducation) It is normal to look through up to 40 airmasses at sunset near sealevel.  So why it yellow in art? We can take all these effects and simulate what the color of the Sun is as a function of the angle above the horizon.  Frankly, I was amazed at how well this matched actual multiple exposure photos of the setting Sun.  WP06588 Setting sun at autumn equinox, 52 degrees latitude. Time lapse shot at decreasing intervals, starting with 6 minutes. Surrey, England. Warren Photographic.  Odd Hoydalsvik. It is December on the North Sea coast outside Bergen. The winter solstice is not far away - the sun is low in the winter sky, and sets at a very small angle with respect to the horizon. This sequence shows 45 minutes of sunset. The images of the Sun was taken at 3 minute intervals. The same exposure was used for each image, and a solar filter was in place in front of the camera lens. A few seconds after the sun had disappeared the filter was removed and the background image was taken. We can clearly see the increasing effects of Rayleigh scatter and attenuation as the sun gets lower and lower. Please support the other photographers. I don\u2019t sell photos. ",
