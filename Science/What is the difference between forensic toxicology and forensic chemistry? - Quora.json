            "answer_text": "What is the difference between forensic toxicology and forensic chemistry? Forensic chemistry is the application of chemistry and its subfield, forensic toxicology, in a legal setting. A forensic chemist can assist in the identification of unknown materials found at a crime scene. Specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances. Forensic chemistry - Wikipedia Forensic chemistry focuses on identifying unusual compounds, such as paint, or something not widespread. \u201cForensic chemists' analysis can provide leads for investigators and confirm or refute suspicions. Substances found at the scene can tell investigators what to look for during their search. During fire investigations, forensic chemists can determine if an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene was used; if so, this suggests that the fire was intentionally set. Forensic chemists can also narrow down the suspect list to people who would have access to the substance used in a crime. During poisoning investigations, the detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of what to look for when they are interviewing potential suspects. In suspected overdose cases, the quantity of the drug found in the person's system can confirm or rule out overdose as the cause of death. Forensic toxicology is the study of the pharmacodynamics, or what a substance does to the body, and pharmacokinetics, or what the body does to the substance. To accurately determine the effect a particular drug has on the human body, forensic toxicologists must be aware of various levels of drug tolerance that an individual can build up as well as the therapeutic index for various pharmaceuticals. Toxicologists are tasked with determining whether any toxin found in a body was the cause of or contributed to an incident, or whether it was at too low a level to have had an effect. Forensic toxicology typically looks in human fluids, stomach, skin, etc. for arsenic or other poisonous items. The techniques can also analyze for prescription drugs intended for depression sleep, etc. that can be delivered in large enough does to kill. [39] While the determination of the specific toxin can be time-consuming, certain clues can narrow down the possibilities. For example, carbon monoxide poisoning would result in bright red blood while death from hydrogen sulfide poisoning would cause the brain to have a green hue. Toxicologists are also aware of the different metabolites that a specific drug could break down into inside the body. For example, a toxicologist can confirm that a person took heroin by the presence in a sample of 6-monoacetylmorphine, which only comes from the breakdown of heroin. ",
