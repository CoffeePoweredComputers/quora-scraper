            "answer_text": "Ionic compounds are made up of two separate distinct ions, which separate from each other whem dissolved in water. Organic compounds are generally not ionic. Organic compounds are generally covalent. Covalent compounds are not made of ions. They are one molecule without any net charges(although may have charge separation). Organic compounds are classified as compounds of Carbon and Hydrogen witch may or may not have other elements. Some of the organic compounds are ionis as well. Eg. Cyclopropenyl chloride. Ionic compounds conduct electricity in their aqueous state due to presence of ions. Where as most organic compounds do not dissolve in water\u2026. However some do dissolve easily such as ethyl alcohol\u2026.. So, as you can see, these two terms(ionic and organic) are not opposite or not even comparable. Comparable terms would be organic vs Inorganic and ionic vs covalent. Both organic and inorganic substances can be ionic or covalent. Difference between organic and ionic then would be only in general terms\u2026\u2026 assuming organic as covalent and ionic as Inorganic\u2026\u2026 then everything would boil down to ionic vs covalent compounds\u2026. And many have already answered that\u2026.. Please rephrase your question or give some details as to what you are looking for\u2026.. Hope to help you\u2026.. ",
