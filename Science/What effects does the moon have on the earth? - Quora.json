            "answer_text": "The most obvious-to-the-naked-eye answer is the tide. The Earth exerts gravitational force upon the Moon, which is what keeps it in orbit. Conversely, the Moon exerts force upon the Earth. The visible effect of this is that the oceans are attracted to the Moon, and bunch up on one side of the Earth (actually two - see Why does the tide rise on the side of the earth opposite the moon?)Of course everything on the Earth is attracted to the Moon, it's just that the oceans are most freely able to move, while, for instance, trees are not. Another effect is that the Earth wobbles slightly in its orbit of the Sun. The Moon does not simply orbit the Earth, but rather the Moon and the Earth orbit a common point. To visualise this, think of yourself holding a tennis ball on a string. As you spin around the ball flies out and spins around you. Now imagine a hammer thrower. As they spin around, the weight of the hammer is so heavy that they actually spin around a point between them and the hammer. Youtube a hammer thrower if you don't know what I mean. The Moon is so small compared to the earth that this common point is somewhere inside the Earth and causes only a slight 'wobble' rather than a common orbit, but the effect is far more pronounced on Mars and its moons, and Pluto and its moon really do spin around a central point far outside Pluto's crust. Lastly, the Moon is slowing down the Earth's rotation.As the tides swish back and forth, they slowly transfer rotational energy from the Earth to the Moon. This slows down the Earth's spin, and moves the Moon farther away from us. During the age of the dinosaurs, the earth moved from about 8,700km closer than it is now (230 million years ago) to about 2,400km closer than currently, just as the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago. At this point an Earth day was only 20 hours long. Laser reflectors placed on the Moon by the Apollo missions show the Moon to be moving away from us currently at about 38mm per year.

            "answer_text": "Malcolm Sargeant is right: in the collision that formed the Moon, the Mars-sized protoplanet Thea donated most of its iron core to the Earth. It is the geodynamo action of  convection in Earth's oversized outer core that generates its uncharacteristically strong magnetic field. This magnetosphere in turn protects life against harmful solar radiation: it shield us from solar wind and cosmic rays, and protects the upper atmosphere. The ozone layer relies upon this shield, and it is the ozone layer that protects the surface of Earth from the majority of DNA-damaging UV radiation. Earth's magnetic field Karl Hoyer is correct that the Moon's gravitational influence stabilizes Earth's axial tilt. While we can't know if life would or would not have evolved if Earth's poles tumbled on geologic time scales, we can say that life would not have evolved its seasonal variations in the temperate zones without this eons-long 23 degrees of axial tilt. Bill Welden is also correct: strong lunar tides expose many shorelines to wet/dry cycles which very likely drove the migration of life from ocean to land. The tides caused by the Moon are more than twice as strong as those caused by the Sun. Tide Intertidal ecology Having a giant solar reflector in orbit certainly had an effect on the evolution of nocturnal creatures (and aided diurnal creatures to see better during certain parts of the month).  I don't think it's a coincidence that the average human menstrual cycle is 28 days, an almost exact average of the Moon's orbital and synodic periods. We can speculate that this evolved as a result of the lifestyle of early hunter/gatherer humans. The light from a full Moon was likely a driver for fertility cycles, whether it was something that encouraged copulation or precluded it in favor of hunting or other activities not normally possible at night. Menstrual cycle In fact so many biological rhythms in the animal kingdom match the Moon's period that it's one line of evidence for a common ancestor among animals. In fact the 28-day menstrual average may be a carryover from tidal pool organisms, and have nothing whatsoever to do with hunter gatherers. Without the Moon, we would not have the concept of months. In Western culture there are roughly 28 days, stretched to 30 so we would have 12 months instead of 13, since 12 has so many divisors and there would be three months per season instead of 3.25. In more recent history (Caesar's time) 12 months were adopted to avoid the problems of having 10 months. The Islamic calendar is purely lunar, which is why events like Ramadan shift on the Gregorian calendar each year. The Hebrew calendar is a mix of lunar and solar. Many pre-Western cultures used lunar calendars. Lunar calendar The Moon also gives us a 7-day week. Even today, most humans live near the sea. For early humans the timing of the tides was a matter of survival, and knowing when it would be at its highest and lowest points was of paramount importance. The interaction of gravitational forces from the Sun and the Moon produce the spring and neap tides on seven-day intervals. Tide ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of the influence of the Moon on the Earth are the ocean tides, particularly the spring tides where the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon combine to give the greatest effect. The regular rise and fall of sea level creates an unique environment in the Solar System, where life is exposed to both immersion in water and exposure to air in the space of a few hours. This interface between two distinct ecological niches is thought by many to be crucial in evolutionary terms. It is considered likely by many authors that the current circa 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation is a relic of the oblique collision that produced the Moon.  Furthermore it is argued that the presence of the orbiting Moon has, through a large part of geological time, stabilised this axial tilt or obliquity of the Earth. This has had important ramifications for life on the Earth as major and frequent shifts in this obliquity would have led to significant and rapid changes in the Earth's climate due to changes in insolation values at the poles and equator.

By stabilizing the Earth's tilt on its axis, it keeps the climate from getting too extreme and helps preserve life, including our own.

In ancient times, before man learned to use fire, it provided light, so he could see the wild creatures that filled the night, and hopefully get some sleep. ",
