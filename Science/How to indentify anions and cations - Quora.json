            "answer_text": "For this purpose, you have test for cations and test for anions. I. Physical method: Observe the colour of the salt. If it is: White => Cu2+, Ni 2+, Fe3+, may be absentBlue => Cu2+ may be presentBrown => Fe3+ may be presentObserve the smell of the salt by taking a pinch of it between your fingers and thumb and rubbing it with water . If it is: Ammonical => NH4+ may be presentVinegar like => CH3COO- may be presentNo characteristic smell => NH4+, CH3COO-, S2- may be absentII. Chemical method: II.I Test for Anions II.I.I Preliminary test Heat the salt with conc. H2SO4. If you observe: Reddish brown pungent vapours that smells of burnt starch and gives paper yellow colour to the solution => Br- may be presentChoking smell and a colourless gas => Cl- may be present. If you bring a glass rod dipped in NH4OH near the mouth of the test tube, dense white fumes are given out.Brown fumes which intensify when you add copper chips Or a small paper pellet => NO3 - may be presentPungent vapour, vinegar like smell => CH3COO- may be presentNo characteristic smell => SO4 2- may be present and the above mentioned anions, absent.II.I.II Confirmatory test (a) Br - (i) Silver nitrate test Add some dilute HNO3 to aqueous solution of salt, boil and cool. You get a pale yellow precipitate (AgBr) (ii) MnO2 test Add solid MnO2 to the salt and some concentrated H2SO4. You will get brown vapours of Bromine. (b) Cl - (i) Silver Nitrate test Add some dilute HNO3 to aqueous solution of salt, boil and cool. You get an yellow or curdy white precipitate (AgCl). (ii) Chromyl Chloride test Add K2Cr2O7 to the salt And some concentrated H2SO4 which would give you deep reddish orange colour (Chromyl Chloride). When you pass these orange vapours through NaOH, you get yellow ppt.. When you add lead acetate to this yellow ppt, you get a canary yellow ppt.. (c) NO3 - (i) Add diphenylamine to the salt solution. You will get deep blue colouration. (ii) Add some freshly prepared FeSO4 solution to the aqueous solution of the salt. Then drop by drop, add a concentrated H2SO4 through the walls of test tube. You will get a dark ring at the junction of the layers. (d) SO4 2- Whether you add barium Chloride or Lead acetate to the salt solution, you will get a white ppt.. (e) CH3COO- Perform the Ester test OR FeCl3 test: To the salt solution, add FeCl3 and filter it. Divide the resultant solution in 2 parts: To one part, add HCl. Red colour disappears. To the second part, add water and boil. Reddish brown ppt. is observed. II.II Test for Cations II.II.I Preliminary test Heat a pinch of salt in concentrated NaOH solution and bring a glass rod dipped in HCl near the mouth of tube. White fumes evolved => NH4 + present Else, Add dil. HCl to salt solution. If white ppt. is formed, Pb2+ present Else, Pass H2S through the above solution. If black ppt. is formed, Cu 2+ present. Else, Take a salt solution, add concentrated HNO3 and NH4 Cl, boil and cool. If you get Reddish brown ppt, you have Fe 3+ but, if you have white ppt, you have Al 3+. II.II.II Confirmatory test ( a ) NH4 + Pass the white fumes in prelims test through Nessler\u2019s Reagent. Brown ppt.. ( b) Pb 2+ White ppt. in prelims test is boiled with water. Divide the solution into 3 parts: Cool under tap water. White crystalline ppt. observed.Add K2Cr2O7. You get yellow ppt..Add KI. You get yellow ppt..( c ) Cu 2+ Black ppt. in the prelims test is added to minimum amount of 50% HNO3 solution and heated. To this, dilute H2SO4 and alcohol is added. You get a blue coloured solution. Divide this Blue solution into 2 parts. Add acetic acid and potassium ferrocyanide. Brown ppt. is observed.Add acetic acid and potassium iodide. White ppt. is observed in brown solution.( d ) Fe 3+ The reddish brown ppt. in prelims test is added to HCl and this solution is divided into 2 parts: Add Potassium Ferrocyanide. Prussian blue colour is observed.Add Potassium sulphocyanide. Blood red colour is observed.( e ) Al 3+ White ppt. in prelims test is added to HCl and to the resultant solution we add 2 drops of blue litmus solution and NH4OH so that we get a floating blue ppt.. This is also called as Lake test. ",

            "answer_text": "It completely depends on the ion you're testing. Since the presence of a cation means that there's also an anion around, you can't use their electric charges to tell what's in the solution. So you have to use their chemical properties.  Example 1. You want to test for copper(II) ions in aqueous solution. As a chemist  (or any other scientist who has to use chemistry), you know that copper(II) ions surround themselves with six water molecules, and this gives them a very characteristic blue colour. If you have a blue solution, it may be because of the presence of copper(II) ions, but also any other blue chemical. What do you do? Well, you have to know the chemistry of copper: -Copper(II) ions turn green when you add hydrochloric acid in excess (since the six water molecules I mentioned before are replaced by four chloride ions). -Copper(II) ions turn into a light blue precipitate, then dark blue upon addition of ammonia (for a variety of reasons). If you add hydrochloric acid and then ammonia in two separate solutions and you see those things happen, you can be sure: you have copper(II) ions in there. There are more methods, of course, and this is just one example. Also, you usually have some sort of context, which helps a lot when determining the composition of something. Example 2. You know that there is some type of halide ions in a solution. That is, you have either fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodine ions. But you don't know which type you have. What do you do? You know that there are four possible results if you add silver nitrate. If nothing happens, then you have fluoride ions. If you get a white precipitate, you have chloride ions. If you get a light-cream precipitate, you have bromide ions. And if you get a light-yellow precipitate, you have iodide ions. You just have to observe to see what happens. Of course, you have to know the chemistry of the species you want to look for. It all depends of the situation. ",
