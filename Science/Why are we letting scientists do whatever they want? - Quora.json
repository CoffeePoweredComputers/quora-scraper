            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t. Scientists are subject to the same laws that everyone else is. This often affects their ability to do their work, but that\u2019s just life. This is why so much science occurs now in places like China while the US is stagnating, as the US has stifled a lot of science with laws, many based on irrational fears and commercial interests. In fact, scientists don\u2019t have all that much freedom - between corporate threats and government regulation, as well as the general hysteria in the media, many modern scientists feel as though they are seen more as Frankenstein\u2019s creator than a pillar of society. Also, most scientists are very ethical people, and won\u2019t carry out research that is harmful or morally wrong. And of course, there\u2019s funding challenges, no matter who you are. And a general bigotry within our field from many other scientists if you\u2019re of the Autodidact variety, no matter how valuable your research. After all of those considerations are taken into account, then, as with most people, we can do what we can afford to do, even if it\u2019s not what we want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is historical. There is still the old \u201cawe\u201d towards science and scientists, originating from those times when science, studying reality around us was confined to the \u201chigher echelons\u201d of society, completely closed off from the masses. We still highly respect awards like the Nobel-prize, we are still intrigued by popular scientist explaining seemingly incomprehensible things to us. Thus we haven\u2019t noticed how science has become corrupted, along with all our other Human activities. Today scientists \u201chave sold their soul\u201d, working for the highest bidder, serving monetary, political purposes. Moreover science has reached a wall it cannot break through, as there is a limit what an inherently self-centered, self-centered, subjective mind can reveal, comprehend. We have reached this limit thus all sciences have become \u201ctheoretical\u201d, descending into the realms of fantasies, illusions, science fiction. In order to science to purify itself and break through into the real dimensions of reality the observer has to change, we need to acquire a selfless, transparent and objective viewpoint that is free from egoistic and subjective distortions.
