            "answer_text": "Because you are hurtling through the air in a projectile metal shell - much like a bomb or a bullet. And if any one of the two hundred people packed into the airborne can-of-humans were to think\u2026 \u2018Hang on, I am hurtling through the sky like a bullet, with 35,000 feet of empty air between my feet and the ground - and will instantly die if anything goes wrong\u2026\u2019  \u2026then they would start screaming. And when people are trapped without any means of escape in a can of human beings that is flying through the sky miles above the Earth, and one of them starts screaming, it is only natural that a few others will join in. And when a choir of people start screaming in unison, people tend to scream along. So if they didn\u2019t make flying boring - there would be 200 screaming sardines in an airborne tin every time you flew. Which is why airplanes aren\u2019t glass-bottomed like boats. And also why they give you ear plugs on long-haul flights. Just in case. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if by boring you are referring to being stuck in a plane for a number of hours. However, it depends on the length of your flight, whether you are flying international, domestic or the airline on which you are flying on. I have traveled both domestic, and international and some flights have been better than others. Just recently I flew to Paris this past spring. I flew Delta Airlines, not because I have a particular preference for them, but because it was the cheapest flight I could find out of DFW. Usually, flights to Europe are pretty pricey, so I had to spend a night in Detroit to take advantage of the cheap airfare. Typically, when flying international and depending on the length of the flight, the airlines provide passengers with a meal(s) and in-flight entertainment (movies, shows, music on a small video screen) free of charge. Of course, this is all included in the price of your airfare, but considering the price I paid for my flight, I would say it was a steal! I can say that one of the best airlines I have been on have been Turkish Airlines, Air Canada, and Jet Blue. The level of customer service, cleanliness of the aircraft, and the willingness of the flight attendants to serve their customers are the reasons why in my opinion the best airlines I have traveled in. If you are like me and your goal is to spend the least amount of money as possible on a flight so you can travel more often, then allow me to suggest to of the search engines I use to search for flights - Airfarewatchdog and Booking Buddy! This is how I have traveled to Europe seven times. If you don\u2019t mind spending the money and would prefer to save time by flying directly limiting the amount of time on a flight then, by all means, do so. My motto is travel as much as you can, travel as far as you can, and as long as you can - life is not meant to be lived in one place. ",
