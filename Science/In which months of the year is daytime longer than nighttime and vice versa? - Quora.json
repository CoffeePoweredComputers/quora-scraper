            "answer_text": "This answer assumes the following definitions for daytime and nighttime: daytime: the daily period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon, i.e. the time during which the Earth does not block sunlightThis can also be considered from another perspective, one which sees it as the time period after the eastern horizon has moved below the sun and before the western horizon has moved above the sun (both as a result of the Earth\u2019s axial rotation) from any perspective with sunlight which is blocked by the Earth. The Eastern and Western horizons are the correct horizons for people near or on the Earth\u2019s surface, but for natural or artificial satellites, the horizons might differ depending on the distance from the Earth and direction of orbit around the Earth.nighttime: the daily period of time during which the Sun is below the horizon, i.e. the daily time period during which the Sun\u2019s rays are blocked by the Earth.These definitions do not consider a few things because they are not relevant to your question: Both definitions either include or exclude morning and evening twilights.Solar and Lunar Eclipses and clouds are not taken into account because they do not affect daytime and nighttime as defined here. They do not have bearing on the question I answered.If you live north or south of the tropics, daytime is longer during the Spring and Summer months and shorter during the Autumn and Winter months. The Vernal and Autumnal equinoxes determine when the days (or nights) begin to grow longer than the nights (or days) and the effect is opposite on the northern and southern hemispheres. That determines which months in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, are the Spring and Summer months and which are the Autumn and Winter months. Near the equator, daytime and nighttime are approximately equivalent year-round. ",
