            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean by an \u201cobject\u201d something massive and extended but rigid, it can have overall momentum zero and rotational kinetic energy, though of course parts of it will have momentum individually. Removing the restriction to a rigid body doesn't fundamentally alter the situation, except that it may no longer be possible to describe what is going on as a rotation. If the object is a point-like particle, then no. Just for the hell of it, I'll use the relativistic formula for momentum. The magnitude of momentum including the relativistic terms is given by [math]\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = |pc|[/math] where E is the total energy. For slow speeds, this is dominated by the energy bound up in the rest mass, and you get (roughly) [math]\\sqrt{2(\\frac{1}{2}m_0v^2m_0c^2)}[/math] [math]m_0c|v| \\approx |pc|[/math] [math]m_0|v| = |p|[/math] This is reassuring - we wouldn't want anything else at low speeds! Returning to the exact formula, if the momentum is zero then the energy is just the rest-mass energy; so it clearly can't have non-zero kinetic energy in addition to this. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it would not have kinetic energy. Linear momentum is given as the product of mass and velocity: [math]\\begin{align}p=mv\\end{align}\\tag*{}[/math] If the momentum [math]p[/math] is zero, then that would require velocity [math]v[/math] to also be zero. Linear kinetic energy is given by: [math]\\begin{align}KE=\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\end{align}\\tag*{}[/math] As such, if [math]v[/math] is zero, kinetic energy is also zero.  It is the same case with angular momentum and angular kinetic energy. Angular momentum is given by [math]\\begin{align}L=I\\omega\\end{align}\\tag*{}[/math] If the angular momentum [math]L[/math] is equal to zero, then the angular velocity [math]\\omega[/math] must also be zero as [math]I[/math] is merely a product of mass and radius/length. Angular kinetic energy is given by [math]\\begin{align}KE_A=\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\end{align}\\tag*{}[/math] Similarly to its linear counterpart, if [math]\\omega[/math] is zero, angular kinetic energy is also zero.
