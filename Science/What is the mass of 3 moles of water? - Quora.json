            "answer_text": "Short answer 18x3=54 gram Explanation: When you express molecular mass (in case of molecule)/atomic mass(in case of atom) in gram it will be equivalent to one mole. For example: 12 gram Carbon atom = 1 mole of Carbon atom = N number of Carbon atom 16 gram Oxygen atom= 1 mole of Oxygen atom = N number of Oxygen atom 32 gram Oxygen molecule (O2) = 1 mole of Oxygen molecule (O2) = N number of Oxygen molecule (O2) similarly 1 mole of water is equivalent to molecular mass of water x 3 that is 18x3=54 gram. It would constitute 3N molecules of water. N: Avogadro's number : 6.022140857 \u00d7 10^23 ",

            "answer_text": "This doesn't require much in the way of math. The molar mass of water is 18.0g / mol (16.0+2x1.0). Three moles would have a mass which is three times greater or 3 x 18, which you can easily estimate. 3 x 20 = 60, so 3 moles of water will be a bit less than 60. Clearly, that is 54g. ",
