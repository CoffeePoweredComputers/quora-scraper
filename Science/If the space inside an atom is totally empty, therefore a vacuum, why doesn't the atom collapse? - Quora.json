            "answer_text": "That is an excellent question - so excellent, in fact, that it required physicists to develop an entirely new branch of science to answer it. The answer lies in quantum mechanics, which scientists began to develop around the beginning of the 20th century. There is a lot to know about quantum mechanics if you want to understand completely, but in the interest of brevity, let\u2019s start with this concept: in an atom, electrons are located in certain \u201cshells\u201d called energy levels. The energy levels are at fixed distances from the atomic nucleus. Electrons can leap from one energy level to another, but only if they gain or lose the appropriate amount of energy. For example, for an electron to jump from the 1st energy level to the 2nd energy level, it must gain exactly the amount of energy that corresponds to the gap between the two levels. Likewise, the electron can also fall from the 2nd energy level to the 1st energy level, but only if it gives off exactly the amount of energy that bridges the gap between them. All electrons tend to fall into the lowest available energy level, so it would seem that electrons would all occupy the 1st energy level, crowding together close to the atomic nucleus. However, each energy level has a maximum occupancy level. The 1st energy level can only hold 2 electrons. If the 1st energy level already contains two electrons, then any additional electrons must go into the 2nd energy level, which can hold up to 8 electrons. The electrons always fall into the lowest available energy level*, but they cannot wind up between energy levels. That\u2019s why all electrons do not collapse into the center of an atom; they simply cannot. They can only exist in specific locations, and when those locations are full, the atom must expand outwards if it gains any more electrons.  *I\u2019ve left out a lot of details, of course. When you start getting into the nitty-gritty of quantum mechanics, you\u2019ll find that energy levels are actually divided into sublevels, which are in turn divided into regions called orbitals. Locating electrons in atoms is much more sophisticated than what I\u2019ve described here, but I\u2019ve hopefully told you enough to answer your question. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the main problem is that people have been taught to think of atoms and sub-atomic particles as physical objects that exist in some space, like billiard balls on a table. Or they see those science videos where they describe space-time as a rubber sheet. They put a bowling ball on it to make the sheet stretch down and then roll a golf ball by it to show how gravity works. But these are all misleading. Space-time is not some container or surface that objects are moving in or on. Rather, space-time is all that exists. Instead of thinking of a particle as a ball on a rubber sheet, think of pinching that sheet and pulling enough material that you can make a knot in it. A particle - matter - is like that knot. So no balls, just sheet. You can probably imagine that it would take a lot of energy to stretch a taut rubber sheet enough to tie a knot in it. And untying the knot would release a lot of energy. That is why atoms have so much energy and we can create nuclear bombs from a small amount of matter. You can probably also imagine that if you stretch the sheet to tie a knot in it, you would increase the tension on the entire sheet. The most tension would be near the knot but even a distant part of the sheet would have some small amount of additional tension. This is how forces like gravity work. Think of forces like gravity or electromagnetism as the threads that this fabric is woven from. Now to answer your original question, you can imagine that once you tie a knot, there is a limit to how close you can tie another knot. Each knot itself needs a certain amount of fabric. If you think of the nucleus as one knot and the electrons around it as other knots, you can imagine that how close you can tie the knots to the nucleus and how many knots you can fit around it would all be limited. Hope this helps! Of course, space-time has many dimensions, not just two like a sheet, but the core idea is the same. ",
