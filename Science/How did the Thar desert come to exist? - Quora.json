            "answer_text": "Being located in interior part of the sub-continent, Thar desert region becomes very hot during summer months and lack of any precipitation in entire year made it more arid over many centuries and hence a desert was formed here.  Climatologically speaking, this region receives no precipitation from both South-west and North-east monsoons. Occasionally it receives but they are mainly due to local factors.  Indian sub-continent receives 60 - 70% of it's rainfall during south-west monsoon. During this period, Arabian sea branch of South-west monsoon is extended over western coasts of India and merges with the Bay of Bengal branch near Dharamsala, south of Himalayas.  Thar desert region is a low level plain landforms that completely falls under this Arabian sea branch of SW monsoon but due to lack of any major obstruction this region receives almost zero precipitation. If Aravali range happens to be rotated at 90degrees to its present location, then this region would have been a very fertile plain region. But since Aravali range lies in the parallel direction of Arabian sea branch, it offers very little resistance to the passing winds and hence less precipitation is witnessed here.  The same Arabian sea branch causes heavy rainfall on western coasts from Kerala to South Gujarat because of the presence of Western Ghats. Beyond this, this branch easily passes into interior parts of India and covers majority of Central India and North of India until it merges with Bay of Bengal branch. Here, rains are witnessed  easily in the surrounding regions wherever it comes across elevated lands.  Monsoon onset and Aravali range maps -     he other time when Indian sub-continent receives rainfall is during North-East monsoon period(September - December months) originating beyond Himalayas. These monsoons cause rainfall in south east Indian regions primarily as they obstruct the retreating monsoons coming from Bay of Bengal sea. But the same NE winds passing over interior parts of country doesn't cause rainfall even if they are obstructed by highlands because they are very dry with almost zero moisture. Hence, Thar desert remains dry even in this period of monsoons.   These are the Western Disturbances originated from the Mediterranean and Caspian seas which causes rainfall / snowfall in Northern India periods during December-January months. Even these moisture bearing winds are beyond the reach of Thar desert region to receive rainfall.   ",

            "answer_text": "It is because the Thar Desert in India! Elsewhere, it must have been a world famous laboratory for the study of climatic fluctuations and hydrological metamorphoses since pre-historic times unwrapping age-old mysteries behind desert landforms on the earth. The artifacts found recently in deep canal cut and deposit of finely laminated black clay (locally called kaajalia) amply proves that some thousands years ago there were heavy rainfall and water bodies full of water in the vast landform where, today, the great Thar Desert spreads. It is also found from different recent studies that about one million years ago much before the formation of Thar Desert, the region was watered by mighty rivers comparable in size to the Indus and the Ganga. It was frequented by regular rainfall; good and lush vegetation prevailed on the landform. A half-million years ago, however, powerful tectonic movements distorted the river system and the great streams began to slow down and meander. Struck by periodic natural catastrophes the region started to experience scant rainfall and the rivers thereupon became consequentially dried. With the prevalence of strong winds the sand and alluvial particles were blown across and got deposited on the landform. The region experienced a hide and seek like interplay between aridity and humidity here over thousands of years. Man has been part of this landform since then. The nomadic life style that is seen today in the desert is a vestige of the period in which the Thar was full of lush vegetation. Gradually, the landforms used to pass through regular climatic and hydrological variations for a long time and aridity perpetuated on the landform. The Southwest monsoon that bring copious rainfall in several parts of India scantly drizzles over the desert as the monsoon winds blow parallel to the Aravalli Range that guards it and also get devoid of sufficient moisture when they reach here. Thus, formed the 77,000 square miles of Great India Desert; and it\u2019s now spread between the Aravalli Hills in the north-east, the Great Rann of Kutch along the coast and the alluvial plains of the Indus River in the west and north-west. It is mostly situated in western Rajasthan and eastern part of Pakistan; also extends to Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana in India. The Great Indian Desert holds utmost significance in terms of economic development not only for Rajasthan but also for India. It also is a vital area for geological and climatic studies. ",
