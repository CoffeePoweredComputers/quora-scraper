            "answer_text": "The REAL reason blondes are so beautiful: Blondes are not the most attractive girls because of their hair color, but because of their genetics over all. People with blonde hair (light brown, dark brown but still nordic genetics) tend to have also better jawlines, nicer (or perfect) noses, better shaped, symmetrical faces over all, wider smile, protruding wider forehead and brow bones giving that proportional angular look, red-ish skin, blushy full cheeks, high cheekbones, blue/light eyes, proportional teeth, naturally toned muscles on body usually, tight skin on face (\u2018cause they tend to have bigger upper skulls (bigger brain)), even most proportional fingers and nails, and so on. Even nordic guys have more testosterone, big full beards almost every nordic guy, and fair mass in muscle without doing any training.. girls usually big breasts, also feminine voices. Generally nordic people seem to have everything going for them. Blonde hair is just one of their good traits. So when most people like blonds, they may think it's just because of the blonde hair, but actually it's because of everything else that goes with it. Also, having straight or fairly straight hair makes it easy for them to have long hair which is also attractive. Plus let\u2019s not forget, people like this, having such good quality looks overall, naturally tend to be confident as a personality (I specifically noticed that most blonds are confident since they are subconsciously if not inherently aware that they have something special going for them), which makes them even more attractive (usually even the non attractive blonde girl will be more confident then the non attractive brunette). And other non blonde girls, a lot of models who are brunettes, actually are so beautiful because genetics wise they are actually \u201cblondes\u201d:      -All five of these girls are actually \u201cblonde in the face\u201d, meaning they have nordic genetics. They just happen to have more melanin in the hair or eyes (if you seen enough blondes in your life, I\u2019m sure you can look at these girls faces, imagine they are blonde, and realize that blonde hair would feel natural on them). So a lot of dark haired beauties are still blondes in a way. And that is the reason why are blondes so beautiful, not because of the blonde hair, but because they simply are the most beautiful. -Beside all of this, blonde hair it self actually is a plus, also it\u2019s very rare to have naturally, so that helps too in making the girl attractive. -Lighter skin, and anything light in color on the body, makes you look younger. And youth is a sign of fertility men are attracted to. Yes, there are a lot of beautiful girls that are not nordic, and yes there are blondes who don\u2019t happen to be beautiful. But statistically speaking, the only ethnicity for which we can boldly expect the girl to be beautiful, just because we know the color of her hair, is this one. You can tell me a girl is naturally blonde, I don\u2019t even have to see her, I already know odds are that she\u2019s beautiful because of the genes that go with that hair. Especially in nordic countries like Sweden and Norway, you could tell that almost all people are generally good looking, everybody. With the most beautiful girls in these countries being so stunning, I think it\u2019s an insult to our intelligence as humans to say \u201cEveryone is beautiful\u201d. Not trying to sound mean, but physical beauty is a very concrete and objective thing. You either have it, you don\u2019t, or you\u2019re specifically somewhere in between, but saying that beauty is a social construct is like saying math and physics are a social construct. There is a good reason why some women turn us on and some don\u2019t (yes, there is a social construct element to it, but it plays a very small role in determining do we find something beautiful or not. I\u2019d modestly assume we judge beauty 10% by society\u2019s expectations, and 90% by our raw, biological instincts and God given eyes). By the way, I'm not even nordic myself, to note I'm not being biased here. I'm very Mediterranean, Italian looking with black curly hair, brown eyes and a big nose. I\u2019m just good at noticing reality. Hope this explained some things. ",

            "answer_text": "Blondes In Fairy Tales I think there are many reasons why blondes are considered to be so beautiful which goes back to fairy tales. The good and beautiful princesses like Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella were blonde to symbolize purity. It also provided a contrast to the evil villains they were often struggling against. Before people could easily use bleach and hair dye to go blonde, it was a relatively rare and magical hair color which fascinated people. Natural Blondes Are Rare In other cultures blondes stand out because they are more unusual. When I was traveling in parts of France where people had predominantly dark hair, I was much more visible. People commented more about my hair when I was in certain countries than in others. Throughout history blondes with light colored eyes and pale sign were also considered rare and attractive to many people. Because blonde hair often darkens with age, blonde hair is often associated with youth and vibrancy. The Media Beautiful Blonde Blitz The media has contributed a lot to the idea of the beautiful blonde by popularizing the blonde bombshells like Marilyn Monroe and Pamela Anderson. Women rock stars understand that they will often win more fans with blonde hair so they tend to embrace that hair color. Imagine Madonna, Lady Gaga or other popular rock stars without blonde hair. Women have famously dyed their hair blonde in order to be discovered in Hollywood because the film industry values blondes as the ultimate beauty symbol. Daenerys Targaryen Is A Beautiful Blonde Daenerys Targaryen is considered very beautiful as well as cherished for her strength on Game Of Thrones (GoT). It\u2019s no accident that Daenerys was written as a gorgeous white blonde. Her gorgeous pale white blonde has become the latest hair color rage along with silver and gray blonde. Ironically, the actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is a brunette off camera. Clairol And L\u2019Oreal Clairol and L\u2019Oreal has made a fortune of the ability to offer any woman the opportunity to go blonde. There have been many television and print media campaigns which underlined the belief that blonde is the most beautiful hair color. Beautiful blondes are a cultural phenomena in some places, a media phenomena in others and just a personal preference by other people around the world. Are all blondes beautiful? Of course not, but beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder. All people are unique, have different likes and dislikes and opinions. Not everyone will agree that blondes are beautiful but it\u2019s a proven fact that a gorgeous blonde will always outsell a beautiful brunette or redhead in a marketing campaign. Best wishes to all.
