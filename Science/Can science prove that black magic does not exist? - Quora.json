            "answer_text": "222 years ago black and white magic was used throughout what is now Australia, the Torres Straight islands and New Guinea. It\u2019s hard to know about Borneo, Bali or the Indonesian areas. Bali was quite sophisticated with Hindu spirituality and yogic science. The indigenous Australians were practicing positive fourth density consciousness in their Dreamtime and certainly used magic. The Torres Straight islanders ways seemed to be more closely associated with those of Egypt which was aligned with negative consciousness and possibly not fourth density. They used head hunting rites in a negative way and fed their god the energy of fear from captured victims who were going to be beheaded. Modern science began in 1901 when the mechanical atom and its negative electron was accepted as its foundation. Nikola Tesla was showing them the magic of numbers and light as well as the reality of lightning and electricity, but he was conveniently sidelined for the inefficient electrical systems that we have today. The universe is infinite and unknowable at our current density of consciousness. The best we can do is to know ourselves and how we want to be within the tribe of earth (Gaia) human beings. There are nations and cultures that don\u2019t work well together at the top echelons of power, but at \u201cWe, the People\u201d level, we can all get on together OK by simply practising the magic of unconditional love and self-respect. Respect is the best way to deal with magic, other people and Gaia. Contempt, disdain and denial are the emotions of those residing and working in the upper echelons of the pyramid systems of corruption and control. The big claims to fame of science are awesome weapons and poisonous technologies as well as COVID-19 and smart phones. Science is currently working flat out to create a satellite matrix for 5G microwave radiation and Artificial Intelligence to control humanity. Does it really matter that science denies magic, because science also denies human involvement in creation and the universe. From a scientific perspective, humans are creatures that accidently emerged because the conditions were suitable on the rock that they call earth. ",

Science investigates evidence, people who believe in magic don\u2019t have any evidence, so science does not concern itself with their claims. A more pertinent question would be: Can you prove that magic is real? Of course you can\u2019t, hence the reason you\u2019re asking for disproof of your superstitious nonsense, to shift your burden of proof onto unbelievers, standard practice amongst those who don\u2019t know the difference between claims and evidence. What you have is a claim, what you do not have is evidence. Learn what evidence is, present some, then we can have a reasonable discussion. ",

If you think something exists and wish to convince others that it exists, you need to provide clear, irrefutable, evidence that is sufficiently detailed to allow for scientific testing of your premise. Rational belief is not something we can choose to believe. It must be discovered from clear evidence that can be validated by the Scientific Method. Any other belief is irrational, and almost certainly false. ",

People walk around in every day life with black magic upon them always wondering why. Do you think they believe it's black magic or even the thought crosses their mind. No If your spiritual an listen to your intuition an guides you will know but many just walk life, with no spiritual knowledge. They may even go to church, believe an be faithful to God, but that doesn't mean their spiritual.. These questions your asking are a cry for attention an lack of knowledge.. Science has no interest in black magic.. Sorry kiddo ",

Science does not concern itself with the supernatural. At all. Science only examines and uses natural explanation of natural phenomena. Now if supernatural claimants contend that something in the natural world can be controlled or demonstrated in some other fashion, some of its claims can be examined. So if you claim that you can control magic and cause something to occur in the natural world, we can test that claim in the same way that ESP claims are tested, requesting you demonstrate your ability. So in that way such claims can indeed be debunked. Science does not examine the existence of the supernatural in an abstract way, only contentions that the supernatural has repeatable effects on the natural world that humans can demonstrate. ",
