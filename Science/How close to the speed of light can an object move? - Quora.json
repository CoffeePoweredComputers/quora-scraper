Oh my god, you\u2019ve not heard of the OMG particle!? \u201cThe Oh-My-God particle was the highest-energy cosmic ray detected so far (as of 2020), by the Fly's Eye detector in Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, US, on 15 October 1991. Its energy was estimated as [math](3.2\u00b10.9)\u00d710^{20}[/math] eV, or 51 J. This is 20 million times more energetic than the highest energy measured in electromagnetic radiation emitted by an extragalactic object and [math]10^{20}[/math] (100 quintillion) times the photon energy of visible light, equivalent to a 142-gram (5 oz) baseball travelling at about 26 m/s (94 km/h; 58 mph). Assuming it was a proton, this particle traveled at 99.99999999999999999999951% of the speed of light, its Lorentz factor was [math]3.2\u00d710^{11}[/math] and its rapidity was 27.1 . At this speed, if a photon were travelling with the particle, it would take over 215,000 years for the photon to gain a 1 cm lead as seen in Earth's reference frame.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "A material particle cannot travel at the speed of light; but how close can it get? A very good question but seldom, if ever, articulated. The velocity a particle can attain is dependent on the value of the force that\u2019s driving it. A particle would need an infinite force to accelerate it to the speed of light. Photons, however, can travel at the speed of light. Quantum-physics allows us to represent particle dynamics in terms of the Planck-Constant \u2018h\u2019. But when the compounded values of particle momentum and position become equal to the value of \u2018h\u2019, physics can no longer explain how a material particle behaves. This suggests that the Planck-constant may have something to do with the limiting value for particle velocity. At velocities approaching that of light, a particle\u2019s wave-function may have simultaneous, multiple values of particle-momentum that can exist at the same instant in time. As particle velocity increases, values of momentum have qualities that can represent both a material particle and a photon. At a velocity near the speed of light, particle energy can be expressed entirely in terms of its relativistic-momentum \u2018h/\u03bb\u2019, as if it were a photon. In other words, a material particle becomes a photon with the same energy as its parent particle. This transition may be represented by the following\u2026 material-particle\u2192mv\u00b2/2\u2192pv/2\u2192p(c-\u03b4v)\u2192pc\u2192(h/\u03bb)c\u2192photon. CONCLUSION: It may be possible to arrive at a maximum value for a material particle by assuming planck-values for energy and momentum in the equation E=p(c-\u03b4v). ",
