            "answer_text": "The question contains the answer (partially). The soap liquid is heavier than air. Even if we assume the density of air inside the bubble is same as the air outside, the bubble will be heavier than air of same volume because some part of it is soap. But, the density of the air inside the bubble is more than the air outside. This is because the surface tension of the soap bubble tries to squeeze it into smaller volume till the air pressure inside the air equalizes it. So even the air inside the soap bubble has more weight than the outside air of same volume. ",
