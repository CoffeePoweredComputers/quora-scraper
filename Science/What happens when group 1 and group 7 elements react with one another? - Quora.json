            "answer_text": "What happens when group 1 and group 7 elements react with one another? Not much. Group 1 elements are hydrogen (usually with an asterisk because it also has properties of group 17), lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium\u2014also known as the alkali metals. Group 7 elements are manganese, technetium, rhenium, and bohrium\u2014part of what is known as the transition metals. Metals just are not reactive with each other. Perhaps there is a typographical error in the question and Group 17 (elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine, and tennessine) were intended instead of Group 7. If that is the case, a quite different answer comes into play. Then you have the Group 1 elements, which are the ones most apt to give up an electron, with the Group 17 elements, which are the ones most apt to receive (more like take) an electron. The difference is so great, that the reaction can be explosive, and compounds with ionic bonding result (most extreme with CsF). ",

            "answer_text": "There will be a vigorous, if not explosive, reaction. Group I metals tend to have low electronegativity, meaning they stuggle to hold onto elections in a bond. Group VII elements have very high electronegativity, meaning they can pull over electrons in a bond very easily. When elements with large differences in electronegativity react, the group VII element will violently \u2018rob\u2019 the group I element of its electron. Plenty of energy will be released, resulting in a vigorous reaction. This is why when making compounds like LiF, we dissolve Li2CO3 in HF rather than react the two elements directly together. ",
