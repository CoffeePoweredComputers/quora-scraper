            "answer_text": "It is hard to get much on exoplanets, and what has been learned about most of them is very little. Of the two most successful search techniques, the radial-velocity method gives lower limits on their masses, while the transit method gives their radii. But if one can observe both transits and radial velocity, then one gets a radius and a mass. Likewise, Transit Timing Variations in a multiplanet system can make possible estimates of the planets\u2019 masses from the planets pulling on each other. But if one has both, one can find an average density. But one has to be careful, since planets\u2019 interiors will be compressed enough for their densities to noticeably rise. For instance, if that did not happen tot he Earth, its density would be 4 g/cm^3 instead of its actual 5.5 g/cm^3. www.astrozeng.com has some calculations for these compositions: iron, rock-iron, rock, water-rock, water, H/He. But if a planet is composed of water, rock, and iron, then an average-density value will underdetermine those fractions. One won\u2019t be able to tell whether or not a rock-iron planet also has a super ocean of water. ",

            "answer_text": "They are able to determine the composition of other worlds with the help of special and specific lenses and filters used in the scopes and cameras they use in their planetary investigations. Depending on the type of light and radiation the planet emits, scientists can narrow the long list of known elements down to just a few possibilities. Then, using other special lenses and filters, they can pinpoint the planet\u2019s most common and abundant element. This process will continue until they have a good idea of what most of that planets elements are, and the approximate percentage of each. ",
