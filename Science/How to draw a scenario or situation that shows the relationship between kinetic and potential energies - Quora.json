            "answer_text": "The classic example is of a pendulum. At the start of the swing, it has gravitational potential - as it speeds up it converts potential into kinetic - and as it crosses the center of the swing, starts to convert kinetic back into potential. Over and over again. In a frictionless setup - the interplay between kinetic and potential is continual and perpetual. ",
