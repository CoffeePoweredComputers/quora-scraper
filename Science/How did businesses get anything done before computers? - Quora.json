            "answer_text": "There\u2019s lots of answers depending on what business you are talking about. I\u2019ll talk about retail banking in 1980 when I was a teller. First of all, banks opened at 10am and closed at 3pm, and they were never open on the weekend. If you needed cash only a very few banks had ATMs and there were no ATM networks to speak of. The protocols for Cirrus and the others had yet to be invented and adopted. Also, if you traveled, there would be no banks in say Las Vegas that were the same as your banks in California. No banks were licensed to do business across state lines. So you really needed a credit card, and they were hard to come by. Most people used travelers checks. So banking was slower and geographically limited and it meant a great deal if you had a credit card or American Express card. There was no Discover. There were no debit cards that were acceptable outside of your bank\u2019s ATM network, and bank ATM networks went bank by bank (until around 1986 or so). So the idea of using a bank card at a supermarket was ridiculous. To get a credit card for a gas station or a department store was a huge privilege. There weren\u2019t many general purpose credit cards. Nobody had automatic overdraft protection. If you bounced a check, the branch manager at your bank would get a greenbar report of all of the overdraft checks and he would approve or deny an overdraft according to his familiarity with your account and business. Ordinary checks written say to your supermarket could take several days to clear. This was called float. It was relatively easy to float a check - so you\u2019d write a check on Monday and you could be reasonably certain it wouldn\u2019t hit your bank until Thursday or Friday. And of course there was no banking on the weekend, so you could easily float a check over the weekend. There was no bank by phone, so if you didn\u2019t know how to balance your checkbook you couldn\u2019t just go to a phone booth and dial your bank. You had to find a branch office near where you were and wait in line for a teller, and a teller would tell you your balance. If you were lucky, they could tell you which of your checks cleared and were paid. You wouldn\u2019t know how your stocks were doing unless you read the paper (the WSJ of course) on a daily basis. Interday trading was unheard of. You had to call your broker and hope he would take your call. But I digress. Deposits also took a long time to clear, so you could deposit a check on Monday and it wouldn\u2019t clear until Wednesday or Thursday. If it was drawn on a bank from out of state, they might even put a 2 day hold on it or give you partial credit. Very few tellers had cash counting machines and they were unreliable. So cash deposits were counted by hand, twice. There was a world of bookkeepers, clerks, typists, stenographers, secretaries and receptionists who handled the bureaucracy of every business. So if you had sloppy handwriting, you couldn\u2019t get an entry level white collar job, period. I ended up at the bank because I got one question wrong on an accounting test for the Beverly Hills equivalent of WeWork in 1980. My girlfriend got a job as a receptionist (lowest on the totem pole, you had to be cute and have a good telephone voice). BTW, there was no voicemail, no email, no fax. You had messengers, couriers and other schleping bagboys delivering telegrams and such. There was no encryption. People had to be trusted. In other words, altogether things were slower and people had to be trusted more. ",

            "answer_text": "You do realize that regardless of the actual age of the earth, this particular manifestation of HUMAN LIFE dates back some 6000 years and OMG 5950 of those years was completely without computers. Just thing ALL THE 7 WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD WERE ALL COMPUTERLESS. The Great Babylon, the Great Egypt, Greece, and Rome\u2026.all without a computer. The Great Pyramid at Giza. Machu Pichu. Sacsayhuaman and Cusco. ALL DONE WITHOUT COMPUTERS. Even the mass mega structure of Noahs ark was designed, planned, and built without a computer. DO YOU KNOW HOW THE WORLD SURVIVED WITH COMPUTERS? PEOPLE ACTUALLY USED THEIR BRAINS INSTEAD. We built and created far more advanced cultures by that. Ones that still have remains among us 5000 years later. What will remain of this modern computer culture 5000 years from now? BASICALLY NOTHING. ",
