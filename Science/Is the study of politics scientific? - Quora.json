            "answer_text": "People have stated that math and science are \u201chard\u201d disciplines, and political science doesn't qualify. Which is nonsense. I believe that political science is the same as any hard algorithm applied to the behavior of individuals in a system, and it makes the same mistakes. Even computer code is affected by free radicals in the system. We try to write the code so that no mistakes slip through, and it's impossible. The computer only does what it does, but we fail to communicate with it properly. Likewise, even a perfect system can be shattered by the human beliefs or reactions of the people who exist, there, at that time. Political Science is the study of what happens, why it happens, and how we can avoid, in future, making the same mistakes we did historically while also promoting the things we did right, and figuring out how to hold both balls in the air. For example, we know that people react to motivation, not punishment. It's not enough to say \u201cAdolf Hitler was an evil man\u201d\u2026.we have to ask how he motivated people to follow him. The answer is, he made promises. He offered them free cars, vacations, the chance to subjugate an entire race and take all of their stuff, and an improved economy at a time when Germany was so poor that people were using money as wallpaper. There actually are mathematical algorithms for the situations that led to that level of worldwide poverty. Governments now understand, for example, the amount of money you can print before the commodity loses value. In political science there's plenty of math: statistics, algorithms\u2026.most programs won't accept you unless you have 12th grade calculus at a minimum. ",

However, it\u2019s a pretty interesting field to study cause it involves other fields like economics, psychology, geopolitics, history\u2026etc. ",
