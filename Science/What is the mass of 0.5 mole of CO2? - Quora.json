            "answer_text": "This is a basic stoichiometric calculation. All you have to remember is the equation for moles n=m/M This equation tells you that in order to convert a substance into its moles you need to divide its mass over is molar mass(you can calculate molar mass by using the atomic mass of each atom adding it together and multiplying by the # of atoms). In this case the question requires that you find mass. So solve the following using the Grass method Your Givens are: n=0.5 mol, Mc (molar mass of carbon from periodic table)= 12.01 g/mol, Mo= 16 g/mol. Required: m=? Analyze: n=m/M (rearrange) m= nM Solve: First solve for the total molar mass Mco2= (12.01g/mol) + 2(16.00g/mol)= 44.01 g/mol Then plug into the equation: (0.5 mol)(44.01g/mol)=22.005 g Finally write a statement and make sure your answer has the correct significant digits. In this case there is only one significant digit. 2 x 10^2 g is the mass of 0.5 moles of CO2. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "mole basically means the amount or mass of substance which contains the same units that 12 g of a C-12 atom has. now the molecular mass of carbon -12 atom in grams is 12 g. Thus 12g carbon is equivalent to 1 mole of carbon. mole thus can be mathematically defined as mole = given weight / molecular weight now replace carbon by CO2 : molecular weight of CO2 is (12 + (2*16)) = 44g putting it into formula : 0.5 = weight / 44 weight = 0.5 * 44 weight = 22g thus the answer is 22g. hope this helps :) ",
