            "answer_text": "Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated ozone depleting substances (ODS) are mainly responsible for man-made chemical ozone depletion. The total amount of effective halogens (chlorine and bromine) in the stratosphere can be calculated and are known as the equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC). Ozone depletion - Wikipedia In other regions, the ozone layer has deteriorated by about 20 percent. About 90 percent of CFCs currently in the atmosphere were emitted by industrialized countries in the Northern Hemisphere, including the United States and Europe. The severe depletion of the Antarctic ozone layerknown as the \u201cozone hole\u201d occurs because of the special atmospheric and chemical conditions that exist there and nowhere else on the globe. The very low winter temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere cause polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) to form. Since the ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet light from the sun, it is suspected that a variety of consequences such as increases in sunburn, skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations in the oceans may result from the increased UV exposure if there was no ozone layer in the atmosphere!

            "answer_text": "It's not, not so much any more.  Chemically-stable gases that are released at ground level eventually find their way to the stratosphere, where there is a high flux of ultraviolet solar radiation. If the compound is susceptible to being broken up by UV light, it is broken up there. Chlorofluorocarbons - which used to be used as refrigerants and spray can propellants - are chemically quite stable. When they reach the stratosphere, they are decomposed by UV light into chlorine atoms. Chlorine atoms catalyze the conversion of ozone into O2, with an efficiency of about a million ozone molecules per chlorine atom.  Ozone holes appear preferentially over the polar regions because the decomposition reaction happens more quickly on the surface of ice crystals, and polar regions have more ice clouds. But chlorofluorocarbons are, to the best of my knowledge, not being produced any more; they were banned by the Montreal Protocol. Current refrigerants, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, have C-H bonds that are more susceptible to (for example) bacterial decomposition in the troposphere, so they don't survive to reach the stratosphere.Page on epa.gov ",
