What a metal detector can do is lead you to indicator minerals, which are used by prospectors. Prospectors follow the indicator trail back to gold or the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. ",

A metal detector works by detecting aberrations in the electromagnetic field, generated by the search coil. a diamond, unset, will not disturb that field any more than a common rock would. ",
