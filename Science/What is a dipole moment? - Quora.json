            "answer_text": "Generally it is defined as the \u201cproduct of the magnitude of the charges and the distance between them. Its direction is always from negative to positive end and it's unit is Debye. Dipole moment may refer to: 1-Electric dipole moment, the measure of the electrical polarity of a system of charges2-Transition dipole moment, the electrical dipole moment in quantum mechanics3-Molecular dipole moment, the electric dipole moment of a molecule.4-Bond dipole moment, the measure of polarity of a chemical bond5-Electron electric dipole moment, the measure of the charge distribution within an electron6-Magnetic dipole moment, the measure of the magnetic polarity of a system of charges7-Electron magnetic moment8-Nuclear magnetic moment, the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus DETAILS\u2014 1-The electric dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges within a system, that is, a measure of the system's overall polarity. The SI units for electric dipole moment are coulomb-meter (C\u00b7m); however, the most common unit is the debye (D). 2-The transition dipole moment or transition moment, usually denoted dnm for a transition between an initial state, {m} and a final state, {n}, is the electric dipole moment associated with the transition between the two states. In general the transition dipole moment is a complex vector quantity that includes the phase factors associated with the two states. Its direction gives the polarization of the transition, which determines how the system will interact with an electromagnetic wave of a given polarization, while the square of the magnitude gives the strength of the interaction due to the distribution of charge within the system. The SI unit of the transition dipole moment is the Coulomb-meter (Cm); a more conveniently sized unit is the Debye (D). 3-In electromagnetism, there are two kinds of dipoles: An electric dipole is a separation of positive and negative charges. The simplest example of this is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign, separated by some (usually small) distance. A permanent electric dipole is called an electret.A magnetic dipole is a closed circulation of electric current. A simple example of this is a single loop of wire with some constant current through it. 4\u2013The bond dipole moment uses the idea of electric dipole moment to measure the polarity of a chemical bond within a molecule. It occurs whenever there is a separation of positive and negative charges. The bond dipole \u03bc is given by: Mu=delta.d The bond dipole is modeled as +\u03b4 \u2014 \u03b4- with a distance d between the partial charges +\u03b4 and \u03b4-. It is a vector, parallel to the bond axis, pointing from minus to plus, as is conventional for electric dipole moment vectors. (Some chemists draw the vector pointing from plus to minus, but only in situations where the direction is important.)This vector can be physically interpreted as the movement undergone by electrons when the two atoms are placed a distance d apart and allowed to interact, the electrons will move from their free state positions to be localised more around the more electronegative atom. 5\u2013The electron electric dipole moment (EDM) de is an intrinsic property of an electron such that the potential energy is linearly related to the strength of the electric field: U=de.EThe electron's EDM must be collinear with the direction of the electron's magnetic moment (spin). Within the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, such a dipole is predicted to be non-zero but very small, at most 10\u221238 e\u00b7cm, where e stands for the elementary charge. The existence of a non-zero electron electric dipole moment would imply a violation of both parity invariance and time reversal invariance.In the Standard Model, the electron EDM arises from the CP-violating components of the CKM matrix. The moment is very small because the CP violation involves quarks, not electrons directly, so it can only arise by quantum processes where virtual quarks are created, interact with the electron, and then are annihilated. More precisely, a non-zero EDM does not arise until the level of four-loop Feynman diagrams and higher.An additional, larger EDM (around 10\u221233 e\u00b7cm) is possible in the standard model if neutrinos are majorana particles. 6-The magnetic moment is a quantity that represents the magnetic strength and orientation of a magnet or other object that produces a magnetic field. Examples of objects that have magnetic moments include: loops of electric current (such as electromagnets), permanent magnets, elementary particles (such as electrons), various molecules, and many astronomical objects (such as many planets, some moons, stars, etc). More precisely, the term magnetic moment normally refers to a system's magnetic dipole moment the component of the magnetic moment that can be represented by an equivalent magnetic dipole: a magnetic north and south pole separated by a very small distance. The magnetic dipole component is sufficient for small enough magnets or for large enough distances. Higher order terms (such as the magnetic quadrupole moment) may be needed in addition to the dipole moment for extended objects. The magnetic dipole moment of an object is readily defined in terms of the torque that object experiences in a given magnetic field. The same applied magnetic field creates larger torques on objects with larger magnetic moments. The strength (and direction) of this torque depends not only on the magnitude of the magnetic moment but also on its orientation relative to the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic moment may be considered, therefore, to be a vector. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of the magnet (inside the magnet). The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is proportional to its magnetic dipole moment. The dipole component of an object's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object. 7\u2013In atomic physics, the electron magnetic moment, or more specifically the electron magnetic dipole moment, is the magnetic moment of an electron caused by its intrinsic properties of spin and electric charge. The value of the electron magnetic moment is approximately \u22129.284764\u00d710\u221224 J/T. The electron magnetic moment has been measured to an accuracy of 7.6 parts in 1013 8-The nuclear magnetic moment is the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and arises from the spin of the protons and neutrons. It is mainly a magnetic dipole moment; the quadrupole moment does cause some small shifts in the hyperfine structure as well. All nuclei that have nonzero spin also possess a nonzero magnetic moment and vice versa, although the connection between the two quantities is not straightforward or easy to calculate. The nuclear magnetic moment varies from isotope to isotope of an element. For a nucleus of which the numbers of protons and of neutrons are both even in its ground state (i.e. lowest energy state), the nuclear spin and magnetic moment are both always zero. In cases with odd numbers of either or both protons and neutrons, the nucleus often has nonzero spin and magnetic moment. The nuclear magnetic moment is not sum of nucleon magnetic moments, this property being assigned to the tensorial character of the nuclear force, such as in the case of the most simple nucleus where both proton and neutron appear, namely deuterium nucleus, deuteron.

            "answer_text": "This question is more complicated than it looks. There are two ways to define a dipole moment: 1. As a function of a field sourceSuppose we have a collection of particles numbered 1, 2, ..., N. Each particle has a \"charge\" [math]q_i[/math]. Then we can define the dipole moment as [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\mathbf{d} = \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i \\mathbf{r}_i \\end{equation*}[/math] That is, multiply each particle's charge by its position vector, and sum on all particles. For a continuous distribution of matter, the sum can be replaced by an integral over space where instead of charge we use charge density, [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\mathbf{d} = \\int \\mathbf{r} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} \\end{equation*}[/math] If the charge or charge density is the electric charge or charge density, the resulting quantity is called the electric dipole moment. There is also a mass dipole moment, where the \"charge\" is mass and \"charge density\" is mass density. In general the value of the dipole moment will depend on the choice of origin. However, in the special case in which total charge vanishes, the dipole moment is independent of origin. The simplest example of an electric dipole is two oppositely charged particles (charge [math]\\pm q[/math]) separated by some distance [math]d[/math]. Since total charge vanishes, the dipole moment is independent of origin, and it is easy to see that its magnitude is [math]qd[/math], and that it is directed along the vector from the negative charge to the positive charge. Now I've defined the dipole moment but I haven't explained its significance. The dipole moment shows up in something called the multipole expansion. I won't explain in detail how this works, but basically it's a way to write a potential with [math]1/r[/math] dependence as a series in powers of [math]1/r[/math]. If we have a collection of particles with charges [math]q_i[/math] and positions [math]\\mathbf{r}'_i[/math], then [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\phi = \\frac{k}{r}\\left[\\sum_i q_i\\right] + \\frac{k}{r^2} \\left[\\sum_i q_i r'_{ij}\\right] \\hat{r}_j + \\frac{k}{2r^3} \\left[\\sum_i q_i(3 r'_{ij} r'_{ik} - \\delta_{jk} r'_i{}^2)\\right] \\hat{r}_j \\hat{r}_k + \\ldots \\end{equation*}[/math] Note that [math]r'_{ij}[/math] denotes the jth coordinate of the position of the ith particle. Repeated indices other than i are summed over. We can also write this in integral form for a continuous matter distribution: [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\phi = \\frac{k}{r}\\left[\\int \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\\right] + \\frac{k}{r^2} \\left[\\int \\rho r'_j \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\\right] \\hat{r}_j + \\frac{k}{2r^3} \\left[\\int \\rho (3 r'_j r'_k - \\delta_{jk} r^{\\prime 2}) \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}'\\right] \\hat{r}_j \\hat{r}_k + \\ldots \\end{equation*}[/math] This is the multipole expansion. The first bracketed expression is just the total charge, also called the monopole moment. The term that contains it has [math]1/r[/math] dependence and is the leading-order term. So this tells you that far away from a source, the source looks like a point whose charge is the total charge of the source. The second bracketed expression is recognizable as the dipole moment, which was previously defined. The dipole term contributes to the potential too, but it falls off as [math]1/r^2[/math], so will in general be negligible far away from the source unless the monopole moment vanishes. If the monopole moment vanishes, the dipole term will be the leading-order term. For a \"point dipole\", then, consisting of two equally and oppositely charged particles very close together, we have [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\phi \\approx \\frac{k}{r^2} \\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\end{equation*}[/math] So in general the dipole moment [math]\\mathbf{d}[/math], a property of a charge distribution, describes the [math]1/r^2[/math] dependence of the potential (and hence [math]1/r^3[/math] dependence of the field). The magnitude of the dipole moment determines the strength of the dipole part of the field, and the direction enters into the equation through the dot product. For example, if the dipole is located at the origin and oriented along the z-axis, then if you approach along the xy plane, you see no potential. But if you approach along the z-axis, you see a potential that varies as [math]1/r^2[/math]. The next bracketed expression [math]\\int \\rho (3 r'_j r'_k - \\delta_{jk} r^{\\prime 2})[/math] is the traceless quadrupole moment. It's responsible for a potential that falls off as [math]1/r^3[/math], and is significant when the dipole moment vanishes as well as the monopole moment. And so on. I won't go into too much detail here. We can expand the gravitational field in the same way; to calculate the Newtonian gravitational potential, just use the mass of each particle as its charge in the above formulae. So you can compute the mass monopole (total mass), mass dipole, mass quadrupole, and so on. (Also, don't forget to use [math]G[/math] for the constant [math]k[/math].) There is also a magnetic dipole moment. This is a bit more subtle than it seems. Magnetically charged particles are not known to exist in nature. Magnetic fields as we know them are produced by electric currents. That is, the source of the magnetic vector potential [math]\\mathbf{A}[/math] is the current density [math]\\mathbf{J}[/math]. Now, the magnetic vector potential depends on each component of the current density separately in the same way in which the electric scalar potential depends on the charge density and the Newtonian gravitational potential depends on the mass density: [math]\\begin{align*} \\phi &= k_E \\int \\frac{\\rho}{\\|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'\\|} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}' \\\\ A_i &= k_M \\int \\frac{J_i}{\\|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'\\|} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}' \\end{align*}[/math] where [math]k_E = 1/(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)[/math] and [math]k_M = \\mu_0/(4\\pi)[/math] in SI units. So we can immediately write down the multipole expansion for a given component of the magnetic vector potential, by analogy. [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} A_i = \\frac{k}{r} \\left[\\int J_i \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\\right] + \\frac{k}{r^2} \\left[\\int J_i r'_j \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}'\\right] \\hat{r}_j + \\frac{k}{2r^3} \\left[\\int J_i (3r'_j r'_k - \\delta_{jk} r'^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\\right] \\hat{r}_j \\hat{r}_k + \\ldots \\end{equation*}[/math] So we see that the leading-order contribution to the magnetic vector potential is given by [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\mathbf{A} \\approx \\frac{k}{r} \\int \\mathbf{J} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}' \\end{equation*}[/math] This is the monopole term; the monopole moment is just the total current. The total current always vanishes for a static current distribution, because otherwise there would be a net movement of charge over time. Thus, not only are there no magnetic monopoles, but there is also no way to set up a static current distribution that produces a [math]1/r[/math] magnetic vector potential. The magnetic vector potential always falls off as [math]1/r^2[/math] or faster for a static current distribution. Now, consider the dipole term: [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} A_i \\approx \\frac{k}{r^2} \\left[\\int J_i r'_j \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\\right] \\hat{r}_j \\end{equation*}[/math] The bracketed object is a second-rank tensor; it has two free indices: i and j. Contracting it with the unit vector [math]\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}[/math] gives a vector, the magnetic vector potential on the left side. This second-rank tensor is the magnetic dipole moment. Likewise, the magnetic quadrupole moment is a third-rank tensor which is contracted with two unit radial vectors to give a resulting vector, the quadrupole contribution to the magnetic vector potential, and so on. However, the magnetic dipole moment is usually thought of as a vector. How can this be, if it's a second-rank tensor? Hodge duality strikes again! For a static current distribution, consider for fixed i, j the quantity [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} I = \\int r'_i r'_j \\rho(\\mathbf{r}') \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}' \\end{equation*}[/math] This quantity should be constant in time since the charge distribution is assumed to remain constant in time. Differentiate this, use the continuity equation to replace [math]\\partial \\rho/\\partial t[/math] by [math]-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}[/math], integrate by parts, and discard the surface term at infinity. You will obtain the result that [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\int r'_i J_j + r'_j J_i \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}' = 0 \\end{equation*}[/math] Therefore the magnetic dipole moment tensor is antisymmetric. Rewrite the dipole term by explicitly antisymmetrizing: [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} A_i \\approx \\frac{k}{2r^2} \\left[\\int J_i r'_j - J_j r'_i \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\\right] \\hat{r}_j \\end{equation*}[/math] We can rewrite [math]J_i r'_j - J_j r'_i[/math] as [math]-\\epsilon_{ijk} \\epsilon_{lmk} r'_l J_m[/math] using the contracted epsilon identity. Recognizing the cross product, [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} J_i r'_j - J_j r'_i = -\\epsilon_{ijk} (\\mathbf{r}' \\times \\mathbf{J})_k \\end{equation*}[/math] Define the magnetic dipole moment pseudovector, [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\boldsymbol \\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\mathbf{r}' \\times \\mathbf{J} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}' \\end{equation*}[/math] Then [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} A_i \\approx \\frac{k}{r^2} [-\\epsilon_{ijk} \\mu_k] \\hat{r}_j = \\frac{k}{r^2} \\epsilon_{ikj} \\mu_k \\hat{r}_j = \\frac{k}{r^2} (\\boldsymbol\\mu \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})_i \\end{equation*}[/math] so in conclusion [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\mathbf{A} \\approx \\frac{k}{r^2} \\boldsymbol\\mu \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\end{equation*}[/math] The pseudovector [math]\\boldsymbol\\mu[/math] is what we usually think of as the magnetic dipole moment, but it is important to bear in mind that it is just a shorthand for the second-rank tensor originally derived from the multipole expansion. The magnetic dipole moment pseudovector has strange-looking definition with the cross product. The original tensor falls out of the multipole expansion in a straightforward way, in analogy to the electric and mass dipole moments. 2. As a parameter determining the response of a body to an external field As always, with field theories, there are two parts to the game. You've got to know how sources generate fields, and you've also got to know how fields influence test particles and test bodies. The energy of an extended charged body in an external electric field is [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} H = \\int \\rho \\phi \\, d^3 \\mathbf{r} \\end{equation*}[/math] We can perform a multipole expansion of this so-called interaction Hamiltonian by expanding the potential in a Taylor series,[math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} \\phi = \\phi(0) + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x_i}\\bigg|_0 r_i + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} \\bigg|_0 r_i r_j + \\ldots \\end{equation*}[/math] Note that [math]\\partial \\phi/\\partial x_i = -E_i[/math] and [math]\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = -\\partial E_i/\\partial x_j[/math], so [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} H = \\phi(0) \\left[\\int \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}\\right] - E_i(0) \\left[\\int r_i \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}\\right]  - \\frac{1}{2} \\partial_i E_j(0) \\left[\\int r_i r_j \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r}\\right] + \\ldots \\end{equation*}[/math] Once again we recognize the monopole and dipole moments in brackets. The third bracketed term is the primitive quadrupole moment. (*) It is easy to see how to extend this to higher powers in [math]r[/math]. So if we just write out the first two terms, [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} H \\approx q\\phi(0) - \\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}(0) \\end{equation*}[/math] with [math]q[/math] the total charge, and [math]\\mathbf{d}[/math] the dipole moment. So we see that the potential energy is minimized when the dipole moment lines up with the external electric field. For a current distribution in a magnetic field we can likewise write down the Hamiltonian [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} H = \\int \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{J} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r} \\end{equation*}[/math] and on performing the Taylor expansion we obtain [math]\\begin{align*} H &= \\int A_i(0) J_i + \\partial_i A_j(0) r_i J_j + \\ldots \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r} \\\\ &= A_i(0) \\int J_i \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r} + \\partial_i A_j(0) \\int r_i J_j \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r} + \\ldots \\end{align*}[/math] As stated previously, the first term vanishes. For the second term, we know that the object [math]\\int r_i J_j[/math], the magnetic dipole moment tensor, is antisymmetric. Therefore its contraction with the tensor [math]\\partial_i A_j(0)[/math] is determined by the antisymmetric part of the latter. [math]\\begin{align*} H &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_i A_j(0) - \\partial_j A_i(0)) \\int r_i J_j \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r} + \\ldots \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{4}(\\partial_i A_j(0) - \\partial_j A_i(0)) \\int r_i J_j - r_j J_i \\, \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} + \\ldots \\end{align*}[/math] But then [math](J_i r_j - J_j r_i) \\hat{r}_j = -2\\epsilon_{ijk} \\mu_k[/math], so [math]\\begin{align*} H &= -\\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_{ijk} (\\partial_i A_j(0) - \\partial_j A_i(0)) \\mu_k \\\\ &= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\epsilon_{kij} \\partial_i A_j(0) - \\epsilon_{kij} \\partial_j A_i(0)) \\mu_k \\\\ &= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\epsilon_{kij} \\partial_i A_j(0) - \\epsilon_{kji} \\partial_i A_j(0)) \\mu_k \\\\ &= -\\epsilon_{kij} \\partial_i A_j(0) \\mu_k \\\\ &= -(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A})_k \\mu_k \\\\ &= -\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\boldsymbol\\mu \\end{align*}[/math] So we get the remarkable result that just as an electric dipole has a potential energy [math]-\\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}[/math] in an electric field, a magnetic dipole has a potential energy [math]-\\boldsymbol\\mu \\cdot \\mathbf{B}[/math] in a magnetic field. The \"passive\" dipole moment defined in this way, as a coefficient in the multipole expansion of the Hamiltonian, is identical to the \"active\" dipole moment defined in the previous section. However, passive dipole moments are sometimes easier to observe. For example, it's awfully hard to measure the magnetic field of a single electron (I'm not sure whether it's been done), but it's easy to observe the interaction energy of an electron with a magnetic field: just set up an ensemble and measure the fraction of the population with spin parallel vs. spin antiparallel to the field; then some basic statistical mechanics tells you the energy difference. In fact, we definitely cannot regard the electron as consisting of classical currents, but we can still define the electron's magnetic dipole moment \"passively\": it is precisely the vector [math]\\boldsymbol\\mu[/math] such that [math]\\begin{equation*} \\tag*{} H = -\\boldsymbol\\mu \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\end{equation*}[/math] is true. The electron also has an electric dipole moment, which is defined analogously. (It is too small to measure by any currently known experimental technique, however.) (*) This can also be replaced by 1/3 of the traceless quadrupole moment. The extra term in the latter makes no difference to the final result, assuming the external electric field satisfies the free space Maxwell's equations ([math]\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0[/math]). Addendum I just noticed this question is tagged as chemistry. The above is written in a very physics-heavy way, so it might not be helpful to someone studying chemistry. Most molecules encountered in chemistry do not have a permanent magnetic dipole moment. This is because, in almost all stable compounds studied by chemists, all electrons are paired, and two paired electrons have opposite spins (hence opposite magnetic dipole moments). A molecule with unpaired electrons will in general have a permanent magnetic dipole moment. A classic example is the oxygen molecule. Using MO theory we can predict that the most stable state of dioxygen is a diradical, with two unpaired electrons; this cannot be predicted from the Lewis structure. The two unpaired electrons' magnetic moments tend to line up with an applied magnetic field, resulting in net magnetization of the bulk substance and paramagnetism. Here is a picture that's worth 1000 words:  Note that liquid nitrogen would not stick between the poles of a magnet, because it has no unpaired electrons. On the other hand, many molecules have permanent electric dipole moments (note however that very few of these are capable of carrying a net electric polarization in the bulk substance in the absence of an external electric field). Such molecules are said to be polar. You don't need to know the exact distribution of charges in a molecule in order to predict whether or not the molecule will be polar. You can approximate it by considering the polarity of each bond. How's that? Well, imagine you have a system consisting of a number of dipoles. You can calculate the total dipole moment of the system by summing the dipole moments of the individual dipoles. (This is pretty obvious, since each individual dipole moment is the sum of [math]q_i \\mathbf{r}_i[/math] for two particles, and the total dipole moment is just the sum over all the particles in the system.) For a molecule, charge separation generally occurs as a consequence of a bond between two atoms of differing electronegativity (for example, O and H). When this happens, electron density is pulled from the less electronegative atom to the more electronegative atom, resulting in charge separation and hence a dipole moment that points along the internuclear axis. A rough approximation is that each polar bond in a molecule contributes independently to the net dipole moment of the molecule. The following diagram [source] is illustrative:  In the water molecule, there is positive charge density localized on each hydrogen atom because oxygen is more electronegative. Each O-H bond therefore has a dipole moment associated with it, which \"points\" to the O. (Chemists define the dipole moment with the opposite sign compared to physicists; the dipole moment in physics points toward positive charge.) The total dipole moment is the vector sum, which is nonzero because of the V shape of the molecule. The result is a permanent electric dipole moment for the water molecule. In the methyl fluoride molecule (middle), we can treat the three C-H bonds as though they are basically nonpolar, since C and H have similar electronegativities. The dominant contribution to the dipole moment comes from the C-F bond. There's only one such bond, so the total dipole moment is just the dipole moment resulting from that bond. On the right we have the linear CO2 molecule. Both C=O bonds have dipole moments since positive charge is localized on C and negative charge on O. However, the two dipole moments cancel because of the shape of the molecule, and CO2 is a nonpolar molecule overall. The carbon tetrafluoride molecule would also be nonpolar: the four C-F bonds' dipole moments would cancel. (You can check that summing the vectors from the centre of a regular tetrahedron to its vertices gives zero.) The electric dipole moment of a molecule contributes to the intermolecular forces in a substance. Two electric dipoles will in general be attracted to each other; in the appropriate orientation, the negative charge of one can interact with the positive charge of the other. However, I am told that despite what your high school chemistry teacher might have told you, dipole-dipole forces are in general weaker than London dispersion forces, and that in a pure substance, London dispersion forces are almost always the dominant intermolecular force. The electric dipole moment of a molecule also contributes to the dielectric constant of the bulk substance. If you would for example embed a positively charged dust particle in a drop of water, the dust particle's electric field would induce water molecules around it to rotate so that their electric dipole moments are parallel to the electric field (this minimizes the potential energy as we saw previously). The result is that the negative ends of the water molecules will be closest to the dust particle, and will partially cancel the field. In fact, in water at room temperature, the electric field around a charged particle will be reduced by a factor of about 78. This is why water is so effective at dissolving ionic compounds; two ions immersed in water only feel 1/78 of the attraction they would feel in vacuum. Nonpolar molecules are much less effective at \"screening\" fields in this way. ",
