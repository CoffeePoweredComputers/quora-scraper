            "answer_text": "You're assuming our government (and Big Oil) cares about the problems you bring up. They don't. They care about their bottom line. \"They\" being both Big Oil and the politicians they finance.  Traditional drilling is no longer sustainable. Fracking allows oil companies to pump hydrocarbons that were once thought unreachable. They will never care about climate change as long as the world continues to run on oil. And the world will continue to run on oil as long as the powers that be are funded by Big Oil.  Therein lies the problem to your question. ",
