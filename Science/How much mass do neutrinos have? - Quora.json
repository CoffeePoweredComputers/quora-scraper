            "answer_text": "As far as I know, they have none. Yes, I know people say neutrino oscillations mean the neutrino has a very small mass, but that\u2019s an assertion rather than a scientific fact. What is a scientific fact, is this: \u201capproximately two to three hours before the visible light from SN1987A reached Earth, a burst of neutrinos was observed at three separate neutrino observatories\u201d. SN1987A is a supernova that took place circa 168,000 light-years away. In the 168,000 years of travelling through space, the light didn\u2019t overtake the neutrinos. That surely tells us that neutrinos travel at the speed of light, and are massless. ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to current quantum theory, which applies a mysterious energy to the subatomic realm, ultrawave theory (UT) shows that all energy (heat is an exception) is really just momentum. As all particles including photons have mass, the neutrino then has the mass equal to a neutron minus a proton and electron, or 1.404E-30kg. In UT rest mass particles do not actually rest, they spin at light speed. When a pair of electrons bump together with their spins oriented opposite, they will combine to form a linear traveling double radius spin particle, the photon, or as having a spin-1 mass interaction. Photons have mass, they were just labeled wrong, because the early physicists could not bring themselves to imagine a speed of 8.9359E16 m/s when light was so fast and was only 3E8 m/s. Somehow they found it easier to imagine that non-locality was possible, that particles could be either wave or particle and not both at the same time, and that energy was a thing and different from mass but equivalent to it. Those unfortunate views have caused a myriad of problems for physics and have created such strange ideas as the multiverse, dark matter and dark energy, and quantum computing. If I had just a small fraction of what is spent on work that is completely unnecessary, I could do so much\u2026 ",
