            "answer_text": "Hydraulics use liquid (typically oil, but water sometimes) as a working fluid. Pneumatics use a gas (typically air) as the working fluid. Compressibility of working fluid - Because liquids are essentially incompressible, hydraulics can handle high loads quite stiffly. Also hydraulics are often used as a force multiplier, with a small diameter source piston and large diameter load piston, such as in a automobile jack or the brakes in your car. Pneumatics can be used this way, but are typically not, because the source stroke becomes a combination of moving the load and compressing the working fluid, making for a very long cumbersome stroke. Viscosity of working fluid - Because liquids are viscous they move through pipe and tubing relatively slowly compared to gasses. The viscous forces become dominant and have significant losses as moderate velocity. Therefore, hydraulics move relatively slowly and pneumatics can move pretty quickly. Pneumatics can also have a very controlled force (force proportional to pressure), regardless of stroke or load resistance. This feature is useful to avoid crushing, or to grip fragile items. Pneumatics are used in factory equipment (but are being replaced by electric actuators for maintenance and controlability) Hydraulics are typically used for high force, slow motion and where stiffness in position is necessary. Pneumatics are used for relatively lower forces, faster motion, and where stiffness is not necessary. Someone might argue that a pneumatic impact hammer or wrench generates high forces, but those peak forces come from a decelerating mass (hammer), not the pneumatic engine. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all Both pneumatics and hydraulic are applications of fluid power. Pneumatics uses an easily compressible gas such as air or a suitable pure gas while hydraulic uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil.t his is the main difference between pneumatic and hydraulics system other difference are Pneumatic system has generally low capacity of load moving than hydraulic systemThe leakage of oil or any liquid is happen in hydraulic where as this is not happen in pneumatic because of use of gas .In hydraulic system you need tank for reservoir of oil to draw oil to the system where as in pneumatic you can draw air from atmosphere.Application Pneumatic systems used extensively in industry are commonly powered by compressed air or compressed inert gases. A centrally located and electrically powered compressor powers cylinders, air motors, and other pneumatic devices. Pneumatics also has applications in dentistry, construction, mining, and other areas.Hydraulic systems are used widely in both industrial and mobile equipment. ... In motor vehicles, hydraulic are most commonly found in the application of brakes. The relatively small force exerted by the driver's foot on the pedal is transmitted through the fluid in a small piston.Pneumatic system is comparatively less efficient than hydraulic system.This are some of main difference between pneumatic and hydraulic system. I hope this helps . ",
