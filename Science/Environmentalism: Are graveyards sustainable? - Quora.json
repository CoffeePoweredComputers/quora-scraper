            "answer_text": "We need to look at this problem in three ways  1.The space problem2.The cost 3.Are we willing to change? No doubt the system of burial will need to change as more and more people get concentrated into large metropolitan and cosmopolitan cities,it is surely going to be hard to find suitable place for burying our loved ones,let alone sprawling graveyards. As we will approach a space crunch burial rates are surely going to skyrocket.When a few years back Mughal emperors had sprawling mausoleums made even before their death,now it has been reduced to just a few square metres of space.Well then they were emperors.The same would today be utterly insensitive and impractical when millions go homeless.Cemeteries which were formerly out of the cities have, in the course of time,remained within urban settlement areas and have become entangled with inhabited areas. These areas within and in the vicinity of urban areas constitute organic links connecting urban green areas and ecological corridors. These areas when taken up in all respects constitute an indispensable use for urban settlements. And the situation is only going to get worse. As it gets worse and the living jostle for space with the dead land rates for the same will go up,no matter how much we want that our dead have a sound sleep,reality and practicality is going to take over and we will need to find innovative and suitable ways which maintain a balance between economics and human emotion. Here is a comparison between burial rates in the US   This also includes labor and other costs but the trend is evident. Is burial sustainable? Well on the green side it still seems a better option then burning your dead on pyres as practiced in Hinduism which involves dead person being put on bed of wood and then putting it on fire.This method of releasing the soul from worldly ties involves use of nearly 300-400 kilograms of wood and also emits a large quantity of greenhouse gas.About 50 to 60 million trees are being consumed in the cremation sector every year in India alone.Does that seem green and sustainable.? So alternatives have been proposed like incinerators which are more efficient in heat utilization than the open air type.But oppositions remain as one is not able to do kapal kriya,which is the process of cracking open the burning skull with a stick to free the soul.Moreover in a country obsessed with mileage,its expensive so is naturally not fit for people with limited means.Pyres are evolving and slowly they will,if not out of environmental concern then commonsense. Alternatives to Burial: Tibetan Buddhist practice sky burial in which the corpse is left to be eaten up by vultures and other scavengers.This arose out of practicality as the Tibetan plateau is scarce in timber and burial is difficult because of terrain and permafrost. Similar ritual is performed by Zoroastrians what is known to most as Tower of Silence.The corpse is again left to be scavenged by vultures.    Vertical Burials:So as space comes at a premium,people have started exploring new avenues and from that has come the concept of vertical burial . Melbourne based company Upright Burials is offering this facility and they claim to minimize carbon footprint and obviously takes less space.A snaphsot from their website:   Churches in keralaHere churches have,keeping soaring land rated in mind have abolished superfluous tombstones and are contemplating switching to reusable graves.They have also done away with the practice of using non-biodegradable stuff like plastic flowers,polybags,leather shoes etc. So is burial sustainable?Yes.Definitely.Its greener than many other options.But will we see the same burial a few years hence.I doubt that.It needs to evolve.

            "answer_text": "In Seattle, WA graveyards/cemeteries are sustainable for atleast 50 years. Most cemeteries now offer or require families purchase double depth cemetery plots. This by itself will sustain urban cemeteries for a long time. Also, cemeteries now allow up to 8 sets of ashes interred in each cemetery space. As the cremation rate in ALL major cities skyrockets up. Cremation is the way of the future. Also, a large portion of cremation families choose to scatter the ashes.

Although it might seem offensive to some that people will one day walk on their graves, that's the way 'the cookie crumbles'. Not only is rebuilding on graveyards lawful in many places, it's also common in some religions to divert the practice of permanent burial for many reasons including environmental ones, even in Orthodox Christianity.

However we have cremation, if you worry that your decendants will morbidly or even with evil intent, go round the grave etc. Its actually quite calming for those that live on after. But can mean people that live far away will put, on those who live nearby e.g. to upkeep the grave when they arent doing bugger all themselves. I don't think that ballooning is right. But I do believe in disposing of the ashes in the sea or preferably lighting a fire on a raft at sea etc. The body has to be disposed of, would it be possible to do this in a power station?
