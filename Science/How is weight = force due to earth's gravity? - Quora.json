            "answer_text": "A few years ago I particpated in a discussion of weight ina Physics teachers\u2019 email forum. There was absolutely no agreement as to what was mewant by weight! One approach was to consider weight as a result of a measurement process. These people thought weight was equal to the reaction force on a surface eg the surface could be a top pan balance. Others thought Weight = mg. Of course g varies over the earths surface but g is also affected by the positions of the moon and sun. Mostly these people felt that strictly the value for g should take into account the effect of other gravitational fields like those of the sun and moon. The reaction force approach also requires other factors to be considered like upthrust from the atmosphere. Is the weight of a Helium balloon = mg? Another issue raised was the effect of the earth\u2019s rotation and centripetal forces. I suspect the answer is that weight is not a defined term other than by the person using the word. As an aside - I attended a very interesting talk about the Trinity College Clock (cambridge) by Hugh Hunt. By careful datalogging he was able to show the effects of various factors like air pressure/ moon/ pigeons sitting on the hands of the clock on the accuracy of the clock. A search will find a website he maintains about the clock and the datalogging. ",

            "answer_text": "Weight or your mass = force acting upon the Earth because gravity is ~9.8 m/s (usually rounded to 10) multiplied by your mass. So your mass times gravity is expressed in newtons. Let's say your mass is 70kg, multiply that by earths gravity = ~700 newtons. ",
