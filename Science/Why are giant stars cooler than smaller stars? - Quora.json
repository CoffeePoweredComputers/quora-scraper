            "answer_text": "\"Why are giant stars cooler than smaller stars?For example our Sun and Betelgeuse or any other gigantic star. Why are these giant stars cooler than our sun?\"----- Betelgeuse (a red supergiant) is certainly bigger and cooler than the Sun, but that's not necessarily so.  Consider O-type main-sequence stars. While these are not in the official category of \"giants,\" they're invariably much bigger than the Sun. At a minimum temperature of  about 30,000 Kelvins, they're a lot hotter than the Sun. Here's an illustration from that linked Wikipedia article.  Unfortunately, the text descriptions for the luminosity classes (indicated by Roman numerals and the \"0\" at the top) didn't come through. The Sun is a class G2V star [1]. Any spectral type to the left of class G are hotter than the Sun. Giant stars are luminosity classes II and III, while supergiant stars are luminosity classes Ia and Ib.     The  deeper purple shapes on this illustration show the range of spectral types associated with each luminosity class. For giants and supergiants, you'll see that spectral types range from M to B. This means that these very large stars can range in temperature from about 3500 Kelvins to about 30,000 Kelvins. For popular examples, we have Betelgeuse (Class MIa)  and Rigel (Class BIa). Both of these stars are much larger than Sun, yet Betelgeuse is cooler while Rigel is hotter. -----[1] Class G2V: The \"G2\" part means spectral class G, about 20% along the axis from class F to class K.  The \"V\" part means a main-sequence star, also called a \"dwarf.\" ",

            "answer_text": "To put it simply, giant stars have for the most part stopped generating energy via nuclear fusion (technically, they are still doing so in thin outward-moving shells, but it's a lot less than in small \"main sequence\" stars). When a star runs out of hydrogen, it starts collapsing because there is no energy source to hold up its immense weight.  So the inner part starts to contract.  But the outer part expands!  Why?  Because as it cools, it gets denser, which means the few photons still being emitted are caught more effectively.  Essentially, the outer part of the star becomes a giant \"photon sail\".  So it starts being pushed outwards, which causes it to cool further just because of expansion. Thus you end up with a giant star, which is both very large and very cool compared to its  hydrogen core-burning star predecessor.  This will happen to the Sun in about 5 billion years, and it will expand to beyond the orbit of the Earth, but will cool to \"only\" a couple thousand Kelvin. ",
