            "answer_text": "Lithium is less reactive than both sodium and potassium because of kinetic factors, not because of thermodynamic factors. Lithium is harder, and it is also less easily melted than sodium and potassium. It is also less quickly dispersed than the other two during reactions. Hence, it is less reactive though its standard reduction potential is slightly lower than that of sodium and potassium. ",
