            "answer_text": "Glass(or any medium in general) has different refractive index for different colours. OR Different colors have different speeds in a material medium OR different colors bend by different angles during refraction. So when a white light beam is incident on one of the reactangular faces , different colours deviate by different angles from original direction after refraction. So colours get separated at the first refraction only.Now all the colors reach to second rectangular face of the prism where again refraction takes place here the two rectangular faces of the prism are not parallel to each other so the two deviations are not opposite ( clockwise and anticlockwise) to each other hence do not cancel which would have resulted in recombination of colors as happens in case of glass slab. Hence it is at first refraction in prism where colour separation takes place ,second refraction only increases separation among these seperated colors. ",
