            "answer_text": "I am not sure what the question is calling \u201cpostulates\u201d. In mathematics, particularly geometry, a postulate is \u201ca thing suggested or assumed as true as the basis for reasoning, discussion, or belief.\u201d Oxford Languages and Google - English | Oxford Languages Theories have statements. Once made, these statements are tested, by deductive logic in an attempt to show them to be wrong. When those tests fail, we say the statements (theory) is supported. The statements of Cell Theory are: The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in living things.All organisms are made up of one or more cells.Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. 4.1C: Cell Theory.It is that last statement that causes confusion in the creationism vs abiogenesis discussion. #3 should state \u201cModern cells arise from other cells through cellular division\u201d Just like the Laws of Thermodynamics describe conditions within the universe but do not describe how to get a universe to begin with, Cell Theory describes the situation we see today. It does not attempt to determine how cells got here to begin with. Where the first cell(s) came from is outside Cell Theory. Those are the essential core statements of Cell Theory. Some additional statements are: Cells carry genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular divisionAll cells are essentially the same in chemical compositionEnergy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells ((same source as above)ALL of these statements have been repeatedly tested and affirmed by observation. Therefore they can no longer be called \u201cpostulates\u201d. ",
