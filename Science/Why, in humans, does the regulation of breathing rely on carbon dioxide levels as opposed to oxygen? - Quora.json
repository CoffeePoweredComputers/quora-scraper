            "answer_text": "Carbon dioxide is a much denser molecule than O2, and diffuses much more rapidly than oxygen at the pulmonary capillary level. I cannot explain any evolutionary process that makes our central brain receptors more sensitive to increasing CO than to decreasing O2, but that is the case. Slight rises in CO2 will initiate increases in minute ventilation (the amount of gas moved in and out of the lungs in one minute), by either increasing rate of respiration, increasing depth of respiration or a combination of the two. In people with long-standing COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) their CO2 levels have been so high for so long that their respiratory drive is activated more by decreases in O2 than increases in CO2. That is one of the reasons that clinicians have to be judicious in their application of oxygen therapy for folks with long-standing COPD. I have seen cases where people with COPD were put on 4 LPM of oxygen by nasal cannula which increased their blood oxygen levels to the point that their respiratory drive was negligible, and they sat in bed, in no apparent distress as their CO2 levels went through the roof and their oxygen levels were just keeping them alive, and the felt no urge to breathe.

            "answer_text": "Increased carbon dioxide in the blood decreases blood pH, which is easy to monitor. Low oxygen levels result in a lower proportion of oxyhemoglobin relative to overall hemoglobin, which is much more difficult to monitor. Since, in most practical instances including drowning and asphyxiation, respiratory distress results in or from failure to expel enough carbon dioxide as well as failure to take in enough oxygen, elevated carbon dioxide is a useful proxy for low oxygenation. Evolution is not a perfectionist; it tends to find a \u201cgood enough\u201d solution. Of course, such a solution doesn\u2019t always work; for example, someone who climbs Mount Everest will experience extra fatigue due to low oxygen but not \u201cshortness of breath\u201d feelings, to the best of my knowledge. But on the other hand, until very recently a human who climbed high enough to experience low oxygen from altitude would probably drop out from fatigue well before reaching air that was too thin to support life at all.
