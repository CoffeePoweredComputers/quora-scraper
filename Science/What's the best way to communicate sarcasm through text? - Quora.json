She was on the couch and he\u2019s at the floor resting his back and munching the snacks that she served. In the middle of a movie he said, I always wish to have a girl like a Pepper Potts, He stopped. She- What ? Why ?.(with a Confused stare). He- Look at her. How she cares Tony stark like a baby and She's Intelligent, Understandable, Ambitious, Loyal, Humble, Sociable, Kind and more over she's a CEO of stark industries and she knows everything about Tony Stark. Do you know my Aadhar Number ?. He asked and Chuckled. (Recalling the party scene in that movie where Pepper asks Tony's Social security number) Though in a extreme anger she acts cool and decided an ambush on him. She- Any one would really wish to deserve a girl like her unless he's a Tony stark who owns a billion dollar company having a stunning iron suit, An luxurious chartered flight, An exotic car collections at his basement, Who knows how to built an iron suit at cave, Who can become an expert in Thermonuclear Astrophysics in over night, Who is good at building an arc reactor with his own element Badassium, Who gave a free super suit to little spidey, Who has built his own personal assistant J.A.R.V.I.S. (she stopped with a epic smile). but here I know someone who not even know how to hold an Iron box, She added. He- Leave it sweetie. Your my Captain Marvel. I was kidding. Who needs a pepper when having a girl like you in someones life. He said with a baby face. Keeping the no more Nice girl face and she said, She- BTW! Your Aadhaar No is 7895-XXXX-XXXX.

            "answer_text": "Sarcasm is best dished through a straight face and tone in verbal communication. I think this is because most times, after a sarcastic retort, the target will usually look at you with an \u201care you serious look?\u201d. And the best thing to do is keep a straight face then! While achieving the tone might not be that easy on text, it's easier to pull a straight face. The best way (on text), is use of this emoji right here \u201c\u201d That bad boy, the look on his face, says it all. So just think up your sarcastic stuff (of course) then use that for effect. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to impact the world by providing an answer to this well-thought question. \\U0001f612 Edit: Just realised after posting that emojis don't show. Way to go Adam. Cool platform bro. In fact we didn't even want emoji support in the first place. :-| :-| is the face I'm referring to. Find something similar on your keyboard. Straight unimpressed face. On whatsapp, I find the black sun does this best. ",
