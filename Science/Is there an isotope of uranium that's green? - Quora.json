            "answer_text": "All isotopes of uranium form the same chemical compounds and have the same spectroscopic properties, in other words colors. These colors range from brown to green to colorless to yellow.  Some uranium compounds are green, for example as seen in uranium glass, but these compounds have a mixture of isotopes. If the isotopes were in a green compound were separated they would all have the same green color. See: Uranium - Wikipedia See: Uranium glass - Wikipedia ",
