            "answer_text": "Mathematical sciences is a group of areas of study that includes, in addition to mathematics, those academic disciplines that are primarily mathematical in nature but may not be universally considered subfields of mathematics proper. Statistics, for example, is mathematical in its methods but grew out of scientific observations which merged with inverse probability and grew through applications in the social sciences, some areas of physicsand biometrics to become its own separate, though closely allied field. Computer science, computational science, population genetics, operations research, cryptology, econometrics, theoretical physics, and actuarial science are other fields that may be considered part of mathematical sciences. A long-standing practice has been to divide the mathematical sciences into categories that are, by implication, close to disjoint. Two of the most common distinctions are drawn between \u201cpure\u201d and \u201capplied\u201d mathematics, and between \u201cmathematics\u201d and \u201cstatistics.\u201d These and other categories can be useful to convey real differences in style, culture and methodology, but in the Panel\u2019s view, they have produced an increasingly negative effect when the mathematical sciences are considered in the overall context of science and engineering, by stressing divisions rather than unifying principles. Furthermore, such distinctions can create unnecessary barriers and tensions within the mathematical sciences community by absorbing energy that might be expended more productively. In fact, there are increasing overlaps and beneficial interactions between different areas of the mathematical sciences. ",

            "answer_text": "EDIT: Doncha hate it when they change question sufficiently to idiofy an answer? The original question: What is mathematics in science? The answer relevant to that: Mathematics is a key part of the vocabulary and structure of science. Measurement, relationships, predictions, quantification are all part of modern sciences. It helps in providing precision, in rigour, in predictability.Unfortunately there is currently a rage for popular science which not only avoids equations, but decries them. (On video, we are treated to speccy visual tricks and amusements - but while they often dazzle us, these pyrotechnics don\u2019t often enlighten us.) ",
