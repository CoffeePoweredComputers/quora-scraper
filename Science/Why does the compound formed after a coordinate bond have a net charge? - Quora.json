            "answer_text": "Coordinate bonds are formed when bonding electrons are shared by only one element. Generally while a single covalentbond is formed each atom supplies one each electron each but in the dative or coordinate bond both the two shared pair of electrons are supplied by single atom. For example NH3 has one lone pair and it shares them with BH3 which has an incomplete last orbital. As NH3 is supplying electron therefore it will contain+2 charge and BH3 has taken 2 electrons therfore contains -2 charge while overall charge remains same . If any of the compound already has a charge then there would be net charge after the coordinate bond has formed . ",
