            "answer_text": "Any atom with 6 protons is carbon, neutrons add to the mass, so this would be a carbon atom with a mass of 14, this is EXTREMELY rare isotope of carbon as it is unstable and radioactive(because it\u2019s unstable) and decays with a half-life(how many years it would take for half the carbon 14 atoms to decay) of 40 years, this isotope is so rare that it is found for every 1 in 1 trillion carbon atoms, that\u2019s 0.0000000001%(trace amounts) of all the carbon atoms found in nature. when it decays a down quark in the neutron will release a W- boson and transform into a up quark which will now make it a proton, and go from Carbon-14 to Nitrogen-14.
