            "answer_text": "When Jehovah sent Moses back to Egypt, Zipporah and their two sons started out to accompany him. Along the way a very serious incident occurred, the rather obscure account of which says: \u201cNow it came about on the road at the lodging place that Jehovah [\u201cJehovah\u2019s angel,\u201d LXX] got to meet him and kept looking for a way to put him to death. Finally Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son\u2019s foreskin and caused it to touch his feet and said: \u2018It is because you are a bridegroom of blood to me.\u2019 Consequently he let go of him. At that time she said: \u2018A bridegroom of blood,\u2019 because of the circumcision.\u201d\u200b\u2014Ex 4:24-26. Scholars have offered many interpretations of this passage, some of these being incorporated into modern Bible translations. (See CC, JB, Kx, La, NE, RS, as well as the German Z\u00fcrcher Bibel, the Spanish Bover-Cantera and the French Crampon, Lienart, and Segond versions.) Such interpretations attempt to settle questions as to whether it was Moses\u2019 or the child\u2019s life that was threatened, whether Zipporah touched the feet of Moses or the feet of the child or the feet of the angel with the foreskin. They also venture opinions as to why Zipporah said (and to whom she said), \u201cYou are a bridegroom of blood to me.\u201d It seems that it was the child\u2019s life that was in danger in view of what the law of circumcision states at Genesis 17:14; that Zipporah circumcised the child because she realized what was needed to set matters right; that she cast the foreskin at the feet of the angel who was threatening the child\u2019s life to demonstrate her compliance with Jehovah\u2019s law; that Zipporah addressed Jehovah through his representative angel when she exclaimed, \u201cYou are a bridegroom of blood to me,\u201d doing so to show her acceptance of a wifely position in the circumcision covenant with Jehovah as the husband.\u200b\u2014See Jer 31:32. But there is no way of Scripturally settling such questions with certainty. The literal reading of the ancient Hebrew in this passage is veiled in the idioms used nearly 3,500 years ago. This is why literal translations (NW, Ro, Yg) and others (AS, KJ, Da, Dy, JP, Mo, Le), including the ancient Greek Septuagint, are not clear on these matters.

            "answer_text": "The Holy Spirit had probably communicated that to Moses when he was suddenly stricken with some sort of severe illness. Given that a disembodied sense of utter dread can be a symptom of neurological issues (including seizures), he was probably made to feel that, too. It can be gathered that Moses\u2014whom his wife would have known to be able to prophesy\u2014would have told her he was about to die with an authority she certainly would have believed, in his state of panic. Also, if you look at the text just before (v.22-23), God had vowed to kill the firstborn son of the Pharaoh for keeping all of Israel in slavery. Zipporah would have known that the God Whom Moses began to worship was only appeased with bloodshed: perhaps part of the reason she did not want Moses to circumcise their son. She understandably wanted to keep her son from being (what she perceived as) needlessly mutilated, in the name of a bloodthirsty deity whom she had never known nor seen. She and Moses knew that they would be considered guilty of wrongdoing, were this god real, and were undoubtedly wary because of it. This is when she realized that what Moses' Lord sought was an atonement offering of spilt blood. ",
