            "answer_text": "People who learn to take responsibility for their actions are eventually picked by the company to lead. So remember everyone screws up. The important thing is to apologize when you are in the wrong. An effective and a sincere apology has three parts a) Acknowledge how your action affected the person b) say you\u2019re sorry c) describe what you\u2019re going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Don\u2019t give excuses.Don\u2019t half ass on any assignments given to you. Regardless of how important or non-important your boss makes it sound, don\u2019t half ass it. You build credibility with consistent output and not one or two big moments.Ask your boss exactly what you are supposed to deliver against for your next promotion. Most people just show up at office without any long term planning. They have no clue why they\u2019re spending 90 hours a week at office except to get their salary. if you want to progress have clear goals and communicate it with your boss. And get clarity on what his/her expectation is of you. This way you have a good reason to ask for your promotion in your next review.Invest in workshops and seminars in your industry instead of buying the next iPhoneDon\u2019t say yes to each and everyone \u2013 even when you are a junior. Take only the work you can realistically do and do it extremely well. That\u2019s the only way you will gain respect. Have a clear work philosophy. Have your do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and express them very clearly to the people you work with. Without a philosophy people will overstep your boundaries, take a dump on you and walk all over you whenever they please. Master the art of saying NO.Read non fictions on management, productivity, personal finance and leadership. Make a habit of it.Make sure your personal life is sorted too if you want to do well in your career. Your personal life and professional lives are not separate. If one of them\u2019s screwed, the other is not going to be extraordinary. Or at least you won\u2019t be able to sustain at an extraordinary level.Pay attention to dressing. Dress not for the job you have, but for the job you want.Invest time to network. If you don\u2019t your career trajectory will stagnate after a point. Network relentlessly within the organization and the industry you work in. Your network is going to determine how big of a jump you will make from your current job. So invest a lot of time networking.Learn to sell yourself. Know that in the corporate world you are a resource. A product. People buy into products that is sold to them in the most attractive way. Your boss is people, your next hiring manager is people, your team is people. So learn the basic principles of sales and marketing and learn to apply some of it to make yourself visible in the organization (and later as you grow \u2013 be visible in the industry) If you are wondering why you haven\u2019t got that promotion even after working 90 hours a week, it\u2019s because people above you don\u2019t see you as an attractive product.",

            "answer_text": "I can summarise it as \u201cYou can only connect the dots backwards.\u201d (Steve Jobs). Let me explain what I mean by this: 1. Change your idea of what \u201cmaking an impact\u201d means I see young people nowadays starting their careers with a lot of enthusiasm, just to become bored and disappointed after a few months, the most common feedback being \u201cI am not making an impact\u201d. But as my ex-colleague at Goldman Sachs Joseph Mauro famously said one day, you have to \u201cstay on the bus\u201d. We can make an impact every day with tiny things, but we tend to discard this as valuable because we reject simple stuff in favour of complex matters. This is also applicable to how we feel. Simple is boring and not sophisticated, and you and I are fun and sophisticated people, correct? Well, you don\u2019t need to feel \u201csophisticated\u201d about your impact. It is more rewarding to change the approach and build your contribution sequentially. Helping our team book meetings, bringing lunch to the desk, mentoring a friend at work\u2026 are all good ways of helping make a better world from a micro perspective. Small and simple things matter, for big things are made of small stuff. Focus on the impact you can make at every step of the way and stop worrying about the impact you think you should be making. 2. Set the right goals at each stage of your career The other day I was talking to one of my students at IE Business School. We were discussing career matters, and he was telling me that he was struggling to make an important decision: become a quant structurer in banking or take a different path in finance. He is in his early twenties. And so I asked: what are the things you can do to help yourself make the best decision? What is holding you back from acting upon that choice? If there was no downside, what would you choose here and now, on the spot? Treating a decision like that as an immediate goal is paralysing. To make that BIG decision you need to gather quality information first: info about the industry, the things you need to master to be successful, devoting enough time to interact with people doing that job, understanding the challenges, the growth path and the typical \u201cday in the life\u201d\u2026 you need to tick off the right \u201cprocess goals\u201d first before you can tackle the \u201cend goal\u201d. The former will take you to the latter. Choose goals that drive you to your ultimate ambitions but make sure you keep moving and acting, not just thinking and planning. Unpack problems and tackle things bit by bit, day after day. Avoid focusing only on the big, longer-term aspirations and keep moving. 3. The \u201creturn on time invested\u201d in growing professionally is not linear People tend to focus on their big goals, without realising that sometimes it takes several years to get the building blocks right. Moreover, the path as you go from breakthrough to breakthrough is never linear. You can never bet on a straight line, but you can surely bet on gradually acquiring the right skills for the future, and keeping a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude and the right work ethics. Those are things that depend on you, so focus on those and let \u201ctime\u201d do the rest. It is a lot more useful to our careers to focus on the process, on doing what needs to be done today, so that we can make progress. Deliberate practice compounds like interest. Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t have the patience to wait for the big pay-offs. 4. Don\u2019t fall for cheap marketing. Discovering your purpose is a lifelong journey As Peter Drucker once said, \u201cSuccessful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values.\u201d I have done many things in life. I think I am on my 7th \u201ccareer stint\u201d at 39 years of age. And I don\u2019t believe I am done yet. Life, for me, was never meant to be a straight line. What keeps me moving is my constant eagerness to learn, and to tackle opportunities that contribute to my skill set and my career capital as I grow. You just don\u2019t follow your passion, you work on it. Discovering your purpose is a lifelong journey, and meaning lies in the path, not the destination. ",

            "answer_text": "For about half of my professional career I was an employee and for the past 15 years, I have run my own business with about 75 employees. I will relate my experiences.. As an employee, I was good. I worked hard, I finished my projects well before time, never gave my bosses any reason to worry, Mr. Dependable is what they called me. You know what? I never got anywhere in my career. It would tick me off that I am doing everything that was expected of me and still, I was bypassed every time an opportunity for a promotion came up. My last job before starting my own business was for a huge corporation. By this point, it was already in my head, that I would remain a lowly level employee no matter how well I worked, so this time around when I got this job, I was not expecting anything so I stopped caring. Not that I stopped caring about my work, I still worked hard, but I didnt live with this fear of always keeping upper management happy. If my manager was making a mistake, I quite literally told him that he was an idiot and I do the task the correct way myself. Since I didnt care about ever getting a promotion, I never hesitated to stick my neck out voice my opinion. I would go into other departments and help other people out, just because \u2026 When I handed in my resignation at this place it shocked me that upper management were really upset at my resignation. Down the rumor mill, I got word that they wanted to take me down the path of eventually being a director. Needless to say, I was in absolute shock! At the time, I couldn\u2019t figure out what they saw in me. Jumping ahead to starting my own business. After years of learning the ropes and building experience in the role of boss, I now realize what I always did wrong, and what I did right in my last job. The whole thing is that as an owner of a company with around 75 employees (no I dont know the exact amount of people that work for me), I have seen all types of employees. What I can tell you is that there are two type of people that get the attention of management, one is obviously the incompetents. They are the ones who cannot get the job done right, and when the job doesnt get done, it effects the rest of the business, so these types of people do not escape notice. There are those that are working hard, doing exactly what is expected of them. They are the ones that hardly get noticed. They get their work done, the mechanics of the company work as expected, so there is no attention paid to that or those who are struggling to keep it that way (I was always that kind of person). The third type of employee who does get the attention of management are the risk takers. They are not afraid to get their feet wet, they go above and beyond what their requires of them. These types of people dont worry only about if they are getting their job done, but they also worry about those who are not getting the job done and they pick up the slack. They take chances and sometimes they fall flat on their faces, but you know what? They tried. They made an effort when they didnt need to. They tried to do what is best for the company. These are the people who get promoted. That was what I was inadvertently doing at my last job before quitting that I now understand. ",

It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s becoming a billionaire or ending world hunger. It doesn\u2019t have to the \u201cright\u201d thing, it\u2019s not forever. Now if you make a declaration for your purpose or your goal(s), it does not mean you cannot change it later or expand it or just drop it and declare something else. Just declare what your life is for right now. Right now, *my* life is for \u201cbeing in action towards a world that works for everyone.\u201d I\u2019ll never accomplish it, but it is a good thing to be working towards. Make some big promises for what you are going to accomplish. Chicken shit tiny promises will result in chicken shit tiny results.Write down a plan. Set deadlines and create milestones. Good ideas without concrete dates are just good ideas. Plan your work and work your plan. Understand that actions cause things to happen, words do not. Make promises to others about what you are going to do and by when. We are more likely to complete a task when someone else is counting on us to do it. If you break a promise, admit that you did that, clean up any mess that you caused, make a new promise. Share your promises and your life goals with anyone and everyone who will listen. (I shared my goal of running an eco-friendly bed and breakfast in New Mexico, US for 10 years. I probably told over 5000 people about it. I handed out business cards on 4 continents. Now I\u2019m running an eco-friendly B&B in New Mexico.) Ask for help and support. Any project worth doing will probably be big enough and complicated enough to need more than one person. Don\u2019t be afraid to make big, bold requests for help, materials, advice, money and anything else you need for your project. You\u2019ll be surprised how often the answer will be Yes! Keep your integrity squeaky clean. No dirty money, no stolen goods, no unpaid bills, etc.I\u2019ve used this list, and it works. Really. When you give your word to yourself that you will move from thinking into action, you will get motivated, you will take risks, you will learn, and as you work toward this goal, either it will become what inspires you, or it will lay the groundwork for you to discover something else that inspires you.

Try to say yes if presented with opportunities (a brand-new place, the chance to provide a considerable demonstration, a substantial company trip), even if they seem frightening. When co-workers request help, say. You will be seen as valuable if you're known as someone who steps up.

            "answer_text": "I think that a good exercise for career development is to break each of your jobs down into a set of activities. Each one of those activities can be isolated and the skills can be improved upon. If you need help breaking your job down into its key activities, think of it like a game of basketball. Throughout a game, you spend your time running, defending shots, shooting, passing, dribbling, etc. You can get even more granular and break each activity into its different parts (ex. shooting includes layups, jump shots, and free throws). So, if you\u2019re looking to expand your role, learn new skills and add new activities to the role.  Next, you can step back even further and not just think about your job, but your career in the same way. A lot of times, company executives will have to know and be able to manage not just one role, but other roles as well. For example, a VP of Marketing needs to manage the Product Marketing team, Corporate Marketing team and the Advertising team. If you are the Director of the Product Marketing team and you want to become the VP of Marketing, you need to develop your skills and expertise in those other areas, or else you aren't really qualified to take the next steps ",

            "answer_text": "Just over a decade ago, I was at my desk in Morgan Stanley's London office, on a teleconference call with about 10 people. We were finalising the details of a \u20ac1.3B deal. There were, amongst others, 2 lawyers and a few bankers on the call. One guy asked if everything was in order so we could proceed. An Italian lawyer said he didn't understand something. The other lawyer tried explaining it, but he still didn't understand. After an hour several had tried explaining, in increasingly patronising tones, and the frigging Italian lawyer still didn't get it. Not only was this Italian lawyer clearly stupid, but he didn't seem to care that everyone now knew he was. At some point, a banker on the call suddenly understood what the Italian was going on about. And guess what? It turned out there was a problem with the structure of the deal, which is why it didn't make sense to him. Lucky he kept asking. I was like wow, what an Italian Stallion. We all have plenty of snippets of information in our little heads, but I assure you very few actually understand what the hell is going on in a fundamental and holistic sense. If you do, and you'll only get there if you're brave enough to ask and challenge, which few do, you'll eventually build an incredible advantage over those around you. ",

            "answer_text": "Give this a read: The dog days of summer are a great time to take stock of your career and its trajectory or lack thereof. There are times in the summer where things slow down as teammates and managers are taking their requisite trip to the beach. And as stewards of your own career, you should be consistently managing yourself. Your manager is not responsible for your career, you are. They are responsible for your output. So waiting until annual review time to determine your goals and accomplishments is a bit foolhardy. But here are 10 things you can do today and this year to improve your career. 1. Set small goals regularly When it comes to annual reviews, there is so much focus on goals for the year. A year is a long time; too long in fact to set tangible, achievable goals. Therefore, it is far more wise to set smaller goals throughout the year. Think about your day-to-day work. What could you be doing to elevate that work? Are there skills you could learn to help you advance? Think about this for a bit and then make a list of goals that relate to these items. And then, once you\u2019ve set the goals, give yourself a deadline to have learned these things. When you\u2019ve hit the deadline\u2026 give yourself a grade. Seriously. It works. Did you do it? Did you do it well? Then ask someone else how they would score or grade you on these new skills. Then rinse and repeat. 2. Stretch yourself The smartest of us say that success is just outside our comfort zone. So, it goes without saying that you must stretch beyond your area of expertise. Do something that scares you. Don\u2019t like public speaking, start signing up for presentations at work or networking events. Does it terrify you to put your industry thoughts out there? Ask someone for the opportunity to guest post. Whatever gives you the collywobbles; sign up for it, today. 3. Get feedback While self-assessment is important, it is also important to get feedback. And it is important to get feedback all the time. I happen to ask at the end of each and every meeting I lead with the following questions: \u201cWhat really worked for you?\u201d and \u201cWhat would make it even better if?\u201d You can learn a lot from these two questions. So much about your work product and performance can be gleaned with these two questions. Give it a try and see what you learn. 4. Curate your work Do you have any idea how many amazing things you\u2019ve done this year? Probably not, because you aren\u2019t curating that great work anywhere to revisit it. There are countless places for you to store this work in a cloud. Check out Dropbox, CredHive, or OneDrive and start curating your work. When you\u2019ve got a great file of work you\u2019ve produced and are proud of, it\u2019s like writing your resume as you go. It is also easy to share with your manager at review time. You\u2019re better prepared to wow them when you\u2019ve got yourself visual proof of your awesome-ness. 5. Be curious about your industry Spend time each and every week as a student of your industry or company. Study your industry and company as if there is a constantly approaching final exam. Ask questions of people in your space. Ask questions to your manager and colleagues. Ask your companies customers how they feel. Develop thoughtful insights about the industry and your company. And don\u2019t be shy about sharing those insights. 6. Read Spend time reading blogs big and small. Spend time reading books about your profession. Read business books that stretches your thinking. But at the end of the day\u2026 read. Reading new things can start conversations when you\u2019re networking and can also build your own career with new ways to do things and different work and life hacks to make life flow a little more smoothly. 7. Network brilliantly Never, ever, ever send a standard LinkedIn invite. Ever. Cannot stress this enough. Personalize the message and tell the recipient what you need from them and how you can help them as well. If you do not know someone, ask someone in your network for an introduction. Networking brilliantly is about leaving a positive impression. And it isn\u2019t just LinkedIn. Attend industry events, local events and meet as many people as you can. This will also help in being curious about your industry. 8. Get a mentor Mentors are great resources for all of these elements. Need feedback? Ask your mentor. Need to bounce off industry or company insights? Looking for ways to stretch\u2026 Mentor! 9. Get a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Conversely, a good prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can also be a tremendous resource to learn from as well. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can bust some of your paradigms. They can also expose you to new thinking and present you with new ways to solve problems and look at things. 10. ABL (Always be listening) Even if you are really happy in your current role, it never hurts to listen to other opportunities and build relationships with new people in the industry. These relationships may build in the future because you never know how you will cross paths in the future. Always be open to new opportunities and people, plus it feels really good when you get noticed! ",

            "answer_text": "4 Effective Tips On How To Take Your Life To The Next Level  After 20 years of working counterintelligence cases, I was asked to become the spokesperson for the FBI in Northern California. My first reaction was \u201cNo\u201d\u2014I was very comfortable in my position as a case agent. By this time, I knew every step in the manual and had my network of informants in place so I could launch an investigation against a foreign intelligence officer with very little effort on my part. I felt the quiet pleasure of smug satisfaction with my existing situation. But in the back of my mind, I knew I wasn\u2019t continuing to hone my skills; I wasn\u2019t striving to do my best. In truth, I had become complacent; I had reached a plateau. When I said \u201cNO,\u201d I was refusing to take my career to the next level. I was successful as a case agent, but my complacency was not nurturing a desire to grow professionally, or personally either. \u201cThe tragedy of life is often not in our failure, but rather in our complacency; not in our doing too much, but rather in our doing too little; not in our living above our ability, but rather in our living below our capacities.\u201d\u2014Benjamin E. Mays Stanford researcher Carol Dweck observed, \"There is no relation between students' abilities or intelligence and the development of mastery-oriented qualities. Some of the very brightest students avoid challenges, dislike effort, and wilt in the face of difficulty. And some of the less bright students are real go-getters, thriving on challenge, persisting intensely when things get difficult, and accomplishing more than you expected.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not always the people who start out the smartest who end up being the smartest. I had always been a go-getter, but somewhere in those 20 years, I had settled into a comfort zone that produced mediocrity. Complacent strength is our greatest weakness\u2014LaRae Quy I eventually did say \u201cYes\u201d and represented the FBI for 4 years in Northern California. I\u2019m going to share 4 effective ways that I took it to the next level, and so can you: 1. BUST THROUGH A PLATEAU Joshua Foer, author of Moonwalking with Einstein, talks about the \u201cO.K. plateau.\u201d It's when we reach a skill level where we\u2019re able to do the task without having to really think about it. Your performance is automatic. While the OK plateau can what be we need in certain areas of our life, there may be other areas where OK really means that we've hit a wall. We're not unhappy, exactly, but not entirely sure where to pinpoint the growing sense of restlessness. We say, \"We're fine\" rather than \"excited about the next step in life or career.\" There's a niggling feeling that assures us there's more out there for us to conquer in the world. People used to believe that they couldn't bust through plateaus because they represented the limit of our talent or genetic ability. In recent years, Psychologists have discovered that all it takes to bust through a plateau is the right attitude. How To Make It Work For You: Take the long view. When we look at the big picture, it's easier to see plateaus as temporary breaks where we can take the time to strategize about not only our vision for the future but the steps it will take to get there. Take risks. No one likes to move out of their comfort zone but only wimps use them as an excuse to hunker down and stay in a place that looks more like a rut over the years than an exciting life. Often, it's your ego that you want to protect because there\u2019s a chance you might fail if you try something new. The result is that you stay in a safe and boring pattern that involves no risk. In the process, you\u2019ve just become Wikipedia's image of a wimp. Embrace the suck. Unless you want to live on a plateau, going nowhere for the rest of your life, you will need to embrace things that are hard and difficult. Yes, it sucks but once you've gotten in touch with your vision for your life, the sprint will be worth a few knocks to the ground. But here's the thing: unless you learn from the failures that will litter your path along the way, it will all be for nothing. Each failure has the potential to make you smarter than before, but only if you embrace the lesson. 2. FEEL THE BURN IN YOUR BELLY  Self-help books can't offer you guidance on this one. The burn in your belly comes from a deep understanding of what is important to you and why you'll persist even when things look hard. Often, our career or path in life is influenced by a teacher or parent in our youth. We find ourselves stuck on a treadmill to nowhere because our heart isn't in it; the path we took belonged to the parent or teacher, not to us. Complacency is often a pinprick to our heart that we've taken the wrong turn somewhere along the road. You can\u2019t take it to the next level until you take a closer look at why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. Complacency can be flat terrain that's an opportunity for you to assess the direction your life is going and decide whether this is where you really want to go. The number one reason most people don't take their life to the next level is that they feel they don't have control over their life. It's far easier to take the wimp's way out and blame their situation in life on someone else\u2014the government, the demands of their job, their crappy childhood, their partner...the pathetic list goes on. Wimps see themselves as victims of life, but what really separates wimps from victors are the choices they make. Your choice is 100% within your control. How To Make It Work For You: Stop using loser words like \"I can't\" and \"I shouldn't.\" Turn those thoughts around and claim control of your situation. Your current work environment may not be ideal, but you choose the attitude with which to approach it. Would you rather eat or starve on the street? That question can be a jolt to the way you look at your job. Does it mean you need to stay in a bloodless profession for the rest of your life? No! Give yourself a kick in the butt and get off-center but it does mean you need to take ownership of the way you approach your life. When you stop being a victim and understand that everything really is your choice, you develop the mental toughness to take your life to the next level. Are you mentally tough? Take this FREE assessment. 3. DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A PLATEAU AND BURNOUT You can\u2019t take your life to the next level until you know whether you\u2019re experiencing a plateau or a burnout. In a plateau, you can find ways to become empowered and recharged. Burnout is trying to do the same old things, or do things in the same old ways, without recognizing your need for reassessment. People in high-intensity jobs like first responders and law enforcement are very prone to burnout but they're not the only ones. One of the best ways to detect burnout is to answer this question: \"Do you notice that you're working hard and long hours but accomplishing less than you used to?\" Yep, that's burnout. According to psychologist Ellen Hendriksen, author of How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety, the signs of burnout are: \u2014Emotional exhaustion: Drained, unmotivated and tired\u2014both physically and psychologically. \u2014Depersonalization: You stop seeing the people you work with as people and instead start to see them as burdens, which builds up a mounting sense of resentment. \u2014Lack of ability to focus: Working hard and long hours but accomplishing less. While it can be hard to distinguish between a plateau and burnout at times, the cures are much different: The cure for a plateau is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm will propel you to learn new skills and acquire more information to keep moving forward.The cure for burnout is excavating the resentment you feel for what you've had to sacrifice in order to get where you are in life.How To Make It Work For You: Take the time to envision what a perfect work environment would look like for you. Take small, realistic steps to bring your reality closer to what you imagine a perfect work environment looks like. Think not only in terms of physical space but of the actual work you'd be involved in as well. 4. RECOGNIZE THE LURE OF MEDIOCRITY  While success is defined differently by all of us, mediocrity is a word we all recognize for what it is: settling for less than we deserve in life. It's a place that's often soft and safe, but at the same time, offers little fulfillment or self-respect. When we slide into mediocrity, we settle for less than we know we can be in life. It's giving up on finding a path that will bring us greater joy and happiness. Mediocrity is a rut that looks a lot like a coffin over time. The reason most people get stuck in mediocrity is that they refuse to fail. The reason people refuse to fail is that they associate failure with defeat. Their fear of defeat paralyzes them to the point that they won\u2019t move forward. People are not finished when they\u2019re defeated; they\u2019re finished when they quit. How To Make It Work For You: Hacks will tell you to start living your dreams. A much more effective approach is to stop living your fears. Fear produces anxiety that paralyzes the way we think, feel, and behave. The only way to move out of mediocrity is to be brave enough to face your fears. Don't face them all at once. Be strategic and pick off the easier ones first because once you slay them, you'll gain the confidence to move on to the bigger bullies that keep you cornered and afraid to move forward. \u00a9 2020 LaRae Quy.

            "answer_text": "Recognition and career progress are on each professional's set of aims. However, what sets the practitioners that are exceptional? The solution is a desire and openness to do. You are able to start scaling ladder As soon as you have got the openness and the ideal mindset. At Expertrons, career upskilling is provided by interacting with experts from more than 100 sectors working in top companies and designation. Here are five career secrets to get ahead in your career. 1. Adaptability/Flexibility This is an idea, and it summarizes the simple fact that to operate in many environments, you have to have the ability also to be open to different methods of thinking, and also to adapt to a situation that is changing. Can you determine or summarize some events or events in, if you think back to your career? If that's the case, adapt to change at work, and you may want to work on the way you respond to. It may be handy to practice a few exercises using this ability. Also, a fantastic way to begin changing is to ensure you take a while before responding to emails, coworkers or issues or challenges at work, and to think about all of the possibilities. This form of thinking up can open your actions. 2. Listening Skills There are few things worse than moving just to discover they've subsequently gone, and speaking at a meeting for one hour continued doing the same thing after your conversation. Being a fantastic listener is more than simply being'engaged' and creating sounds when somebody is speaking to you and nodding personally; it is about engaging with the material of dialogue, and taking in what's being stated. When action is needed, you then take the essential steps, and refer back to this message should you require clarification. Then ask if it'd be fine to list meetings on your phone if you know you are pretty bad at getting information in meetings. You may get your listing of this assembly because this might be a source for the office, typed up. 3. Confidence We do not mean arrogance here. The assurance which you will need to get ahead in your career will revolve around your capacity to have the nous to proceed with a job when you are feeling uncertain to stand up to your thoughts and also to encourage the accomplishments of others. Confidence at work will make sure you can perform the job that's demanded of you. 4. Networking The ability to have the ability to maintain a conversation and at any location is an element of you getting yourself beforehand. After all, you can't know what's going to change as a consequence of dialogue, and you never know who you're likely to fulfil. To striking up a dialogue the advantages are many - if you're equipped with a few business cards if you're a speaker, also which you can head out to pick parties. If you are enthusiastic about exactly what it is that you do, then people will be impressed with your ability to converse what your career is, and are far more inclined to participate in a feeling with you. 5. Innovation It is all very well to take management, and act based upon everything you've been told, and then the ideal thing to do would be to listen. But it is highly robust, and the perfect thing to ask questions, to do and also to attempt to find out a better way of doing something. If you are aware that you are not as successful as you can, or something is in desperate need of a revamp or upgrade, you are likely to be rewarded for the invention and thoughtfulness - provided you approach the ideal people in an ideal way. This signifies is that you have to be respectful of others' power, but also brave enough to challenge something whether it might be achieved in a better way, or if you know that it's not appropriate.

I am taking the liberty of using some of the sentences & questions I used to ask in the management lecture to my subordinates : ME : What are all the asset classes you have my dear colleagues ? GROUP: Shares, Fixed Deposits, Gold, Cars, Houses etc. ME : OK Fine. From this please tell me What are the assets give you return every year and the value also keeps on increasing ? GROUP: Few assets give returns every month and some do not. Similarly value also increases only for very few assets such as House etc. ME: You have forgot to add one Asset in your list which is your Career. A career gives Monthly returns and the value also keeps on increasing every year. Hence find ways to add value to your career. If you add value then automatically advancement pf career also will happen. Now coming to your question of Advancing Your career. First step is keep on adding or improving your skill set every year.Whatever job you are doing think you own that business and act accordingly. Have an entrepreneurial mindset but within the frame wrk of your organisational policies and guidelines.Keep abreast of what is happening in your field of work outside of your workplace. Watch the technological updates , trends etc.Have such a mindset that One day you are going to declare your Boss surplus. You do not have to be arrogant or anything but you are going to replace him soon.Never discuss about the people and discuss about Ideas.Never think your fellow worker is your competitor.Every year prepare s SWOT analysis on your career and honestly accept the same. Then only you will find ways for improvement.Hope the above helps. Rama Krishnan ",

However, this does NOT mean you should slack off at your current job. You need to maintain the highest level of professionalism, and still do your best. On the side, you need to have a plan.are you just reacting? or you actually have a plan? Most people do NOT have a plan. They wake up, go to work, and then go home. They\u2019re reacting to whatever come up at work. They do what their boss tells them. You need to be different. You need to take charge of your job and your career. Have a plan. Having a plan means 1) you know what you want 2) you have a plan of attack to get what you want 3) you adjust if you\u2019re not getting the result and 4) you measure and track your result to make sure you\u2019re executing.Start with physical changes. If there is one thing you can do, it\u2019ll be starting to exercise 30 minutes first thing in the morning. Do this for 30 day straight. It\u2019ll give you a nice energy boost, improving your mood, and give you confidence. This one small change could have profound impact on the rest of your life and career.Andrew Franklin Author: How to Get a Job at Amazon & How to Get a Job at Google & Smart Move: How to become a Product Manager ",

            "answer_text": "Leave your job the moment you stop learning and growing. This means you just be constantly assessing whether you\u2019re learning or not. And you must know what you aim to learn.Become best friends with executive assistants and HR personnel. They have the pulse on the organization. If you want to get the inside scoop, befriend them. I\u2019m not talking about sucking up, because then you\u2019re just a brown noser, and no one likes that. Genuinely be friends with them help them in those jobs and careers. Support the people who are only used to giving support and you\u2019ll soon have an insider look at the organization.Know your value. How much are you worth in today's job market? Does your salary reflect the level of contribution you have been making to your employer? Going on to sites like Comparably, Glassdoor, Monster or just google it.Find a mentor. Mentors can help you in so many ways. They provide information and knowledge. They can see where we need to improve where we often are blind. They stimulate our personal and professional growth. They offer encouragement and help keep us going. They are sounding boards so we can bounce ideas off them for an unfiltered opinion. They have the experiences you can learn from to prevent making the same mistakes beginners make.Be a mentor. If you can\u2019t teach it to someone else, you haven\u2019t learned it well enough. And you should always Give back to the community. Word will get around about your good deeds and it will create new opportunities for you. When you help others get what they want in life, they will help you get what you want in yours.Ask for what you want and be unapologetic about it. If you don\u2019t get what you want in life if you don\u2019t ask for it. And you only have one life, so there\u2019s no pulling punches.Always be looking for our next opportunity. The best time to fill your job opportunity pipeline is before you need it. Even if (especially when) you\u2019re happy at your job. These days, things can turn on a dime and the last thing you want is to be high and dry without a job. I\u2019m not saying you should become a job-hopper, but you should know your options. This also gives you leverage at your current job.Network both inside and outside your company. First, you need allies at work in other departments, especially in management positions. Second, referrals are the best way in to a new job, but I caution people to blatantly ask for an interview or job in a professional setting. Ask them for advice (for example, on your resume) but don\u2019t put them in an awkward position - let them offer it and be the judge if it\u2019s appropriate.Be the first one in the office. Set the tone. Make people chase and aspire to you. Plus, you will get so much done in the 60\u201390 minutes before everyone else gets in. Starting the day with an advantage everyday multiplies over time.Work with a recruiter. They have access to unlisted jobs, connections with hiring managers, inside information on the job requisition, and an incentive to place you (they get paid by the company, not you). Also, work with multiple recruiters. Get them to compete for your talent.Be picky with your job. Are you optimizing for learning, career trajectory or money? Choose accordingly. Then, only say yes to a job that will get you there AND you will be happy at. If you\u2019re optimizing for learning, don\u2019t let money distract you. The money will come later. You must always be thinking ahead.Bend the rules. I\u2019m not advocating for breaking rules, but you should always be questioning convention. When you find yourself on the side of the majority, it\u2019s time to stop and reflect. Are there better ways to do this? What haven\u2019t you considered? How get I get the outcome that I want? Also, when someone asks you for 10 professional life hacks, give them how many you want to give.Go above and beyond. Do more than what\u2019s expected of you. Going the extra mile will always pay off. You\u2019ll learn more, you\u2019ll gain respect, and you\u2019ll be setting yourself up for the future. When you help others, they will help you. Also, when someone asks you for 10 professional life hacks, give them more. Related: What is a life changing book?

            "answer_text": "We both took drop for the preparation of NEET in the same year. She is my friend and is really a good student. We used to study together but in our NEET exam she couldn\u2019t manage to score well instead I scored enough to get a seat in KGMU. She was broken and depressed, and in spite of my success I couldn\u2019t celebrate it. I consoled her and somehow convinced her to drop again. She dropped again but she failed again. She broke contact with everyone including me. I tried hard to contact her but she didn\u2019t want to talk to me. After one year one day she called me. She told nothing for few minutes except for crying and crying. \u201cI failed again Sarah. I tried but I couldn\u2019t do it. Medical is not for me. Even my parents are not with me now. They have lost their hope in me and me too. My life is worthless. I don\u2019t want to live anymore\u201d she was baffling and burst into tears again. She told me that she took admission in BSc because of her parents but continued her preparation side by side. And after one more failure her parents asked her to leave the hope for medicine. I talked her for one hour and consoled her. I talked to her parents and convinced them to give her one more chance. And they agreed (May be I was influencial to them because of my credential) \u201cListen, don\u2019t have an alternative for medicine in your mind. Set a single goal and focus on that. Just keep it in your mind that this is the thing which you can\u2019t live without. Stop crying and wasting your time in regret at the moments when you failed instead move ahead with a new hope. And please never lose your faith in yourself\u201d I told her when she told me that she is going to drop again. She gave NEET once again this year and now, she is having fun in GSVM Kanpur. She confessed that the biggest mistake which she did in those years was to take admission in BSc which give her an alternative for medicine. Subconsciously, but she gave her time thinking about things other than medicine.  Embrace your failure (I know it sounds philosophical but it actually works). Mistakes and hurdles are inevitable while walking on the road of self mastery and success but ultimately it will give you opportunity to learn, Pivot and go after your goals with new perspective. Don\u2019t cry and regret at your past. It has already shaped you in good or bad. You can\u2019t afford wasting your time and efforts in correcting something which is irreversible. Take a deep breath and focus on the current running seconds which you have to make productive. Don\u2019t let others decide what is better for you. No one can know about your longing and decide what your heart craves for. Just think that this is all you want and you can\u2019t live without this. Set a single goal. Have a clear priority for each single day which starts before you sit down at your desk to work. Climbing a mountain often gets easier once you have picked the Mountain you have to climb. So, Just pick your mountain right now! Thank you for A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Prove yourself different and secure a good career. Whatever the job you have chosen you have to make a difference. When the competition gets, tough with hundreds of job applicants with similar qualification and experience for a few vacancies, the need to distinguish yourself increases. Once upon English used to fulfill this need. English was considered essential for getting any decent job In India. Now-a-days English can help no more to distinguish yourself from others as the candidates speaking English are very common. Imagine a situation, where among thousands of job applicants to an MNC, you get selected, because your CV underscores your French or German. Now in a more globalized scenario, a foreign language has become more important than English. It is true. There is a growing demand for candidates with foreign language in multinational companies. Proficiency in a foreign language seems to have become a norm now, as it guarantees a high paid job with quite a number of perks and foreign trips. Of course the number of Students learning Foreign languages has increased. But this is not the only reason for students to learn a foreign language. Job is not the only reason and only ultimate advantage of learning a foreign language. When you learn a new language, a completely new perspective opens up for you. The way you look at the world and your life changes. You learn not just the pronunciation and sentence construction but you see the history of the part of the world from which the language comes. The people who you interact change and ultimately your world changes. What are the most popular foreign languages in India? Which is the best and the most popular language in India? French followed by Spanish, German are some of the most popular languages. There are sufficient reasons for Indian students to opt for these languages. In Germany there is no tuition fees, the quality of higher education is excellent. The standard of living is high but the cost of living is low. These are the factors driving Indian students to Germany. In October 2015, Ms Merkel visited India. After her talk with Mr Modi there is a sharp rise in Indian students heading to German universities. With France setting a target of Ten thousand students by 2020 the number of Indian students going to study in France is also on the rise. In the first six months of 2017, the students who went to France increased by 40 per cent. There is no gainsaying that more people are moving from India to Europe than before. However, studying in Europe is not the only cynosure but business, tourism and migration are the other opportunities inviting Europe stretching arms of safety, prosperity and above all longevity. Europe is considered better than America as the life expectancy is higher in Europe than in America besides low crime rate, road fatalities and rapes. People going to Europe have different choices such as studies, job or migration but they have no choice when it comes to language. People hardly respond to English and they prefer to speak in local language, such as French, or German. Learning another language has personal, academic and social benefits. Foreign language is valuable asset and a credible career choice. Unfortunately, in India, especially in South India, where students target technical courses for MNC careers language skills have taken back seat. Schools and colleges actually deem language skills less important and don\u2019t pay attention to teaching or practice. They are committed to show marks both to survive the competition and to satisfy the parents. Even in engineering colleges the teaching goes in vernacular languages leave alone general communication. Most engineering colleges usually hire professionals to teach language communication skills just a few days before Campus Recruitment Programs. The commercial mottos in education are depriving students of a very valuable opportunity of acquiring language skills that are essential to raise curtain personality development and cognitive, social and economic benefits. COGNITIVE BENEFITS for children and adults Brain science has discovered that functional plasticity of the human brain is driven by language, knowing a foreign language can actually change the brain's anatomy says research at the Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London. Children in foreign language programs have tended to demonstrate greater cognitive development, creativity, and divergent thinking than monolingual children. Adults show better performance on standardized tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).\"Foreign Language Study not only helps improve SAT-Verbal Scores but academic performance. Most of these academic improvements lie in the range of verbal accomplishment. Studies have shown that such students are strong in mathematics as well. Research has shown that having studied a foreign language one can understand one\u2019s own language better. Foreign language study can also raise one\u2019s abilities to function in other spheres of life. Adaptability increases as an outcome of foreign language study. A student is exposed to unfamiliar ideas while learning a new language thus adaptability and diversity are easy for him. By learning a new language, one can expand his horizons of thinking that reinforces one\u2019s own identity and self-confidence. Social Advantages of Foreign Language Education In a world where innovations like the Internet have brought the farthest ends of the earth into close contact learning a Foreign Language proves to be a solid help that goes beyond cognitive and academic benefits. Learning another language is often more advantageous as it unfolds another culture and can offer everyday social advantages. In a world where IT Companies have spread across the earth people are moving across the globe due to myriad reasons and speaking a foreign language is useful in situations other than just travel. Increasing number of jobs other than foreign trade, involve Foreign Language which allows people to interact with more people and adapt to clients with different cultural backgrounds. That is why IT professionals with foreign language are on greater demand than IT professionals with just English. In fact some companies are willing to train people on technical skills if the candidate is good at a foreign a language. Foreign languages are not an option but a need for tomorrow\u2019s professionals. Now-a-days in Hyderabad many schools are offering French as a second language. In recent days French language has spread into small towns and cities like Warangal, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Mahaboobnagar. Small and Medium schools also provide French language for their students. - Venkat Poolabala ( writer.poolabala@gmail.com) mobile: 9700877409 ",

            "answer_text": " How did he become the boss\u2019s assistant in a bit more than 3 months? That\u2019s probably what everyone asked themselves at the time. In less than 10 years, he co-founded Creative Artists Agency and took 70 percent of the business. He even was President of Walt Disney company in the nineties. Sure, it was a few decades ago but the teachings will still be valid for years to come. How would you go about INTENTIONALLY become the \u201cPUT HERE FAVORITE POSITION\u201d in 6 months or less? I mean, everyone knows what to do in a job, right? You show up early, you do your best, you go home late\u2026 and you do that consistently. Wrong! I remember this episode of the 70 Show where the dad \u201cRed\u201d had lost his job and was trying to get another one. He was repeating what everyone in the room was repeating: \u201call I have to offer is that I\u2019m hard-working and loyal\u201d. Nowadays it\u2019s not an advantage anymore. Back to Michael Ovitz. He started by making friends with the secretary at the front desk. He would bring her coffee and donuts frequently. She knew he was sucking up, but nobody sucks up to a clerk. She liked it. He knew it. After a few weeks, he asked her for the keys of the storage room. It contained thousands upon thousands of documents about past, present and most certainly future deals. He went deeeeep. But he knew one thing most employees don\u2019t: One day, I\u2019ll have my shot. I\u2019ll be ready. Of course, that day soon arrived. Staying late, Michael noticed that almost every night, the boss and a friend of his were going out for diner and then coming back at the office to get some work more done. He had an office but it was in a corner. He decided to sit at the receptionist desk and for 3 nights they would come back from diner, find him sitting there, greet him and go to their office. The fourth night, his boss goes out of his office with a pile of paper. \u201cWould you please make me photocopies?\u201d \u201cof course\u201d he replied. When he brought the stack of paper he added: \u201cIs there anything more I can do?\u201d Sure enough, he had more work for him. Guess what happened the day the boss told him that he wouldn\u2019t be able to help with some specific files? Michael already knew what files the boss was talking about. Hell, he even had a copy of the keys of the storage room they were locked in. He could go and grab the files right on the spot. Guess what happened when the boss\u2019s assistant fell sick? Of course the boss asked for this young man to help out. Guess what happened a bit more than 3 months after Michael joined? Yep, he became the personal assistant of the boss himself. Now\u2026 This story has a few years, sure. But the lessons are timeless. It\u2019s not about showing up early and going home late. Not anymore. It\u2019s about being intentional in what you want. You want to develop your career? Be intentional about it! Don\u2019t get a \u201ccareer by default\u201d.  Click here for the whole interview. ",

Not what I wanted to be. So I set off on my career with principles I both admired and bought into. It usually made it easy to do the right thing and, more generally, it actually made life itself just plain easier.I had just enough support from my childhood family that me and mine did not starve or freeze in those early years.I only worked for privately-held companies.I read a lot (especially the WSJ) and I taught myself to program.I married somebody smarter than me.I made friends with the widest variety of people.I negotiated more and more scheduled time off and traveled the country.I took a job early in my career that had rigorous processes. Thereafter, I thought about efficiency all the time.I never let employers or lawyers or businesses or the police or CEO\u2019s or landlords or bankers or anyone abuse me.I never went along to get along.I was very discerning about debt and mostly avoided it. And I never bought stuff mindlessly or to impress others.I was always wary about conventional wisdom.",

            "answer_text": "these are 10 things can improve your career 10 Things You Can Do To Improve Your Career TODAY 1. Set small goals regularly When it comes to annual reviews, there is so much focus on goals for the year. A year is a long time; too long in fact to set tangible, achievable goals. Therefore, it is far more wise to set smaller goals throughout the year. Think about your day-to-day work. What could you be doing to elevate that work? Are there skills you could learn to help you advance? Think about this for a bit and then make a list of goals that relate to these items. And then, once you\u2019ve set the goals, give yourself a deadline to have learned these things. When you\u2019ve hit the deadline\u2026 give yourself a grade. Seriously. It works. Did you do it? Did you do it well? Then ask someone else how they would score or grade you on these new skills. Then rinse and repeat. 2. Stretch yourself The smartest of us say that success is just outside our comfort zone. So, it goes without saying that you must stretch beyond your area of expertise. Do something that scares you. Don't like public speaking, start signing up for presentations at work or networking events. Does it terrify you to put your industry thoughts out there? Ask someone for the opportunity to guest post. Whatever gives you the collywobbles; sign up for it, today. ",

            "answer_text": "Be present. This may sound like an odd piece of advice but the truth is that if you are not present or aware in your career you will drift off course, fail to create or recognise the opportunities that come your way and find yourself far from the place you set out to be. You are a work in progress. You are a work in progress and therefore so is your career. As you change and grow as an individual so do the things you want from your career. Take time to understand your own needs and wants and make a plan to integrate these into your career plan. Understand and welcome change. Many people fear change in their jobs and career. Instead of approaching change with a fearful attitude try to welcome the opportunities it can bring. Yes, things may appear unclear or the change feel unwelcome at first but it\u2019s better for you if you can work with it. Change is a constant especially now we are experiencing the true effects of technology and the digital age which is leading to totally new career opportunities and reshaping the jobs we do. If you are not present or aware of what is happening around you, in your industry and your organisation you will not be prepared to deal with your current situation or any future opportunities that flow from that because you won\u2019t have acquired the necessary skills to move forward. Keep learning. One of the key reasons people move on from their jobs is because they have ceased learning. They perform their job on auto pilot and oftentimes they are bored. Boredom leads us to focus on the wrong things and divert us from our purpose. People who are constantly learning are rarely bored because they are learning new things. When you are learning you become aware of new ideas and opportunities. We expand our critical thinking and develop more of an openness to possibly. And, when you are open to possibilities you are more able to take calculated risks in your career that can move you forward. Take responsibility for your own career management Your career is YOUR responsibility. Your career development is not the responsibility of your employer. A good employer can facilitate your learning but they can\u2019t define it for you. They can outline a pathway for what they need their employees to do for the good of the organisation. If that fits with your career plan - great. But in reality, it is up to you to define your career direction and make a plan that will take you there. ",

Because today either you want to be employed or start your own enterprise, the people you would be dealing with in either of those options are looking for someone who knows their stuff alright. I\u2019m not undermining the importance of a university degree (well I myself am a masters pursuant at the moment) but signifying the underlying truth about today\u2019s scenario. Scenario: Currently I\u2019m a masters student in Renewable Energy Engineering and am a chemical engineer by bachelor training. Right after my bachelors degree I succeeded in achieving a technical job as a junior engineer in a cement company, which is pretty decent for someone with that qualification in India. I did have plans for masters degree abroad to start with, but was in a dilemma to choose between the two options right in front of me at the time. I chose to seek advice from my professors, seniors, parents and fellow mates. If not all, most of them advised me to follow through higher education in continuation of my bachelors reasoning that it\u2019s really difficult to get back to university life when one gets into a job. The job offer was a 5 years\u2019 contract and the pay well, wasn\u2019t really up to my expectation. As evident, I chose to side with the advice and pursued higher education. Result: I\u2019m at a very reputed university and am pretty satisfied by my learning and doing fairly well with academics as well, but I\u2019m 23, graduating with 2 degrees and have absolutely nil work experience. When I look for technical jobs even in the new field I stepped into, my profile suits the educational qualifications they require but when it comes to the experience part, I become ineligible. Most of the jobs today, particularly in engineering field l, need recruits to be previously exposed to the engineering, operations and maintenance, design aspects to some extent if not a lot. Inference: I may be great at the theoretical knowledge university is laying off on me, but in a practical sense I am still wet behind the ears. As a result I have to stick to jobs even as part time one, like retail, services, sales, marketing (etc the list is long) but nothing technical, that I actually want to pursue. It\u2019s not that I am not trying, (trust me I send out about 7 different cover letter every day) but inexperience hits me almost everywhere. I understand graduate programs offered by companies are meant for people like me, but a straight up, to the point advice I\u2019d give is always gain work experience, the field you want to end up in, by whatever means you can . It actually helps you go a long way ahead. Hope it helps. Cheers! ",

Well, here we have talked about skill, it means that either he is living his life with old knowledge, he doesn\u2019t try to upgrade skill, and not have knowledge about whats will go on in the future? but some students and employers be serious about his career. He always tries to do something new. For example(Student):- A student who is studying from b.com and he always wants that he should have knowledge of science and also know history as well. Next example for Employer:- Like that an employer who\u2019s doing the job in MNCs, and also he does work hard for what? for a good salary and quick promotion, he always wants and tries to learn something new(new technology ideas, new course ideas, own business ideas. etc) from senior.  This is the exact thing for students or employers to boost, upgrade and upgrade their skills. 5 Tips for best ways to get ahead in your career Dr. Tracey Wilen-Daugenti, vice president and managing director of Apollo Research Institute and visiting scholar at Stanford University's Media X program, recommends five additional career management strategies. Set goals and create a plan to achieve them:-Could your career development and management use help to gain momentum? People who are the most successful and satisfied in their careers have proactively determined what they want from work. Develop a timeline, including milestones:-Bringing your boss and their sponsorship and mentoring into the picture will ensure that you have an internal mentor who will help you manage your career. Utilize company programs:-Some companies have formal programs to help employees develop their careers. In others, you will need to informally pursue your career development. Companies with programs generally focus energy on helping employees develop and follow a career path. Own your career path:-A career path can be discussed at several bi-annual meetings with your boss. Some companies demonstrate a deep commitment to their employees by assisting where possible with resources of time and dollars. However, remember that it is your career path. Write it down:-Career paths are recommended for the same reason that goals are recommended. They are the written plan that can help each employee take charge of what is most important to his or her fulfillment and success. Without a plan, you can feel rudderless and you have no benchmark against which you can measure your progress.  Here are the top 5 points(which related to me) for career growth. Think positiveCan\u2019t stop learningAlways big thinkLearn future technologyLearn about different jobFor example in Learn future technology, I\u2019ll suggest you learn Blockchain Technology for students and learn blockchain technology for the employer. What is Blockchain technology? Blockchain technology is the revolutionary technology that was first invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is a pseudonym. Initially, it was the technology behind the digital currency, Bitcoin, which is nothing but a form of digital (Cryptocurrency) which can be used in place of Fiat money for trading but it has opened up other avenues of its use across the World. Don Tapscott definition provides a nice concise description: The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. You can read more about blockchain and how it works CLICK HERE And If you want to learn about the history of blockchain then CLICK HERE I never told you its blog to help you in a growth career but its the most important part of getting a better solution for go best ways.

            "answer_text": "Generically: Success is not necessarily the result of hard work, but very few people that are successful are not hard working. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and others come to mind. In fact it\u2019s funny how those that work the hardest seem to be so lucky and successful, and those who don\u2019t\u2026aren\u2019t. So work hard! No matter how smart or how clever you may be (the turtle and the hare comes to mind) if you don't make an effort and work hard, all is for naught. For you have created but not carried out! Work smarter if you don\u2019t want to work harder (PD: More on this at the end), in other words make your brain work instead of your brawn. Even so there are times, and you have to know when that happens, that you just have to wrap up your sleeves, pick up the shovel and start digging, for no matter how much thinking and planning you made, there comes a time for action and you have to do it with equal, if not more, enthusiasm. On work itself: Revise your work very thoroughly before you deliver it, making certain there are no errors, minor mistakes or even details in its presentation. Do this until you consistently are delivering quality work that gets no comments (serious comments, you will always get some due to differences in style!)Always react politely and with a smile to suggestions and criticismIf you commit a mistake, make certain you never, ever commit it again!Make an effort to deliver all your work on time, and if possible ahead of scheduleYou may have to work longer and harder for a period, but the effort should eventually pay offIf possible offer your help to othersIf in doubt...ask! It's better to ask than to commit a mistake!Never give, up, be persistent, you will eventually get thereOn work ethics: - Treat \"everybody\" with respect - Always say Please and Thank You - When on the phone, or in a conversation or discussion, avoid raising your voice, there are people working nearby - Never (ever) get angry - Don't talk about politics or religion, you will never reach an agreement, and don't talk about women, you never know when you may be talking about somebody's relative - Never be late - Don't chatter in the hallways, people are working nearby - Leave the coffee room clean In general be a gentleman or a lady and act accordingly! PD: I have always been kind of lazy although very responsible, and hate doing things twice, the hard way or with excessive effort. I usually find ways and systems to do what has to be done, as soon as possible and with a minimum effort, so I can get on with what I really want to do. When I studied in the Naval Academy far from my home I lived at a friend\u2019s home during weekends. I loved and still do love, reading, and spent as many hours as I could during those weekends...reading. My classmate\u2019s mother would get exasperated with me because she considered that spending so much time sitting down doing nothing except reading, meant that I was lazy (maybe she wasn't wrong!). One day she asked both her son and me to paint the boards to set up a picket fence for the garden. Each of us got about 60 boards to paint. My classmate started immediately, he picked up the first board, painted one side then the other and finally both rims, set it aside to dry, picked up the next one and so on. I looked at him and saw this was going to take like \u201cforever\u201d, so I thought it over a bit and came up with a better idea. I set up all 60 boards against a wall side by side and painted the first side all at one time. Then I rotated them till the first rim was visible and painted all sixty of them again. When I had rotated and painted the boards all the way around, I set them out to dry. I then turned back to my friend and he obviously still had a long way to go, so I picked up my book and started reading again. The lesson here is you have to do what you have to do - you just don\u2019t have to do it the hard way. Cutting corners is beneficial as long as you get the job done, well and on time. Before you start any task I suggest you spend a spell thinking it over before you start. It is amazing the time you can save just by analyzing a situation without moving one finger. It is time well spent and well earned. Don\u2019t feel guilty about sitting and thinking. Generally the time you spend thinking is returned tenfold. In other words make your brain, and not your brawn, work for you. Having said the former, there are times when the only alternative is to wrap up your sleeves and slog your way until the work is finished, no matter how long it takes or how tired you are. A smart guy is capable of knowing when he has to do which. The really smart guy plans, prepares, simplifies, systemizes and looks for the fastest way to do the job. Yet once all is said and done and the only alternative is to sweat it out, you do it, then, there, and with your best disposition. ",

At some of the other point in life you will get bored from your career choice. That is a time when you might contemplate on \u201cI wish I would have tried that earlier\u201d My experience till I am 23 looks like this: At the age of 12, I wanted to be a cardiologist. The reason being my mom's heart problem. I was very sure of being a cardiologist and curing that problem for others. Life gave me a reality check when I was studying biology. I realised it is a very long journey of giving NEEt to MBBS to Master's which will take atleast 7 years after my 12th. Belonging to a family from Tier II city in Gujarat, I did not have enough colleges for medical. I had to move out of the state which was not at all possible due to family restrictions. I took commerce, planning to do BBA and manage my family business. I am a character who will prefer out if the box thing, be it career or any other option. So I got trapped into CFA which was an upcoming field at that point of time. Although my family had never restricted me nor pressurised me in choosing a particular stream. I cleared CFA Level I and was totally frustrated by my choice. Till then I realized that my interest lies in Education field as I see a lot of students not realising what to do with their careers. That is when I wanted to work towards uninformed career decision. I was researching on the same while doing a job in marketing in an education company. After my Bachelors, I quit my job, went for a trek and took an admission in ISME for Masters in Entrepreneurship in Mumbai. It was again a trending and upcoming field. Till then I knew I want to work on solving uninformed career decision as a problem through my company/start-up. During my Master's I found Think Young in May 2018. It is an Entrepreneurship and Leadership Academy for students aged 11 and beyond wherein we allow a child to experience being an Entrepreneur and develop 21st century skills. I am also currently learning Digital Marketing. So to summarize, one must keep on learning and exploring new career options throughout the life. Exploring them while in school is recommended. Take upon internships, read about various careers, meet people from different careers and ask them about the same, try developing diverse skills but NEVER opt for career counselling or DMIT. ",

It doesn\u2019t hurt to occasionally stay a little late or come in a little early either. But one tactic that I think is overlooked is leaving the company. Many times people who are great at their job get pigeon-holed into their position. The company will give you decent, more-than-cost-of-living increases in salary, but it\u2019s really just enough to keep you where you are. However, if you apply for a position \u201ca level up\u201d at a competitor, you may get more attention. I don\u2019t remember the source, but an article I read did research on salary and tenure. Employees who stay at one company for longer than two years are generally underpaid. You can thwart that just the same with this tactic. It\u2019s not for everyone, because many people don\u2019t enjoy change. After all, there\u2019s a large cost to change. But its benefits could significantly outweigh its costs. ",

Assume in any given situation where you have a message to communicate that you have thirty seconds of the other person's full attention. During that time they will take in a lot of information about you from your appearance, manner and delivery which they will use, along with the words and gestures you use, to determine how interesting your idea or proposal could be. At this point, the detail doesn't matter, what you have to get across is that for the other person, dealing with you is useful and worth their (later) time. Get implicit agreement in principle and the rest is just application.Learn to work with yourself; an unpleasant truth in my eyes is that in service-based jobs people generally work very inefficiently. If you look at the productivity demands placed on production line or factory staff, who are often low-paid, and compare this with the output of office staff, it can look like very little gets done in the time available. This is what advisers mean by focus; define tasks clearly, allocate time (resources) to each, complete each task, evaluate your work and present it. By concentrating on producing output over time (with the right quality) you will shine in comparison with fellow workers on the same pay grade.Finally, a word about office politics. It's real, its wasteful and its a pain. If you find yourself in a place where office politics dominates progress, get out and find somewhere new. ",

To stand out from your peers, you must have superior debating and public speaking skills. This variable may have a disproportionate impact on your career as measured by value of investment. Put simply, you have to be a confident speaker, capable of engaging individuals, and groups under all circumstances. This applies equally to the technologies of presenting your work such as power point. Second, this is related to the first. Your writing skills matter. You will be responsible for generating well-structured and well-written reports and proposals, make sure you stand out from your peers with world-class writing. Third, be disciplined and organized. Develop procedures for anything that matters. Keep a journal of ideas, and a journal of daily activities and contacts. When things go wrong, and they always do, being organized is an advantage as you can systematically look backwards from more than method. To sum up: the best public speakers and communicators get noticed first and most, this is the single best piece of advice I could give a young person. Your writing skills matter, and being organized makes life much easier. ",

Note that this is about \"doing\", not being someone or some position. 2- Specialize and commit to skills upgrades- Many careers require specialization or some require add-ons.  Ensure that you are always keeping your skills up to date.  For example, if you are a Project Manager (PMI) or a Service Manager (ITIL), ensure you keep your certifications current until you've reached a high enough level.  Or if you are going towards cyber-security, you have to build up to it through experience and credential.  Sometimes this isn't necessary, it depends on your environment. 3- Be curious- See Daryl Capuano's post regarding exploratory work.  It is good to pursue interests and passions if only for self-enrichment.  You might discover a path you would have never considered.  Alternatively, the passion may enhance your main career. ",

If you move before you\u2019ve finished a significant project, you are probably moving too soon. If you move because the job is not \u201cfulfilling\u201d or because you don't like your boss, or because \u201cthey just aren\u2019t recognizing my talents\u201d, you are most likely moving for the wrong reason.

The best time to move is when you\u2019ve finished something you are proud of, you want to try something new, and you are approached with new, more challenging work. ",

You also need some luck. The more senior you get (unless you are a once-in-a-generation genius in your field), the more success comes down to communication and relationship-building. You need to be able to communicate why your ideas are important and how they will fulfill the goals of funding agencies. You need to be a good listener so that you really understand those priorities. You need to be able to explain why your findings matter and and what should change as a result. You need to build collaborations that people enjoy working in and that achieve their over-arching goals. You need to know how to bring the best out of your collaborators, staff and/or students through difficult times, and to help them to achieve their own goals. You need to build networks so that your expertise will be sought out. You still need your technical expertise, but you will find yourself spending less and less time at the lab-bench, in the field, or at the code-face and more time working with people. ",

If you're really, really great at what you do, or even at what they do, the tendency is to be a non-follower. It's not competing necessarily, it's simply not following. And there's lots of good reasons why. The boss is a flake. He communicates poorly. He doesn't recognize who is carrying the load and who has lots of time to spend garnering credit. Whatever his flaws, the job will suddenly work if you pull with him instead of against him. Find ways to help him succeed. And he doesn't have to change and he doesn't have to succeed for it to transform your career. It has to do with where you had to move to support a leader, the space you had to create. Standing in the shoes of the leader, comprehending the sense and the dread of responsibility that comes with the role, changes you, prepares you to be a leader. It happened for me almost effortlessly and almost instantaneously after a lot of years of non-following. ",

But I would not be the best possible teacher I could be if I didn\u2019t keep on expanding my scientific content knowledge. So last year I read On the Origin of Species. I have taught evolutionary biology for a decade but I never read the entirety of Darwin\u2019s seminal work. I didn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d to read it all (and I breezed through some of the slower chapters) - I know enough to teach what is a relatively surface level of evolutionary biology. But to understand just how much effort Darwin put in to developing evidence gave me significant insight into just how amazing his theory was and continues to be. It informs my teaching and expands my enthusiasm for continued teaching. It allows me to continue to be excited for teaching the same topic every year; knowing that I \u201cknow\u201d my topic better and have greater command of the facts and that my expertise and ability to convey the material is stronger makes this the best job I could imagine.

Be able and keep moving with one armdistaance from doing and actual results : verify are you doing right things first time and dre you doing first the right things.9. Reapeat this loop until your all packets are over.10. Once thats over , you will not be found here asking questions but helping others reach their speific growths .. Leverage ur strengths and focus ur working point ( professsion). Success is only that distant from you , that distance is how fast you can complete the points 1 to 10 with accuracy. Otherwise you might not 100% of your goal but also say not in proper time ... you dont want to drive F1 race whhen there is no competition ",

The percentage of young adults who actually explore is so low, that when you do so and demonstrate passionate curiosity, respect and appreciation towards Guides, you'll stand out. Guides are loose tie connections who really want to help Explorers. The Explorer simply asks for some of the Guide's time. She's not looking for the end all Mentor, she's just looking for knowledge, information and wisdom. Following that initial conversation she asks the Guide if it'd be all right to touch base in the future and if they'd be interested in her progress.  Btw, the second most important thing an Explorer does following a visit with a Guide is to send a hand written thank you note. The first? Well it's a combination. Heart-fully thank the Guide in person and ask if they know of anyone else who would be willing to spend a twenty minutes in a similar conversation. ",

Ususally young people are very confused with what they want to do in life and keep wasting time in searching for their passion or in discovering their calling. The best way to know your passion is to do what you get in a best possible way. With time, you will discover your calling. The best advantage of this thing is that, the early you start, more the time you have to discover your passion. This is the best way for a good career development. ",
