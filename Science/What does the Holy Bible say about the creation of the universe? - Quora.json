            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Old Testament, which in Genesis, is an account of nature, and If it were to be asked to describe the natural world, the answer would be that the world was created in six days and that stars were little points of light that could fall out of the sky. That\u2019s one sign of Revelation and of the \u201cSecond Coming\u201d is that the stars will fall out of the sky and land on earth. To even write that shows that they really don\u2019t know what those things are and have no concept of what the actual universe really is. So everybody who tried to make proclamations about the actual universe, based on Biblical passages, got the wrong answer. So when science discovers things and you want to believe the Bible is unerring, they go back, reinterpret that, and say that they didn\u2019t mean that literally but figuratively. So this whole reinterpretation of how the the figurative and poetic passages are, came \u201cafter\u201d science showed that, that\u2019s not how things unfolded. The Bible is used for \u201cspiritual enlightenment\u201d and \u201cemotional fulfillment\u201d and not a source for science\u201d. Science has no position on wether god exists or not, so the inferences apply solely to the facts science expresses. - Neil deGrasse Tyson - ",

            "answer_text": "What does the Bible say about the origin of the universe? It says that god spoke light into existence and then separated the light from the darkness thus making the first day. It also says that god created the sun and moon on the fourth day. So where did the light come from on that first three days? And how long was a day? This might have assuaged the curiosity of some Bronze-Age peasants in the same way that the very different creation myths of other religions did, but the question must be asked why there is anybody at all in a first-world educated country that takes this literally today. Biblical literalism can only result from indoctrination of the young and the prevention of development of critical thinking skills. ",
