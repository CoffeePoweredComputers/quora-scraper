            "answer_text": "Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem is not known as that because it was the last theorem he came up with, but because it was the last one to be proven or shown to be wrong. Fermat noted his \u201cmarvelous proof\u201d of this in 1637. He came up with Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem in 1640, the same year as he wrote about his theorem on the sum of two squares to Mersenne. He contributed extensively to probability theory in the 1640s and 1650s. I am sure there is more. ",
