            "answer_text": "One way is to compare escape velocities. Escape velocity is the minimun speed needed for a free, non-propeled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body. From the Moon that speed is 2.38km/sec, from Earth 11.2km/sec. That means that you need 2.82MegaJoule to extract 1kg from the surface of the Moon and 62,72MegaJoule to do the same from the Earth surface. This is only calculating work against gravity. ",
