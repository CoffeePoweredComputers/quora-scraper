            "answer_text": "Is this island off the coast of Europe or Scotland or 1,000 miles southwest of Tahiti? Are there dock facilities? Are there natural sources for building rock, gravel and sand? On any island exposed to marine storms, hurricanes or typhoons and probably earthquakes in the Pacific \u2014 the logical building technique would be Monolithic Domes, which are proven to be totally safe from hurricanes/typhoons/wildfire/earthquakes/lightning/hail, including wind speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour, plus reducing all HVAC costs by 80%, virtually eliminating exterior maintenance costs.As for cost, that harbor could cost $1-Million or $10-Million, Costs for the airport could vary from $20,000 with perfectly flat smooth ground to start with to another $10-Million.Then initial investment for combined solar field and wind powered electrical generation and satellite communications services \u2014 Telephone/Internet/TV and radio, plus full emergency communications with both 100 foot tower and ground level antenna array.After that \u2014 road, water, sewer, solid waste collection/recycling, communications, administration and education infrastructure \u2014-PLUS medical facilities, at least six staff members and ten in-patient rooms, an O.R., Intensive Care and Emergency Room services. All utilities constructed underground within clear easements.Don\u2019t forget recreation \u2014 tennis, golf, archery, bocce ball, shuffleboard; Hiking trails, picnic areas; Football, lacrosse, field hockey; Community fishing boats, multiple sail boats/water ski/pontoon boats for residents and visitors \u2014 hopefully many with MONEY. [A single \u201cgo fast\u201d Police boat.]A Monolithic Dome central structure could provide visitor cabana suites, deluxe apartments with retractable balconies, one and two bedroom apartments and evern studio apartments \u2014 along with the administrative offices, community center with multi use for basketball/volleyball and a community auditorium,/dance floor.Are there perfect natural locations for harbor, airport, water/sewage plants?How much earthwork and site preparation will be required for each structure, the harbor, airport and all other facilities? How much base preparation will be needed for each section of streets and roads?",

So if anyone gives you a price tag for the project, he/she doesn't known their staff. If you want an estimate you can contact me and I will do it for you, but for price. ",
