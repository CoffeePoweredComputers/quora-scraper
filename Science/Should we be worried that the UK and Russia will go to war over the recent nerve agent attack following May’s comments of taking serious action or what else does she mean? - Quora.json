            "answer_text": "What everyone in the world should be worrying about is the apparent belief of Putin and the Russians that they can do anything they like, when they like and where they like. The police are now reinvestigating the mysterious deaths of over 12 Russian opponents of Putin in the UK. Putin, portrays himself as the big man, a world leader, strongman when if fact he is a petulent whimp. He is making big the forthcoming presidential elections in Russia but won\u2019t explain how or why almost all his oppenents have been barred from standing for election, suffered unfortunate fatal accidents, or just plain disappeared. He is obviously afraid and probably incapable of conducting a debate within a normal political forum. That should be no surprise, his most vociferal opponents, now living in exile, have found out the level and nature of Putin\u2019s corruption - 8 billion Euros (at least) in his private Swiss and other hidden accounts, his clear connections to Russian criminal gangs, clear involvement or connection with criminal money laundering on a massive scale, disregard for human rights, authorising the deliberate bombing by Russian military forces of civilians, including the use of banned munitions including chemical weapons, in clear contrevention of international law, shooting down of MH017, deployement of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, annexation of the Crimea and now the cold blooded murder of his opponents in the UK by use of banned chemical weapons which may have contaminated hundreds of ordinary, innocent civilians. We also have seen clear evidence a Russian state sponsored drug abuse by atheletes not only at Sochi but also at the recent Korean games. Many world governments have registered various objections about Putin\u2019s behaviour yet will gladly all attend the forthcoming World Cup and allow Putin to wallow in his glory in front of the Russian people. It is clear that only Putin\u2019s power base can remove him and that is the Russian people. Ecconomic sanctions serve to hurt the people, they don\u2019t effect the super rich Putin and his close power weilding friends. Take his glory away from him and expose him for the real evil tyrant he is, no more handshakes with his blood soaked hands, no more invites to G8/G20 or any other forums, challenge Russians at every opportunity in the UN, boycott world sporting events, don\u2019t invite the Russians anywhere. I would also like to see individuals take some actions, don\u2019t accept Russian tourists, ban them from your hotels, tell them they are not welcome in your communities and when they ask why - because we don\u2019t want out kids exposed to nerve agents ordered by your president Putin. The message will soon get back to the Kremlin and the general population. ",

We and the Russians often prod each other with very long sticks, \u201cQE Carriers are convenient target\u201d being a classic Russian example. We would be very reluctant to wage war on the Russians though. We don't want or need a war, and to be blunt, neither do they. We'll stick to the political squabbling and childish comments for some time yet, I fear. ",
