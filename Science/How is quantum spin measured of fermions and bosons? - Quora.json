            "answer_text": "The spin of a particle is typically deduced from it\u2019s magnetism. We fire a stream of particles through a magnet, and they are deflected according to their magnetic moment. The spin angular-momentum is determined by dividing out the magnetic part. It is also possible to check this by firing spin-polarized particles at a non-rotating target, and time how long it takes to rotate at some speed. ",
