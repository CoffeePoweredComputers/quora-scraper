            "answer_text": "A living organism. Or just organism works too, you can\u2019t have a non-living organism. You can\u2019t say cell because there are multicellular organisms. You can\u2019t name any of the classifications of life because that would not include all living organisms. So living organism or just organism is all I can think of. Or maybe \u201clife\u201d? I don\u2019t think that works, since it refers to life as a whole not any individual organisms. ",
