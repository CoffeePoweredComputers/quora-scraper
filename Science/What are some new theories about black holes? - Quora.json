            "answer_text": "I am not an astrophysicist, but I do have a degree in physics so I will tell you what I know; it should serve as an introduction to the subject. Black holes are basically burned out stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and start to collapse inward on themselves. If the stars are initially large enough, somewhat larger than our Sun, the collapse continues until they collapse into a point and vanish. However, their gravitational field remains - the black hole. To an outside observer, the black hole would be invisible although its gravitational effect would still be felt. If one gets too close to it, however, strange things start to happen. The black hole\u2019s gravity becomes so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape and everything will be sucked into it. The black hole has become a cosmic vacuum cleaner! The nearest black hole to Earth is apparently in the constellation Cygnus, about 20 light years away. We can detect it by its gravity and also by the radiation given off by infalling material as it vanishes into the hole. There may be many more black holes in the Milky Way galaxy and in other galaxies; this is an active subject of research. At present it is even thought that a giant black hole of a mass of many millions of Suns lies at the center of the Milky Way and all other galaxies, this is again an active subject of research. What happens precisely to an object after it crosses a black hole\u2019s Schwarzschild radius, the point of no return after which the object can no longer escape from the black hole, is another subject of active research. At first everyone thought that there would be no escape for the particle, but in the 1970s a Jacob Bekenstein, along with Stephen Hawking showed that some light might be able to escape from the black hole after all. This is now known as Bekenstein radiation; it is again an active subject of research. A final area of study concerns the fate of particles that have fallen completely into the black hole. Again in the 1970s it was shown that if the black hole were rotating, as almost all of them are, the infalling particle would miss the center of the black hole and its infinite gravity and be ejected back out! The only catch is that it could be ejected at any time and in any area of space! Wormholes might also be involved that could carry this outward radiation. But we have now reached the very frontier of black hole research. I hope that this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects found in outer space. They are objects of extreme density, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape from their grasp if it comes near enough.   Albert Einstein first predicted black holes in 1916 with his general theory of relativity. The term \"black hole\" was coined in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler, and the first one was discovered in 1971.   There are three types: stellar black holes, supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes. Stellar black holes \u2014 small but deadly  \tWhen a star burns through the last of its fuel, it may find itself collapsing. For smaller stars, up to about three times the sun's mass, the new core will be a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to fall in on itself to create a stellar black hole.   According the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, \"the Milky Way contains a few hundred million\" stellar black holes.  Supermassive black holes \u2014 the birth of giants  \tSmall black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. Supermassive black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun, but have a radius similar to that of Earth's closest star. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way.  \tScientists aren't certain how such large black holes spawn. Once they've formed, they can easily gather mass from the dust and gas around them, material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies, allowing them to grow to enormous sizes.\t    Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge together. Large gas clouds could also be responsible, collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass. A third option is the collapse of a stellar cluster, a group of stars all falling together.  Intermediate black holes \u2013 stuck in the middle  \tScientists once thought black holes came in only small and large sizes, but recent research has revealed the possibility for the existence of midsize, or intermediate, black holes (IMBHs). Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction.   Several of these forming in the same region could eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole. In 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy. Interesting facts about black holes  If you fell into a black hole, theory has long suggested that gravity would stretch you out like spaghetti, though your death would come before you reached singularity. But a 2012 study in Nature suggests that quantum effects would cause the event horizon to act much like a wall of fire, instantly burning anyone to death. Black holes do not \"suck.\" Suction is caused by pulling something into a vacuum, which the massive black hole definitely is not. Instead, objects fall into them.  \t \t\tAstronomers estimate there are anywhere from 10 million to a billion stellar black holes, with masses roughly thrice that of the sun, in the Milky Way.  If a star passes too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart. Recently Nolan introduced stunning pic of black hole called Gargantua in his movie Interstellar.
