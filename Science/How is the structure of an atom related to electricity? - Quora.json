            "answer_text": "The electrons of the valence shell, the outermost layer of electrons, are the most significant feature of any substance in regards to electrical conductivity. An atom (or molecule) with 3 or less electrons in the valence shell is more conductive; 5 or more electrons in the valence shell makes it less conductive/dielectric/insulating. A Valence shell with 4 electrons makes a semiconductor, not a good conductor, but also not a great insulator, but Very valuable when it comes to making effective diodes, transistors and other semiconductor devices for all modern electronics.
