            "answer_text": "All of those sound like useful skills, but not particularly crucial to scientific research. Mainly you seem to think there is some speed component, where there is almost none. In fact the opposite talent is far more useful. Persistence and the ability to adapt in the face of repeated failure. Once you are doing research you are generally pretty deep into the field you are working and probably one of a pretty small number of people that have a command of most of the knowledge in that area. As a result you will be comfortable and generally happy to discuss any area of your work at almost any time, including people asking you lots of questions. No cramming or memorization is necessary, it is literally the area of knowledge you helped discover and know the best. So there is almost no speed requirement of any kind ever. At the beginning of a project you might spend a few days or weeks doing a literature search to get some depth on the area of study. Being good at reading papers certainly would help, but if you took two or three weeks instead of one week no one is going to notice. Stress certainly exists in the life of a researcher, but it is of a far more existential nature, and generally not any immediate stress. By choosing to go into research you have chosen to give yourself quite a bit of freedom. But you do worry whether things will work, because you won't know for years if ever. Also for many areas of scientific research you have made a choice to make far less money than you would otherwise, this can cause some stress especially in early career scientists. In general it is not clear to me where your idea of scientific research comes from, except some movie montage where everything happens all at once. Expanding the boundaries of human knowledge is generally slow work and prone to repeated failure and that is source of most of the struggle in research. ",

            "answer_text": "Different people will give you different answers, as questions you ask are quite subjective. Here are my 2 cents:1. Remembering information is useful, but not that important. But comprehension is important. Researchers learn constantly, and they have to read tons of research papers; often not just to learn new concepts, but to keep up with state of the art.2. Nowadays science is not that much stroke of insight, but a day-to-day work. Sometimes experiments produce unexpected results, but the sole fact of this is expected;3. That would help, especially when you are studying and/or taking classes. But for scientist - not that important;4. I\u2019d put it No. 1. There\u2019s lots of competition, and, as a result, lots of stress in modern science. In addition to stress coming from competition, add stress from- strained finances. Young scientists and professors don\u2019t earn decent money;- relationships. When a husband or a wife is a scientist, family life is not easy at all;- social pressure. Your friends in industry work on stable, well-paid jobs; buying decent houses; go travelling on vacations and sometimes even have time for hobbies and personal interests. Young scientists - I\u2019m not talking of established, famous scientists - generally don\u2019t have these luxuries. ",
