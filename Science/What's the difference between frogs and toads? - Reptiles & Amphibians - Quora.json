Toads are family of frogs, Bufonidae, although there are many species outside of Bufonidae that are called toads. However, I can explain some characteristics of Bufonidae from other frogs. Live in non aquatic habitats as adultsDry, warty skinMost toads crawl because of their short hind legsNo teethMore plump (however, many frogs from different families are even more plump than toads, so this is not a fair comparison)Lay eggs in chain formations Once again, Toads are family Bufonidae, frogs are order Anura which contains toads. So really, toads are frogs and some frogs are toads. ",
