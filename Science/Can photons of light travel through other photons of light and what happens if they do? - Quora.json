            "answer_text": "Yes they just pass through each other. It is a bosonic phenomenon largely where photons which are gauge bosons of the electromagnetic field can occupy the same state and not interfere with each other. They do not obey Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle unlike Fermions which do. This ramifies into traveling photons just crossing each other with no consequences. They can very rarely collide from opposite directions with each photon converting to an electron and a positron pair, and each electron combining with the other positron giving rising to a photon again, and the same happens to the other pair leading to a second photon formation with two photons emerging just like they bounced off of each other ! Experimentally this can be done on rare occasions also. There is total conservation of energy here following Einstein\u2019s mass-energy equivalence. For a photon to transform into an electron-positron pair the photon must have sufficient energy to convert to the combined mass of the electron and positron pair ! This is mostly feasible for photons of gamma rays ! High energy photon that has sufficient energy to convert to the two masses transiently. Photons of much less frequency can not transform into electron-positron pairs. This above conversion and reconversion back is instantaneous and occurs only with sufficiently high energy photons, and only when they collide or are made to collide in an experimental setting, and its occurrence is rare. In the greatest majority of situations the photons just cross each other, or pass through each other without any issues ! Kaiser T, MD(Life long physics, math, cosmology and science proponent). ",

            "answer_text": "Most physicists ignore the photon interference that occurs because of the interacting electromagnetic fields between photons. It is most noticeable when the two photons are very nearly the same frequency. It can cause photons to change direction and appear at a different location. It kind of amazes me that they always forget about this and when you bring it up they try to say that the photons are not interacting. Yet clearly the presence of a photon makes another photon change direction. Or more specifically, it changes the probability of the photon being detected near point A from near unity to near zero. Other than interference, photon-photon scattering in the absence of matter is extremely low probability and has only been observed at very high photon energies. In the presence of changed particles and atoms, all sorts of nonlinear interactions occur. Multi-photon fluorescence, multi-photon absorption, frequency multiplication, Raman scatter, stimulated Brillouin scatter, and four-wave mixing are just a few examples. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, it happens all the time, even when we do something as simple as turn on two lights in a room. Both lights make their own shadows, and that means that photons from both lights are going right through each other without any problem at all. This is one of the defining characteristics of particles called bosons. They not only don't mind being in the same place at the same time, but they rather enjoy it. That latter feature is what leads to lasers, where the photons all join together to do exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. Incidentally, the really rare case is is not when protons pass through each other, but when they do interact directly with each other. This requires photons of extremely high energy that are headed directly towards each other, in which case they can very rarely produce a positron-electron pair. This is the time-reverse version of matter-antimatter annihilation. ",

            "answer_text": "Photons do travel through each other in free space. This property is called linearity. Space is linear for photons of low energy. The situation is different for gamma rays photons whose energy is approaching the mass-equivalent energy of an electron, i.e. 0.511 MeV. Two such photons can create a momentary pair of electron-positron that later annihilate each other back to a pair of photons and the end result is that the two photons have interacted with each other and can scatter to different direction as if they were two ping pong balls. Edit: actual photon-photon scattering without the presence of matter is extremely rare and has been observed only at very high energies in the >5 GeV range and only in recent years.
