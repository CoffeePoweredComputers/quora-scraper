            "answer_text": "For Metals (s-block) reactivity is defined as their ability/ease with which they release electrons. Whereas for non-metals (p-block) reactivity is the ease of acceptance of electrons. Group 1A (Group-I) consists of alkali metals. As one goes down along this group the size of atom increases. Hence energy required to remove ns[math]^1[/math] electron decreases down the group.i.e. Ionization energy decreases down the group.  Group 7A (Group-XVIII) consists of halogens ns[math]^2[/math]np[math]^5[/math]. As one goes down this group the size of atom increases. But here the effective nuclear charge decreases due to increase in size and hence the ability of these atoms to accept electron reduces down the group.i.e. Electron affinity decreases down the group.
