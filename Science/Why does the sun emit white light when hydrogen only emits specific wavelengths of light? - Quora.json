            "answer_text": "Because it is incorrect to model the spectral emission from the sun as a hydrogen line emission spectrum. If we start in the core of the sun where thermonuclear fusion takes place the photons released are gamma ray photons. These photons spread out from the core but undergo countless trillions of interactions with the surrounding plasma, moving closer to the surface and increasing in wavelength as the temperature decreases. Eventually they reach a layer of the sun called the photosphere which emits a continuous spectrum containing all wavelengths within the visible spectrum, ie white light.*  However above the photosphere lies the corona, which is essentially the Suns atmosphere. Here it is not line emission spectra that are important but line absorption spectra. You see hydrogen, helium etc absorb photons at exactly the same energy & frequency at which they emit. So the atmosphere of the sun (or any star) actually create dark bands within the spectrum called Fraunhofer lines. These lines can be used to determine the chemical composition of the star and hence assist with stellar classification. *Note different stars will have different temperatures. Wien\u2019s law states that the black body radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to the temperature. In other words hotter stars are bluer in cooler, cooler stars redder. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy does the sun emit white light when hydrogen only emits specific wavelengths of light?\u201d An atom (such as hydrogen) or a molecule (such as hydrogen) emits specific wavelengths when it isn\u2019t interacting with neighboring atoms and molecules. Bringing together a large number of interacting atoms or molecules creates a large number of new energy states\u2014effectively becoming a continuum at not unreasonable densities. For example, you could have just as easily asked why an incandescent light bulb gives off white light rather than the spectral lines of tungsten, from which the filament is made. The answer is that tungsten metal combines the allowed energies of the individual tungsten atoms into a broad continuum of allowed electron energies. The surface of the sun is a plasma, not a metal, but the same idea applies. There are many interacting hydrogen atoms, so their allowed energies come from the collection, rather than the atoms individually. And there are enough of them to create an effective continuum. ",
