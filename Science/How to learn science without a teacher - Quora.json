            "answer_text": "Read science books. The 'rule of thumb' for children's reading is that as they read a page they put a finger on any word they do not understand; if they use up five fingers then that reading material is probably too tough for them. As an adult your reading experience needs to be different (but do keep in mind that science books written for children may explain science concepts in a much more easily grasped manner). For higher-level (than children) readers here is what I suggest: preview the book by looking at the chapter titlespreview a chapter by looking at the headings and sub-headingsread all the summaries within the chapterbegin to read the paragraphsif you don't understand a paragraph, begin by understanding individual sentencesif you don't understand a sentence, begin by understanding individual wordsif you don't understand a word, use the glossary (or a good dictionary)be active in your reading\u2014try to anticipate what the writer may be trying to say (from your initial overview)if you own the book, make copious notes on the pages about what you're reading\u2014knowledge books aren't meant to be kept pristine; be involved in what you're readingif highlighting (with a highlighter), mark all the thoughts that you think are important and then go back (later, if more appropriate) and underline, with pen or pencil, all the thoughts that are 'core' to your original highlightingwhen you've read an amount that you can retain, set the book aside and write out your best recollection of what the author has said (usually, for me, a paragraph or sub-topic section)YouTube is good for many things. Try to make your learning involve seeing, hearing, and doing. My opinion. ",
