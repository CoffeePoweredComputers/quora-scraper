            "answer_text": "You overestimate the achievements of quantum mechanics to ask such questions. According to quantum mechanics, the world is probablyy non-deterministic (see for instance Wave function collapse - Wikipedia). However, your\u2019s are not the type of questions that quantum mechanics deals with. Quantum mechanics is even more unlikely to answer the \u201cfree will\u201d question. However, inasmuch as this question arises from our perception of relations between space and time, one might be enclined to think that the necessity for the future to result from the past in a uniquely determined manner rather lost ground with the modern views of physics (quantum mechanics - statistical physics - relativity theories).
