            "answer_text": "Maybe you wanted to ask how neutral atoms are converted into cations? A cation is a positively charged ion. So in order to create a cation you have to strip your neutral atom from at least one of its electrons. A convenient and often used way to do that is by using an electron gun. This device \u201cshoots\u201d a beam of electrons into a beam of neutral atoms. These emitted electrons have enough energy to kick out one of the bound electrons of an atom and you end up with cations. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you sure about your question. Did you mean NEUTRAL ATOMS? As far as I know: Atoms are neutral; by taking an electron out of an atom, it is converted in to a cation ( positively charged) and by adding an electron to an atom, it becomes an anion ( negatively charged).
