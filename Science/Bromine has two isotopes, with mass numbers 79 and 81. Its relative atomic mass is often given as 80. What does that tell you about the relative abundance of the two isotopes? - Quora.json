            "answer_text": "You really should do your own homework, but it means they are found in roughly equal amounts. The atomic mass given on the periodic table is the average of the naturally occurring isotopes in their respective amounts. If the number given was 80.5, it would mean that there was proportional more bromine-81 than 79. ",

            "answer_text": "They are almost exactly the same. Because of that a brominated compound is very easy to detect in a mass spectrogram. Take ethylbromide, for example. You will see molecular ions at 108 and 110 at almost the same intensity, and large peaks showing the loss of a methyl group and 93 and 95, again almost the same intensity. ",
