            "answer_text": "Is it possible to block infrared waves by ultrasonic sounds? Ultrasonic sounds are sounds. What are sounds? They are the vibration of the air, but can also exist in liquids and solids. I mention air because that is the usual environment our ears are in, so I speak only of the vibration of air molecules. Infrared is an electromagnetic energy carried by waves/particles of photons. They travel through space, through air, and many other things. Infrared waves in particular can travel through air but some fraction energy is absorbed depending on the frequency of the infrared we are considering. Since we already know infrared can travel through air (go outside in the sun someday, the heat we feel is the infrared), there is really nothing a molecule of air can do that will block this energy. Whether it moves slowly, or at the rate of sound waves, or even ultrasonic frequencies, there is nothing a moving air molecule can do that a still molecule can do. And that\u2019s pretty much nothing to infrared energy. It blows right past air molecules like they were in two different space-time universes. No, ultrasonic or any frequency sounds can not block infrared waves, or radio waves, or light, or x-rays, or pretty much any electromagnetic energy waves. ",
