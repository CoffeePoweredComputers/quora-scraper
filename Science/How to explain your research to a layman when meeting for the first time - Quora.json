            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t. Like most mathematicians (if not most researchers), I work off in an obscure corner of the intellectual universe. I do strange things with abstract stuff like binary trees and matrices and recursion and topology that most laymen have no exposure to and don\u2019t care about. Most people don\u2019t even know that university professors do research. Most people would correctly interpret even a cursory description of \u201cmy research\u201d as a flood of meaningless buzzwords, which I\u2019m just throwing at them to make myself sound smart. That\u2019s just rude. I generally talk about more relatable stuff, like teaching, or office politics, or my kids, or travel. Everyone\u2019s had teachers, everyone\u2019s office has politics, everyone has a family, and we\u2019re probably on a plane. Sometimes, especially if the person I\u2019m talking to solves problems for a living (for example: doctor, teacher, electrician, auto mechanic, blacksmith, video editor, portrait artist), we can talk about the problem-solving process. But few people outside the Ivory Tower have dealt with Referee #2 or fought the Notation Demons, and even fewer have ever tried to (or wanted to) understand the role of homology in computing strictly convex drawings of essentially 3-connected graphs on the torus. (See what I mean?) On the extremely rare occasion that someone I\u2019ve just met actually asks about my research (beyond the level of \u201cI design algorithms\u201d), I usually start with something vague like \u201cIt\u2019s pretty abstract. I draw a lot of donuts.\u201d or \u201cDid you ever play Asteroids? Imagine some of the rocks are connected by rubber bands.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to explain your research to a layperson you\u2019re meeting for the first time, talk to your mother about it! I think this is a great question. Before we start, let\u2019s define the parameters of our conversational setting. If it\u2019s a random layperson, it would be extremely arrogant of me to start talking about my research. I\u2019d rather talk about something that\u2019s interesting for both of us. That said, it\u2019s inevitable that you would run into situations where people do not have a lot of idea about your field of study, but you\u2019re still expected to explain your research to them. This is particularly relevant in a corporate research lab where you\u2019d be collaborating with people from engineering, management, marketing and much more. Back when my advisor was a graduate student, he had to deal with company CEOs directly and present his work, to secure funding for his doctoral research at his university. Even if you\u2019re presenting your paper in a conference, it is always a good idea to motivate the problem in layperson words. This makes the presentation more powerful as most attendees would have something to gain from it. So, knowing how to talk about your work at a high level so that it\u2019s interesting to laypeople, is always a good skill to have in your armory. For me, one thing that really helped develop this skill was talking to my mother about my research. My mother\u2019s always been inquisitive about what I do. Unfortunately, she has an Economics background and she doesn\u2019t get any details whatsoever. Talking to her has really helped me develop a perspective on what a layperson can relate to and what the best way of explaining my work would be. A good way of motivating your work to a layperson would be to keep things on a high/abstract level. A good strategy at first would be to talk about an application or a natural event that they\u2019re bound to experience. For example, in my case I say, \u201cWhen you go to a party, you don\u2019t have a problem talking and listening to your friend even when there are several people talking around you.\u201d Now that they have an idea about the application, you can explain the research problem on a high level again. So I say something along the lines of, \u201cHumans are very good at it, but a computer would get utterly confused. So, my goal is to teach a computer to do that.\u201d If the other person finds the problem interesting, I\u2019ve noticed they often get back with questions that are on a high level again. Now, answering these questions is a lot easier since they set the technicality of the conversation at their comfort level and you just respond to questions.
