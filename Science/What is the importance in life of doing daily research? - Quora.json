            "answer_text": "Research COULD be important, but it tends not to be. Why? Because research is *required* in order to obtain tenure in academic positions (at least in the USA). This means that there are thousands, perhaps millions of grad students out there doing meaningless research for the primary purpose of learning the methodology of research. When these grad students obtain their advanced degrees and go on to accept tenure-track jobs, most take the easy way out re: research. There are few people doing large, grant-funded, multi-center research studies with lofty goals. Most researchers are doing small, limited studies with the primary goal of getting tenure, or if they already have tenure, with the primary intent of being promoted (Assistant Professor to Associate Professor, Associate to full Professor, etc.). These studies tend to have little real relationship with human needs and human suffering. The studies that *might* impact human needs or human suffering tend to be funded by Big Pharma or other profit-making entities, which want nothing but the go-ahead for FDA approval (substitute the agency more appropriate to your profession). There was a Peds Renal physician at the academic health center where I worked as an RN for 25+ years (UF Health at University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida) who was notorious for not even knowing the name of the antibiotic which he was purportedly \u201cresearching.\u201d In truth, the pharmaceutical company that created the antibiotic was running the study, and using the physicians name (and the prestige of the University of Florida) in exchange for a nice sum of money. This is the reality of academic research. I served as a study nurse for several health-related studies. I came across questionnaires that were sloppily constructed, with questions that could be taken several different ways. I remember asking my supervisor about the questions, and she agreed they didn\u2019t make sense, and suggested I call the study center. When I called the study center, they really could not answer my questions and told me nobody had ever asked them to clarify. That tells me that study centers were glossing over the questions and ignoring the content. Obviously this made me question both the worth and the intent of the study. If the intent of the study is to promote a particular medication or treatment, wouldn\u2019t you expect the study creators to care about the content of the study? When I was a research nurse for one particular professor who was renowned in her field, the way she determined her next research study was to have her grad students flip through research journals in her field and \u201cfind me something you think would be a good research study.\u201d Not, \u201cHelp me think about the important questions in our field that, if answered, could improve patient care and patient outcome.\u201d Is research important? Yes, vitally, but not in its present form. Professors have told me that their salary was dependent upon \u201ceat what you kill,\u201d which meant they would be given an office with desks by the University, but anything else (computers, graduate assistant salaries, the professor\u2019s own salary, etc) was expected to be funded by grants. Ethical, important research is a rarity in this country. Millions of animals are sacrificed every year for students to learn a process that is essentially useless to human health. Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor in Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, which is considered to be one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, makes her view of the subject quite plain: \u201cIt is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d  Google Image used for illustrative purposes only. I have no idea who these people are. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "I just read Cixin Liu\u2019s \u201cThree Body Problem\u201d yesterday and am in the mood to answer this question. Some spoilers below, I try to keep things as vague as possible to not give away important plot elements. A well-developed theme of the plot in \u201cThree Body Problem\u201d is how the scientific method, the development of technologies like computing, and the rise of civilizations as a whole is fairly consistent even between civilizations that evolve separately on different planets. The book basically argues that all advancement of civilizations is largely due to the scientific endeavor of questioning how and why the universe works the way it does. That\u2019s research. The plot of the book involves some aliens (Trisolarians) who live on a pretty shitty planet and decide to pack up and relocate to a different planet. Unfortunately, the nearest hospitable planet is 8 light years away, 400-years via sublight interstellar vehicles. To make things worse, it\u2019s already inhabited by sentient, intelligent life so the Trisolarians have to launch an invasion. The foreign planet\u2019s technology is inferior to that of the Trisolarians, but because it takes 400 years to reach that planet, the Trisolarian invaders must account for the fact that when they arrive, the foreign planet will have had 400 years to improve their own technology and weapons. At the timescale of galactic conquest, the top priority in a space invasion is not to assassinate key figures, or stockpile resources, but rather to simply halt the enemy\u2019s scientific progress. This can be done by tampering with scientific experiments (e.g. messing with the results of particle accelerator experiments so the invaded civilization cannot discover how to manipulate higher dimensions, build antimatter weapons, etc.). Just to be safe, the Trisolarians also try to kill mathematicians, theoretical physicsits on the foreign planet first. Okay, let\u2019s discuss the non-fictional, non-futuristic setting. The purpose of research is to push the boundaries of human knowledge about the universe: past, present. Research into history gives present-day policy makers and sovereigns guidance on how to lead nations and govern people, resolve judicial disputes, and determine ethics.  All good authors of fiction/nonfiction alike do huge amounts of research to build up stories/context for their writing. Research into the present solves crime mysteries, develops technology that increases the standard of living for all humans, understands and cures diseases that have plagued people for millennia. Then:  Now:  Research into the basic laws of reality gives us the opportunity to witness \u201ccosmic truths\u201d that we are barely biologically capable of grasping.  Research - the quest to find truth, gives intelligent life\u2019s otherwise meaningless existence something to do to pass the time, besides watch TV. Most research work is quite incremental and doesn\u2019t seem to be all that interesting or important. But in the big picture - on the timescale of decades - research accomplishes incredible, rewarding things. Research is pretty much responsible for all of humankind\u2019s progress. So, pay attention in math class, kids! One day your knowledge of algebra could protect the world from an alien invasion! ",
