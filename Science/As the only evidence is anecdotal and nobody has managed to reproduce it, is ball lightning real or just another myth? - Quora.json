            "answer_text": "I have actually seen it in 1961! I can show you exactly where I was, when I saw the strike come down towards the ground, swerve about 2 metres above the ground, and come charging about 150 metres just above the ground towards the building I was in. As it approached it started to climb towards me. I stood there totally mesmerised, scared and unable to move. It was about 0.5 metre in diameter, rotating slowly and had a scaly surface, coloured a pale almost pastel pink and blue, purple where they met. About 1 metre from me it exploded with one of the loudest bangs I had ever heard. I was in the bathroom with the window open, getting washed, and my younger sister was there too. Well at 11 and 9 we had an innocence that seems to have vanished. We ran screaming out of the bathroom, and were unable to describe to our father what we had just witnessed. That was September 1961. So yes it does exist, and as to why they cannot reproduce it in a laboratory I have no idea. NOTE: After writing the above, I did a bit of digging and typed in to my search engine \u2018Ball Lightning,\u2019 it offered me information and high speed video. However, it also states that the cause etc; is unexplained. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, stones from the sky were reported but believed fictional until scientists actually witnessed some. The problem with some phenomena in science is that scientists have to have to be in just the right place at just the right time to witness the phenomenon\u2019 while the odds of that are small to begin with the odds of them having any instruments available to record and measure the phenomenon are smaller yet (and will likely remain so until we have Star Trek type \u201ctricorders\u201d). So while many people have witnessed ball lighting (I\u2019m among them), there\u2019s only that anecdotal evidence since no one got a record of the event (in my case, those present were both astounded and frightened enough no one thought of grabbing a camera until too late). At this point there\u2019s little doubt that the phenomenon is real, the problem is catching it with the right instruments to be able to pin down just what it is; the fact that according to some apparent records of it there are elements involved that aren\u2019t from the atmosphere just makes the puzzle more fascinating.
