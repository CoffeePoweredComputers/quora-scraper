            "answer_text": "I guess that what you are asking is : What is the proper calculation for the specific gravity of a solution after a solute has been dissolved in water? Definition of specifdic gravity : The ratio of the mass of a volume of the substance to the mass of an equal volume of water . Now you prepare your solution . You measure the volume exactly - let us say 128.5 mL . Determine the mass of the 128.5 mL solution = let us say 137.8 g What is the mass of 128.5 mL of distilled water at the ambient temperature: Let us say 25\u00b0C . Density of water at 25\u00b0C = 0.9970 g/mL Therefore mass of water = 0.9970 g/mL * 128.5 mL = 128.11 g Specific gravity of the solution = 137.8 g / 128.11 g = 1.076 . And specific gravity has no units ",
