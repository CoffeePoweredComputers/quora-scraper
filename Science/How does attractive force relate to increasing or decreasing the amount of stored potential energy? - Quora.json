            "answer_text": "In the case of gravitational potential energy the greater the attracctive force the greater will be the stored potential energy, other things being equal. PE depends to a great on the position of the object in relation to the force.For example, gravitational potential energy of the system Earth-object will increase the larger the distance of the object from Earth. The combined effect of force and configuration will determine the potential energy of the system. ",

            "answer_text": "When two masses or two charges interact, the greater their separation, the greater the magnitude of their potential energy. Except for very limited circumstances, such as near Earth's surface, potential energies are given negative values for attractive forces, with the largest possible potential energy being zero at infinite distance. The equations for gravitational and electrostatic potental energy are very similar. They are given below respectively: U = \u2013GMm/r, U= kQq/r, FOR ATTRACTIVE FORCES U IS NEGATIVE, EXCEPT AT INFINITY WHERE IT'S ZERO. U is potential energy G and k are constants M and m are the masses Q and q are the charges And r is the separation between the two mass or the two charges. Note when r is infinity U is zero. FOR SYSTEMS INVOLVING ATTRACTIVE FORCES: If the mass increases the gravitational force increases and the gravitational potential energy will become more negative, as demonstrated by the equations below: F = GMm/r^2, U = \u2013GMm/r If the charge increases the electrostatic force increases and the electrostatic potential energy will become more negative, as demonstrated by the equations below: F = kQq/r^2, U= kQq/r \u2014 It also should be mentioned that for like charges the force on each charge is repulsive rather than attractive. FOR REPULSIVE FORCES U IS POSITIVE, EXCEPT AT INFINITY WHERE IT'S ZERO. We use the same equation, U= kQq/r as before, because plugging in the signs of the charges for Q and q will give the correct sign for U. \u2014 SUMMARY As the force of attraction increases, potential energy becomes MORE NEGATIVE.
