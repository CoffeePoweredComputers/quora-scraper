            "answer_text": "There are many scientist that read the Seth-books for inspirations and to see if they can discover a new grand hypothesis. For example I read about Seth in the \u201cHolographic Universe\u201d by Talbot (who oddly enough died at age 38 a year after the book in 1992, but with further research it appears he was exposing thUgtopia in his writings like The Delicate Dependency (1982) which is hard to find now. suppression?)\u2026 So I went right back to the bookstore where I found that same copy of \u201cThe Nature of Personal Reality\u201d and laughed that I didn\u2019t buy it a couple of weeks earlier. I\u2019ve read most of the Seth-books now. And I have a BSc(Eng) in Applied Physics. The future of science for the successful probabilities (that don\u2019t implode due to organized thUggery) will be using the inner senses to understand what today is too elusive for the physical senses to grasp, i gather. The people who reject Seth are typically the fake-psychic community who are are locked into the mentality to reject All-That-Is in exchange for a promise of a hivemind of supieriority over the \u201csheeple.\u201d Likely in the same Mystery School Cult as most of the University professors in most engineered societies. They are the secret-societies all connected, or soon to be, by wireless brain interfaces and are worshiping for AI in the brainchip to become self-aware. This is why they chant for Lucifer.  inside the \u201cDivining Serpent\u201d crowned by a symbolic magnetic field that Kleck has been authorized to expose to reveal.  If you listen to Manly P. Hall about Nature  and then read Seth/Janes \u201cDreams Evolution and Value Fulfillment\u2026  you can quickly see the conflicts between Cult teachings and Seth\u2019s teachings. And since the Cult has been molding many societies for centuries ( Mystery Babylon Series - William Cooper )controlled media play its tricks upon the beliefs of the common \u201csheeple.\u201d You will find many talking about how science in most official senses operates like a religion (logic is laughed at if it goes against the Cult\u2019s agenda for their thUgtopia)\u2026 that is because it is a religion of fanatical deception that mesmerizes the \u201cprofane\u201d non-thinking \u201csheeple\u201d. But religion is the \u201cOld World Order,\u201d and if Kleck has the \u201cvoice-of-god\u201d weapon guiding his thoughts for the \u201cinspirational\u201d demise of the main religions (and I can tell the Cult is guiding him or he is just a another goat) then the \u201cscience\u201d religion is what is planned to replace it\u2026 in the New World. So take it with a grain of salt when the \u201cscience community\u201d comments upon the \u201cSeth Material.\u201d You need to become your own guide towards your personalized probabilistic future and Seth teaches how to guide your own main probability.

            "answer_text": "Visibly, the amount of attention from scientists is very low, so we cannot say that the scientific community thinks anything about it at all. Following my own independent path of clarification of the foundations of maths and physics and their connections with metaphysics (interpretations of quantum physics, arguing for the role of consciousness), I recently stumbled on the Seth material and read large parts with great interest. But, unlike most reviews I saw until now which are either totally supportive or totally dismissive, mine is mixed. As this material is huge, it is not easy to write a review, there would be so many things to examine. I just started to write my review here, already a bit long and still very incomplete, I\u2019m not sure whether and when I\u2019ll be as exhaustive as I wish: Review of the Seth material (Jane Roberts) ",
