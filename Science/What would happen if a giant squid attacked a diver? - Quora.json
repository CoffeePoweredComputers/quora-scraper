            "answer_text": "In theory a giant squid (Architeuthis) could make short work of a human, but since giant squids almost never come near the surface unless ill or dying, an encounter with a diver is very, very unlikely, and has never been reported. The normal vertical range of giant squids is thought to be 300 to 1000 metres (about 1000 to 3000 feet). Human divers rarely go much beyond 50 metres. ",
