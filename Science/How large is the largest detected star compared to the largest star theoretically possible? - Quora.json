            "answer_text": "UY Scuti may be the largest in size, it has a radius more than 1,700 greater than the sun. In other words, this single star is so large that its outer surface would extend far beyond the orbit of the planet Jupiter. UY Scuti's size of 1,700 solar radii compares to one estimated theoretical maximum of 2,600 radii.   The heaviest star is thought to be R136a1. It\u2019s 265 times more massive than our sun \u2013 nearly twice as massive as what was thought was possible. Astronomers had said for decades that no star can be born by ordinary processes with more than 150 times our sun\u2019s mass. It\u2019s also the most luminous star known at more than 7 million times the luminosity of our sun.  But according to theorists, how big can stars get? I contacted Roberta Humphreys from the University of Minnesota, the researcher who calculated the size of VY Canis Majoris, and posed this question to her.  The largest stars will be the cool supergiants. For example, VY Canis Majoris is only 3,500 Kelvin. A really big star would be even cooler. At 3,000 Kelvin, a cool supergiant would be 2,600 times the size of the Sun. That, she believes, is the largest possible star. sources:How big are the biggest monster stars?

            "answer_text": "How large is the largest detected star compared to the largest star theoretically possible? The short answer is that, since our theory of stellar evolution is based on observation, the largest stars we can observe are exactly as large as theory predicts. Maybe a little smaller. That\u2019s because what we know of stellar evolution depends on what we can see in the sky. A couple of hundred years ago that would have been a different matter, since we didn\u2019t know about hydrogen fusion. There still are things about stellar evolution that we don\u2019t know, but the basics that determine things like size, luminosity, and spectral class all seem to fit pretty well into our present model of stellar evolution. So now to the details. There really is only one parameter that matters to a star in the main sequence (the hydrogen fusing phase) and that is the amount of mass it has. The upper limit appears to be about 120 solar masses, which results in a star that is about 20 times the size of our Sun. The reason for this limit is that a main sequence star produces a set amount of energy from hydrogen fusion, and that energy goes up as the square of the rate at which the mass goes up - double the mass, and you quadruple the energy, etc. At over 120 solar masses the energy is enough to literally blast the star\u2019s surface material into space, so that there is a pretty good limit to how large stars can get by simply accreting matter. We know stars a little larger than that exist, probably as the result of two or more smaller stars merging. Obviously they wouldn\u2019t stay that size for very long, since the rate at which they blow away their outer layers would simply accelerate geometrically, the bigger they are. The largest main sequence star we\u2019re aware of is R136a1, a 10th magnitude star in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Based on its spectrum, its distance from us, the amount of light we\u2019re receiving from it, and what we know about stellar evolution, it is about 315 times the mass of our Sun, and 28.8 times the size of our Sun. Based on that information we can also expect that its life expectancy is at best a few ten million years, and it is likely surrounded by a growing cloud of gas and dust blasted into space by its solar wind. Ironically, main sequence stars that are this crazy big are also very efficient at using their fuels, since they do not have a radiative shell surrounding their core, but rather have layers of convecting cells that move fuel into regions where it can be fused. They may grow to luminous supergiant size, and may become several hundred times as large as our Sun, well past the Earth\u2019s orbit, before running out of fuel and finishing in a supernova explosion. Which brings us to red supergiants. For stars between ten and twenty times as massive as our Sun, the core runs out of hydrogen, it cools, contracts under gravity, and various processes start that end up pushing out the outer shell of the star, increasing its size. When that happens to our Sun it will become a red giant, and reach out as far as to Earth\u2019s orbit. However, we know of red supergiants that get much larger. A red supergiant\u2019s size is far less predictable, since it depends on the star\u2019s metallicity (elements other than hydrogen or helium), as well as its mass when it leaves the main sequence. These massive stars run through their fuel a hundred times faster than our Sun, and when they balloon, out they can become ridiculously large, to the point where we even have the category of red hypergiants. The size of these stars, as with all stars other than our Sun, is determined by their spectral temperature, their apparent luminosity, and their distance. However, while the photosphere of a star in the main sequence is a shell made of plasma, a red hypergiant\u2019s photosphere is a mixture of ionized and atomic gas that glows with the heat of the distant core that it surrounds, and may pulsate in and out significantly, either as a whole, or in one region of its surface or another, due to clouds of material wafting up from the struggling core. Where the surface of our Sun is a fairly certain thing to point at, the surface of such a monster is a lot more hand-wavy. Going by temperature, luminosity, and distance, the largest known hypergiant is VY Canis Majoris, a star estimated to have 17 times the Sun\u2019s mass, and up to 1,500 times the Sun\u2019s radius. If it were at the center of our solar system, its photosphere would reach out to 7 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth, well past the orbit of Jupiter. It\u2019s hard to say how much larger a red hypergiant might grow. Making such a star more massive wouldn\u2019t necessarily increase its size, since the added mass can change too many variables that affect that part of its evolution. Also, the largest hypergiants are in a fairly brief phase of their evolution, which is part of the reason why they are among the most rare of space oddities that we know of. ",
