            "answer_text": "\"Wisdom (sophia) is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight. Wisdom has been regarded as one of four cardinal virtues; and as a virtue, it is a habit or disposition to perform the action with the highest degree of adequacy under any given circumstance.\" Ref: Wikipedia   If the definition of wisdom above is true, and I believe it is, then the answer to your guestion is that any relatively well adjusted person can not only aspire to wisdom, but indeed be wise about something at sometime, perhaps even about many things most of the time. One might not reach the point of ultimate wisdom - which would be existing in a state of wisdom all the time, but the effort to attain wisdom is a reward unto itself. Some forms of Buddhist teachings, as well as numerous psychological disciplines, are examples of seeking this ultimate wisdom by self-knowledge through the self-exploratory understanding of knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense and intuitive insight and internalizing that as a personal virtue.

            "answer_text": "I have a theory that wisdom is an individual's ability to match patterns and find linkages to help him/her find an optimal solution set to a current problem.   Intelligence is clearly a contributing factor to wisdom. Sherlock Holmes and his article on \"The Book of Life\" comes to mind. \"From a drop of water, a logician can infer the existence of the Atlantic or the Niagara, without having seen or heard of either. Life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it\". Matching patterns from prior knowledge to infer new information.  Experience is another major factor for similar reasons as above. A good memory would then be a derivative attribute to maintain a large repository of experiences. Memory and intelligence (not to be confused by IQ) are relatively immutable attributes. You are what you are, with minor changes over time, habit and circumstance. Experience, however, is a personal choice. You can linearly amass experiences to suit your goals and increase wisdom - either by 1) doing the same thing over and over, which in turn becomes practice and gives you the domain specific wisdom / intuition of an expert , or by 2) doing different things each time like travel the world, which helps amass generalist \"life experience\" and a different kind of wisdom consequently.
