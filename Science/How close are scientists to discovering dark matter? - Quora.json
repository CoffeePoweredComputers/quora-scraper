            "answer_text": "The leading candidate, the WIMP coming out of supersymmetry, with 100,000 of these passing through every square centimeter each second, has been ruled out by astronomical observations years ago, but if found in the lab, it may suggest multiple types of dark matter. There are numerous instances of direct experiments coming up empty. Since the world\u2019s two most sensitive direct-detect experiments, the LUX and PandaX-II have recently failed in their quest for WIMP dark matter particles, its like trying to ride a dead horse at this point. So how close are scientists to discovering dark matter? As soon as experimental researches start looking in the right place instead of trying new experiments to find WIMP hypothetical particles and the like. WIMPs have had a 30 year experimental run now, so unless there are some significant changes in direction sometime soon, it will be at least another 100 years before Dark Matter is better understood. There are a lot of theories and candidates with Dark Matter, but they are presently best understood based on observations of gravitational influence around galaxies (disks and halos) and its effects on visible matter, radiation, large-scale structures of the universe, and they are obviously transparent to light. Dark Matter is even found in our solar system at 300 times higher density compared to most galaxies. It\u2019s essentially everywhere, even on this planet, it\u2019s more a matter of its density and eventually being able to direct test for it. We are going on the 100 year anniversary of the first observation of dark matter. Since then, many galaxies have been observed. The models and simulations coming out of UC Irvine, which often resembles similar halo profiles as cold dark matter (CDM), but solves larger than predicted elastic cross section problems, which could be the right size if dark matter is composite, looks very promising, and is called strongly interacting dark matter (SIDM).
