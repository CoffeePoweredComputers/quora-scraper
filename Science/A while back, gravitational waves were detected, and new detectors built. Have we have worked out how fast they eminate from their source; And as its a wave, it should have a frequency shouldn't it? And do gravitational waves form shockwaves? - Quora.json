            "answer_text": "GWs were predicted to travel at c, and this was verified through the detection of GW170817, which was a merger event of two neutron stars, and therefore had an electromagnetic signature as well (whereas black hole mergers such as the First observation of gravitational waves, GW150914 emit only GWs). The GW observatory network was able to locate the source in the sky well enough that a number of other telescopes were able to find it, and from the fact that the gamma rays arrived at the same time as the GWs to within about a second after traveling some 130 million years, it was established that GWs travel at c to within one part in 10^16. GWs can have well-defined frequencies, but the merger events we\u2019ve been seeing so far are chirps with frequency and amplitude that sweep upwards to a sudden cutoff in the low-medium audio range. And \u201cshockwave\u201d is pretty loosely defined, but in the sense of a wave so powerful that the properties of the material behind the wave are substantially different than in front of it, then no.

            "answer_text": "A while back, gravitational waves were detected, and new detectors built. Have we have worked out how fast they eminate from their source; Yes. Their speed is measured to be light speed, as predicted by Einstein. And as its a wave, it should have a frequency shouldn't it? No. Periodic waves have frequencies; aperiodic waves do not. The waves we have detected have resulted from fast orbits preceding collision. The frequency is determined by the angular speed of the orbit. As such it sweeps upward from low to high, not maintaining a constant frequency. And do gravitational waves form shockwaves? I\u2019m not qualified to answer. I\u2019m not aware of any property of spacetime that would allow the formation of a shock wave. As far as I know, a mass would have to exceed light speed in order to produce a shock wave, which isn\u2019t possible. ",
