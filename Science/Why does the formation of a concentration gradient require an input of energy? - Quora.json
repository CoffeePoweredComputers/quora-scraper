            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t require an input of energy in the sense of energy flowing into the system. It requires an expenditure of free energy. The formation of a concentration gradient reduces the system\u2019s entropy, so it will never occur spontaneously unless coupled with a greater increase in entropy in the surroundings. Such an increase in entropy could be arranged by running a highly exothermic reaction, to give one example. ",
