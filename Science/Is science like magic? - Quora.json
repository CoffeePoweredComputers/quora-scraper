            "answer_text": "Not only is supernatural magic not like science, by its very definition, supernatural magic does not exist. Stage magic is performance. Stage magicians apply scientific discoveries in the fields of psychology and neuroscience (and other fields of science) to create illusion and a sense of astonishment, but stage magic itself is not science, but it could be considered to be like science, since it employs science. science (noun): the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. magic (noun): the power of apparently influencing the course of events by using mysterious or supernatural forces. If you were to study magic using observation and experimentation according to scientific method, that would be science. Science does not necessarily explain why things happen. Sometimes science merely establishes that things do happen in an observable, predictable and repeatable way under test conditions. supernatural (adjective): (of a manifestation or event) attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature. By definition, supernatural magic precludes science. Sir Isaac Newton used scientific method to establish the law of gravity, but Sir Isaac Newton did not understand the cause of gravity. You could say that the cause of gravity was beyond scientific understanding, but I think we can agree that even before the advent of the law of gravity, gravity was not objectively magic or supernatural, although it may have seemed so. If something can observably and repeatably influence the course of events, it can be studied scientifically, and therefore is not magic. Since magic cannot observably and repeatably influence the course of events, it cannot be studied scientifically\u2014further, it cannot be reasonably considered \u201cthe power of apparently influencing the course of events.\u201d Therefore by definition magic does not exist.

            "answer_text": "Science can seem like magic because the impossible suddenly appears possible. Science can seem like magic because the tools scientists use are unfamiliar. Science can seem like magic because only the anointed are allowed to do it.Bupkis! Our brains evolved to make us scientists. We explore our world and draw inferences. We try new things and see what happens. We generalize from examples using the inductive method. Of course, most people do this in a less systematic way than is required by science. But the process is the same. Science is simply a formalization of our casual worldly explorations. How can one separate science from magic? First, read all with a skeptical eye. If the results seem too good to be true, they probably are. Just as there are few \"get rich quick\" schemes floating around, there are few fundamental scientific discoveries that appear without precedent. The \"discovery\" of Noah's Ark on Mt. Ararat last week with \"99.9% certainty\" by a religious group strained credulity since scientists have made innumerable expeditions up the mountain and had not found the Ark. The odds of some \"true believers\" finding it was slim. But not impossible. A key step to science is replication and verification. If they had found the Ark, it could be verified by inspection by someone outside their group. This method reveals the panel in the top hat hiding the rabbit. Once one is shown how to do a magic trick, it ceases to be magic. It also ceases to be fun. So, enjoy magic for entertainment, and be a skeptical scientist when it comes to discovering new facts. ",
