            "answer_text": "Concrete is obtained by mixing Portland cement with a coarse and fine aggregates. The coarse aggregate can be limestone, quartz or any other rock with sufficient compressive strength and chemical stability. Cement is made by finely grinding clinker with Gypsum. The fine aggregate is usually quartz sand. Therefore, concrete is very heterogeneous and, as such does not have a melting POINT. Instead, it has a melting range. Quartz sand melts around 1650 C. Cement melts around 1550 C. Limestone decomposes at 825 C into lime, and lime melts at 2572 C. Granite (another aggregate) melts at 1260 C. So, you must reach extremely high temperatures to completely melt concrete. ",

            "answer_text": "What is concrete's melting point? Typical concrete does not melt. It decomposes (usually before any one ingredient melts). Materials containing more than one ingredient do not possess just one melting point in any case. However, if you heat it hot enough, with a flux such as iron oxide, a glassy mess will form around (maybe) 900 degrees Celsius. Without the flux, it will take a somewhat higher temperature. ",
