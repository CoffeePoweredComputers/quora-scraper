            "answer_text": "Because, English: Is just a language that starts with saying a for Apple and b for ball. The so called good at English students are very well trained to spill out whatever it is that they could memorize. History: Why? Geography: The smartest of school children will know the names of capital cities of all the states in India. That's the end of geography. Value education: A big haha! Starts with \u201cFood is a menifestation of God\". Ends with \u201cWe should respect elders.\u201d All of it, only in writing. Mathematics: Your intelligence is judged by the number of multiplication tables you know. Or the values of sin and cos at various angles that you could spit out. And why science? \u201cBecause only science has some scope ahead\u201d But there are people studying arts. Right? Yes, sure. But most of them only do so to grab a teaching job wherein they could dump the text books on to the heads of the students who have no way to actually understand the essence of what history, geography and other subjects stand for. In our country, children are taught/trained to read not to understand. PS: To improve the state I can give a suggestion. Education starts at home. Teach your children how to understand and not just how to read. ",

            "answer_text": "In most of the schools, we find that cut off to take admission in class 11 in science stream is higher than commerce and arts. Due to these numbers, students and parents consider science stream to be superior over commerce and arts. There are certain points in relation to the question- To satisfy ego.Because relatives\u2019s son/daughter have taken science.To excel their career as doctor/engineer.We are familiar to science stujects unlike arts and commerce where we face new subjects.Peer and relatives pressure.The bitter reality is that commerce and arts as difficult as science. So, never ever try to underestimate other streams.You should make a wise decision before choosing stream as your career will totally depend on it. Thank you ",
