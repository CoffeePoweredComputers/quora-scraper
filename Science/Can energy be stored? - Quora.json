            "answer_text": "We take it for granted that electricity will flow to our light bulbs, computers and microwaves at exactly the moment we need it. We owe that reliability to the electric grid, a vast and complicated machine that constantly adjusts to balance the supply of electricity coming in from power plants, wind turbines and solar panels with the demand from customers. To keep the grid humming, electricity has to be tucked away for times when demand exceeds supply. That\u2019s especially true for renewable power \u2014 demand is sometimes greatest when the wind isn\u2019t blowing or the sun isn\u2019t shining. Right now, only about 2 percent of the electricity that can be generated can be stored on the grid. With more renewables coming online, more storage is needed, and soon. California has even mandated that 1,325 megawatts of energy storage be added to the grid by 2020. The race is on to find new and better ways to stash power. Scientists and entrepreneurs are already testing new technologies and improving old ones to expand capacity and bring down costs. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a shakeout, as to which technologies are truly ready,\u201d says Jeff Chamberlain, executive director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research based at Argonne National Laboratory. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a blood bath for the technologists.\u201d 1. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) How it works: At times of low energy demand, motors powered by electricity or natural gas compress air and pump it into an underground cavern, abandoned mine or other large confined space. Later the air is released and heated. As it expands, it drives a turbine to make electricity. Pros: Proven. Cities and mining operations have been using CAES for decades. It\u2019s relatively cheap, and it involves no toxic materials. Cons: Requires a cavern or other suitable space.  2. High-Speed Flywheels How it works: When demand is low, electricity is sent to a motor that accelerates a cylinder spinning in a case, which is vacuum-sealed to reduce friction. When electricity demand is high, the resulting kinetic energy is converted back to electricity. Pros: Responds almost instantly to changing energy needs. Cons: Stored energy lasts only about 15 minutes, good just for short bursts. 3. Pumped Hydro How it works: Electricity is used to pump huge volumes of water from a lower reservoir to an upper one. When energy is needed, the water is released to flow through turbines, generating electricity. Ninety-five percent of stored energy currently on the grid is in pumped hydro. Pros: Can store large amounts of energy \u2014 10,000 MWh in a reservoir a kilometer in diameter and 25 meters deep. Storage installations last a half-century or more. Cons: Requires space for a deep reservoir, and water to fill it. Low storage capacity despite the large volume of water involved. 4. Vehicle-to-Grid How it works: Electric vehicles can double as batteries plugged into the grid, saving up power at night when electricity demand is low. Then they can send electricity back to the grid at peak times. An aggregator pools the power into one large source. Pros: Can be used anywhere there is a parking spot and a plug. Owners can receive compensation for energy sent back to the grid under utility companies\u2019 net metering policies. Cons: Extra charging and discharging can wear out the battery sooner. Feeding the grid could drain the battery, requiring it to be recharged before driving. 5. Rail Energy Storage How it works: Electric trains loaded with rocks or dirt travel up a slope when electricity demand is low. Then when electricity is needed, the rail cars slide back down the hill, and a regenerative braking system makes electricity as they go. The longer the slope, the better. Pros: Can release large amounts of power quickly. Technology is proven, and plans are in the works for a 50-MW rail energy storage system in Nevada attached to California\u2019s grid. Cons: Lots of space and a hill are needed, and it works only in certain remote locations. 6. Solid Electrochemical Batteries How it works: Batteries basically store and then release energy by sending ions through chemical compounds between negative (anode) and positive (cathode) terminals. Pros: Proven. Solid batteries have been around for more than 200 years, but advances in the materials and chemistry of lithium ion and other batteries have made them much more efficient and effective. They can be used anywhere. Cons: Expensive and store relatively small amounts of energy. Safety risks, including fires  7. Flow Batteries How it works: Flow batteries work in a similar way to typical solid batteries, but they can store exponentially greater amounts of energy since the chamber where the electrochemical reaction occurs is attached to large tanks that hold electrically charged liquid. The fluid in one tank has a positive charge, and the fluid in the other tank is negatively charged. Pros: Large amounts of electricity can be released quickly. Cons: Space is needed to store the large tanks of liquid. Risk of pollution from leaking and sometimes unreliable.  8. Molten Salt Storage How it works: When demand is low, mirrors reflect sunlight onto tanks of molten salt, heating them almostto 1,000 F. When demand is high, the salt\u2019s heat turns water into steam to drive a turbine, making electricity. Pros: Proven. Molten salt thermal storage is used at large-scale solar installations attached to the grid. Cons: Need lots of space for tanks.  9. Thermal Energy Storage How it works: When demand is low, electricity is used to freeze or chill water that is stored in tanks on rooftops or inside buildings. Then at peak demand times, the ice or cold water is used to cool air for large office or industrial buildings, meaning they need much less power from the grid. Pros: Simple thermal energy storage \u2014 hauling ice into the city to cool buildings \u2014 has been used for centuries. Thermal is among the cheapest types of energy storage. Cons: Cooling buildings is only helpful in the summer. ",

            "answer_text": "Energy can be stored - in particular be grateful for it whenever you charge your cellular phone. Energy storage is ubiquitous around us - e.g. as as potential energy mechanically, e.g. lifting a weight up, or chemical energy storage in a battery (be it rechargeable or not), or the energy of the sun is stored in the plants and subsequently in the oil that the plants turn into, or electrically by running a current in a coil (magnetic energy) or by charging a capacitor (electrical energy). The stored energy may subsequently be released (i.e. turned into other forms of energy), e.g. when the uplifted weight drops and picks up speed, when the energy stored into the iPhone generates sound energy and electromagnetic energy (waves), when the capacitor or coil discharges and the current causes heating or some other action, when the tree or oil burns and releases heat energy (kinetic motion on a micro-scale). The name of the game in \u201cgreen technology\u201d is efficient energy storage, e.g. hydrogen cells or better batteries. ",

            "answer_text": "Energy can be stored in many ways. Energy is stored in wood and coal and petroleum and methane, released as heat and lightwhen we burn it. Energy is stored when you fill a balloon or canister with compressed air. Energy is stored when you charge a battery. Energy is stored when you wind-up a rubber band. Energy is stored when you dam up a river. Energy is stored when you lift a weight. Energy is stored when you shine a light on glow-in-the-dark material. Energy is stored in hydrogen and helium and other fusable atoms, released in stars as heat and light. When a star collapses and explodes, some of that energy is stored in uranium produced by that explosion. If energy couldn\u2019t be stored, life would not exist and you would not be here to use stored energy to post this question on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways energy can be stored, but first the equations: E= mc^2 and\u2026., Total Energy = potential/stored energy (PE) + kinetic energy (KE) also\u2026, there are 2 types of stored energy - gravitational (G) and electromagnetic (EM) Examples: 1. A book placed on a table - push the book off and stored energy is converted into kinetic energy due to gravitational stored energy. 2. Water from the ocean which evaporates due to energy stored in the sun and is transformed into rain which fills reservoirs and provides a power source in the form of kinetic energy from turbine generators. 3. Nuclear weapons where stored energy in the form of energy stored in the mass of a nucleus is converted into kinetic energy. BTW: the sun is actually gravitational energy (G) which then gets converted into photons, also known as (EM) type energy. In conclusion: Total Energy = G + EM = PE + KE. And the stored portion is just the inactive form of the other. ",

Then let it flow down and turn a generator. Householders can charge a bank of batteries, then use them as a power source but probably will have to use an inverter to convert to AC at 120/240. Getting the frequency right too is important. ",
