            "answer_text": "Just wonder .. In semiconductors why valance bands are there ? ....there should be a significant level of energy for an electron ... Bands are formed due to the interaction of other atoms's proton over a particular electron when they are solid (well arranged crystal lattice ) . Now when an electron jumps from valence band to conduction band  ------ this is the condition when attractive  interaction of the electron with the proton ( with which atom  it belongs to ) gets nullified due to the interaction with the protons ( of  other nearer atoms ) . and the electron now is free to move .. and increases the conductivity of a semiconductor !!  Hope this helps .. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, we cannot talk of just one free electron. But we CAN talk about the probability distribution of electrons as the temperature of a solid is increased from absolute zero. Firstly, electrons being fermions obey the fermi-dirac distribution of occupying energy states.   where mu is the Fermi energy, T is the absolute temperature, kb is the Boltzmann's constant, E is the energy level. What we can say, is that as the temperature of the concerned solid is increased from absolute zero, more and more electrons start occupying the higher energy states in the conduction band. This is because electrons(being fermions) obey the Pauli-Exclusion principle which states that no two fermions can occupy the same state(in this energy state).   Here, Ec and Ev are the conduction and valence band energies, g(E) is the density of states (red) and f(E) is the fermi-dirac distribution, the Fermi energy is not shown in the diagram but will be between Ec and Ev, Eg is the band gap[Mind you, E is on the y-axis here] By the definition of conduction band itself, the minimum energy band in which the electron is free from the atom, or delocalized, as more and more electrons enter the conduction band, => more and more delocalization occurs and more mobile charge carriers are added  to the CB which increases conduction ",
