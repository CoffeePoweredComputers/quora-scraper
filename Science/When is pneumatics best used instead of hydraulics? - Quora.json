            "answer_text": "Oil Hydraulics are used for high load mostly slow moving equipment like rams , lifts, cranes and presses. That has the grunt to exert tremendous solid power, ie 100 of tons of steady pressure. or rotational applications using 10,000 psi special pumps needed. Pneumatics are best used where loads are lighter, faster and more insignificant as to the greater variation in speed and sponginess. They normally need some damping to prevent flyaweay conditions, th e gear is much lighter and cheaper than with hydraulics but each has a specific function in design. Pressures seldom exceed 150 psi so ordinary compressorsare used. Hydraulics are brute force and everything is absolute. Pneumatics more gentle and forgiving in case of obstruction. Both fields have their specific applications and can be exceptionally interesting in design. Both need understanding of flow rates in pipes,bursting pressures, the intricasies of valving and the consituents of the medium to be used, one of my favourites. Vaccuum systems have their applications also under the heading of pneumatics, the choice of suitable valves for vacuum systems is extremely limited, many pressure valves will not operate successfully under vaccuum conditions andmay need additional modification to the original design when used in alternative vacuum situations. Expanding air gets very cold, cold incites moisture which affects lubricaton of vac situations, whereas pressurs systems do not suffer the condensate problems and normally contain an oil mist to assist ease of movement. The water, can readily freeze in vac situations or create causing blockage or rust giving more problems in maintenance. Water hydraulics are another specialist field ,used mainly in themining industry for fracking of coal seam gasses and ultra high pressure units for cuttingof asbestos , aluminium , these use pressures of 30 - 50,000 psi some with abrasives injected into the lines to permit cutting action of hard or brittle materials. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.
