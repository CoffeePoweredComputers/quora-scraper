            "answer_text": "That clue to the cure for all diseases has been with us from the beginning of time - As all species reproduce in early bloom of maturity for survival . All subsequent offsprings after the 1st and 2nd offsprings have always been considered as food for predators - as they have been hatched / given birth when the parents have crossed that magic age of BLOOMING GOOD HEALTH - and have stepped into that slow degenerative eras of the lives which are then transmitted to their offsprings . And humans are similarly so designed by the same evolutionary principles . So saying , a few who procreate AFTER that magic BLOOMING YOUTHFUL AGE - their offsprings MAY survive as full good and robust in health and well being - even though their chromosomes had already been compromised by their parents .

I doubt anyone is actually looking for cures\u2026 there are plenty people looking for treatments.. and there is a world of difference. Once you understand that Pharma companies sponsor a lot of the research, you can come to understand that they have zero interest in cures but massive interest in treatments. It usually all becomes clear when you make that realisation. \u2026\u2026.. Just to add a thanx to Maxime Sauvaget for translating this answer into French., ",
