            "answer_text": "I HOPE not.  (Photo by Carollyne Yardley) How would YouTube makeup tutorials work with this? Yeah; what foundation or concealer would cover all of that there? Atleast acne and wrinkles wouldn\u2019t be visible! Botox, fillers, rhinoplasty and facelifts wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Shedding all the time and bathing yourself like a cat licks its fur to bathe\u2026. wouldn\u2019t be too attractive. Fur all over the couch, dinner table and bed sheets! Who needs that! If we had tails, we\u2019d be chasing our own tail when bored or during a nervous breakdown of sorts. Mating would be a disaster. Fleas would be considered an STD in one way or another. Contraction of fleas from sex. Seriously, literally NO ONE needs this! There\u2019s a saying that goes \u201cyou lay down with a dog; you get flees\u201d (about cheating) and that would be even more applicable if we had fur! Shaving and remove female body hair is exhausting enough as it is. I don\u2019t think people who love tattoos would want to be covered in fur either. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d evolve to have any more body hair than other primates do; although in contrast, their head hair does grow to the extent of what humans does. VERY good question by the way! ",

            "answer_text": "No, because we would simply have kept the HAIR we always had to start with, since humans with hairy bodies would out-compete the less hairy kinds for reproductive success. It\u2019s the opposite - we used to have hairy bodies, and have evolved toward generally losing it. It is not impossible to imagine that humans as a group might eventually regain that thick hair - most people still have all the hair follicles, we just don\u2019t grow long thick hairs from them (now), but we COULD. But we are highly unlikely to switch to fur. ",
