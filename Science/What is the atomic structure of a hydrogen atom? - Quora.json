            "answer_text": "A hydrogen atom is, at its most general definition, a proton. The subatomic proton is a hydrogen atom, but a positively charged one That structure is, for diagram structure, a circle. Hydrogen atoms can have neutrons, such as deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron (two circles joined) that makes water heavy. For electrons, hydrogen atoms at a neutral state, will have one electron in a 1s orbital A negatively charged hydrogen atom could have more electrons, in more clouds, but generally, it will be a single proton  (circle or sphere, depending if 2d or 3d nucleus) surrounded by a single orbital in a cloud, (circle on a circle or a sphere, depending if 2d or 3d orbitals)  ",

            "answer_text": "The Hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron. That proton is present in the nucleus and one electron is present in the 1 principal shell ( K shell ) and s orbital. Since s orbitals have apherical shape, hence hydrogn atom can be visualized a s a spherical atom ",
