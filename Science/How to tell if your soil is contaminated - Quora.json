            "answer_text": "See if you can determine what the history of land use has been. Was it ever used for agriculture, was it previously a yard? What you are really interested in is seeing if there might have been previous chemical use that could have contaminated the soil. Look at the ground around and see what is growing there and if what is growing there looks sick or damaged. Sick or damaged plants may indicate chemical exposure. The absence of certain plants my indicate herbicide usage. Grab a handful of soil and look at it. Are there bugs or earthworms; healthy soil usually has a variety of \u201ccritters\u201d inhabiting it. What does the soil look and feel like. Healthy soil is darker in color and has an \u201cearthy\u201d feel and smell to it. Dead dirt is generally dusty and light brown in color with little or no smell and a crumbly feel. Get a book about soil and agriculture and read up on what the characteristics of healthy soil are. If after a thorough investigation on your own you suspect contamination then take a soil sample in for testing to determine what it is. ",
