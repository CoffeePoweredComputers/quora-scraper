            "answer_text": "It's true.  A carboxylic acid is  a combination of a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group.  Carboxylic acids are electrophilic at the carbonyl and nucleophilic at the hydroxyl group.  Thus, treating a carboxylic acid as a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group does give insight into the reactivity.   The reason a carboxylic acid is its own functional group is because there are significant differences in how the hydroxyl and carbonyl in a carboxylic acid react in comparison to a ketone and an alcohol.  While a ketone reacts by addition, a carboxylic acid undergoes addition followed by elimination of the hydroxyl group.  The hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid is a significantly weaker nucleophile than an alcohol.  Functional group assignment is a way to describe the reactivity profile of a particular arrangement of atoms.  Because the reactivity of carboxylic acid is so different from the reactivity of a lone hydroxyl group (like an alcohol) or a lone carbonyl (such as an aldehyde or ketone), it's useful to give it a separate name to organize the unique reactions it undergoes.
