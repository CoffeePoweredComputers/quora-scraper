            "answer_text": "The most obvious similarity is that both anthropology and political science are social sciences. Anthropology broadly studies humans, human behavior, societies and cultures. Some branches of anthropology study linguistics and how languages affect societies. Biological anthropology studies the biological and behavioral aspects of humans. Political science is a much more narrow field which studies governments, government systems, and political activities. Political science and anthropology are also similar in that they study current as well as past conditions, events and activities. Political science and anthropology certainly intersect and it could be argued that political science is a sub-study of anthropology. However, political science and anthropology are typically considered separate fields within the broader class of social studies or social sciences. ",

            "answer_text": "Poli Science and Anthropology in the basics are very similar. (Let\u2019s use Poli Sci and Anthro to save space) Socialized populations of people tend to organize based on the symbiosis of people or primates. Poli Sci gets specific when it gets specialized as does Anthro. Many classes are cross taught in both or more fields of study. Either one make for a good double major or a minor in one or the other. I chose Poli Sci with Anthro, Sociology and Economics as backup fields. Poli Sci (Public Administration) had an edge for me as I was not going on to advanced degrees. I later went for an Economics Bachelors to notch up my resume. ",

            "answer_text": "Anthropology is the study of mankind, its structures and its customs. Political science is the study of government and politics. Since government is one of the ways in which mankind is structured an anthropologist will be interested in describing the political system of a part of mankind being studied and how it operates. A political scientist will also be interested in the same thing but from a different perspective. We might say the anthropologist is taking a passive approach whereas the political scientist is taking an active approach in politics. ",
