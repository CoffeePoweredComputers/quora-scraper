            "answer_text": "It's all about maturity\u2026. 1. Recognize\u200a\u2014\u200aand admit\u200a\u2014\u200awhen you\u2019re wrong \u201cIt\u2019s far easier to get defensive and deny responsibility, or become overwhelmed with shame for our act of imperfection or ignorance. Being able to acknowledge when we\u2019re in the wrong takes humility, self-compassion and courage.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMegan Bruneau, Psychotherapist & Executive Coach 2. Recognize\u200a\u2014\u200aand admit\u200a\u2014\u200athat you are biased \u201cWe all have innate biases and prejudices. It\u2019s impossible not to: we\u2019re socialized into a stereotyping world. So what\u2019s important is learning to cultivate an active awareness of these biases and prejudices, and examine how they might influence our decisions and actions. Ask yourself where you might be practicing discrimination (subtly or unsubtly), and how you can begin to counter these ingrained behaviors.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMegan Bruneau, Psychotherapist & Executive Coach  3. Recognize\u200a\u2014\u200aand accept\u200a\u2014\u200ayour own feelings and needs This is the opposite of the above. Some of us struggle by wallowing too much in our emotions, but giving them too much authority in our lives. Others struggle by denying our feelings altogether, which is impoverished in another way. 4. But recognize that your feelings don\u2019t run the show We are not victims of our own lives. People are not out to get you, or hurt you. The universe has not conspired to bring you down, break your heart, or make you sad. Life is only partly what happens to us, and mostly how we respond to it. We choose our reaction\u200a\u2014\u200aand viewpoint. 5. Set healthy boundaries Stating what is acceptable to you and what you will and will not allow. Once you define that line, defend it. Don\u2019t let anyone to cross it. Boundaries are important because when they are set, our character also sets, becoming more resistant to nonsense and drama. When someone charges ahead and breaks through our boundaries, we are compromised. Don\u2019t kid yourself. We suffer emotionally and can sustain lifelong damage. Don\u2019t assume people will know your limit either. It\u2019s your job to tell them.  6. Pause between feeling and reacting Think it through. \u201cThrough practicing mindfulness, we can increase the amount of time between feeling a particular emotion and reacting to it. We gain a sense of spaciousness with regard to how we observe our emotions\u200a\u2014\u200arather than clinging to our feelings immediately and reacting instinctively, we learn how to first observe, and then react more carefully and productively.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMegan Bruneau, Psychotherapist & Executive Coach 7. Love\u200a\u2014\u200adefined as compassion \u201cJudgment is at the heart of hate. It is what fuels unhealthy relationships with ourselves and others. If you\u2019ve learned or are learning how to be more compassionate, not just to others but also to yourself, you\u2019re moving closer to enlightenment.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMegan Bruneau, Psychotherapist & Executive Coach 8. Composure, grit, and ability to endure setbacks \u201cLife is going to be full of problems. The acceptance of this allows mature people to stay calm and think more clearly during life\u2019s more difficult moments. The whole process of meeting and solving problems is what gives life its deeper meaning. Mature people have established the emotional intelligence necessary to understand that life\u2019s difficulties are the cutting edge of what distinguishes one from being a success or a failure.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSherrie Campbell, Psychologist, Author, Speaker 9. Positivity and Optimisim \u201cA positive attitude comes naturally to the mature person\u2026 [and] keeps mature people in a state of harmony with themselves and others because from their vantage point there is a way to make every situation a win-win experienclif\u2014\u200aSherrie Campbell, Psychologist, Author, Speaker  10. Honesty and Integrity \u201cMature people live with high integrity. They are committed to knowing, hearing and working within the truth no matter how hurtful or stressful that truth may be. Mature people are also willing and committed to telling the truth even when it is humiliating and difficult for oneself or another. They have an open mind to hear counsel and to respond to reproof.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSherrie Campbell, Psychologist, Author, Speaker Thank you! Edits are always welcome!! ",

            "answer_text": "The ability to adapt your communication to the fundamental needs (details below) of other people. Helping the people you care about to answer their fundamental needs is a good way to answer your own.  For thousands of years, human behavior has been driven by three fundamental needs: control, connection and consistency. Evolution has ensured that those of our distant ancestors who answered those needs survived long enough to have and raise children. But evolution is so slow that our ancestors\u2019 fundamental needs are still with us today. Directly or indirectly, they drive everything we think, say and do. Our needs for control, connection and consistency express themselves in infinite ways in a world that has become less physically threatening but more complex and mentally challenging. Understanding and satisfying those three needs, both in yourself and in others, is key to \u2018surviving\u2019 in a modern sense. This means navigating the opportunities and threats of today\u2019s world, communicating and influencing effectively, and achieving what you want for yourself and your children. Here\u2019s a closer look at those three fundamental needs: >>> OUR NEED TO FEEL IN CONTROL. This explains our attraction to knowledge, food, shelter, freedom, choice, power, truth, possessions, contracts, insurance, mastery and safety. But it also explains our attraction to risk taking, fortune telling and novelty, all of which are opportunities to test or improve our control. On the other hand, losing control over our life or loss of any kind, whether real or potential, is something we avoid and act on. >>>> OUR NEED FOR CONNECTION There is very little, including reproduction, that we can achieve alone. Evolution has hardwired us to assume we can achieve much more by collaborating with others and being sociable (watch how newborn babies instinctively attract attention, for instance). As groups we can produce more food, build safer shelters and defend each other. Sex is one of the most obvious manifestations of our need to connect. It is evolution\u2019s way of making reproduction (and therefore survival of the species) irresistible. But we also need to feel emotionally connected to the world around us, to what we do in it, to what things mean, to who we are and to who we might become. That\u2019s why stories, not facts and numbers, resonate so deeply with us. On the other hand, isolation or exclusion, whether real or potential, are forms of disconnection we instinctively fear and may go to extremes to avoid. >>> OUR NEED FOR CONSISTENCY. This need supports the first two. How do we spot threats to our control and connections? How do we spot opportunities to test and improve them? By constantly checking our surroundings for breaks in the consistencies we know about. Consciously or not, we can\u2019t refrain from filling gaps, spotting patterns, inventing or finding expis lanations (through religion, for example) and drawing conclusions. The world might seem to be in a turmoil of change, but most of life is a consistent. We know from observation and learning that the same jv is causes have the same effects and that reality in itasqps millions of tiny details, including our own thoughts, actions and j, is mostly consistent with our expectations and remains so from one timeframe to the next. This means, crucially, that anything that we know to be consistent can be safely ignored in most cases. This in turn frees up our mind to pay attention to inconsistencies, which signal either threats to our control and connections or opportunities to improve them. ",
