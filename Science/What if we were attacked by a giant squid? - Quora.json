            "answer_text": "Humans aren\u2019t really on the menu for Squid. The Giant Squid, which is a BIG animal, can range up to over 40ft in length for males and 30+ft for females, so no human would have a chance battling one of these monsters in the ocean. But it is very rare to hear of a human being attacked by a squid, the giants live in the ocean at extreme depths where humans never go unless in a submarine of some sort. ",
