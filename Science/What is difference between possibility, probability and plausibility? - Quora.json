            "answer_text": "Possibility always needs to be qualified. Sometimes is just means anything that doesn\u2019t entail a logical contradiction, like a square circle. Sometimes it means something you can imagine. Sometimes it means something that is consistent with the laws of physics; this is nomological possibility. There is a well developed mathematical theory of probability, derived from the axioms of Kolmogorov. So anything that obeys those axioms can be considered a probability. In it\u2019s applications probability has several different meanings and philosophers argue over them as if one must settle on \u201cthe real meaning\u201d. But this is a mistake. Just like \u201ccost\u201d or \u201cenergy\u201d, \u201cprobability\u201d is useful precisely because the same value has different interpretations. There are four interpretations that commonly come up. (1) It has a mathematical definition that lets us manipulate it and draw inferences. (2) It has a physical interpretation as a symmetry. (3) It quantifies a degree of belief that tells us whether to act on it. (4) It has an empirical meaning that lets us measure it. The usefulness of probability is that we can start with one of these, we can then manipulate it mathematically, and then interpret the result in one of the other ways. For example, you might observe that dice are perfectly cubical and uniform and so by (2) each face should be equally probable, i.e. P=1/6. Then you could calculate, using (1), that there are three ways of rolling a 4, . .:, : :, and .: . , out of a total of 36 possible outcomes. So the probability of a 4 on a throw is 3/36=1/12. Which tells you to only bet (3) on making a point of 4 at 12-to-1 or better odds. If you watch many game of craps and tally the results, you can approximately confirm the relative fraction of times 4 comes up (4). Plausibility is a purely subjective attribute. It means you assign it a degree of belief that is significantly above zero and is not small compared to contrary possibilities. ",
