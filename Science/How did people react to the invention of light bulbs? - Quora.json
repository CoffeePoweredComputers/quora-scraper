            "answer_text": "The person credited for inventing the electric bulb was of course Thomas Edison but the man who pioneered it and brought that to the market for common people was JP Morgan, one of the greatest business magnate America has ever had. He always wanted to establish his own legacy just like his contemporary tycoons, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. Like the discovery of fire and the invention of the wheel, electric light would revolutionise mankind and Morgan believed, would make him rich, and crucially, richer than his rivals. So Morgan hired Thomas Edison, a telegraph boy turned inventor, to install electricity in his 5th avenue Manhattan mansion. Morgan\u2019s home became a lab for Edison\u2019s experiments and a small generator was installed to power the home\u2019s 400 light bulbs, some of the first to be ever manufactured. Morgan\u2019s home was to become the first private residence in the world to be lit by electricity. He invited many to his home to see the marvel of the electric light for the first time. He knew his demonstration would put him in the fore front of a new industry. People were amazed to see this miraculous form of light in which there was no gas, no flame, no oil, just a visible stream of energy. At first they didn\u2019t understand how it worked because you can\u2019t see the electricity. So, it was viewed as something magical by most of the people. Against his father\u2019s advice, who believed it a fad, Morgan invested everything in Edison to form the Edison Electricity Company. They then created the world\u2019s first power station and soon half of Manhattan\u2019s connected. As time passed, electricity became a must have for the country\u2019s elite except for John D. Rockefeller who had built the largest fortune in America by refining oil for kerosene lamps. He realised that electric light had the potential to replace kerosene as America\u2019s prime source of light. So, Rockefeller launched a targeted PR campaign against electricity. He painted the new technology as dangerous and even deadly. He knew that if he could frighten the public his kerosene would continue to be the prominent source of light in the country. He warned of mass electrocution and out of control fire. Edison\u2019s dc current\u2019s image further tarnished in the public when he made the electric chair. So people resented from using electric bulbs and preferred staying back to the safer kerosene lamps. Later, when Nicola Tesla invented the alternating current, the safer and the more powerful current, Morgan invested in him. Gradually, after series of demonstrations, people could trust this new form of electricity and started using electric bulbs again, but this time those lit by alternating current. ",

            "answer_text": "I was just reading something that related to this last week in Olivier Sacks memoir called Uncle Tungsten. His uncle was a chemist who manufactured light-bulbs so they featured a great deal in his boyhood.  In the pages starting on chapter five he discusses it a great deal.  He says that in his boyhood in the 1930s many streets in London still had gas lamplight. His Edwardian house had been converted to electricity in the 1920s. But they still kept a few gas jets so if the power went off they could light by them. Both his parents were physicians and the house was very large. I imagine that less well off people didn't have electric light in many places yet. Electric light bulbs were very exciting to people in the 1880s but there were already gas systems in most cities and power plants and wires needed to be built In 1816 the first gas lighting was in England. By 1823 it was in many cities. By 1859 it was all over England. It was 75% cheaper than lamp oil or candles. So with electric light it was not that people had no lighting before. The early bulbs were not cheap and they were dim and fragile. His uncles, the light bulb makers, described the fight back and forth between gas and electric lighting in the 1880s and 90s.  The issue was that the gas lighting industry had been revolutionized by Auer in 1891 when he discovered that a mantle impregnated with a 99-1 ratio of thoria to ceria made a much more brilliant light. This made serious competition for the new electric light. The new carbon filament bulbs were a dim yellowish light not brilliant white. In 1882 the first central electric system in London was set up on Farringdon Bridge road and the Holburn Viaduct. For the next 10 years electric lighting systems were built. But then in 1891 the new gas mantel systems made better light and cities still had gas systems. Then in 1897 the first osmium bulbs were made. They were brighter but too fragile. And osmium was too rare. Then in 1905 tantalum bulb filaments became possible. They were cheaper and could be mass produced. They challenged both carbon filament and gas mantels. Tungsten with bulbs filled with argon which was cheaper, tougher and more efficient was figured out in 1913. Commercial quantities of argon were figured out after WWI. This enabled light bulbs to take over from gas lighting in most cities after WWI. ",
