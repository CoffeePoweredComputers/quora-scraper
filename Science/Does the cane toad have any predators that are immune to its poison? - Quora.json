            "answer_text": "In its natural habitat, i.e. South America and parts of Central America, the Cane Toad has several predators, which include the Broad-snouted Caiman and the Banded Cat-eyed Snake. Many species of Eels, Catfish, Bullet ants and Ibis also frequently prey upon the Cane Toad. The Cane Toad (Rhinella marina)  Broad-snouted Caiman (Caiman latirostris)  Banded Cat-eyed Snake (Leptodeira annulata)  However, these natural predators do not occur in Australia, where the Cane Toad is an introduced and invasive species. The predatory animals that exist in Australia are not entirely immune to bufotoxin, secreted by the Cane Toad as a defense mechanism. However, a few native species in Australia, the Torresian Crow for example, has learnt to prey on the Cane Toad without ingesting the poison; it delivers a lethal blow using its beak, after flipping the toad over, and consumes the toad\u2019s innards. A recent research reports that the Australian Freshwater Corocodile has learnt to eat only the legs of the Cane Toad. ",
