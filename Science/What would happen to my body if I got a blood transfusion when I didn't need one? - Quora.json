            "answer_text": "Blood cells live for about 3-4 months. When you receive foreign blood via a transfusion, the alien cells are usually filtered out of circulation within a week. It is in the first few days that they save your life. Beyond that, you'd either need more transfusions or the health problem has been corrected. Filtration of the blood cells within the transfusion usually occurs in the spleen but the liver also has an active immune system that also filters out these cells. They are eventually eaten by macrophages (a type of white blood cell equivalent to a hungry pit-bull) and excreted in the bile (from the liver), which is passed then into your intestines. Any fluid imbalance that occurs immediately during and after a blood transfusion is easily regulated by your kidneys. Most of the blood you've receive during a transfusion is excreted within 7 days. Provided the blood-type was matched correctly, there are no issues or concerns, unless you're Jehovah's Witness or the blood wasn't screened for infectious diseases.  ",

            "answer_text": "As a number of others have answered, your body would seek to remove. And as one said the doctor would be subject to criminal action or even medical fraud, since they would have charged your insurance close to $1000 for that pint of blood.  The issue of what was that blood carrying, and how well they filtered out the bad junk, before you got could be an ongoing problem the rest of your life. For example, no one filters out for the Zika virus right now. And the hundreds that were infected with HIV before they started to filter it out. In Africa, where they have limited facilities for the processing of blood in a proper manner, you could come home with a wide variety of common illnesses.  ",

            "answer_text": "Same place your own blood goes when it gets old - it gets taken to the spleen and is \"broken up for parts\" and mostly recycled.  One thing that doesn't recycle is the haem part of haemoglobin which ends up as bile and is excreted via the liver and gall bladder. Your own red blood cells have a life of about 120 days; transfused blood doesn't live as long as it's a mix of young and old cells, has been drained out and stored in a cold plastic bag and even if it's a match for the major groups it won't be an absolutely perfect match unless it's an auto-transfusion.
