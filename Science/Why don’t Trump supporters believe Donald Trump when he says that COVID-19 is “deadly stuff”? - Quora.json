            "answer_text": "but who exactly is saying they don\u2019t? The average death age of people with covid is 82. Anyone aged under 65 has in between a 99.65% and 99.98% chance of survival (CDC). Still, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t believe it, it just means that they decide based on their situation rather than the state. Also, when Trump got Covid, people made videos by the thousands, if not dozens or hundreds of thousands, wishing Trump well. If i thought Covid was like a cold, i wouldn\u2019t care if my candidate got it. ",

You don\u2019t arrange a grand entrance back to the White House - and then do a second take. You don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s business as usual by going back to work while still infectious. In short, the little President who cried wolf, has called wolf once too often. ",
