            "answer_text": "For a long while it was believed that there was an inherent difference between compounds produced from minerals and those produced by living organisms. Then Wohler synthesised urea from mineral sources and the vitalism idea died. Now organic chemistry includes compounds of carbon except for a few like metal carbonates and carbides. The border is a bit fuzzy. If a chemical has a chain of C-C bonds then it is definitely organic. ",
