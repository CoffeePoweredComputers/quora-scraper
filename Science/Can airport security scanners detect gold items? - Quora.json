            "answer_text": "Er, yeah. They use metal detectors. Gold is a metal. It\u2019s the kind of thing metal detectors are specifically designed to detect. Unless you\u2019re carrying a huge amount of it there\u2019s really nothing to worry about. I\u2019ve travelled with gold rings, gold cufflinks, my wife often has gold jewelry (rings, necklace etc). They show up on the scanner. The agent operating the scanner sees jewelry in the bag and it goes through the scanner for me to reclaim it. Unless you\u2019re traveling to some tinpot banana republic where you\u2019re afraid the agents are corrupt enough to demand you hand over your jewelry in exchange for safe passage (in which case you shouldn\u2019t take gold items at all), the agents operating the security scanners don\u2019t care if you\u2019re travelling with personal effects that happen to be gold. If you\u2019re travelling with $1,000,000 worth of gold bars that\u2019s a different story. If you\u2019ve got a legitimate reason to be carrying them you still won\u2019t have anything to worry about. If that $1,000,000 worth of gold bars represents the proceeds of that month\u2019s cocaine sales on the streets of London and you\u2019re trying to fly to New York with it, be prepared to answer some awkward questions.

            "answer_text": "The metal detectors can easily detect gold, but they are usually calibrated to ignore small amounts\u2014many people have gold fillings in their teeth, and would like to keep their glasses on while going through security, for example. The surface area of the metal seems to matter more than the actual amount of metal. When I lived in Germany, I flew Swissair a lot. On every flight, they offered the passengers chocolate. For several months, the chocolate was in the form of large, 10cm foil-wrapped coins. The flight attendants were adamant that you take lots of chocolate, so I always ended up with a few in my jacket pockets. They set off the security scanners every time! As a test, I ate the chocolate, but kept the foil crumpled up in a tight ball in the same pocket. The security scanners offered no warning after that. So: If you wish to smuggle gold, do so in small nuggets, rather than foil sheets. ",

On the X-ray machine for your hand luggage, the gold and silver will show up. They may ask you to open your bag to see what it is. If it is not over the limit for currency, you should not have any problems. ",
