            "answer_text": "Nothing \u2026. is no thing so it can not coexist, simply because it is nothing. Have not scientists proven that on looking at the micro level there is just space and matter is not matter at all but space? So everything is appearing from nothing as nothing and it is all matter? The appearance of matter is the way we can see nothing, as nothing can not be directly experienced \u2026. by itself, so matter is manifest so nothing can experience everything in space and time. It is nothing which is pure potential of everything , wanting to experience itself. So the personal is simply identification to the particular action figure moving through space and time now. Life\u2026. the beautiful expression of life we are now is eternal while we come and go in form while ultimately formless. Everything , or form is our way of seeing nothing through a filter, as nothing is too incomprehensible to the brain. Form (as the void) is strung out as space and time so it is a little more digestible. Lol. I could be making all this up I don't know? I just wrote it. Love. ",

They can\u2019t take into account kinetic dynamic of substance (they only treat it as \u201cat rest\u201d in terms of physics; that\u2019s probabilty for you, a majority gives you the same result as a hundred percent certainty, now it inaccurately describes the item\u2019s dynamic interaction of \u2018state\u201d. Natural Matter cannot occupy the exact same space. Technically, everything that item is, exists in that spot while nothing else does\u2026 (But there will be overlap of fields and energies generated or influenced by the entirety of the matter, as a whole, or one mass. So applied to the last extrapolation, the \u201cnothing\u201d gets eliminated from the equation by < matter but better defined by \u201cmass of\u201d.) ",
