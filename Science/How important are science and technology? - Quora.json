Science and technology has made life a lot easier and also a lot better with the advancement of medicines and analysis on diseases. Technology, science and knowledge are important in modern contemporary society. Essential questions include the following: How does science and technology produce new products, new ways of understanding, new ways of living and new institutions? Why is new technology and knowledge so fundamental to us in the ways through which we imagine the future? Technology, knowledge and science are fundamental in modern contemporary society. The understanding of how social, cultural and material elements influence the production of new practices, new ways of understanding and new institutions is vital in our understanding of contemporary postmodern society. Studies of technology and science provides students with insight into how different processes of knowledge are initiated and progressed, and how innovative technological processes are developed, employed and increase in importance. Studies of technology and science gives insight into the understanding and knowledge of technology, science and knowledge from the viewpoint of the humanities and the social sciences. Throughout the course of study students will become familiar with amendments of social and cultural analyses of modern science and technology in interaction with social, political, economical and cultural processes of change. In this manner, students will be provided with the academic basis for working with detailed analyses of different forms of technologies and processes of knowledge, within business life/industry and commerce, research and research-related work, political development, management of knowledge and innovation.

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re important because they keep us inter-connected and they streamline the processing and manufacturing of goods and services. Without technology, we would not have access to limitless amounts of information and knowledge that sources like the internet provide us. We would not be able to easily communicate with people across the world in seconds, and we would be unable to process international transactions on a wide-scale. Technology strives towards the globalization of our world. Without it, we would be more isolated and localized as a society. Science is the foundation upon which technology relies upon, and upon what our universe relies upon. Without Biology, our bodies wouldn\u2019t have evolved to create the multi-cell organisms we are today. Without Chemistry, we would be unable to find cures for diseases and medicine to help treat people with life-threatening diseases. Without Physics, nothing would exist, as it literally governs the laws of our universe. So to answer it bluntly, they are very important. Without them, our world as we know it, wouldn\u2019t exist.

The more of these you answer \u201cyes\u201d, the more important you think science and technology are! Do you like your cell phone?Do you like video games?Do you like getting to see more of the world than that of a moderately sized state in a lifetime?Do you like getting to see more of the world, without having to ride on an animal?Do you like food you didn\u2019t have to hunt?Do you like getting to eat more than about a dozen kinds of food in your life?Do you like your food cooked?Do you like knowing your food was cooked properly?Do you like knowing you won\u2019t get attacked by a wild animal during the night?Do you like knowing you probably won\u2019t get attacked by a wild animal while you\u2019re out & about during the day?Do you like light other than the sun?Do you like not dying, or having loved ones die, commonly at a very young age and for often unknown reasons?Do you like having a place for your poo to go, and it going away where you don\u2019t have to think about it or do anything with it?Do you like entertainment that doesn\u2019t involve creative uses of a stick and/or rock?There are many more questions of course, but I think this gives an idea\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cScience\u201d is the name of searching, exploring and seeking the secrets of nature to make the human life easier through many discoveries, inventions and instrumentations called technology. It has always been a cherish desire of a man to explore and search out the naturally occuring phenomenon that how they are running systematically. So man learnt through trials and errors to discover many incredible facts of the nature and made them in use of artificial life. So, as the time passed people grew up with more new ideas and gave birth to science and technology. But the real science and technology began to make progress in 17th centuray when the people were more sphosticated and learned. Since 17th centuary to this era science and technology progressed very rapidly and engagged human life with artificial world. Now man has come out of his futile and superstitious thoughts. Now he is in modern world. All has changed due to tremendous progress of science. If we compare the lives a few years back and the lives of the modern world then here are some examples; Classical People had to do more efforts and physical activities but now the man is no more physically active just because of technologically packed sorounding. Peolpe of the olden time used to plough their fields by Oxen and now a days science and technology introduced a Tractor which release human fag. Before the tremendous invention of aeroplane by Wright Brothren it would have taken a greater time for a journy of even a small distance but now a large distance can be travelled in a few minutes and hours. People used to travel by carts and horses but now there is an alternate of them i.e cars, motor cycles, rickshaws etc. We are all sorrounded with the bunch of inventions that made human life comfortable .it seems to be lived hardly if there is no more facilities now onward. life will become arduous. Man won't be able to perform his job properly as we are not self dependent now. Here we are on the mercy of science and technology. Science and technology has also imparted its pivotal role in developing a country. All the developed countries are fully equiped with the modern and neoteric technology that has brought them to overcome the degression and earn progress. The role of science & technology can't be ignored in upgrowth and thrivingness of a country. To be prosperous, progressive and powerful, a country needs what is the advancement of science and technology in thier culture. Through the research and technology we can perform well in different fields to earn huge capital. However, in Pakistan, science and technology is somewhat deadly working to earn its existance in front of the world. Education system is defective. Bogus and outdated courses are the major reasons which cease student's abilities and make them functionless.they aren't supposed to opt out a new notion, idea and theory about a scientific fact. There is no practicality that limited our students to exams only. They are now just supposed to crame something and feel it as honour to obtain higher marks in exams. I cordly disagree with Pakistan's scientific and technological race with other countries. \u25aaI would like to suggest that Information technology should strictly and perfectly be taught at schools,colloeges and universities by experts. Those who have cleared up their BS should only be allowed to teach the 9th & 10th class and those who posses M.phil degree, let them to teach students of FSc. Course should be upto-date and there should be more subjects like Psychology, computer and Future technology from 9th to 12th as compulsory ones as other scientific subjects are. In this way we can promote & improve our broken condition and gradually earn achievment, advancement. Science and technology is displaying some of its side effects on environment as it progresses and is being more advanced. \u2022It seems that environment is being polluted continuously and instead of providing ease to human life, it ensures that life will be more disturbed and hard in near future as compared to the life we are living or had lived a few centuries ago. \u2022Many new diseases have been diagnosed. \u2022 Earth's greenry is being exploited every day. \u2022 Natural products have been blended with the products formed artificially and are no more available. We are being deprived of natural good ourselves that will be more dangerous and health voilating if is not conserved. So, \"to make the survivle sure we need to protect our natural environment more\" through suitable inventions only. Usman iqbal ",
