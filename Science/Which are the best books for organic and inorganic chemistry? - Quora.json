            "answer_text": "Well depends how far you want to go in either subject. Organic and Inorganic, in terms of research, both vary. Some Organic Chemists do a lot of synthesis (For instance natural compounds, new synthetic methods, etc.) while others focus on spectroscopy, Bio-Organic, etc. Inorganic Chemists will often focus on similar topics as well. The key difference is that Organic chemists focus on Organic compounds (Ones with Carbons and Hydrogens) while Inorganic Chemists spend a lot more of their time focusing on metals. There is obviously tons of cross-over which leads to the field of Organo-Metallics. This field focuses on combining the two fields and includes topics such as coordination chemistry (Specifically focusing on coordination complexes with organic ligands), catalysis and reagents (Such as EtMgBr, the ethyl Grignard reagent, OsO4, used in the formation of diols, and Dess-Martin Periodoxane, a common oxidizer). If you are just talking about just taking one class, then talk to people who have taken both classes at your school. The difficulty will vary from university to university and in other cases, one particular professor will be very highly recommended. I personally prefer Organic Chemistry because the synthesis is more interesting to me and I also love mechanisms. On the flip side, Inorganic Chemistry focuses much more on orbitals and metals. So if you really like quantum mechanics (The foundation of our modern understanding of orbitals and electrons), then Inorganic would be a good choice. Both classes require very little Math (This might be different at another school so double check) and are very fun and interesting classes. Either way, they are both excellent subjects and you can\u2019t go wrong with either one. ",
