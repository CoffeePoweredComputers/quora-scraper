            "answer_text": "This is not a question for physics. Its a metaphysics question.... Physics can't give a absolute answer to this question nor could there ever be one.  We can't even see beyond the Big Bang and so far there is no ending to the Universe.   First off understand that the Universe 'might' have no start and no end.  These words have no meaning in the Universe. Starting something is actually ending something else and this can go on for ever. Nothing ends and nothing starts.  No one created energy.  Just like we are not created out of thin air. We come from carbs protein iron and calcium. When we die we start to decay from the micro organisms and the worms living in ground.  Humans like to think we can find the start of something or  the ending of something but really there was never a start or ending to begin with....  Energy cannot be created according to today's physics. In fact Energy is = 0.   Your question could be where did MASS come from?    If we look at infinity and understand what it could mean.  The non observable universe could be indeed infinite in time and mass.  If this could be true we should understand that the universe did not start and end.  These are constructs developed by a human brain.  In the universe nothing comes to an end nor is their a beginning.   Example:  We are made of stars and one day our atoms will be part of another newly born star and again it will die and spread out its atoms.    In my opinion the big bang was not the beginning of our Universe but the end of a massive black hole located near our known universe.  And these questions cannot be answered by scientists because we don't have enough data. You must come up with your own theory and question it.  We must look beyond physics for these type of questions and come up with multiple theories trying to prove and disprove each one. What is your theory?  ",

            "answer_text": "There are several possible answers to this.   The standard cosmological answer is the energy was created in the very first instance of the universe by a quantum vacuum fluctuation.    It is actually imprecise to say energy cannot be created or destroyed it happens all the time.   The equation that governs this is: \u0394E\u0394t\u2265\u210f2 What this equation tells you is the shorter the time period you look at the less certain you can be about the energy in the system.   But you can always be certain there is some energy in any system. Over long periods this you can be extremely certain in the amount of energy, so the principle energy cannot be created or destroy holds up.  But when people talk about quantum vacuum fluctuations, or and electron-positron pair appearing in a vacuum this is exactly the equation that they are referring to. Now this is not a fully satisfying answer, as the universe always demands repayment of this energy loan.   Even extreme cases, like say an electron-positron pair appear near the event horizon, one is swallowed and one escape.   It seems like \"repayment\" of the loan is impossible.   But this process known as Hawking radiation can actually take energy from inside the event horizon of a black hole to maintain conservation of energy. So how exactly can we have a whole universe of energy, and not have had the debt repaid?   There are two possible response.   One is to say it came from thermal energy.   Which is basically a self referencing answer.  Essentially the energy was always there, it just changed forms.   Another is to say there is a net zero energy. The net zero energy is more interesting.   Both gravity and electro-static force have a negative potential energy associated with them.   This means if lets say the only thing you had in the universe where two neutrinos.  (The lightest particle we know of.)   If you brought those neutrinos infinitely close together you would have an infinite amount of energy.    What this means is if at the start of the universe just two particles where borrowed with no net energy and they were brought together into a singularity, without mutual annihilation there could be enough energy for a full universe. So it turns out obtaining infinite energy to power a universe is not hard to come up with.   The hard part is actually trying to figure out the laws of nature that prevents this from happening again.   General relativity tells us something very similar happens in a black hole when a singularity is formed.   Fortunately though, we are protected from such an event by an event horizon. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of problems with this question. First our ability to explain where the energy came from or not isn\u2019t positive evidence for \u201cgod did it\u201d. To illustrate I could say \u201cIf homosexual universe creating pixies didn\u2019t exist, where did all the energy come from, since energy can neither be created nor be destroyed?\u201dTo which you might say \u201chomosexual universe creating pixies aren\u2019t real\u201d to which I\u2019d point out that there is the same amount of non fallacious argument for their existence as there is for any gods from what I\u2019ve been presented. Next problem is you seem to be trying to use the The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy. But you seem to not understand what it actually says. It states states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time. Now there are two problems for you. First is we don\u2019t know if the universe is an isolated system. We know that the visible universe is not an isolated system. So even at that scale your premise is wrong. So you\u2019ve mangled a scientific concept then pulled an argument from ignorance fallacy, specifically a god of the gaps fallacy. That since you can\u2019t think of how something happened and no believe if no one else can then your answer of \u201cgod did it\u201d wins by default. This is bad logic. Even if I have no answer to your question your answer doesn\u2019t become more correct. For example if I ask two five year old children what the cube root of 27 is and one says \u201c5\u201d and the other says \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d the child that said \u201c5\u201d isn\u2019t more likely to be right because the other child was honest and said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.

            "answer_text": "If energy cannot be created or destroyed, where does energy originate from? In 1785, Antoine Lavoisier discovered the scientific law called the Law of Conservation of Mass, which states: matter is neither created nor destroyed. In 1905, Einstein\u2019s equation: Energy equals Mass times the Velocity of Light squared, indicates that Energy and Mass (matter) are interchangeable. The question relates to the principle of vibration where everything that exists is a vibration of energy from THE ALL (God) which is the highest vibration of energy, and matter which is the lowest vibration of energy. THE PRINCIPLE OF VIBRATION. \u201cNothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\u201d\u2013The Kybalion. This Principle embodies the truth that \u201ceverything is in motion\u201d; \u201ceverything vibrates\u201d; \u201cnothing is at rest\u201d; facts which Modern Science endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify. And yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration\u2013the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest\u2013just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion. This is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes. An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. \u201cHe who understands the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the sceptre of power,\u201d says one of the old writers.

            "answer_text": "The positive energy of particles is exactly in balance with negative gravitational energy. Total energy in the universe is zero. I addressed this on a prior Quora post: Stephen Hawking said the total energy of the universe is zero and Brian Greene said we still have to account for 10 kg before inflation. Who is right? Here\u2019s where the idea of zero energy comes from:  https://www.astrosociety.org/publication/a-universe-from-nothing/ \u201c\u2026In the inflationary theory, matter, antimatter, and photons were produced by the energy of the false vacuum, which was released following the phase transition. All of these particles consist of positive energy. This energy, however, is exactly balanced by the negative gravitational energy of everything pulling on everything else. In other words, the total energy of the universe is zero! It is remarkable that the universe consists of essentially nothing, but (fortunately for us) in positive and negative parts. You can easily see that gravity is associated with negative energy: If you drop a ball from rest (defined to be a state of zero energy), it gains energy of motion (kinetic energy) as it falls. But this gain is exactly balanced by a larger negative gravitational energy as it comes closer to Earth\u2019s center, so the sum of the two energies remains zero\u2026. The idea of a zero-energy universe, together with inflation, suggests that all one needs is just a tiny bit of energy to get the whole thing started (that is, a tiny volume of energy in which inflation can begin). The universe then experiences inflationary expansion, but without creating net energy.\u201d Brian Greene is pointing out that 10 kg (a tiny bit of energy) is needed to get the whole thing started. \u201c\u2026.Quantum theory, and specifically Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle, provide a natural explanation for how that energy may have come out of nothing. Throughout the universe, particles and antiparticles spontaneously form and quickly annihilate each other without violating the law of energy conservation. These spontaneous births and deaths of so-called \u201cvirtual particle\u201d pairs are known as \u201cquantum fluctuations.\u201d Indeed, laboratory experiments have proven that quantum fluctuations occur everywhere, all the time. Virtual particle pairs (such as electrons and positrons) directly affect the energy levels of atoms, and the predicted energy levels disagree with the experimentally measured levels unless quantum fluctuations are taken into account. Perhaps many quantum fluctuations occurred before the birth of our universe. Most of them quickly disappeared. But one lived sufficiently long and had the right conditions for inflation to have been initiated. Thereafter, the original tiny volume inflated by an enormous factor, and our macroscopic universe was born. The original particle-antiparticle pair (or pairs) may have subsequently annihilated each other \u2013 but even if they didn\u2019t, the violation of energy conservation would be minuscule, not large enough to be measurable.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows what energy is. Richard Feynman said it is just a number that we get from a calculation. Nobody knows what time is. Thanks to Einstein time has now been included in the fourth dimension. Your shadow is you in the flat 2-dimension. Your shadow knows very little about the real you of the 3-dimension. Your shadow does not know your pulse rate, height, skin colour, temperament etc. So equally, we know next to nothing of the fourth dimension. We cannot measure time. We measure the movement of a pointer across a clock face. So all the things that we know nothing about what they actually are, like mass, charge, time, the gravitation mechanism, energy etc. must come from the fourth dimension. If they came from the third dimension we could define them. Many scientists fear that pollution, poison, atomic explosions etc. are cracking the walls of this fourth dimension and releasing a Pandora\u2019s box of 4-D disease that we cannot solve with 3-D medicine. A scary possibility. AIDS, super bugs etc. We cannot create or destroy energy as it is a 4-D reality that is far removed from our 3-D world. Walker Gargagliano gave the most obvious answer. Energy is too subtle for us, because it comes from above us. So Someone above the 4-D had to create it. Science says the same thing. There was nothing before the Big Bang. No space. No time. No evidence of anything that could \u201cexplode\u201d. So we are outside of science since there is no pre-Big Bang evidence. Whatever exploded ( and nobody knows what it was so we are once again outside of science ) had to be in a higher dimension since it was not part of 4-D space time. This is troublesome as there is no physical evidence of a fifth dimension. \u201cEnergy was created\u201d. This is again outside of science as it contradicts what Einstein said was the strongest law of physics, the conservation of energy. No experiment has ever disproved this law. To break this law would require a miracle, because it cannot be done within the laws of physics. Physics does not deal in miracles. So when all the energy ( not some of it, all of it ) was created at the beginning the scientists ( if we ignore their frantic and evasive hand-waving technical gobbledy gook ) are actually claiming a tremendous miracle. This is exactly what Walker says. But Physics has no laws of creation. We can only modify what is created. Do not listen to science stories about a vacuum. They are not telling the truth. Their vacuum is always full of energy. So it is not a true vacuum. A true vacuum has nothing. No energy, no nothing. Ask a scientist to start with nothing and see how far he gets. Science cannot perform a miracle. But Walker knows Who can. ",

ALL creation questions and debates about the universe being finite or infinite are all pretty much the same thing. The Big Bang theory hints at a start or creation from nothing BUT that\u2019s not necessarily the case. Ancient versions of the question lead to god type explanations, but god answers doesn\u2019t explain why or how unless you pre suppose what god was thinking and his intentions - and god nutters think SCIENTISTS are conceited. If god is the answer ANYTHING is possible. Our universe is SO big, that humans might be an unintended consequence of the creation of something else God wanted and she doesn\u2019t even know we are here!!! How did our universe come to be? Was there a beginning or was it always here? If there was a beginning to this universe, what was before that, nothing - or was the stuff of our universe something else? Or is there an eternal infinite multiverse? NOTE: almost ALL conservation laws are conditional. Dark Energy, if our present hypothesis about it is correct, is continuously creating new energy out of nothing. The \u201cconservation of energy\u201d apply to close system IN our universe, if the universe IS a closed system, then it SHOULD apply to the universe as a whole. But General Relativity has no problem with the violation of the conservation of energy on a cosmological scale. SO TO SUM UP: The conservation of energy law of physics is valid and a good one, get the detail and conditions in which it applies Conservation of energy - WikipediaGeneral Relativity allows the violation of the law on cosmological scales, so i\u2019ve heard many theoretical physicsts say, eg Sean CarrollDoes Big Bang theory violate the law - I say not necessarily, depends on your hypothesis for before the Big Bang - there are no falsifiable theoriesAlan Guth (inflation guy) suggested if you viewed gravity as negative energy, the sum total of all energy is zero - hence the universe does not violate conservation, but Dark Energy stuffs that up.God is just another un falsifiable idea, except that Quantum Field Theory proves there is no after life and no way for God to inter fear with our daily lives - check out Sean Carroll and \u201cThe Big Picture\u201dSO, if there is a God, he must have created something that he can\u2019t control - for entertainment maybe - that\u2019s what i\u2019d do. Imagine if you could do anything and never fail, know the outcome to everything, and never die - what the hell would you do?!?!? If you where THAT god, you\u2019ve have to think you where in hell, right?",

            "answer_text": "I am not a physicist and neither am I believer of any divine entity, I will try to explain this from my limited understanding of the subject [please correct any scientific inaccuracies]. I hope you are not asking if there is a divine being that is capable of creating energy and moreover bending the rules of physics, I don't think that is how our universe works or has ever worked that way, it seems like from what scientists observe and calculate, it pretty much holds up, yes certain things are hard to explain, certain things are almost impossible, but fitting them with some \"god\" is not a great idea, if that is what you are suggesting here. I feel at the end of the day we live in a Zero-energy universe so nothing gets violated in my opinion [I am not a physicist]. Now are you asking about the big bang? the moment when it all began. Here is a little diagram  I hope you are aware of some elementary concepts of physics and you know about the concept of Mass\u2013energy equivalence.  I feel I still haven't answered your question, so coming back at it what you are probably asking is what exactly happened at Planck epoch and how did we end up with something such as the Inflation (cosmology) . All ideas concerning the very early universe (cosmogony) are speculative. No accelerator experiments have yet probed energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed during this period. Proposed scenarios differ radically. Some examples are the Hartle\u2013Hawking initial state, string landscape, brane inflation, string gas cosmology, and the ekpyrotic universe. Some of these are mutually compatible, while others are not.The Planck epoch is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) big bang cosmology wherein the temperature was so high that the four fundamental forces\u2014electromagnetism, gravitation, weak nuclear interaction, and strong nuclear interaction\u2014were one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a gravitational singularity before this time, but this theory relies on general relativity and is expected to break down due to quantum effects. So, you are probably still wondering what do I have to say, what made big bang happen, how did everything came into being without disobeying any laws, well for one we know that at the many theories break down at this level, and all we have are plausible scenarios, I will definitely not say I am sure there wasn't a god, maybe he made the universe and it's laws, but I have no evidence of that, yes we don't have evidence that he did not either, but I for one work on the assumption that there is no creator.  A Universe from Nothing is a possibility and you can read physicist Lawrence M. Krauss's book on the topic, although he has received a lot of criticism for his work as well, but as a layman with some knowledge of the topic I feel I don't mind his hypothesis. And in the current universe we have the concept of Zero-energy universe, so at the end of the day, what you can say that we have is the ultimate free lunch as we call it and it is fascinating that such things are atleast plausible now, you can read about it here , and the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly zero: its amount of positive energy in the form ofmatter is exactly canceled out by its negative energy in the form of gravity I hope this helped.

            "answer_text": "Responding to your question, there are only 3 ways that it can be answered: Starting with the \u201cgivens\u201d, and apply the laws of physics which we are familiar with, going back in time before or during the Big Bang, and then using these laws to explain things before these laws were discovered. Also known as \u201ca priori\u201d explanations.Starting with \u201cNothingness\u201d, and then thinking in terms of abstract concepts which are entirely unrelated to the laws of physics that we are familiar with. And since collecting of empirical data is impossible, then solving this problem with logic and mathematical balance.Assuming that the question can never be answered, give up on science and reason, and invent an eternal god living in an eternal universe with an eternal and constant energy supply. In other words, a Closed System.The 1st answer, starting with the \u201cgivens\u201d, is not acceptable for the simple reason that it involves circular logic where energy is defined according to the laws of thermodynamics where mass = energy. But then where did mass come from. This involves \u201ca priori\u201d knowledge along with meaningless tautologies. The 3rd answer involves religion and philosophy. And since those 2 subjects belong to controversial topics in the field of Humanities, and since Humanities is not exactly science, then that approach using paraboles, allegories, and anecdotal stories is not scientifically acceptable. And most importantly, our universe is not a Closed System. Einstein, with his Cosmological Constant, along with the Hubble Telescope proved that the universe is expanding. And thus is an Open Universe. The 2nd answer, by a process of elimination, is clearly the winner where Nothingness is the starting material for all mass/energy for the simple reason that it has balance and logic. However, since all answers have only a statistical chance of being correct (since there is no empirical data to support them), then it is the best answer because there is no evidence to refute it, and thus there is at least a 50% chance that it may be correct. To sum up both logically and using simple math: so it is possible that our universe came into existence due to spontaneous and random fluctuations of Nothingness where a (+) something came into existence at the expense of a (-) something over the vastness of time. So both logically and mathematically, a simply syllogism can explain it: If Nothingness = 0 And 0 = +1 and -1 Then a (+1) universe and a (-) universe can come from (0) or Nothingness. Or more specifically, the beginning of our universe came into existence at the same time as the beginning of an anti-universe. And proof of the anti-universe is Dark Matter. And this beginning started out as a simple (+) wave and its (-) anti-wave partner which separated from Nothingness. Then as the waves became unraveled and separated from Nothingness in a PCR type multiplication process, this allowed for infinite strands of wave + anti-waves to assemble at the plus and minus ends of the dipole to come together and form monopoles, also known as gravitons and anti-gravitons, or (in aggregate) known as gravity and repulsive gravity. And it was this repulsive gravity that supplied the energy for the Big Bang. The concept of the Singularly as a power source is not acceptable for the simple reason, where did it come from. However, if an anti-Singularly is supplied then this is the same as saying gravity against repulsive gravity supplied the energy source. Remember, anytime something is introduced, it must be balanced by an anti-something. No free lunches in the Cosmos. For every Credit there must also be a Debit, that way the Grand Balance Sheet of the Cosmos will Balance. But yet not completely balance, for that would cause a reversion back into Nothingness. Thus a slight amount of asymmetry is needed to drive things forward as provided by the disparate entropy of the 2 opposing binary universes. The following diagram might help to illustrate the Big Bang/Big Separation. Also, it helps explain how gravity can be united with electromagnetism. In other words, how dipoles (electromagnetism) can be converted to monopoles (gravity) or vice versa.  Then during this multiplication process, the next vital step occurred which is the asymmetry (provided by the disparate entropy of both systems) to prevent a collapse back into Nothingness. The most important message of the above explanation is that the above scenario requires no \u201cgivens\u201d. No quantum foam, no energy from false vacuums, no branes, no singularities, and no gods. Just Nothingness. In fact, the idea that mass/energy of our universe is the result of the collision of 2 other universes is totally nonsensical. And again, a meaningless tautology using circular logic for the obvious reason: then where did those universes get there mass/energy. Nothingness is such a simple explanation that it is often rejected especially by physicists that rely on current laws of physics to explain everything in our universe, which is true. But those laws cannot be extrapolated back in time before those laws came into action. And speaking of Nothingness, it was this lack of any Higgs Field (or any matter that offered resistance) that allowed for the development of the Hyperinflation Theory where the universe and its anti-universe partner (Dark Matter) sped away from each other at faster than the speed of light due to the effect of gravity against repulsive gravity. Thus Nothingness is in fact, a fact of the Cosmos that is real. It sounds illogical to say that nothing is something but yet it is true when balanced with an anti-something. And a something plus an anti-something gives back Nothingness, or a Null Point. And a Null Point on an oscilloscope can mean that a wave has been cancelled by an anti-wave. And running things backwards from a Null Point gives back a wave and its anti-wave partner. So to answer your question, from a Null Point and considering the 4 dimensional coordinates 0,0,0,0 in the Space-Time continuum, a wave with the coordinates +1,+1,+1,+1 and its partner -1,-1,-1,-1, went on to form all the energy in our universe and the dark energy in the anti-universe. Which is a completely balanced and logical explanation. Anytime something is introduced without an explanation as to where it came from is invalid. And using using one unknown to explain another unknown is circular logic and bordering on nonsensical tautologies. It\u2019s like saying that energy came from the energy that was already there. Whereas Nothingness is a perfectly acceptable concept because it has balance, as in: 0 = (+1) and (-1). No givens or transference of our laws of physics to explain it. It is such a simple concept but yet so difficult to understand because there are no comparisons in our present universe. So, in summary: Energy Waves + their Anti-Energy Wave Partners came from Nothingness. See below article for additional information.

At some point you have resort to the old Special Pleading Fallacy to escape it and then people who know how to think will mock you for cheating. We need to give up on this ridiculous notion that at some point in the distant past there was \u201cnothingness\u201d and that everything that exists sprang into existence from nothingness. The evidence doesn\u2019t support that notion and it leads to a complete breakdown of logic. And no, the big bang model noes not posit the universe springing into existence from nothing. In fact, it posits the exact opposite. It posits that everything in the observable universe was in pretty much the exact same place at the same time about 13.8 billion years ago, making that \u201ceverything\u201d nearly infinitely dense, hot, and small. But it was still everything, not nothing. The question, as posed, is fundamentally meaningless. If energy cannot be created or destroyed, then by definition it couldn\u2019t have \u201ccome from\u201d anyplace, because by definition it must have always existed and must continue to exist, in one form or another, forever. If you want to make it have \u201ccome from\u201d someplace from \u201cnothingness\u201d, then you\u2019ll have to change the definition of energy to allow it to be created and/or destroyed.

            "answer_text": "Conservation of energy says that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. One form of energy can be transformed to another and this is what keeps the Universe going. Lets take the example of fossil fuel. Energy is stored in bonds between the atoms of hydrocarbons in fossil fuel which when broken by applying heat energy releases a *lot more* heat energy that is tapped to perform useful work. Fossil fuel is derived from fossilized remains of prehistoric organisms which derived their life-giving energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun. The Sun derives all its energy from fusing hydrogen into helium inside its core. The energy of the hydrogen atoms (forming our Sun and other such stars) derived their energy when they were created from bare subatomic particles (protons and electrons) at the time of nucleosynthesis around 300,000 years after the Big Bang. All the protons and electrons in the Universe were created moments after the Big Bang, before which time there was basically a primordial soup of particles with higher and higher energies. As we inch still closer in time to the Big Bang a point is reached, the Planck epoch (10^-43 s), beyond which standard physical laws break. So we see that the energy that is stored in fossil fuels can ultimately to traced back to the energy of the Big Bang. This primordial energy has undergone many transformations in the 13.5 billion years that it has been around and ultimately driving human civilisation forward. ",

            "answer_text": "Many fundamentals aspects of the universe can currently be honestly answered with: \"we don't know\". And it's good to be able to say that. It flags the area as being a mystery for further inquiry and research. What we don't do is eschew the honest, \"we don't know\" to the assumption, \"well it MUST be god then!\" Consider, at every point in human history, there were natural phenomona that was beyond us - that eluded our ability to understand and explain at that point in time. There was a time when we didn't understand lighting and thunder or the stars or fire etc etc etc. Usually in the past, when such explanations were beyond us, we assigned the mystery to god. How does lightning work? god! How do the stars stay in the sky? god! But over and over again, those things that were attributed to god were eventually understood and explained as a part of the natural world. That's the mistake. To assign everything that we currently don't understand to god because we're uncomfortable, for some reason, with having to admit that 1. at this time, we don't know and 2. there may come a time in the future that we WILL 3. it may indeed be a possibility that for some things, we will NEVER know. But we still feel a need to attribute the unknown to god(s). With millennia of history under our belts, you'd figure that human beings would have learned by now not to do this - to attribute to god what we currently don't understand. But as your question indicates, that impulse is still strong. As it is with other current mysteries like the origin of life (from non living compounds to living organisms) or the nature of death and the soul and of course, the ultimate origin of everything up to and including the big bang. But note that \"because god\" cuts off inquiry. In lieu of a natural explanation, we chalk it up to the ineffable and call it a day. \"We don't know\" leaves open the door and extends an invitation to find out. And it is THAT avenue that has brought us from hunter gatherers to advanced, technological civilization. \"We don't know\". Know it. Love it. ",

            "answer_text": "Mike, this is perhaps the most fundamental question that can be asked about the whole Global Universe. \u201cFrom where did all the energy come from if it can neither be created nor destroyed?\u201d There is a lot of misunderstanding about what \u201cenergy\u201d really is and therefore the law of conservation of energy is terribly misunderstood. Let me explain : Energy : Matter is accumulated energy and anti-matter is accumulated energy, so in fact there is \u201cenergy and anti-energy\u201d, even though in reality they are both energy: different kind of ripples in force fields. Conservation of energy : Energy cannot be created nor destroyed is true, but \u2026. Energy and anti-energy can spontaneously come into being (ripples) if they come in equal amounts. So when added up the result is still zero! Energy and anti-energy can interact (ripples interacting) in such a way that both disappear, meaning they are both annihilated. Frome where did all the energy come from? The answer is very simple and straightforward : from the potential vacuum energy that is able to make energy to come spontaneously into being. That explains very clear why everything in the whole Global Universe added up is still zero, as it always has been. ZERO The question that remains I have answered is : \u201chow does a perfect vacuum does what is does, this spontaneous come into being\u201d. That answer, \u201cwhat vacuum energy really is\u201d, I will not give on Quora. ",

Also, He is the One who did not only set the universe in motion but also the Laws that govern it. The Laws of Physics did not evolve. They derive from the Lawmaker who put everything in place. A little humility doesn\u2019t do most people much harm, and that is what I will recommend to those who reduce belief in the Creator God to the level of tooth fairies and treat Bible believing Christians as if we have not advanced beyond the postulates of the 19th century clergyman who attempted to fix a date for the creation of the world.If someone has graduate degrees in molecular biology, mathematics and philosophy the chances are that he knows a little more science than most of those who gleefully scorn non-atheists on Quora. If that person has written acclaimed books on Newtonian Physics, Calculus and Algorithms, and if, rather than follow the Jewish religion of his ancestors, he decides to live his life as a secular Jew, we might be willing to exclude him from the group of unthinking theists we so confidently denigrate. Please check out Professor David Berlinski and attempt to engage with the issues he raises. This is from his book, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Delusion,\u201d written in response to Professor Richard Dawkins:\u2022\tHas anyone provided a proof of God\u2019s inexistence?

Not even close.\u2022\tHave the sciences explained why our universe seems to be fine-tuned to allow for the existence of life? Not even close.\u2022\tAre physicists and biologists willing to believe in anything so long as it is not religious thought? Close enough.\u2022\tHas rationalism in moral thought provided us with an understanding of what is good, what is right, and what is moral? Not close enough.\u2022\tHas secularism in the terrible twentieth century been a force for good? Not even close to being close.\u2022\tIs there a narrow and oppressive orthodoxy of thought and opinion within the sciences? Close enough.\u2022\tDoes anything in the sciences or in their philosophy justify the claim that religious belief is irrational?

            "answer_text": "Energy can neither be created or destroyed but change from one form to another. Energy is always present with in the mass as the property of the body. For instance if we consider Sun as the source of energy, then the energy of the sun is produced by the reaction of hydrogen in to helium which is happening in the core of sun and changing chemical energy in to heat, light and other small form of energies. Then the energy emit by sun dissipate in the universe and small part of that energy is absorbed by our planet and absorbed by various different element in the universe . Because of which most of the elements above the earth atmosphere is present in ionic state and which also causes them to create meteorite. The part of energy absorbed by earth is used for nurtured plants and other living and non - living beings on our planet. if we consider plant nurture the energy in very efficient way then it is not true, it is nurtured equally by every thing on earth whether plant, humans, bacteria, elements and other forms of matter. But depends on the size and readily availability of the energy for instance plants needs sunlight for their growth but they may get dried during sunny days. But energy will still be present in them in the form of chemicals and other elements.    The energy absorbed by earth is then used to change weather conditions, growth of plants and create different atmosphere at different places according to the amount of the energy  absorbed by that part of the planet. Because of that earth have different atmospheric conditions at different places. Other then that  plants we eat, or the food we eat also produce energy in us by the chemical reactions and then change it in to mechanical and other form of energy. Then the excretion produced by our body also have some energy which is then utilize by the earth.        ",

            "answer_text": " This has nothing to do with science, but look at it this way. Your emotions.  You can \"feel\" nothing inside, but you know your feeling nothing so wouldnt that nothing be considered nothing. Ok, so apparently, before the big bang, there was a small speck of pure energy. It literally contained everything that exists today, and soon  enough it \"exploded\" created the big bang. There is another theory, that anti-matter and matter can cancel each  other out and there used to be an equal amount of each. Then, for whatever reason that our science cannot \"discover\" there was a rip in the 5th dimension, sucking in the anti-matter, and so the balance was tipped toward the normal matter side, allowing matter to exist, allowing us to exist. Now, to answer your question about there being a place where there truly, just is, nothing. We haven't been able to prove such a place, but in theory, it exists,because if the universe is \"expanding\" then isn't there million, billion, trillions, possible infinite space left for it to expand into? So yes, it is possible for there to be a place where atoms literally don't exist, where \"nothing\" exists, untill of course, the universe spreads to that part, but then there is only just more space. Thus allowing us to call it \"space\" We live in a world where life goes through a cycle of creation, growth and death. Seems like we cannot comprehend a system that doesn't abide by this rule since we have no context to visualize any other way the universe can operate, at least currently.   So much of science is simply observing and comparing physical phenomena  and if there is anything we see predictably repeating, we label it something and call it science. I can't believe we can ever answer anything meaningful about our existence (why we are here, where did we come from, etc.) with science.  This makes me think future generations will evolve to using more than  just science to answer the most profound questions about our existence.  Maybe we just live in an era that believes too much in science similar  to how our ancestors believed religion answered all the questions about the physical phenomena they encountered. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody did. But that is another matter. The concept of energy is not a primary one, as is often imagined. From basic unit analysis you will notice that its unit, the Joule, is derived. Displacement = m Displacement over time = Speed = m/s Acceleration = change of speed = (m/s)/s = m/s ^2 Force = a mass Accelerating = Kg x m/s^2 = kg.m/s^2 Energy = a Force exerted over a distance = m x kg.m/s^2 = kg.m^2/s^2 (the Joule) So the classically defined idea of energy isn't meaningful without Distance (space), Time and Mass. For electromagnetic energy this still holds because Planck's constant is required and defined as 6.62607004 \u00d7 10 to the power of -34 kg.m^2 / s Multiply in the time component of frequency (hertz) 1/s and you get kg.m^2/s^2 So energy is is a derived property. What bothers you is conservation of energy. At the very smallest scales this conservation rule gets more flexible and probabilistic, but it doesn't add up to much more than Quantum fluctuation If time, space and mass are emergent properties of quantum fields, rather than absolute conditions, then the question of the origin of energy goes down a deep rabbit hole that nobody has been to the bottom of... yet. There are many different attempts going on right now, but science is naturally slow, so hang in there, if you are young now, you might see this one answered one day. ",

            "answer_text": "Our universe is what we know as a closed-system. A closed-system is something in physics that doesn't exchange matter with the rest of what is our there (other possible universes or \"systems\" occupying space/time on the space-time continuum). But our universe was not always this way. Before the Big-Bang, what ever was there in seemingly nothingness were these random particles called tachyons. There is no confirmed existence of them but are like pure forms of neutrinos which bear some resemblance with the peculiar properties of tachyons. Tachyons always travel faster than the speed of light (try to forget Einstein for a moment) and have an imaginary amount of mass. Since they break the rules of regular matter and because there was no closed system in play matter and energy get created and destroyed. These tachyons would pop up and disappear in the measure of Plank Time. The last thing in place is a false vacuum and a true vacuum. A false vacuum is a state of high-energy where the tachyons are unstable. Ideally they would want to go to a lower-energy state. Think of it as a dam holding water back. You would think that the water is at a low-energy state until a crack in the dam shows you that the water will flow out and settle in a massive puddle. That is the transition from a high-energy to a low-energy state. It is also described as the natural or ground-state. Similar thing happens with tachyons, except a crack in the dam or a rip in this emptiness that represents the true-vacuum or space-time continuum. At this point the water or the energy (which is a real number) inside the tachyon wants to immediately transition into the ground-state or lower-energy state and so the water flows out faster and may make a bigger crack in the dam. In this case, the dam is the empty area before the universe. The crack reveals the true vacuum or evolving space-time continuum for the universe. Suddenly the crack becomes bigger into a bubble and expands as actual matter and energy on the inside of the bubble. The outside of the bubble is still covered in decaying tachyons as this immensely hot and energetic bubble of expanding matter and energy is theorized to be the Big Bang as we know it. Cosmic Inflation and the universe began then as a closed system. So even though matter and energy are never created or destroyed, they came from the following: an open system, tachyons, emptiness, false vacuums and bubbles of space-time continuum/matter/energy in true vacuums. These conditions are ultimately a theoretic explanation for the birth of our universe. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a very simple answer to this question but you will probably not like it very much and you will feel that it doesn't actually answers anything. Fact 1: The law of conservation of energy i.e. that energy cannot be created or destroyed is closely tied to symmetry of time, i.e. things are roughly the same today as it was yesterday in the sense that any experiment you did yesterday will yield roughly the same result today. If there is probabilistic or chance involved, both results will be within the same a priori probability of the experiment and if there is no probability or chance involved, it will always yield exactly the same result regardless of when you do it. Under these conditions AND ONLY under these conditions do the law of conservation of energy hold. What this means is that if you posit a time that is unlike any other time in that it is the beginning of time, then there is no symmetry of time near that time. Consequently, there is no reason to assume that the law of conservation of energy apply to that time. Compare the situation to the law of conservation of momentum if you are nearby a wall that prevent objects from passing it. The law of momentum will not hold. A ball hitting that wall will change its momentum and suddenly fly in the opposite direction. The conservation of momentum is not valid in that situation - well you can argue that the momentum is still preserved when you consider the minute fluctuation of the atoms of the wall which heats up a tiny bit from the impact and in the same way you can argue that the law of conservation of energy may hold up through a big bang if you could somehow follow each individual piece through the big bang - but that's exactly the point - the big bang is a singularity, you cannot follow each individual particle through the big bang. We know nothing about the state of the particle even at 10^-37 seconds after big bang, it is too short time after the big bang for us to know anything about it, much less anything before - whatever that is supposed to mean - the time of big bang. So, no we cannot assume that the law of conservation of energy is valid at the time of big bang. That would just be silly. So the answer to your question is: There is no rule that say that energy cannot be created or destroyed at that time in history. The law of conservation of energy only applies to situations where you have symmetry of time and that also means that it must be a closed system but closed system is not enough - it is the symmetry of time that is the necessary and sufficient condition for the law of conservation of energy to apply. A closed system does not have symmetry of time because if you add energy to the system doing the experiment at an earlier time when the energy was lower may yield a different result than if you do it at a later time when energy is higher. Reverse if you remove energy from the system instead of adding to it. ",

What is true regarding energy here is true everywhere. There is sufficient data from the countless observations of deep space and all the events taking place in it to come to this conclusion with cheery confidence. Regarding \u201cwhere it comes from\u201d, that\u2019s the whole point of the 1st law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, that it cannot be created. It didn\u2019t \u201ccome from\u201d anything other than itself, and it is timeless, ageless and causeless. Having said that, the 1st law has a corollary, which is, that energy can change in form. They could have added, all forms are temporary; eventually all forms of energy transform, or, energy eventually must transform from one form to another. That leaves the field wide open for theories and conjectures on what other forms energy can become that perhaps we don\u2019t know everything about, or forms we do not know anything about because they have yet to be observed.

Amusing!!!]  If, \"energy cannot be created\" is the premise that is if you accept or assume or consider or believe it (the statement) is true, then \"who created it?\" indicates that you are doubting the premise itself. So you are asking: Who can create what cannot be created at all? Let, \"X is the creator of energy in one or other form\" is a statement and our premise. Is X animate or inanimate? Who created it or him or her or them? What thing did it/he/she/they use to create the initial energy? What quantity of energy did IT create? Is IT exsting still now? If not then exactly at which point of time did IT come into being? Did IT come into being on its own or was IT created? If created, who or what created IT? Hmmm. I know the answers to all these questions!!! Believe me. First, make an agreement that you would believe whatever I would say, without any furher question. No argument. Complete faith upon me. Why should you believe me? Simply because X has revealed ITSELF to me and only me for the first time and for the last time ;-)  ",

            "answer_text": "Logic. Let's see the following model of the universe: there is nothing. period. No one had to create nothing, because it is nothing. Nothing doesn't exist. If we'd have to put number to nothing, it would be zero, if we'd have to \"paint\" it, it would be a point, a dot, dimensionless, infinitely small - zero. Now let's \"see\" nothing and zero.  Look around you and tell me how many albino unicorns are in the room with you?  Count them. Your answer would be \"zero\", but to answer that question you'd need consciousness and imagination.  Without consciousness you couldn't witness that there are no albino unicorns, and with out imagination you couldn't even know what to look for in your room. I've just created \"trinity\" - nothing, consciousness and imagination.  \"Nothing\" is something, \"Nothing\" is a word, vibration, information, thought.  Now we have a dot, \"singularity\", zero, total sum of energy.  Is there only one dot in the picture?  For that, we'll have to use the language of universe - math.  How many zeros are there in a single zero?  x*0 = 0  What is x? X can be any number you can imagine, equation will be valid.  So, there are many dots in a single dot. But only way for this to be true is to create some distinction between all those dots (points). We need a pattern.     And there we have countless dots all alike, like image in two opposite mirrors.    And there you have it, every dot is infinitely small and infinitely large at the same time.  You've just got duality - nothing is something after all. Nothing is everything and everything is nothing.  We are in mirror right now, you think author is talking to you, but in reality, you are talking to yourself.  I am just a voice in your head making these dots on screen alive.  I am a thought.  Everything is a thought, consciousness, imagination, nothingness, illusion.  You might think it started from a Big Bang, but only if we're talking about your parents :)  Allah is Great. Allah is infinite in both ways. Above and below.  Allah is zero. The All. The One.  Singularity. Call it whatever you want. ",

Yes energy can be created\u2026.in the case of nuclear fission reaction\u2026..where one atom is broken down into two parts\u2026and a little amount of mass is converted into energy\u2026.!!! this do not only revoke the the law of conservation of energy\u2026.. but also the discard the law of conservation of mass\u2026\u2026.more over\u2026.energy can be destroyed..in case of black hole matter\u2026.!!! once a source of energy like light\u2026.radiations\u2026electromagnetic rays\u2026.etc passes through it\u2026it perfectly gets destroyed\u2026..ie. it can never be reused by anyone\u2026..!!!!and hence we can say that\u2026..in big bang theory of Creation of universe\u2026., there are possiblity of involvement of nuclear fission or fusion reaction\u2026.!!!!EDIT: For those\u2026.who thinks that in nuclear fission reaction\u2026..energy is stored inside the nucleus\u2026\u2026pls recheck your facts\u2026..and ans me \u2026..which kind of energy and in which form is it stored in\u2026.??? in chemical bonds\u2026??? in mechanical bonds\u2026??? in terms of electrical energy\u2026?? in terms of heat \u2026?? or what\u2026??? no my friend\u2026no energy is stored inside the nucleus\u2026.!!! nucleus have neutrons and protons\u2026..and they dont even attract each other by means of charge\u2026..!!! they are tightly packed with the help of quarks\u2026!!! a kind of sub atomic particles\u2026..and these quarks\u2026..helps to build atoms\u2026.and other sub-atomic particles\u2026.!!! and this quars gets converted into energy\u2026.!!!! moreover recheck your fact by calculating mass in RHS and LHS side of a fission reaction , by keeping account of all other by products\u2026..you will definitely find slight difference in masses on both side\u2026!!!even Einstein's famous formula \u201cEnergy=Mass \u00d7 C\u00b2\u201d gives clear relation between mass and energy\u2026.where we can corelate the change of mass into energy and vice-versa\u2026.!!!Now in black hole matter\u2026.!!! once a particle say light enters it\u2026.!!! it cannot escape\u2026.!! then what would happen with photons\u2026?? where would their energy would go..?? can you recollect it\u2026.?? can you tranform it into an other form\u2026like heat or photoelectric emmisions\u2026??? no\u2026since no electron would bear to move inside a black hole and transfer electricity\u2026due to gravity\u2026!! no free charge and atomic vibration would bear to take place inside black hole to transfer heat\u2026.due to gravity\u2026.!! so ultimately energy has to get destroyed\u2026.!!! and that destroyed energy is the fuel or say food for black hole\u2026..since either it would convert into mass and increase the gravity of black hole\u2026.or it would stray for a while till black hole sucks sufficient extra energy to convert it into mass by the formula or E=MC\u00b2\u2026.!!!And please dont say that conversion on energy into mass is not possible\u2026.!!! in fusion reaction we provide energy to fuse two masses into one\u2026.!!! and evem in this reaction\u2026. account of masses on both the side remains unbalanced even after considering the byproducts\u2026!!!

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang theory explains how the universe started from something very small hot and dense, and the expanded and cooled to make the elements, and the stars galaxies. Prior to this time the universe was so dense that to understand it, we need a physics that combines gravity with the forces of quantum physics, we do not have that science yet. It's possible energy is eternal, or maybe energy can be created in the meta universe, ubaverse, and the energy can not be created in our small universe. So if you want you can put God there, though that strategy hasn't worked in the past, God has moved from the mountains to the sky to the universe etc. A better strategy for believing in God is to say he/she is responsible for it all but I don't know how. Personally I don't anybody is in a position to say anything about Gods existence. I also think we are never going to have a satisfactory answer to why there is something instead of nothing, since you can not explain the existence of something without starting from something else, conceptually if not time wise, its just a bottomless well of more abstract understanding about how the universe works.

            "answer_text": "Brilliant Question to whoever asked. This simple universal law of energy oddly defies to the theories held by all atheists, scientists(atheist ones only!) etc. Engineering and Physics(or Science in short) knows the cause and effect theory i.e., for every effect happening in the universe, there should be a cause for it. lets consider the cause as the reference point. No theory in science will ever exist without a reference point. This reference point must exist for creation of energy also, and in this case the \"cause\". There is someone/something that put the cause to action(taking newton's first law into account). The source of this energy is someone/something that really must be powerful enough to create so much energy. No non living entity can produce energy, hence Someone very Special who has the innate capability to create energy must be present and that Someone must be the one and only source of all energy in the universe. Its God and only one who can have the capacity for this to happen. Hope this helps to answer your query. Please note that science is present to teach the presence of God and not deny it. If you disagree with this proof even after explaining logically with existing science theories, then it is your gross ignorance and over exaggerated ego you uphold in yourself ( pun intended!) ",

            "answer_text": "We haven't developed a theory that explains the origin of energy yet.  However, current theory and measurements are converging on a strange idea about energy that may simplify the origin greatly without completely explaining it. When cosmologists use the General Theory of Relativity with quantum mechanics to describe possible evolutions of the observable universe, they find that if the total energy (this takes into account that mass is equivalent to energy) of the universe is a little greater than zero, the universe would have collapsed shortly after forming.  OTOH, if the total energy is a little less than zero (gravitational energy is inherently negative), no structures would likely have formed.  The evolution of the universe works most simply if the total energy is and always was zero.  This is sometimes referred to as the ultimate free lunch. Estimates of mass in the universe at first indicated that there wasn't nearly enough mass to make the total energy zero.  Then dark matter was discovered, but things still didn't quite work.  With the discovery of dark energy, even without knowing what it is, the total estimated energy in the observable universe came out very close to zero.  Theory and measurement seem to agree on this crazy result. See: What's the Total Energy In the Universe? ",

That\u2019s impossible right? Even if you see an infinitely small point in your head right now, it has to be surrounded with anything that has a depth of any kind. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell which is the point and which is not and since it\u2019s infinitely small you wouldn\u2019t be able to even tell where to look for it. There would be only nowhere, \u201cwhere\u201d you could find it. I am not a physicist by profession and I don\u2019t have any degree, other than the half of my life spent studying everything about it but I personally don\u2019t believe the Big Bang was the beginning.

            "answer_text": "I also don't know the answer (like everyone else) but I have a theory not for the energy topic but for the matter concept: People are very often like \"Oh look, so much matter. Could have a big bang created so much matter in  so many varieties? Nope, it must have been someone like god\". so first off (to get rid of the notorious \"who? who? who?\" people): following your logic , everything had to be created from someone or something. But who created god? Or are you telling me that he came into existence without anyone else? but if that is true, why should not matter be able to come into existence the same way?  So, back to the interesting topic: lets say, in the beginning there was vacuum (and I mean real vacum with nothing in it, not the actual definitions that still allows few matter in it). I see vacuum as something like zero. Like in math, it is neither positive nor negative. And as he have learned somewhere, matter (which is positive) and antimatter which is negative) cancel each other out. (they sum up to zero, just like (-1)+(+1)=0. But if +matter and -matter can \"fuse\" to create void, to create a zero like space, why shouldn't the inversed process be possible? Say we have a 1 m^2 of complete void (absolutely nothing in it) . why shouldn't it be possible to create 0,5 m^2 of positive and 0,5 m^2 of negative matter in there (although create in this case just means come into existence) . nothing would change since the sum (considering this 1 m^2 cube) is still+-0 . Now if we consider that there can be different levels of positivity and negativity (+1,+2,+3,...,-1,-2,etc.), then a big variety of particles could be possible. Just have to make sure that they don't meet each other's counterpart and return to void. And if we consider that there are more \"dualities\" than the one, I just picked as an example , then wh shouldn't there be an insame amounts of different things possible? We probably just don't realize these dual partners since they are not arranged symmetrically like in the example, but are spread all over the universe. And not to mention that they are interact with each other (which is the reason why physics, chemistry and biology exists).    Thats just a little theory I have on HOW stuff came into existence. For the WHY (why did the void \"decide\" to change into dual partners instead of staing void), I don't have a theory right now.  But I guess my thinking is all nonsense anyways, so you don't have to believe it. But it is a way for me to ease my mind from the ever occuring questions \"Who created this? who created that? \". ",

            "answer_text": "This is indeed a good question. Everything in the Universe follows the first law of thermodynamics, which states that in a closed system the total energy is constant, it can neither be created nor be destroyed. But at the time of creation of every other things this universe is made up of, it started from the nothingness, the very famous BIG BANG THEORY. In the Big Bang Theory, its known that at the time of creation of everything, it didn't follow the general laws of physics. Hence I can say that, energy was also created. But, it turns out that in Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, regions of space with positive energy actually push space outward. As space expands, it releases stored up gravitational potential energy, which converts into the intrinsic energy that fills the newly created volume. So even the expansion of the universe is controlled by the law of energy conservation. Again, see how humans can give birth to humans. Considering human beings to be distinct set of energies, the exponential increase of population clearly indicates how energy has magnified. With an analogy to that I suppose the universe is a complex system of such entities whose rapid expansion as well as time dilation in the beginning has significantly contributed to the non-constancy of energy in those days.

It was the primordial singularity in space-time from where our\u2019s Universe started out. Universe expand from this infinitely dense, curved and high temperature state, being a singularity general laws of physics can not be a adequate description at that point. So now we have some models that can closely explain some physics at that Planck scale. From general theory of relativity any form of energy causes curvature in space-time. Hence by studying curvature invariancs in space time we can estimate the total (all form of) energy present in Universe. As Universe expand from this singularity it\u2019s energy density started dilute and as later temperature falls down matter formation took place through baryogenesis process. And this is the matter that we see all our around today. As the universe expand the form of energy that is stored in the curvature of space-time started transform into other form of energy like radiation (relativistic particles, Photons, neutrinos), matter particle etc. However it has been observed now that Universe is expanding and rate of expansion is also accelerating. Cosmological constant or dark energy is the main cause for this accelerating expansion. Main peculiarity of this dark energy is that it do not get diluted as universe expand unlike radiation or matter whose densities fall as $a^{-4} $ and $a^{-3}$. Source of this dark energy is mysterious till now. ",

This can proved for all other physical quantities, phenomenon and equation. Also, space-time-mass-energy are made of made different concentration of atoms of reality. Conversion of mass-energy to space-time is fueling the expansion of our local universe. In our present universe, what we call as energy is a type of space-time-mass interaction. Also, according to my theory, before big bang of mass, there was big bang of space (atoms of reality emerged to form space-time). During big bang of space-time, reaction of expansion created singularity of mass (i.e reaction of expansion condensed atoms of reality to form singularity of mass). This singularity of mass started reacting /interacting with the space surrounding it. This singularity of space had high degrees of uncertainty and randomness. During this, linear kinetic tendency transmitted to singularity of mass was converted /split into components of inherent potential energy. This destabilized singularity of mass, this led to the Big Bang of mass. So mass started reacting with space surrounding it, this created space-time-mass entity which we call as energy in present local universe.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, energy can be found in many things and takes many forms. There is potential energy in objects at rest that will make them move if resistance is removed. There is kinetic energy in objects that are moving. The molecules making up all matter contains a huge amount of energy, as Einstein's:- E = mc^2 pointed out to us. Energy can also travel in the form of electromagnetic waves, such as heat, light, radio, and gamma rays. Your body is using metabolic energy from our last meal as you read this. Energy is constantly flowing and changing form. If you take your metabolic energy and rub your hands together, you have made metabolic energy into mechanical energy. Your hands will heat up. That is some of the mechanical energy turning into heat energy. So energy can change form, but where did that energy ultimately come from? Let say that a bicycle is rolling down the hill, transferring potential energy into kinetic energy. The bicycle got its potential energy by the rider using metabolic energy to move the pedals. The pedals used mechanical energy to move the chain, which moved the wheels. The rider's metabolic energy came from chemical energy that was stored in the molecules of the food she ate. That chemical energy entered the animal whose meat she ate by the animal digesting a plant and breaking the bonds in its molecules. The plant made the molecules by using light energy from the Sun. The Sun's light energy came from electrons in its atoms lowering energy states, and releasing energy. The energy in the atoms came from the nuclear reactions in the heart of the Sun. And scientists say that the nuclear reaction is started from Big Bang. So the short answer is that the energy we encounter and use everyday has always been with us since the beginning of the universe and always will be with us. It just changes form all around us. That is called the law of conservation of energy. ",

It was after nuclear physics told us that mass and energy are essentially equivalent, this is what Einstein meant when he wrote E=mc^2 - that we realized the 1st law of thermodynamics also applied to mass. Mass became another form of energy that had to be included in a thorough thermodynamic treatment of a system. The first thing we have to do is determine what a \"closed system\" is, when we look at a physical situation and draw an imaginary circle around it, we're defining a system. A refrigerator, for example, can be a thermodynamical system. But once we've specified that the system is closed, it means that everything inside the system at that moment, the total amount of energy, be it potential energy (mass can be thought of as a kind of potential energy) or kinetic energy or both must stay at that same constant level. If the amount goes up or down, either the system isn't closed, or we've neglected to account for energy (for instance, heat) coming into the system or leaving the system. If we draw our imaginary circle around the universe, we can call the universe a closed system, but it means the total amount of energy in the universe has to remain the same from its beginning until now.

All internal energy of that particular entity is responsible for collective energy of the universe.. But before explosion there were no time..so it complicates the concept of internal energy.. According to some scientists energy and hence universe had been created from nothing or Zero For example 0 = -x +x Where x is matter or energy(all kind of energy come from this energy) and -x is anti matter or dark energy which created space. In future if they meet they will annihilate each other leading to nothing again. Its like a chess game for matter Vs antimatter or energy Vs dark energy(space) Matter and energy were thought to be two distinct entity until Albert Einstein told the world that both are interconvertible or same.Remember E = mc^2 If whole universe is considered as a system its energy remains constant and is equal to +x ",

            "answer_text": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be converted from one form to another. According to the Big bang theory, all the energy of the universe was concentrated at a particular point of infinite density. This is known as a singularity. It is not known as to what energy was there before, but at this point, the laws of physics broke down. It was of so much energy, that it expanded. Most scientists believe that we live in an inflationary universe, and so, the energy from the Big bang is still reaching us. What we see around us are different forms of such energy. Now, two interesting things come to note here: Einstein's equation, E = mc\u00b2, means that mass and energy are interchangeable close to the speed of light. The same concept is used in our nuclear bombs as well. During the early stages, much of energy was also converted into mass, as our universe bonded from quantum fluctuations.Should there not have been an equal number of matter and anti-matter (it's opposite) at the time of the big bang? If so, why did they not cancel each other out And simply leave energy? I hope this answers your question, and poses further as well.",

Actually, this means that the mass that is converted into the sunlight, for example, must therefore also be a form of energy. So, to be accurate, we must say that mass and energy are each conserved only if we take into account that mass has an energy equivalent or that energy has a mass equivalent. Conservation of energy - Wikipedia conservation of energy (total, including material or rest energy), and conservation of mass (total, not just rest), each still holds as an (equivalent) law. In the 18th century, these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws. In other words, the sunlight comes from some mass of hydrogen that is converted to electromagnetic energy in the fusion process. The hydrogen consumed is also converted into very hot helium which has both a rest mass and a mass equivalent to the thermal motion of the helium atoms. ",

The answer is Big Bang. In the beginning of time i.e, during big bang a huge amount of energy got converted into matter and that is the matter we are having now. But, no one knows why? Why did energy got converted into matter at beginning? What stimulated it to happen? What was there before the big bang? We make theories but there is no theory that could tell us why big bang happened, because even big bang is a theory that can never be proven. we make theories that could convince us about the mysteries of the universe, but all those theories cannot be proven.

And only those things can be conserved which are already present in this universe. So what the statement actually means is that the amount of energy which was present at the time of creation is still the same , neither we can add more nor we can take it. This is simply why you don't hear explosion in the middle of night in your room without anything to cause it. Because energy has to come from somewhere , it cannot create itself randomly. Same goes for the conservation of mass and charge too. Think that you are sitting in your bed reading this answer and and suddenly a penguin pops into existence beside you! Sounds silly but it can happen. But for this insane thing to happen the penguin has got to be disappeared from somewhere, because mass cannot create itself. So basically everything is limited. Everything we use is kind of borrowed from somewhere or something or someone. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no need for someone to have created energy, since one can make a plausible argument that the energy of the universe is zero. This issue is still debated among physicists, and I would say there is no consensus, but the argument in favor of zero is that in a semi-classical calculation, the mass energy mc2 is exactly cancelled by the negative gravitational binding energy of the mass to the universe. We see apparent energy because the binding energy is constant, but the form of the positive component can change (rest mass, kinetic energy, local potential energy, etc.). This has a nice philosophical touch, because it implies that the creation of the universe took no energy. But, I emphasize, this is based on a semi-classical argument. There are theorists who make arguments (that may be right) that the total energy of the universe cannot be defined in any meaningful way. I think that is currently correct, but I suspect that some future physicist will work a way around the objections, and so we will conclude that the total energy of the universe is indeed zero. But that\u2019s speculation. ",

            "answer_text": "We can raise precisely the same objection against the materialists and ask them, \"If we follow the chain of causality back, we will ultimately reach the primary cause. Let us say that cause is not God, but matter/energy. Tell us who created primary matter/energy. You who believe in the law of causality, answer us: if matter/energy is the ultimate cause of all things, what is the cause of matter/energy? You say that the source of all phenomena is matter-energy; what is the cause and origin of matter-energy?\" Since the chain of causality cannot recede into infinity, they can answer only that matter is an eternal and timeless entity for which no beginning can be posited: matter is non-created, has no beginning or end, and its being arises from within its own nature. This means that the materialists accept the principle of eternity and non-origination; they believe that all things arose out of eternal matter and that being arises from within the very nature of matter, without any need for a creator. Russell openly states this belief in the lecture quoted above. He says: \"There is no proof that the world ever had a beginning. The idea that things must once have had a beginning results from the poverty of our imagination.\"4 In just the same way that Russell regards matter as eternal, believers in God attribute eternity to God. Belief in an eternal being is then common to materialist and religious philosophers: both groups agree that there is a primary cause, but believers in God regard the primary cause as wise, all-knowing, and possessing the power of decision and will, whereas in the view of the materialists, the primary cause has neither consciousness, intelligence, perception, nor the power of decision. Thus, the removal of God in no way solves the problem posed by eternal being. Moreover, matter is the locus for motion and change, and its motion is dynamic and situated within its own essence. Now, essential motion is incompatible with eternity, and matter and essential stability are two mutually exclusive categories that cannot be fused in a single locus. Whatever is stable and immutable in its essence cannot accept movement and change within that essence. How do Marxists, who believe that matter is accompanied by its antithesis, justify the eternity of matter/energy? Eternity means stability and immutability of essence, the impossibility of cessation, but matter is in its essence a compendium of forces and potentialities; it is relativity itself, totally caught up in living and dying. Eternity is incompatible with the mode of being possessed by matter and the factors and attributes necessitated by its nature. The belief of those who have faith in God concerning a fixed and absolute principle relates to a being who in and of his nature can accept stability and absoluteness; his nature is completely devoid of and remote from the properties of matter. The very nature of matter refuses permanence, eternity and continuity, for it can never separate itself from movement, relativity, and it stands in opposition to being a prime or absolute agent. It will be useful here to relate the discussion of Imam as-Sadiq, upon whom be peace, with one of the materialists of his age. The materialist: \"Out of what were beings created?\" The Imam: \"They were created out of nothing (i.e., they were originally non-beings).\" The materialist: \"How do they grow and emerge from nonbeing?\" The Imam: \"Did I not say that all things in the world were created out of nothing? My purport is this, that all beings were originally non-beings; they were non-existent, and then they became existent. You wish to say that the world is eternal, but this notion is incorrect for the following reasons: \"First, if the material world is eternal, it follows that an eternal being should be subject to change and cessation, which is impossible. \"Second, if the elements comprising the world are eternal by virtue of their essence, how is it possible that they should enter the embrace of death and disappearance? And if, conversely, they lack life in their essences, how can life surge forth from them? \"If you say that living beings emerge from living elements and inanimate beings from inanimate elements, we reply that an essence that lacks life in and of itself cannot be eternal and cannot be the source for life.\" The materialist: \"If matter/energy is as you say, why are beings said to be eternal?\" The Imam: \"Belief in the eternity of the universe is held by those who deny the existence of a ruler and planner of creation, reject the messengers of God, regard the books they bring as the fables of the ancients, and concoct beliefs pleasing to themselves.\"5 URL Lesson 6: The Need of the World for One Without Need ",

            "answer_text": "The law of conservation of energy comes from the symmetry of time, according to N\u00f6ther\u2019s theorem. It arises because if you do something today, and do exactly the same tomorrow, you expect exactly the same outcome. The problem then is, if you assume the Universe came out of nothing, there was no time symmetry then. Before the Big Bang, there was not even time (according to one theory). Of course it all might have been there anyway, if you follow the \u201cBig Bounce\u201d theory. My view is that since we don\u2019t know what happened, we can\u2019t answer this question, but if a point was created, leaving aside near infinite negative gravitational energy to counter the positive energy of the bang, we cannot answer because time was not symmetric about the point, and hence the conservation law does not apply.

For that matter, you are welcome to stipulate that God created the universe 5324 years ago on April 1; as long as you agree that She created it with the photons en route from an apparent Big Bang, with dark matter, dark energy, the signatures of Inflation & stellar nucleosynthesis and a fossil record mapping out a billion years of apparent evolution on Earth, there is no conflict with science.

The matter and radiation energy cancelled by the negative potential of the gravitational force. It's beautiful notion if you think about it. Universe emerging from nothingness and may return to nothingness in a Big Crunch. But that was before they discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe and found out that universe will expand eternally. The total evergy of the universe is thus not only constant but ever increasing - Dark energy remaining constant per unit volume. So as long as we rely on current model of the universe, then energy (dark energy) is constantly being created. Matter/radiation energy may remain constant and its source elusive. Or maybe it's counteracted by the negative gravitational potential - thus the total \"normal energy\" may be zero. Leaving only the dark energy to be explained.Perhaps they might discover some other mechanism to explain the observations that led people to interpret these as accelerated expansion thus requiring the notion of inexplicable dark energy. One recent paper described the observations of accelerated expansion as only apparent and due to the preferred direction of time dilation instead of relative. We can safely assume the real answer is still eluding us al. ",

So the total energy of universe is zero, so what does that mean. That means a much because only a universe with total energy zero can exist and could have began from nothing (zero enrgy in classical Mechanics). So the energy you are talking about is created by Quantum fluctuations that Occurs in empty space. \u201cA cube of empty space has enough energy to boil up all the Oceans of our world.\u201d ~ said by Richard feynman. Now you may ask that why it do not happens all the time or now - Big bang to create another universe. Well that maybe because of So many energy now are acting and present in the empty space for big bang to happen. But Our universe maybe created at that time when nothing was around to effect empty space and may the random chance occured. There maybe other universes also created due to big Bangs but that universe when created is so so far away from other universes so that the empty space have less effect. But that is not Confirm, its maybe. ",

If one was there from the beginning, where did the ones beginning come from \u2026 Like many who enjoy science, we push for the answers. In this case there are many theories, from what I see they seem to use almost a circular reasoning. It may be beyond the realm of sciences; and belong in the hands of the philosopher's. It exists; unless it doesn\u2019t? If the Universe always was, or came from nothing, or that One was a creator. I have not seen enough evidence yet.

In the beginning of the Universe, a body containing all mass, energy, and spacetime in the Universe would be compressed to an infinitely dense point. According to big bang cosmology about 14 billion years ago, our universe and all the energy and matter distribution inside the universe start expanding in all directions from an infinitesimal small dense point known as the initial or spacetime singularity. The Big Bang theory explains the Planck era or the earliest stage of the universe, but it doesn't much explains about the spacetime singularity.  Our universe starts inflates from a spacetime singularity, but that was not the only gravitational singularity exist in our spacetime. At every center of a black hole a gravitational or spacetime singularity exists and at every center of a galaxy a super massive black hole exists. The gravitational field of a black hole is so strong that nothing can escape from a black hole even light also changes its path under the influence of gravitational pull of black holes and lost itself if comes under event horizon of a black hole.  The complete explanation of spacetime singularity can unlock the mystery of existence of energy and matter in our universe and up to now the only way it can be done is the study of the central singularity of a black hole.

It was foundational to classical physics from about 1650 to about 1900. It was disproved in Einstein\u2019s famous 1905 Special Theory of Relativity, which proposed that energy can be created from matter. The law was updated to require conservation of energy plus matter in a closed system. More recently, scientists have managed to extract matter-antimatter particle pairs from a vacuum, which appears to upset the apple-cart once again. Theoretical breakthrough: Generating matter and antimatter from nothing. But the most fundamental underlying problem in this question has nothing to do with matter, energy or physics. It is simply, Why is there anything at all, instead of nothing? ",

Maybe by including a little bit of philosophy we could try to answer the creation of energy. Let us suppose \"somebody\" was there in the beginning who created this mysterious energy and then the Big Bang followed. But if we think on it for a second that if  \"somebody\" existed before the creation of energy then what is that somebody made up of. Because we all know that every thing that ever existed or will exist in this universe owe it's existence to All Mighty \"Energy\". Now we have arrived at a point where we are experiencing a Paradox. This is a highly paradoxical question which cannot be answered so easily. But however if we consider that somehow this energy was here from the start, there is an interesting theory of ekpyrotic universe. This theory says that the universe was born not just once, but multiple times in endless cycles of death and rebirth. Enormous sheet-like \"branes\" representing different parts of our universe, collide about once every trillion years, triggering Big Bang-like explosions that re-inject matter and energy into the universe. The brains behind this theory are  Steinhardt and Neil Turok. At Cambridge university this duo provided an alternative to Big Bang theory claiming that their theory will explain not only inflation but mysteries of dark energy and dark matter as well. If this theory is true then we can proudly say that universe is ageless and self-renewing. If that is true then there is a quantum probability that I would be writing this same answer trillions of years from now in a brand new self-renewed universe or maybe I am already writing it now. ",

Science cannot explain where energy came from, but that's not a criticism of science, science was not designed to explain everything in the universe, only the things that are useful here and now. Knowing where energy comes from is ultimately not really that useful anyway, so long as energy does exist we can plug things into it and charge our phones, etc. Also even if science could explain where energy comes from it still wouldn't explain what love is.

As Steven says, the energy that \u201cinflated\u201d from the Singularity in the poorly-named \u201cBig Bang\u201d (which did not bang, neither was it big\u2026) accounts for the existence of our universe. All matter currently in the universe is condensed from that original energy and further modified by nuclear fusion in stars and such. But there is no more or less of it in total than there was microseconds after the original inflation. Now, you might well ask where the primordial ultra-hot, ultra-dense point of energy came from, and for that we have a simple answer\u2026 We dont\u2019 know. Our physics break down at that point, though they become relevant again at just microseconds after. There are no lack of hypotheses as to how this situation, the Singularity, came to be. But none are testable at this point. ",

And at some point, an explosion takes place which restarts the entire cycle. It appears we are talking trillion year cycles or more. Science is already discussing a notion that we live in multiple universes, which introduces another gorgeous wrinkle. There is no doubt multiple universes exist, but the whole thing gets convoluted whether we are actually living or we are in some sort of massive dream, or that another universe is the negative or mirror of ours. In that case, all laws of physics go out the window and we need to grapple with ontology using a different set of tools. I suggest you pose this question to my brother Gary Ansorge who has a slightly different take on the whole thing. ",

Mass is the only substance of matter without regards of its existence states. Matter is the abstract term of mass with all its existence states. A mass move due to it is the fundamental natural tendency for matter to stay at the thermodynamically more stable state at that moment. And due to that movement, the thermodynamically more stable state changed for this matter, and matter keeps moving to chase that more stable state of that moment. Thus, matter movement never stop, and it has no beginning neither. Due to the movement of mass can only transform into different forms, so it cannot be created or destroyed. Therefore the total movement quantity (which is the total amount of energy) is constant in the universe. ",

But the processes by which planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe form and change over time are also types of \"evolution.\" In all of these cases there is change over time, although the processes involved are quite different. Hubble's hypothesis of an expanding universe leads to certain deductions. One is that the universe was more condensed at a previous time. From this deduction came the suggestion that all the currently observed matter and energy in the universe were initially condensed in a very small and infinitely hot mass. A huge explosion, known as the Big Bang, then sent matter and energy expanding in all directions. So if you ask again that where from that condensed energy came? Then i guess there are many speculations about pre - Big Bang form of universe. To my knowledge i don\u2019t think till now there is any kind of theory or explanation for the formation or origin of that condensed state of matter and energy before the Big Bang. ",

Everytime we come across a symmetry in the laws of physics there is a conserved quantity related to it (ie a property of the solution). Energy is the name of that conserved quantity.  Easier to grasp example is angular momentum (nicely demonstrated with gyroscopes), which is the consereved quantity of rotation symmetry. ",

But, the fuel itself comes out of energy. No Energy in this universe is man made. You will never achieve 101 percent efficiency from any perfect system. If you achieve, then you creating energy by your self which is quite not possible. Thats why conservation if energy principle still and ever valid.

However, whether energy is conserved overall in the universe is not a simple question. This because in general relativity energy is just part of an energy-momentum vector and there is no unique way to sum up vectors from different parts of the universe. If the universe were not expanding there would a unique way define the total energy. There are different ideas of how to sum up the energy of the universe in which the gravitational potential contributes a negative part and matter the positive part and most of them conclude the net energy is zero.

In the beginning God created everything visible and invisible from nothing but His word. In this creation God designed and ordered how the physical universe was to operate. If we show scientific evidence that a principle of physics never changes we call that a law. We must understand that our laws are from our finite viewpoint.

The vacuum of empty space is actually seething with quantum activity. Particles and antiparticles are constantly appearing from nothing and then recombining into nothing. This is a consequence of quantum mechanics, one of the most successful predictive theories of all time. It be measured in the lab as the Casimir effect. It is the basis of Steven Hawking's theory on black hole evaporation: black holes can separate the ephemeral particle pairs so that the matter escapes but the antimatter falls in and reduces the mass of the black hole. The probability that a particle will spontaneously appear falls off rapidly with particle size. The probability of a mass the size of the universe appearing is incredibly low (maybe biggest understatement of all time), but is nonzero. But maybe the probability is 1 and we just don't know why yet. We have yet to figure out what dark matter and energy are, and where the rest of the antimatter is so that the net mass of the universe is zero. ",

We could be a bubble universe off an even greater multiverse which has always been.Perhaps there had always been a universe and the big bang was simply a restart button.But these are all speculations (maybe not the zero energy one, but I can't remember where I learned that anymore and I don't want to leave it as \u201ctruth\u201d when I can't point you to a better source than \u201cI have a vague and fuzzy memory of this\u2026\u201d).

There is a fixed amount of equivalent amount of energy present in the form of energy or mass and energy keeps on changing its form, like electric energy into light, heat and sound energy as in case of lightning and so on. Tbe earth has got huge amount of energy embedded over it during its genesis only in some form which kept changing various forms and also it is receiving huge amount of energy from the sun every second in the form of light, heat and in the form of many other kind of waves ",

The electrostatic force, the long range attractive force, the short range repulsive force and gravity. As long as these forces exist matter will have some form of energy potential, kinetic etc. So this leads to a deeper question: How did matter come into existence? To understand this you need to study the origin of universe and the Big Bang. ",

Thats a lie!Einstein's papers of Relativity tells us that Matter is a condensed form of energy (E=mc^2) and we can tansform energy into matter and vice versa.There are many examples: During Nucleur reactions... mass of the reactants used become less and they are converted into energy. \u200bPartially according to Einstein's formula T'= T \u00d7 [{1 - (v^2/c^2)} ^ 0.5] ... one will gain mass the faster you move through space and slower you move through time. The mass is gained by condensing the energy around the particle.There are endless examples... I gave only two.Hope it helps :) ",

For instance, you and I cannot see X-rays, nor can we percieve the billion neutrinos blasting through every square inch of our skin each second; but it\u2019s happening. It would be very naive of scientists to assume that our ignorance today is not absolutely vast, just as those people in 1920 had no idea about neutrinos, there are untold phenomona beyond our grasp at present. There may be additional dimensions, entities and forms existing outside of our \u2018visible\u2019 world, both to our eyes and greatest instruments. Indeed this very possibility is what motivates the scientist to proceed, that the very terms he uses to understand the universe will someday be outdated is something he should accept at the outset.

Which may be why the ancient Hebrews made god's name unpronounceable so that we would not suffer the illusion our minds could encompass the referent. Stephen Hawking has a nice analogy related to the cause of the big bang, (source in your question). He says the big bang is like the North pole and asking what comes before is like asking what is farther north of the North pole. For myself this question in all its forms is a constant source of wonder and pleasure that I never tire of as I never tire of a sunrise or heron flying. Following contemporary physics as it comes closer, most recently with the work on the Higgs Boson,  is an analogous pleasure. Thus far, no answer has been final. ",

I believe we are created and everything around us is created( I stress the word believe). You may ask - how come? Who created the Creator? No-one and no-thing, the Creator I know(or believe to know) is eternal, unbound by time, which He also created. The thing is, with materialistic paradigm it is very hard to answer this question - is Universe eternal, is mass and energy eternal? We know the amount of mass/energy is constant, but has it had the beginning? If so, it's not eternal, therefore needs a cause. If it hadn't the beginning, what is time? Is it not the measurement of change? And we know that mass/energy changes its state all the time. And so on we are going further and further into unending cause and effect chain. With intelligent, eternal Creator I believe in it's not the case. Also I strongly support the claim that intelligence needs intelligence to occur and life needs life to occur. To sum this up, I'm a creationist because, for me, it's illogical not to be(sorry if I offended anyone, it was not my intent). ",

It was about 10^61 J, no one knows from where the enery came from but it exists in our universe and cannot be destroyed only can be converted into mass or other form of energy. It is energy only that has guven rise to particles such as proton,neutrons and electrons and eventually atom. Hope this helps ",

You can see things like the bonding energy of a proton and an electron, if you get hold of some really accurate values for the weights of these and a hydrogen atom.  The hydrogen atom is lighter than the proton and electron by 13.6 volts, the ionisation energy of this.  So E=mc\u00b2 is also a chemical thing. ",

So the universe kind of folds onto itself to get all the infinite possible eigen states. So each universe is a random selection from all the universes that went before and occur in the future, to infinity both directions. In other words, you don't split universes, you select from the superset. That way everything that can occur does occur, and in a sense already has, so the whole deal is a monster superposition of all universes. ",
