            "answer_text": "I would say yes. For one thing, becoming a true Christian is a transformational experience, and has nothing to do with adherence to dogma. It also involves awareness of the presence of the Holy Spirit, which is actively the Spirit of Truth, and which can be felt. This sounds unbelievable to persons who have not experienced it. When i sensed it for the first time it was like hearing a bell from a distance, and it was familiar and true. I was kind of taken aback. The second time my daughter and i were speaking in the kitchen and we both remember it. She was a teen and i was explaining that, oddly enough, her analytical, science minded mother had discovered something that I sensed was true and pure. The words that i heard myself using were clear and concise. She understood completely. The experience was on another level. Since then there have been other situations that i recognized were metaphysical. They are quite personal and would take a long time to describe. The Word is very dynamic as i\u2019ve come to realize. It unfolds like a flower and with each reading has flashes of clarity and new meaning. Almost like reading it for the first time. This is unlike anything i have ever experienced. I think that the Bible is a book which cannot be truly finished when reading. It is an unending book. Interestingly many other Christians know this experience, and can relate to this, but generally do not discuss it because there is so much skepticism about this faith. More so than towards other faiths i believe. Christianity is not only misunderstood, it is often misrepresented. I found out about it through personally challenging myself, and not expecting to find anything. This is ironic because i have Christian ancestors dating back to the time of Jesus. Somehow we think we are all \u201csmarter\u201d than thousands of people who came before us, because we are \u201cmodern.\u201d That is actually quite an arrogant assumption. See my discussion on the fact that \u201cDogs can\u2019t read\u2026\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s like asking \u201cIs science \u2018part\u2019 of the Theory of Evolution?\u201d Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy, dealing with the question of what it means to exist. Why does anything exist at all? What does it mean to exist? Does God exist? \u2026 that sort of thing. It\u2019s not in itself a specific position. That is, people can disagree about metaphysics, just like they disagree about economics or history or whatever. Christianity is a religion. So it makes metaphysical claims, but also epistemological claims and ethical claims. Those two things - epistemology and ethics - are probably the two other main fields of philosophy (logic would probably be one more major field). For example, if you\u2019re a Christian, you probably have a metaphysics which says that God literally exists. You probably think that God created everything somehow ex nihlo and so all existence is ultimately based on the existence of God. You probably think that existence, or at least human existence, has a telos (ie you probably think that your purpose is to please God). Those are all metaphysical claims. Other people who are interested in metaphysics will have different metaphysical beliefs. ",
