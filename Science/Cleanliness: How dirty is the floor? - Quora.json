            "answer_text": "Regarding being barefoot: As long as you don\u2019t lick your feet or have open wounds, there is no way for germs to penetrate the tough skin of your feet. Your feet will be healthier bare than shod with shoes because bacteria love the dark and sweaty confines of the shoe. Do you want to know a cheap cure for athlete's foot? Walk around barefoot. The fungus can\u2019t survive in the air or light. Or, you can use drugs. Do you know those filthy floors in your house that you won\u2019t walk barefoot on? As a baby, you crawled around on them and stuck your fingers in your mouth. If that didn\u2019t kill you yet . . . . Do yourself a favor, take off your shoes, you\u2019re standing on holy ground. ",

Anyway, they tested this theory. The dropped the same food on the floor and picked it up at different times. The food that was on the floor the least had less bacteria than the others, but it still had bacteria. I believe it depends on how porous your food is. If it's a piece of cheese, I don't think you are going to want to eat that no matter how long it was on the floor! ",

            "answer_text": "This quick video runs through the 5 second rule theory and uses some research conducted by Clemson University to disprove it! It turns out that it only takes a few milliseconds for bacteria to reach food that is dropped on the floor and so eating food after being dropped for 5 seconds will be harmful to you. The amount and type of bacteria on the floor will vary depending on the material, location, and nature of the floor, however, there is no bacteria-free surface that would not infect food if placed/dropped onto it. Not all of this bacteria is harmful though! Have a look at the NHS website about the 5 second rule too - Does the five-second rule really work?   ",

As for the x-seconds rule and dropped food: Don't eat it.   As for walking barefoot:  If you're talking about inside your home home, and there aren't any horrible parasites endemic to where you live, and you actually clean your floors occasionally, and you haven't got any open sores or wounds on your feet, why not?  If you live in tropical Africa or South America or Asia, don't ever go barefoot. ",
