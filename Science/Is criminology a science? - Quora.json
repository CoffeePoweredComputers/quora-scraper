            "answer_text": "It might be more of a science than you would imagine. And it is a science that is evolving. Calling a particular field a Science is basically asking the question, is there any absolutes in this field? Are there predictions that can be made that have statistical significance regarding expected behavior and actual behavior? \u201cIf this, then, that.\u201d Math is often called a pure science. Because it has high statistical probability (100%) that given a certain mathematical problem if 100 people do that problem the same way, they will end up with the same result. If you have 4 eggs and I have 4 eggs and we are both asked to remove 3 eggs, we will both have 1 egg left. Have you ever wondered why Doctors are said to be in the Practice of Medicine, and not in the Science of Medicine? Well Medicine is a science. It is a science because it encompasses a body of knowledge where hypothesis have been tested and if certain methods are employed there can be the same expected outcome with a certain degree of certainty. If a person has localized tenderness on the lower right of the navel, is experiencing pain, a fever, nausea, vomiting, a doctor arrives at a diagnosis of appendicitis. This diagnosis is a hypothesis. I hypothesize that these symptoms indicate appendicitis. If I treat this condition with removal of the appendix I can expect that the person will make a full recovery. But that doesn\u2019t always happen because there are these nasty little things called \u201cvariables.\u201d The patient my throw a clot and die. That is not the normal and expected outcome. While Medicine is a science, it is not an exact science because of variables. That is why you always have to sign that waiver. \u201cToday we are going to remove a wart from your hand, it\u2019s a simple procedure, with few complications, but you might still die from unforeseen complications.\u201d Don\u2019t you love it. OK so, Criminology is a science because we can predict some things with a degree of certainty that is better than chance. We can look at career criminals and we can predict some things. They came from a broken home, they had no strong moral role models, they have low or no education. Is that always the case? No, but there are some things that are pretty accurate. What about someone who is a serial killer and sexually brutalizes women and then kills them in such a manner that indicates a great deal of rage. Overkill, stabs them 60 - 70 times. Generally indicates an individual with a strong hatred of some woman in their life. Many times an abusive mother. This is the kind of data and proclivity that profilers study to try to understand the psyche of those involved in these types of horrific crimes. People who commit serious crimes have a very high ability to rationalize their behavior. If I asked you while taking a trip and driving on the Interstate have you ever driven over the speed limit, or set your cruise control to a few miles over the speed limit, would you say yes? If you said yes, why did you break the law and go over the speed limit? Seriously, why would you do that? Was it because you were just trying to keep up with everyone else? Was everyone else speeding too? Were you just trying to maintain and average to make up for all the times you had to slow down when you came up on a slow truck? Maybe your car gets better gas mileage when you go a little faster. Bottom line, all of the above are just rationalizations. You rationalize your unlawful behavior. Now is that a terrible thing. No. Because your ability to rationalize bad behavior probably has a pretty low threshold. But your ability to rationalize driving a little too fast is just as normal to you as it is for a serial killer to kill someone, bury the body, and be able to go to bed and fall asleep. It\u2019s just that they have a very strong ability to rationalize their behavior, or a psychosis that drives them to do things beyond the wildest imagination of a healthy functioning human being. So, yes Criminology is a science. Albeit one that is fraught with inconsistencies because of high numbers of variables. Look at all the variables that can affect a person. Is the crime motivated by socioeconomic influences, psychological dysfunction, sociological considerations, jealousy, revenge? Criminology is actually the science of trying to figure out the influences that weighed on everyone who is under suspicion, and trying to piece together a giant puzzle. A puzzle that when the pieces come together will indicate who had the motivation, the opportunity, and the ability or means. Motivation has been at the heart of a lot of Criminologist\u2019s study. The motivation of a psychotic to commit a given crime may be so off the wall that a sane thinking investigator who is unable to think outside the box, may miss important clues. John Hinkley shot President Reagan. Well obviously he hated Reagan! Not necessarily. His real motivation was because he wanted to impress Jodie Foster. People are as different as sea shells. Anytime any field of study involves people, with all of their idiosyncrasies, the science involving that study is going to be extremely challenging. This is quite unlike the science of numbers. 4 items, is 4 items. Take 2 away and you have 2 left. No variables to speak of there. Chemistry. Two atoms of Hydrogen, and one of Oxygen combined under ordinary conditions and you have H2O, water. That is pure science. Sigmund Freud was known for attaching significance to items as being symbolic or a substitute for something else. A man might drive a big shiny expensive car because he is sexually insecure. Or maybe it is because he needs for people to be impressed, because in his heart he feels he is not very accomplished. etc. etc. And then we have the famous quote attributed to Freud, \u201cAnd sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\u201d So herein lies the difficulty in a field of study where you are trying to use scientific methods, but you have people involved with all of their variables. So just remember the greater the number of variables that you can not control in any field of study, the less of a pure science that area of study will ever become. ",

            "answer_text": "Criminology is a science. I , in my opinion can not see how it can not be called a science. It is the study of criminal behavior. What makes a career criminal commit the crimes he or she does.. It is making predictions based on the study of past criminals. If someone stabbed someone several times, criminologists say that the killer knew the person and was very angry. They have found out that most serial killers are white middle aged men However, there are variables and exceptions, but it is still a science.But it is evolving and getting more advanced each year.. When I shot and killed my brothers abuser in 1987, the investigators figured out how far away from the person I was, the exact angle , the bullet entered,etc. They were spot on in every detail. I was amazed and impressed. And this was in 1987! Just imagine now. ",
