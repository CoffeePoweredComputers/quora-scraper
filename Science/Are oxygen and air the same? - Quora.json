            "answer_text": "Formally, they are different things. \u201cAir\u201d has O2 (oxygen) as one of the components of the mixture that is \u201cair\u201d. However we breathe in 21% O2 in air, and breathe out about 16% O2 (and increase CO2). So in a confined space, \u201cair\u201d is all about the percent of oxygen, and whether not we can thrive in whatever percentage of oxygen is present. Most buildings are not hermetically sealed, some significant air exchange occurs, which carries in more O2 and carries out some CO2. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Air is a mixture consisting most of nitrogen, oxygen and a variable amount of water vapour, along with some carbon dioxide and a number of trace elements. Oxygen is a pure substance, referring either to the atom or the diatomic gas, the latter being a part of the air. Nevertheless, air is sometimes used to refer to oxygen. ",
