            "answer_text": "The boiling point is a physical parameter\u2026 when you heat up a liquid, the molecules start to move faster and faster because you give them energy\u2026 at some point the bonds between the molecules cannot hold back those molecules that are going so fast they need to \u2018break free\u2019. Now imagine gas molecules inside a balloon, being heated up and hitting the sides of a balloon faster and faster and with more energy\u2026 at some point the walls of the balloon will give because they cannot hold those molecules in any longer\u2026 but if you put outside pressure on the walls of the balloon to reinforce it\u2026 like you hold it in your hands completely on the outside\u2026 you increase the pressure on the outside wall from the other direction so it can now take more energy from the molecules inside, you help it contain the molecules inside\u2026. so the molecules inside can now move faster before breaking the walls of the balloon, so they can now be at a higher temperature without breaking the barrier\u2026 well it\u2019s a bit like that. As you increase atmospheric pressure, your liquid now has help from the outside in maintaining its shape and the bonds between its own molecules and it can withstand a higher temperature before breaking up and starting to need to change phase\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Any liquid boils at a pressure at which it's vapour pressure is equal to its solution pressure\u2026\u2026 At ground level, we can say the solution pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure which is in turn equal to vapour pressure of vapour over the solution\u2026\u2026.. But at high altitudes\u2026, as the atmospheric pressure decreases the vapour pressure doesn't remain equal to the reduced atmospheric pressure(which is also the solution pressure) due to increase in altitude\u2026\u2026\u2026 So, for increasing the reduced atmospheric pressure(which is also the solution pressure) to make it equal to the vapour pressure of the solution, we provide heat by increasing the temperature of liquid\u2026\u2026. Thus this results in increasing the boiling point of the liquid\u2026\u2026. As per my knowledge, your question must be successfully explained by laws of thermodynamics and not by any microscopic properties of the system\u2026\u2026 ",
