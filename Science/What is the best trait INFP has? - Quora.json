            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the best trait of an INFP is sensitivity. All of my life I have been called sensitive in a demeaning manner to the point I started to take the word as an insult. Truthfully, I believe it is one of the most beautiful qualities to have in a world that is rather unkind, and I am glad I am finally starting to accept it as one of my strengths instead of a weakness. Being sensitive to what happens around us, not only makes us more aware of the world we live in, but it also allows us to be kind towards and thoughtful of others. Another reason I chose this quality is because it simply entails so much: Deep feelers and thinkers:We have big hearts that feel so very deeply and posses minds that are complex beyond your wildest imagination. This can be a downfall as we are more prone to take things personally, but when we are happy, we are happy with all of our hearts. The tiniest of kind actions can make our days and we\u2019ll remember it always. We are touched very easily and love with the depths of our soul. When we are passionate about something, there is an impossible-to-extinguish fire in our souls that visibly burn in deep within our eyes. We also seek the deeper meaning behind everything. Whether it be a song, movie, book, flower, even the weather XD. Just about everything we see or hear we attach an emotion and deeper meaning to it. Not only that, but we also think a lot about different philosophical perspectives, what other people say, what we\u2019ve said etc.Highly empathetic + Thoughtful:Not only are we deep feelers when it comes to our own emotions, but we also feel other people\u2019s emotions as if they are our own. Saying that we are able to put ourselves in another person\u2019s shoes is an understatement, we embody their situation and feelings as if our souls are one and the same. Because we so whole-fully understand others and what resides within the depths of others hearts, we treat them with extreme sensitivity and wisely cater to any emotional/mental state they may be in and are very conscious of the things we say and do.Selfless + Considerate:Because we know how it feels to be in pain and have a naturally empathetic nature, we tend to put others before ourselves to make sure they feel minimal pain and discomfort. It is nearly impossible for us to just walk past someone in need or someone upset without stopping to help them no matter what situation we may be in. This duty gives us a sense of purpose, happiness, and fulfillment. Many INFPs are intrinsically altruistic and considerate.Welcoming and nonjudgmental:Due to our deep understanding and love for others, we are very accepting and nonjudgmental and always do our best to create an environment where the people around us feel free to do whatever or be whoever they want to be. In doing so, people feel comfortable telling us their problems and secrets because they know they can trust us and we will be there to lend an ear along with a big heart.Self and People Awareness:We are very in tune with who we are, what we feel, why we feel, our likes, our dislikes, and generally almost everything about ourselves. This helps us give direction to our life for we know of what we want. Similar to how we are self-ware, we also have a very keen sense of people awareness. There is little an INFP won\u2019t notice about a person they are observing, even when it is something slight like a change in body language or tone. They can easily pick up on how another is feeling and whether or not they are telling the truth and also have a solid understanding of humans and their innate nature.Creative:Living as an INFP is like having a magical window that allows you to see the world in a different, very special light. Because of how emotionally connected and mentally complex we are and our self-reflecting thinking nature, we find great love in metaphorical arts: paintings, sculptures, writings, poetry, etc. Not only do we enjoy it, but we are often very skilled at it ourselves. I know I have a deep love for all forms of art, and personally, although I am not very good at it, I know I have a passion for poetry, reading and writing it.Idealistic:We see the world as we believe it should be: everyone living harmonically and being considerate to one another and helping others out in any way we possibly can, whether it be providing comfort, a home to live in, money, food, an education etc.. We all have the same home and are all bounded together by our human-nature We have very strong moral values and would do whatever it takes, whether it be big or small, to make the world we live in a better place and to spread our morals and beliefs to others.So yes, I truly believe sensitivity to be the most precious trait an INFP posses. What I\u2019ve stated above is merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of what else encompasses the quality \u2018sensitivity\u2019. If any of you have been called sensitive in anything but a positive way, remember that you are an amazing, magical, and kind soul. Some people tend to take even the most beautiful of things and shed negative light on it. It takes a lot of strength to be a sensitive person in the cruel world we live in today. Stay strong and stay smiling! ",

            "answer_text": "Hope and support. They have this faith in other\u2019s abilities that encourages others to keep moving forward, this \u201cI believe in you, I trust you, I\u2019ll be here by your side when you reach your goal\u201d. They believe in yourself even when you don\u2019t. If people tell bad things about you, they won\u2019t listen because what matters to them is your attitude towards them and your true self, so they\u2019re not influenced by others in this regard, in fact, they don\u2019t care at all.Loyalty. It\u2019s difficult to approach an INFP in a deep level, they\u2019re quite selective when it comes to making real friends. But when they do, they will be endlessly loyal and commited. They may not stand up for themselves, but they will stand up for you doesn\u2019t matter what happens. They will assist you at 5 PM and at 5 AM if you have a problem. They will work on your relationship so it lasts. The more time you spend with them through the years, the more they will feel affection for you, just like the growth of a tree.Non-judgement. They will give you the benefit of the doubt, and as long as you don\u2019t violate their value system, they will accept you as you are, with all your weird traits. If something goes wrong, they will be willing to listen to your reasons so they can understand your point of view and integrate it along with other\u2019s, and objective facts.Active listening. INFPs can listen to someone for hours and good thing is, they don\u2019t even need to say anything because their posture already tells you that they\u2019re paying attention to you. They may even forget about their surrounding and the notion of time - they just focus on you.Peace of mind. INFPs make you feel safe. They create a room where you can do whatever you want. Even the most paranoid person can feel at ease with them, as they carry an inner harmony that they spread around. When you\u2019re around assertive INFPs, it\u2019s as if everything is fine. They make you feel as if you\u2019re understood and not alone.Flexibility. Do you want to go to the cinema? Okay. Do you want to eat Japanese food? Also okay. They adapt very easily to day-to-day matters. They are very open-minded in that sense. But don\u2019t mistake their flexibility - their values are untouchable. They\u2019re very stubborn when it comes to good and bad actions. Want to convince INFPs to do something they don\u2019t agree? Good luck with that\u2026Memory. This a trait that is especially appreciated by Si-users. Remember that time when you went to a party three years ago and it was chaotic but fun? They remember. Remember that time when they went through difficult times but you helped them? They remember. They cherish the time they spend with you, and are very grateful for the small gestures you had with them in the past. They also remember everything you said about your tastes so they can make things more pleasant for you in the future.I could go on, but I think that\u2019s enough. I could also talk endlessly about their weaknesses, though ;) ",
