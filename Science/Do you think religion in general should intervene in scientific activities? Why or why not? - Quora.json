Religion has no right to do anything outside the walls of a church. Keep your ignorant, retarded religion to your self please. If someone isn\u2019t in your church, LEAVE YOUR RELIGION OUT OF ANY CONVERSATION YOU MAY HAVE WITH THEM!!! Everyone already knows about your stupid fucking religion! If we wanted anything to do with it we would join your church. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Ultimately science is based on fact\u2026religion on unproven fantasy. Science influenced by fantasy is very poor science indeed. Personally\u2026I have always felt that religion is more harmful to humanity than just about anything else\u2026and the sooner people jettison these unproven assumptions, the better off we will be. So religion should not attempt to intervene in scientific activities at all. After all, scientists do not fly aircraft into buildings\u2026as they have a very good idea what will happen if they do\u2026so they don\u2019t need to test it on innocent people! Charles Darwin, for example, never committed an atrocity to kill thousands of people! ",
