            "answer_text": "First make sure your understanding of gravity is accurate. Since this is the field of physics, let\u2019s choose a model of gravitation that is purely physical. I\u2019d suggest considering that gravitation is the simplest possible mechanism, particles being emitted from stars and other high-energy celestial objects, moving outward through empty space and imparting their momentum to other matter: Brian Klock's answer to What are the types of cosmic gravity?  With this particle conjecture for gravity in mind, it\u2019s easier to imagine what it really means physically for the Sun\u2019s gravitational influence to extend any particular distance. Within this model, a celestial object\u2019s magnitude of gravitation is determined by the number of particles from the Cosmic Background Particle Field (CBPF) that it interferes with. Also, the influence of its gravitation is determined in the following manner: for each particle it interferes with, what celestial object would that particle have reached instead, if this celestial object had not been present at all? Each particle interfered with represents a quantum of push force that was removed from the other celestial object\u2019s balance of push forces. (In the case of Earth, this illuminates that the Sun interferes with a huge quantity of CBPF particles that would push Earth outward, thus leaving Earth cradled in a set of particles from every other direction other than the Sun\u2019s direction \u2026 particles that push it towards the Sun and keep it in orbit.) What this model means for the extension of the gravitational pull of the Sun, is that the CBPF particles flow past the Sun and off into the distance, without the particles the Sun has interfered with. Whatever distance the unimpeded CBPF particles travel, that\u2019s how far the gravitational pull of the Sun extends to. ",

            "answer_text": "Infinite. Yes you read that right. Infinite. (Well, okay this gets way more complicated, and no not really, but really, just not effectively.) Gravitational affects occur at the speed of light. Our Sun formed 5 billion (ish) years ago, so lets say about 5 billion light years. But the gasses and matter that make up the Sun existed since the dawn of the universe so 14.7 (ish) billion light years. So the matter that makes up the sun has had gravitational affects on the universe since the matter came into existence. There is no limit other than the speed of gravity. Now the affect it has on other objects diminishes proportional to the distance. So the farther away, the less effect. The effects of gravity will propagate forever. If the universe is truly infinite then the reach will be infinite. But here it gets even more complicated\u2026. the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light. (DA FUQQQQ????) Yes really. The farther apart to objects are in the universe, the faster they are moving apart from each other. They aren\u2019t actually moving faster than the speed of light, but they are moving AWAY from each OTHER (relatively speaking), faster than light. How Can the Universe Expand Faster Than the Speed of Light? So even thought the effects of Gravity could spread out forever, there are parts of the universe that will never see the light of our Sun or feel the effects of its gravity. Just as there are parts of our universe that we will never see or feel the effects of gravity from those distant galaxies. ",

It is never gone, so the reach of the earth\u2019s gravity just gets weaker until it is just part of the background field of gravity from other bodies in the universe all so weak as to be insignificant. The expression for gravitational attractive force can be expressed as: Force of Gravity = (G x m1 x m2)/d^2 G is the universal gravitational constant m1 and m2 are the masses of the two bodies d is the distance between the bodies ",
