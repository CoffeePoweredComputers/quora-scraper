            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need help from here. If you want to believe it, you will. That\u2019s the position I was in for a while when I was considering myself \u201cin between\u201d religions; I thought spellcasting, ghosts and psionics were real and looked for \u2018evidence\u2019 to convince myself. I lost interest in these things after a while and stumbled along the path of debunking or seeing debunked one, then another, then most, paranormal shows, sites, communities or experts I came across. So the trend continued until I realized that none of it was reliable, and now I can tell hocus pocus from reality miles away. This is to put it simply, because I care about truth on principle. But as long as you have an emotional attachment to something not evidently true, you will continue to find what stands for evidence. That\u2019s how belief works: Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. ",
