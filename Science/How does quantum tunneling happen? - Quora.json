            "answer_text": "David K\u2019s answer is good. I would like to use the analogy that our world is like a digital simulation. As we know quantum refers to the idea that measurements such as lengths or energy have minimum amounts. I.e. like dots on a computer screed things can not be smaller than the distance between dots. In this analogy dots on the TV screen are a quanta apart. When a value is between pixels a dice is rolled to decide which value to place the dot. In tunneling this means the height of the obstacle may be small enough to jump over. This is a rough analogy and likely quite flawed. In this analogy the dice roll relates to the Uncertainty principle. A similar process using uncertainty supposedly allows Hawking Radiation to do impossible jumps needed to escape black holes. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to pay a quantum toll to go through them. Seriously, quantum tunnels are probably not really a thing. Quantum tunneling just means that, quantum mechanically, particles and such can tunnel through classically forbidden regions, regions where the motion of a classical particle would be past a classical turning point. Generally the wavefunction of such particles drops exponentially while in the forbidden region, and the coefficient in the exponent depends on the height of the barrier. So a high and wide barrier in comparison to the momentum implies a rapid drop in the amplitude of the wavefunction until a second classically allowed region is reached and so in such a case there would be a small tunneling probability.
