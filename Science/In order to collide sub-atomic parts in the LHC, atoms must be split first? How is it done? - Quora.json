            "answer_text": "Sorry, if I am wrong, but most probably LHC makes collisions between protons which can be obtained from normal hydrogen(protium). Hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron, so if somehow the electron is removed from the atom ,we are left with proton. The removal of electron is called ionisation.Ionisation can be done by a few methods like heating the sample to a very high temperature or passing the higly accelerated hydrogen atoms to certain kind of filters.
