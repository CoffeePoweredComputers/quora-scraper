            "answer_text": "Photons have no definite size until measured. This is a common quantum mechanical oddity that has no parallel in our more intuitive, classical world. \"A photon has a zero size\" means that if we place an array of increasingly small detectors to detect a single photon, only a single detector will \"click\" to indicate a hit, making us conclude that a photon is smaller than any detector we have made so far. Until detected, it is possible to demonstrate that a single photon wave can extend more than the size of a galaxy. Our current interpretation of a mirror reflecting a photon is that the wave characteristics of the photon dominates a mirror reflection and as long as the mirror appears smooth at the photon's wavelength scale, a reflection will take place. For photons whose wavelength is about the size of an atom (gamma rays), there is no reflection -  it is rather scattering but even here the wave nature is more useful for analysis than the particle, although you can choose either way to perform your quantum-mechanics-compliant analysis and predict the same results.

            "answer_text": "Every mirror is backed by a metal layer. The metal conducts electricity. That means that if an electric field is applied to the metal, electric current will flow. The electric current will induce a magnetic field in the insulating material (e.g., glass, air, vacuum, etc.) outside the mirror. The magnetic field will induce an electric field in the opposite direction as the original electric field. And so forth and so on. Light is a type of electromagnetic wave. An electromagnetic wave is characterized by an electric field, which induces a magnetic field, which induces and electric field, and so forth and so on. This cascading series of electromagnetic fields forms the electromagnetic wave. Imagine a beam of light incident in the mirror. When light is incident on a metal surface, it introduces an electric field in the metal. The electric current in the metal induces an magnetic field in the insulator in the metal. The magnetic field induces another electric field in the insulator that is initially opposite in direction to the original electric field. This electric field induces a magnetic field. So forth and so on. The cascading series of electromagnetic fields is the reflected light. So the incident beam of light induces the reflected beam of light through the electrical conductivity of the mirror backing. The electrical conductivity of a metal makes the metal reflect light. This is what is called a classical mechanics explanation of mirror reflection. A quantum mechanics explanation would involve particles of light called photons. I will let other people explain it in terms of photons. I like the classical explanation better !-) ",

So, a more accurate analogy might be \"how do walls reflect beach-balls if beach-balls are bigger than bricks?\" That's addressed by the answers to this question: How does light reflect in terms of a photon hitting an atom?

            "answer_text": "The surface of mirrors are coated with material whose atoms absorbs, cannot hold the KE of the photons and thus must re-emit those or other photons with fidelity, ie without (much) change in kinetic energy. Some of the photons do go too deep into the structure of the material and are fully absorbed without or marginal re-emission of photons or electrons. That causes heating (increased vibration) of the atoms and overall material. ",

            "answer_text": "Refraction, reflection, and scattering involve absorption of light momentum, by charges. In the case of a reflector, the light\u2019s momentum is usually absorbed by free electrons in a metal matrix. It makes no difference the photons are point-sized and electrons are point-sized, when the charge of the electron fills all space, and its mass is so small. ",
