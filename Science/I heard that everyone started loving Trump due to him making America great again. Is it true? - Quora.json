            "answer_text": "Trump has a group of core supporters because they felt empower with Greatness each time he bullies, berates, and belittles others. When he declares (trade) war on the world and that they are easy to win, this reinforced their sense of Greatness. Sadly and in reality, these are just delusions and that they are causing great harm to the US. From the havoc and chaos that Trump had imposed on international institutions and trade that were created by earlier Americans, a new Eurasian trade zone (which exclude the US) is starting to take shape; for the US currency which is used for trade by the world and which the US had weaponized (and which underpinned US prosperity), the world is now developing an alternative; and for technologies which the US lead (such as operating system and CPU chips), the world is developing alternatives which does not include US components. To answer your question: yes, Trump has a group of supporters who support and love him because he had promised them greatness. Unfortunately, the greatness that Trump promised them is only a delusion AND that he has in fact ensure that they will never AGAIN be great. ",

He has stabbed our allies in the back, he has done very little for the people of this country, unless your rich. He has set back the piece we have been working toward by breaking an agreement with Iran. People in other countrys can no longer trust us, are word means nothing. Does this sound to you like this president is making anything great? ",
