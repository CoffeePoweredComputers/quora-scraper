            "answer_text": "The charge of this atom can be found by knowing the charge of protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons are made from two up-quarks with a charge of 2/3, and one down-quark with a charge of -1/3. Neutrons are the opposite, with one up-quark and two down-quarks. If you add the charges, you get 2/3+2/3\u20131/3 = 3/3 = +1 for protons, and 2/3\u20131/3\u20131/3 = +0 for neutrons. Electrons aren\u2019t made of quarks, but have a charge of -1. Knowing this, the total charge of protons is (4*1) = +4, the total charge of neutrons is (5 * 0) = 0, and the total charge of electrons is (3*-1) = -3. Add them up and you get +1. Note: The atom in context is Beryllium-9, the most common (and basically only, as about 100% of all Beryllium is Beryllium-9), type of Beryllium. Also, Beryllium has lost one electron, but to have a full outer shell, it would need to lose 2. ",

            "answer_text": "This sounds like homework. Do you think it is OK to get other people to do your homework for you? If you want honest homework help, please see Physics Forums - The Fusion of Science and Community Meantime, here is a hint: the total charge is the result of adding up the individual charges. So what are the individual charges? OK - add them up. ",
