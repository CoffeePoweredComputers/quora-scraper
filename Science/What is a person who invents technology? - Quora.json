            "answer_text": "Could be a pain in the arse! The inventor as the English language becomes in itself a language and dictionaries to be. The question could then be who invented the inventor, and therefore another language that may mean the translation is Producer. There is an interesting fact of defining words and then attributing that definition, that other countries may disagree by the history of what the word occurred, in an easement of being able to comment. If a canon blasts a town away is the inventor around to say Hooray or quietly changing the word into Slave Repairer of the Masters Plans-Promsman.

Technicians tell the Fabs and the R&D people why it failed to work or, in extreme cases, blew up.
