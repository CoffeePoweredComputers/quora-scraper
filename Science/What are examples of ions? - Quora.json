            "answer_text": "About the simplest example I can think of for an ion is what you get if you dissociate a water molecule. Water molecules are each composed of three atoms - two hydrogens and one oxygen (thus the simple formula H2O). If you could look really up close and personal into a glass of distilled water, you would find that it is not really made up of gazillions of intact water molecules, but rather is MOSTLY intact water molecules but with a smattering of \u201cbroken\u201d water molecules - because each individual intact water molecule has some tendency to break into two pieces - one piece being ONE of the hydrogens and the other piece being the OTHER hydrogen with the lone oxygen atom still stuck together! When the intact water molecule comes apart as described above, the ELECTRONS of the atoms involved get distributed in a way you might not expect. The intact water molecule has a total of 18 electrons floating around its three aromic nuclei. When the molecule comes apart, NONE of those electrons wants to remain associated with the single hydrogen atom that breaks off by itself - I guess they are all scared to do that and stick with the other piece - the oxygen and the remaining hydrogen! So the lone hydogen now bouncing around in the water is just a NUCLEUS with NO electron(s). And the other piece (called a \u201chydroxyl\u201d) has an EXTRA electron that its two atoms don't need. Electrons each have a NEGATIVE CHARGE of ONE. So the hydroxyl piece ends up with a net negative charge of NEGATIVE ONE, and the lone hydrogen nucleus ends up with a NET POSITIVE charge of PLUS ONE. The two pieces of the original water molecule are called IONS. The lone hydrogen is called a positive ion and the hydroxyl is called a negative ion. There are names for these two kinds of ions - one is called CAT-ion and the other an AN-ion - and even though I was a chem major at Yale for my college years (1960s) I could NOT tell you which is the negative ion and which is the positive ion - if MY LIFE depended on it!!! (Fortunately it doesn't). Maybe another Quora participant can help us both out here. ",

            "answer_text": "An ion is a charged molecule or atom. This means that you can have two types of ions, negatively charged where a molecule or atom has gained an electron or a positive ion, where the opposite is true. In some cases an ion may have a double or triple, or even a quadruple positive or negative charge depending on how many electrons the particle in question has available in the outer shell. The easiest example is a H+ ion. Hydrogen has only 1 electron and in most cases will readily give up it\u2019s electron during a reaction, giving it a positive charge. In some cases you may find it gains an electron, this will give you a H- or hydride ion. There are a couple of rare cases where you may end up with a highly charged +5 ion (5 electrons in the outer shell, all given away during a reaction) such as in the case of bismuth. Here you get a Bi+5 ion (or bismuth V ion) Here is a list of some common ions that you may want to familiarise yourself with. Generally speaking the lower the number on the charge (be it positive or negative) the easier it is to achieve.  ",
