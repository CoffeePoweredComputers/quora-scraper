            "answer_text": "If you were to transfuse beet juice, it wouldn\u2019t matter what else was in that beet juice. That individual would die. Plain and simple, that individual would die. There\u2019s really no such thing as \u201cblood nutrients\u201d because blood doesn\u2019t manufacture nutrients. It\u2019s not an organ and is, itself, manufactured \u2014 the cells originate from red bone marrow and plasma is derived primarily from water & salts absorbed through the GI tract. I don\u2019t need to address in detail the immunoglobulins, enzymes and other proteins in plasma. Blood doesn\u2019t create these. Blood is made up of plasma, cells and cell fragments (platelets, which we also call thrombocytes). Blood transports nutrients in varying proportions & amounts at any given time. What do you know about starting IVs? Have you taken at least a 2-day course? Are you certified? Do you really think you could find a viable vein on a rat? And you have a rat-size IV starter kit?? But don\u2019t bother because you would kill the rat and I\u2019m not sure why you haven\u2019t given any thought as to how beet juice is supposed to function like blood unless that\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand the functions of blood in the first place. Hey, not being judgmental, just being honest. ",

            "answer_text": "Why on earth use beet? What\u2019s the rationale of that\u2014just because beet juice is red? The red color of blood is from the hemoglobin contained in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin is needed to transport oxygen in the blood. All sorts of horrible things could result from replacing blood with beet juice; among them, if you replaced enough of the blood, the animal would quickly die of oxygen starvation. Blood nutrients would be irrelevant. Trying this at home would be difficult to begin with because you probably don\u2019t have enough skill to correctly place an IV line in an animal and know what volumes can be safely transfused and at what rates. Even a nurse or phlebotomist with advanced training on how to do this on human patients probably couldn\u2019t do it on a rat. But secondly, if one got past that hurdle, its cruel effect on the rat would be surpassed only by the stupidity of the person who tried this. If I knew of someone doing this, I\u2019d report him to the authorities for animal cruelty. ",
