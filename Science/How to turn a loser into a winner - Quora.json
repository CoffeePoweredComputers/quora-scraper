            "answer_text": "Theres a saying, if you get tired of losing you will eventually find a way to win. To change your life from negative to positive isn\u2019t done overnight. It takes sometime to master the principles and divine laws of success however, the earlier you start the better. The earlier you get on that road the better. Remember if the people around you are succeeding in life it means they got on the road before you. You need to invest in learning. For me, The book Think and Grow rich changed my life. I would recommend you start off reading that book and then find something you enjoy doing. Something you do that you forget to keep track of time then focus on that one thing. Or you can choose to learn a skill. Sales, facebook ads, copywriting, web design or whatever you find fascinating. You will be on your road to success. ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost thing is \u201cATTITUDE\u201d. The attitude of being a loser will surely lead to further downfall. Just have a lesson from your past and think of future. Remain in contact with influential people. Think that you have tried but don't think of failure. You are ahead of lakhs of people who thought of doing but hadn't even tried of doing. You have already won half of race from them and another half will be won by your attitude and determination. So be patient and think positively. Always remember darkness and failure are never permanent. \u201cKEEP YOUR FACE ON SUNSHINE SO THAT YOU WILL NEVER SEE SHADOW\u201d. ",
