            "answer_text": "INTRODUCTION In the construction of highways, embankments, earth dams, and many other engineering projects, loose soils must be compacted to increase their unit weight. This aimed to achieve; Increases StrengthDecreases permeabilityReduces settlement of the foundationIncreases slope stability of embankmentsSoil compaction is defined as the method of mechanically increasing the density of soil. In construction, this is a significant part of the building process. If performed improperly, settlement of the soil could occur and result in unnecessary maintenance costs or structure failure. Almost all types of building sites and construction projects utilize mechanical compaction techniques. General Principle; The degree of compaction of soil is measured by its unit weight, [math]\u03b3_{dry}[/math], and optimum moisture content, [math]w_c[/math]. The process of soil compaction is simply expelling the air from the voids. or reducing air voids By reducing the air voids, more soil can be added to the block. When moisture is added to the block (water content, [math]w_c[/math], is increasing) the soil particles will slip more on each other causing more reduction in the total volume, which will result in adding more soil and, hence, the dry density, [math]\u03b3_{dry} [/math]will increase, accordingly The following are important elements in soil compaction: Soil typeSoil moisture contentCompaction effort requiredEvery soil type behaves differently with respect to maximum density and optimum moisture. Therefore, each soil type has its own unique requirements and controls both in the field and for testing purposes. Soil types are commonly classified by grain size, determined by passing the soil through a series of sieves to screen or separate the different grain sizes. A well-graded soil consists of a wide range of particle sizes with the smaller particles filling voids between larger particles. The result is a dense structure that lends itself well to compaction. A soil's makeup determines the best compaction method to use. There are three basic soil groups: CohesiveGranularOrganicCohesive soils Cohesive soils have the smallest particles. Clay has a particle size range of .00004\" to .002\". Silt ranges from .0002\" to .003\". Clay is used in embankment fills and retaining pond beds. Characteristics Cohesive soils are dense and tightly bound together by molecular attraction. They are plastic when wet and can be molded, but become very hard when dry. Proper water content, evenly distributed, is critical for proper compaction. Cohesive soils usually require a force such as an impact or pressure. Silt has a noticeably lower cohesion than clay. However, silt is still heavily reliant on water content. Granular soils Granular soils range in particle size from .003\" to .08\" (sand) and .08\" to 1.0\" (fine to medium gravel). Granular soils are known for their water-draining properties. Characteristics  Sand and gravel obtain maximum density in either a fully dry or saturated state. Testing curves are relatively flat so density can be obtained regardless of water content. The tables that follow give a basic indication of soils used in particular construction applications.  Effect of Moisture The response of soil to moisture is very important, as the soil must carry the load year-round. Rain, for example, may transform soil into a plastic state or even into a liquid. In this state, the soil has very little or no load-bearing ability. Why Compact?  There are five principle reasons to compact soil: Increases load-bearing capacityPrevents soil settlement and frost damageProvides stabilityReduces water seepage, swelling, and contractionReduces settling of soilTypes of Compaction  There are four types of compaction effort on soil or asphalt: VibrationImpactKneadingPressureThese different types of effort are found in the two principal types of compaction force: static and vibratory. Static force is simply the dead weight of the machine, applying downward force on the soil surface, compressing the soil particles. The only way to change the effective compaction force is by adding or subtracting the weight of the machine. Static compaction is confined to upper soil layers and is limited to any appreciable depth. Kneading and pressure are two examples of static compaction. The vibratory force uses a mechanism, usually engine-driven, to create a downward force in addition to the machine's static weight. The vibrating mechanism is usually a rotating eccentric weight or piston/spring combination (in rammers). The compactors deliver a rapid sequence of blows (impacts) to the surface, thereby affecting the top layers as well as deeper layers. Vibration moves through the material, setting particles in motion and moving them closer together for the highest density possible. Based on the materials being compacted, a certain amount of force must be used to overcome the cohesive nature of particular particles. Moisture vs. Soil Density The moisture content of the soil is vital to proper compaction. The moisture acts as a lubricant within the soil, sliding the particles together. Too little moisture means inadequate compaction - the particles cannot move past each other to achieve density. Too much moisture leaves water-filled voids and subsequently weakens the load-bearing ability. The highest density for most soils is at a certain water content for a given compaction effort. The drier the soil, the more resistant it is to compaction. In a water-saturated state, the voids between particles are partially filled with water, creating an apparent cohesion that binds them together. This cohesion increases as the particle size decreases (as in clay-type soils).  Soil Density Tests To determine if proper soil compaction is achieved for any specific construction application, several methods were developed. The most prominent by far is soil density. Why Test? Soil testing accomplishes the following: Measures density of soil for comparing the degree of compaction vs. specsMeasures the effect of moisture on soil density vs. specsProvides a moisture density curve identifying optimum moistureTypes of Tests Field Tests It is important to know and control the soil density during compaction. Following are common field tests to determine on the spot if compaction densities are being reached The Hand Test A quick method of determining moisture is known as the \"Hand Test\". Pick up a handful of soil. Squeeze it in your hand. Open your hand. If the soil is powdery and will not retain the shape made by your hand, it is too dry. If it shatters when dropped, it is too dry. If the soil is moldable and breaks into only a couple of  pieces when dropped, it has the right amount of moisture for proper compaction. If the soil is plastic in your hand, leaves traces of moisture on your fingers and stays in one piece when dropped, it has too much moisture for compaction. Sand Cone Test A small hole (6\" x 6\" deep) is dug in the compacted material to be tested. The soil is removed and weighed, then dried and weighed again to determine its moisture content. A soil's moisture is figured as a percentage. The specific volume of the hole is determined by filling it with calibrated dry sand from a jar and cone device. The dry weight of the soil removed is divided by the volume of sand needed to fill the hole. This gives us the density of the compacted soil. This density is compared to the maximum Proctor density obtained earlier, which gives us the relative density of the soil that was just compacted.  Nuclear Density Nuclear Density meters are a quick and fairly accurate way of determining density and moisture content. The meter uses a radioactive isotope source (Cesium 137) at the soil surface (backscatter) or from a probe placed into the soil (direct transmission). The isotope source gives off photons (usually Gamma rays) which radiate back to the mater's detectors on the bottom of the unit. Dense soil absorbs more radiation than loose soil and the readings reflect overall density. Water content (ASTM D3017) can also be read, all within a few minutes. A relative Proctor density with the compaction results from the test.  Soil Modulus (soil stiffness) This field-test method is a very recent development that replaces soil density testing. Soil stiffness is the ratio of force-to-displacement. Testing is done by a machine that sends vibrations into the soil and then measures the deflection of the soil from the vibrations. This is a very fast, safe method of testing soil stiffness. Soil stiffness is the desired engineering property, not just dry density and water content. Applications ; The desired level of compaction is best achieved by matching the soil type with its proper compaction method. Other factors must be considered as well, such as compaction specs and job site conditions. Cohesive soils - clay is cohesive, its particles stick together.* Therefore, a machine with a high impact force is required to ram the soil and force the air out, arranging the particles. A rammer is the best choice, or a pad-foot vibratory roller if higher production is needed. *The particles must be sheared to compact.Granular soils - since granular soils are not cohesive and the particles require a shaking or vibratory action to move them, vibratory plates (forward travel) are the best choice.Reversible plates and smooth drum vibratory rollers are appropriate for production work. Granular soil particles respond to different frequencies (vibrations) depending on particle size. The smaller the particle, the higher the frequencies and higher compaction forces. Normally, soils are mixtures of clay and granular materials, making the selection of compaction equipment more difficult. It is a good idea to choose the machine appropriate for the larger percentage of the mixture. Equipment testing may be required to match the best machine to the job. Asphalt is considered granular due to its base of mixed aggregate sizes (crushed stone, gravel, sand and fines) mixed with bitumen binder (asphalt cement). Consequently, asphalt must be compacted with pressure (static) or vibration. Equipment Types RammersRammers deliver a high impact force ( high amplitude) making them an excellent choice for cohesive and semi-cohesive soils. The rammer is inclined at a forward angle to allow forward travel as the machine jumps. Rammers cover three types of compaction: impact, vibration, and kneading.Vibratory Plates Vibratory plates are low amplitude and high frequency, designed to compact granular soils and asphalt. Vibration is the one principal compaction effect.Reversible Vibratory Plates In addition to some of the standard vibratory plate features, reversible plates have two eccentric weights that allow smooth transition for forward or reverse travel, plus increased compaction force as the result of dual weights Unlike standard plates, the reversible forward travel may be stopped and the machine will maintain its force for \"spot\" compaction.Rollers Rollers are available in several categories: walk-behind and ride-on, which are available as a smooth drum, padded drum, and rubber-tired models and are further divided into static and vibratory sub-categories.DETERMINING THE COMPACTION CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOIL SPECIMEN BY PROCTOR\u2019S TEST Proctor Test Tests to determine optimum moisture content are done in the laboratory. The most common is the Proctor Test or Modified Proctor Test. A particular soil needs to have an ideal (or optimum) amount of moisture to achieve maximum density. This is important not only for durability but will save money because less compaction effort is needed to achieve the desired results The Proctor, or Modified Proctor Test, determines the maximum density of a soil needed for a specific job site. The test first determines the maximum density achievable for the materials and uses this figure as a reference. Secondly, it tests the effects of moisture on soil density. The soil reference value is expressed as a percentage of density. These values are determined before any compaction takes place to develop the compaction specifications. Modified Proctor values are higher because they take into account higher densities needed for certain types of construction projects. Test methods are similar for both tests.   Theory: Compaction is the process of densification of soil by reducing air voids. The degree of compaction of a given soil is measured in terms of its dry density. The dry density is maximum at the optimum water content. A curve is drawn between the water content and the dry density to obtain the maximum dry density and the optimum water content.

The diameter of the mould =Height of mould =The volume of the mould, V=The specific gravity of solids, G= Plot a curve between was abscissa and [math]\u03c1_d[/math] as ordinate.
