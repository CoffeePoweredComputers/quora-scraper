            "answer_text": "In the visible spectrum wavelength, red is the least refracted wave. so the start of the rainbow colour is the least refracted, then gradually changing up to the most refracted (violet) . The order is always the same because as the wave lengths go from longest to shortest, so we see the corresponding colours in this order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. We call this \u2018Optics\u2019 and it has been studied since the 17 Century. Interestingly, the bodies Chakra energy points have the same wavelength order and go from the Root chakra (red) up to the top of the head, 9Crown Chakra) which vibrates at Violet. Each vibrating energy matches with a different colour. ",

            "answer_text": "Convention, perhaps because in the first (primary) rainbow, the red is on the outside so perhaps looks bigger. The red-orange-yellow tend to blend together somewhat in our vision, so we see a lot more \u2018red\u2019 than we do the g/b. The bit we might call red corresponds to almost half of the wavelength range we can see. In the secondary rainbow, the order is reversed. Not a lot of people know that! ",
