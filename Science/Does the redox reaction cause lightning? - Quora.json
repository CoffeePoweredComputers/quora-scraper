            "answer_text": "No. High-velocity updrafts, rapid cooling of water vapor, ice crystal formation, and falling snow-water (graupel) cause charge separation inside large convective storms (thunderstorms). Collisions between updrafted small ice particles and falling graupel cause charge separation through triboelectric effects. The ice crystals become positively-charged, while the graupel becomes negatively-charged. The updrafts then separate the positively-charged ice crystals, moving them to the upper portion of the storm. The negatively-charged graupel falls to the lower portion of the storm. Its a combination of triboelectricity and convection (wind), not any redox reaction. ",
