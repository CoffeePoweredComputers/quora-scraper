            "answer_text": "\u201cLife\u201d is NOT found in Venus\u2019 atmosphere. What was found is a gas (phosphine) that on Earth is associated with a certain kind of bacteria. But there are other ways to make phosphine. Here on Earth, we make quite a lot of it in chemical plants using a process that starts with phosphoric acid. The next step is for a second group to observe phosphine in Venus\u2019 atmosphere and hopefully using some different methods that can see more than just one spectral band. After the presence of phosphine is confirmed, then the theorists can come up with a list of possible sources. One possibility is that this gas is made deep underground where there is an abundance of heat and pressure using a geochemical process not unlike what we use in chemical plants. This is FAR more likely than a biological source. After you have some competing theories then you have to think of observations or experiments you could do to rule out some of the theories. We are not there yet but this is the next step, thinking of ways to rule-out some of the possible sources. One thing about life is that it is always going to be part of some ecosystem. You can\u2019t have just one organism. It is hard to imagine a complex ecosystem living in 900-degree heat in a cloud of sulfuric acid. More likely the phosphine is made underground then leaks upward. But first, we need to verify it is actually there. ",

Since 1952 contactees have told us that Venus in inhabited but at a far higher level of matter than Earth.For us to see our visitors from Venus, and all the other planets in this System, they must lower themselves, and their craft, to our level. In that case you\u2019d see them as human.Earth is one of the least advanced {evolved} planets and the only one upon which life and form still appears in dense physical matter. All the others hold life and form in etheric physical matter.While this is all known by our authorities, they\u2019ve chosen to misinform the public for over 70 years.For most people it will take official Disclosure to allay their needless fears of \u201caliens\u201d, abductions and invasion.

As far as we know, this gas can only be produced by life, under the conditions in Venus atmosphere. Additional, independent confirmation of this finding is desirable. The ESA/JAXA probe BepiColobo will pass near Venus on October 15th. They will attempt at that time to detect Phosphine, and again in August, 2021, when the probe will pass even closer to our sister planet. It\u2019s not clear how long it will take to analyze this, or other data relating to Phosphine on Venus. The work done to detect the gas in the first place took several years. ",

There will be several fly-by missions (en route to other planets) that may be able to contribute some measurements, but the orbiter-lander missions now being discussed won\u2019t be operational for at least several more years.

            "answer_text": "Well, the phosphine finding means nothing. The conditions on Venus is are not compatible with any known life form possibility. The lifeforms producing phosphine would need to live on the ground, if not underground to have access to phosphorus compounds! And they would need to access to water to be able to produce it. Most probable outcome is that that phosphine origin is abiogenic just like methane is produced also by abiogenic way on earth and most probably also on Mars. The first step to find life on venus is to fly there with probe equipped with solid microscope and explore. ",

Look how long it has taken to look for life on Mars without any results and when they were possibly found NASA panicked and retracted all future seaches for life like we make on the Viking spacecraft ? That was the first lander and only one equipped to look for life with 3 experiments. 1 was positive, 1 negative, and the last one \u201cmaybe\u201d. We never looked again. Perservence is again \u201clooking\u2019 but indirectly. So if it is taking that long on Mars - can you imagine how long it will take to do the same on Venus ? ",
