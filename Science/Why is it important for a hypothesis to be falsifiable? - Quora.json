            "answer_text": "Suppose I claim that fairies are responsible for everything. Why is the sky blue? Obviously, the fairies wanted it to be blue. Why is grass green? Because fairies made it so. You could dig deeper into the mechanisms, but the answer is fairies, wherever you choose to stop. Prove it wrong. Can you? (Aside from saying that it\u2019s merely absurd?) If you can\u2019t prove it wrong, does that mean it\u2019s right? Of course not. The reason you can dig deeper into the mechanisms is that you can imagine it works a particular way, and there are observable consequences of it working that way. There are things you would expect to see \u2014 as well as things you\u2019d expect not to see \u2014 if the hypothesis is true. A useful hypothesis in science is one that can in principle be proven wrong, because then we can devise tests that might determine whether or not it is true. If according to hypothesis X we expect not to ever see phenomenon Y under conditions Z, we can go on a quest to set up conditions Z and see whether or not Y occurs. Consider the hypothesis that meat spontaneously generates maggots after a given length of time. A consequence this hypothesis is that we\u2019d expect there to be no conditions under which maggots could be prevented from appearing in a piece of meat. By engineering conditions in which flies are unable to lay eggs on a piece of meat, we can consistently prevent maggots from appearing in it. It turns out that spontaneous generation of maggots in meat is false, and the mechanism of their appearance is linked to the reproduction of flies. Or we could have just run with the idea that the fairies simply made it so that maggots would appear in meat, and we would have learned nothing. So why is it important for an hypothesis to be falsifiable? Clearly the fairies demand it! ",
