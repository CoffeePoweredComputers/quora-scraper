            "answer_text": "This is an important question. I dont think it is an accident. I see a number of similarities between my work as a researcher and as a data scientist: [Nature] Science requires discipline. Data science is math in other forms, and also requires discipline. You have to be able to bring to the table the diligence that you find in scientific work. Nature doesnt care who you are. Either your work has integrity or it doesnt.[Process] Science is about finding testable explanations and predictions. Defensibility of the work is important. Data science has similarity in terms of framing of questions, experimenting to generate understanding, and communicating the understanding to the rest of the world. This work also has to stand the test of time.[Methods] This is less important IMO but data science methods are used routinely in quantitative scientific work.But data science also differs from the traditional science: [Goals] Data science is applied science. It is not about fundamental truths but about having an impact within a context. Finding a defensible idea/approach is important but it doesnt have to be novel.[Communication] Data science involves communication to normal people. Traditionally scientists talk to each other, and can assume fair amount of background knowledge. Data scientists\u2019 work involves interacting with large number of non-technical people, and helping them understand what data is saying is a critical function.",

            "answer_text": "As per the dictionary meaning of \u201cScientist\u201d, A scientist is a person engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge that describes and predicts the natural world. In a more restricted sense, a scientist may refer to an individual who uses the scientific method. The person may be an expert in one or more areas of science. Therefore A data Scientist is the person who follows a defined activity on data and predicts the impacts and events. ",
