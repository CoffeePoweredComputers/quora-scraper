            "answer_text": "Because these substances, while often containing water, become impervious to water or at least stay solid (allowing water to pass through, however slowly that may occur), when the water has evaporated from the original mixture. Two examples being latex paint and concrete. In the instance of the paint, it becomes impervious to water once the water it the formula evaporates. Whereas with concrete the water in the mix acts as a catalyst when mixed with the dry components that causes the mixture to become hard as a rock, this reaction and the aforementioned result will occur regardless increasing the quantity of water involved. I am unsure at which point an insufficient quantity of water would result in the reaction not taking place, but from experience I can attest to the fact that an opened 60lb bag of concrete will harden within a few days and that occurred with the only water source being a high humidity factor in the air those days. Or conversely you could pour a bag into a lake and within a few hours you would have a rock solid lump of concrete at the bottom. Untreated concrete will however allow water to seep through over time whereas the paint wont. ",
