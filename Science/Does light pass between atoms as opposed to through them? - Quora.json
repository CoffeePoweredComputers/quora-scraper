            "answer_text": "Light is very confused, sometimes it\u2019s a EM wave - energy - and sometimes it\u2019s matter. The material form is organized into packets called photons. that hits a molecule is absorbed (wave) but also pushes against the molecule (matter) and the molecule moves. Other photons pass between the molecules but not unscathed The gravitational forces of all those molecules slow down the photon packets (matter) but on exit from the substance photons are again at the original speed (wave). Light speed is 186,000 miles/sec is light in a vacuum. Air, a tiny bit slower, water even slower and glass slower still. Near a massive gravity source, like a galaxy, light passing by on one side gets bent in a curve so you can actually see another galaxy behind it. Light will either pass between or be stopped by molecules. Now that you have got that down we can move on to the general theory of relativity and why time speeds up as you go into space ",

            "answer_text": "In gases, light passes between the molecules, simply because the distance between them is Much Greater Than their individual size. In liquids and solids, light does not pass at all, unless the material is transparent or at least translucent. In any case, the most accurate thing that can be said is that light waves can \u201cinteract\u201d with the atoms of a material. The particle model is of little or no use in understanding these interactions. And Quora is not a good source of information on this phenomenon anyway. There are far more wrong answers here than right ones, possibly because right answers would take up multiple chapters in a physics text. And possibly because several of the wrong answers sound plausible until examined closely. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question Ive developed a theory that is at odds with current understanding of light, lightspeed, and speed itself. All three, are very different event of the one action. The action of lightspeed itself, infact passes through the medium of space and its predominant ingredient, gravity. Like a boat in the medium of water, under the throttle the vessel moves water aside as it pushes forward and a bow wave is created. Light or what i call (photon rain) is created like the boat creates a bow wave in water, the wave is large in the conception, but as the wave propagates outwards it slowly decreases in wave size and energy, just as photon rain dose within the propergation of light, lightspeed, and speed. The one difference, the action of lightspeed, has a conical bow wave when passing through gravity, the basic element of the fabric of space/birds nest in reality, space itself. Light isn't encumbered by anything other than the (Graviton). This would suggest that objects of certain density, reflective material and in particular (photo synthesis), are/is under a strong influence applied via contact with the (Graviton) Hope this helps you Chow Caddies BigBangBurn ",

            "answer_text": "We just do not know what light does. Think about the following: A photon of a special energy level can disappear and be reborn at another place. The distance of the two separated place is maximal: d = c \u2022 t ; where d is the distance; c the speed of light and t the time interval (disappearance and appearance). This process can happen several times. The photon leaving the source is hardly the same photon, as the one we observe. There are many \u201crebirth\u201d ! Werner Heisenberg said: \u201cWe can not look into an atom\u201d I say: We can not see a photon. We can only observe its birth and its disappearance. Further notice: Quantum particles do not travel on a Newtonian path. (See the explanations above) We only know with a certain probability where quantum particles may be. ",

If you draw a circle on a paper and work out a point striking one end of the circle to create a wave along the circumference, you\u2019ll find that the wave travels to the other end and meets to cancel and return to the starting point (reflection) or jump to another circle and transmit further (transparent crystal).
