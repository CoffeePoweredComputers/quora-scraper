            "answer_text": "I always feel slightly sad and slightly cross when I see questions like this. To answer the question first: humanity will not only survive but, given empirical values of climate sensitivity, will do well out of an atmosphere enriched with co2 as will the biosphere. It is plain ignorance to believe this represents a challenge in any sense other than exposing the deceit of the alarmists. You can probably only ask a question like this if you are (with all respect) scientifically gullible or ignorant, and have fallen for the outright lies and deliberate deception of the alarmists. These people are mostly in academia and government, and gain greatly from the fake alarm they have instilled in you. Thousands of university lecturers and so called researchers will be out of a well paid job unless they continue to make people feel that co2 creates a problem rather provide benefits. There are hundreds of similarly gullible people on Quora who gave fallen totally for the alarm and who can quote all sorts of irrelevant references but, lacking any physical science education, are studiously oblivious to the scientific method and who have no clue how to judge or interpret such information. This scam needed a lot of \"useful idiots\" to provide pressure on politicians, almost all of whom are also scientifically illiterate (think 'Obama' for example). In such groups the scam succeeded in finding such people. The entire scare is based on the output of unvalidated computer models. It ought to be a matter of common sense that a model which cannot predict or understand even the grossest elements of climate, is useless for telling us how things will be in one year or a hundred. But the climate gullible all go along with this and are climate science deniers in that they deny the real evidence. There is nothing to worry about in terms of our climate's future. We will survive very well as long as we resist the alarmists and scammers and then we can concentrate on real problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Why wouldn't?  Who said humanity wouldn't? First, let's talk about Ice Ages--surely (after a meteor strike or nuclear war, the most Earth-altering event), you know how powerful an event that is?  Well, the interesting thing about the Ice Ages is that, frankly, the Earth is still a pretty damned nice place to live on.  They come every hundred-thousand years or so.  Does anybody think that any significant degree of life is wiped out?  No.  Just the northern and southern ice caps grow out by quite a bit. South America, Southern North America, Africa, Southern Asia and Australia really remain quite habitable.  In fact, Africa actually turns IN TO a really nice place on the whole:  the jungles in the middle dry out a bit and the Sahara becomes a fairly fertile steppe.  Shit, all this talk about \"Ice Ages Destroying Humanity\" is, well, it's bunk.   I also have doubts about humanity wiping out humanity with a nuclear war.  (see:  Dan Holliday's answer to How many times over could the world's current supply of nuclear weapons destroy the world?).  Meteors or Yellow Stone Erupting would probably do us in, but what are the odds of those?  Slim to none before the Singularity. Remember:  Human beings have survived two ice ages together.  Barely. But we survived as a tribe.  Our ancient ape ancestors and before that (and so on and so on) have survived dozens of heating and cooling of the planet.  Humanity may well survive, but our society will be utterly crushed. So, even if human being RAISE the temperature of the Earth by an average of TEN DEGREES, even if we kill off all the bees and most of the oceans, it's unlikely that \"all of humanity\" would be destroyed.  We'd just see a lot of dead humanity (maybe even on the order of billions).  But even if 99% of human beings perish, that's still around 70 million survivors.  That's a LOT of creatures. So, why care about all the pollution and global warming nonsense?  Well, for one we as living things have to accept an ethical mantle, an obligation to preserve and not destroy things.  Second, we aesthetically like the variety that is available on the planet and to pointlessly allow a species--or a hundred thousand--to be wiped out is just stupid.  Third, we live on this planet and, while we may not go extinct, we don't have the right to fuck it up for future generations.  Fifth, there is nevertheless a small risk of our extinction if we carry on as usual.  What if that percentage were just 5%?  Would you let your husband work in a job where he had a 1 in 20 chance of being killed?  Would you work in that job?  Would you allow your kids to attend a school where 1 in 20 kids get seriously harmed?  Your chances of catching aids after anal sex (receiving) is like 1 in a hundred.  It's goddamned HARD to get penetrated and get AIDS.  It's like 1 in a 1000 for vaginal sex.  Those are pretty damned good odds!  Still, do you--whoever you are--really think it's a good idea of risking such a disease, a disease which isn't even necessarily a death-sentence anymore?  No.  Of course you don't.  And, at least if YOU or a LOVED ONE die, it's just \"one person\", we aren't talking about one person, we're talking about us, humanity, the only intelligent species we know of and once we're gone, nothing of us will remain.  Any species that knowingly walks towards their possible destruction without doing everything to avoid it is acting out of common insanity.  Humanity may well be insane because our priorities are so resolutely screwed up. But, don't be confused.  All of this will end anyway.  If you're one of \"those\" people who thinks that humanity should just be wiped out or allowed to go extinct (morons), then I remind you that EVERYTHING in this exceedingly violent universe is temporary.  All life in this universe will end one day--trillions of years from now.  Nothing will survive.  We will end, even the matter in the planets and the Black Holes will evaporate while entropy takes hold.   But just because it will end one day, doesn't mean we shouldn't fight for our lives to survive and avoid any possibility (no matter how remote) of extinction.  So, while global warming is unlikely to kill off humanity (who knows, it might be our evolutionary bottleneck), it will kill off a lot of people and will most certainly alter our lovely planet in ways we would not like.
