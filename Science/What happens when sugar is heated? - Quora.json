            "answer_text": "It will initially melt (at around 140C) and very soon after that start to decompose, tuning brown, and if you continue heating it will turn black and give off fumes as the sugar decomposes down to carbon and the hydrogen and oxygen in the molecule vaporise as various organic fragments. Please note that the brown product - often called caramelised sugar - is not really a caramel, it is just partially decomposed sugar with a wide variety of breakdown products If you do this be very careful, melted sugar is both very hot and very adhesive and causes very bad burns.

            "answer_text": "When sugar is placed in a pot or pan over a flame or another source of heat, it transforms from a solid to a liquid substance. It develops a different taste and smell, and the most common term for the result of heated sugar is caramel. The molecules in heated sugar break down and produce several different compounds. Its color shifts from white to amber before taking on a brown hue, and its sweet taste is replaced by a more bitter flavor ",
