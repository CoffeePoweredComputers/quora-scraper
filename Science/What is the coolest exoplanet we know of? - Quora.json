            "answer_text": "Apologies for this dad joke of an answer, but the coolest exoplanet would probably be the sub-Saturn-mass planet orbiting the late K dwarf binary OGLE-2008-BLG-092L A b.  Three main factors exist to make this planet the coolest. One, the huge semi-major axis. At 15.0 times the distance from Earth-Sun, this planet orbits roughly where Uranus is in our Solar System. Uranus is a pretty cold place. Two, the star it orbits. Late K-dwarfs, while long-lived, aren\u2019t exactly known for giving off much energy. An Earth-like planet would need to orbit roughly where Mercury is to be warm enough. Three, its mass. At 56 Earth masses, the gas giant is not warm enough to warm its cloud tops sufficiently the way larger planets may be able to. The result is a very cool (see what I did there) planet, somewhere in the range of 40K. This is roughly the temperature of Pluto and cool enough to make nitrogen freeze as a solid. Brrrrrr! Sounds pretty cool to me!! Not sure if this is what OP intended, but who could resist a good dad joke with a little scientific flair involved? P.S- To answer OP\u2019s actual question, Beta Pictoris b is kinda cool. It is young though, so still has a lot of residual heat from its formation, hence why it\u2019s not the \u201ccoolest\u201d (I couldn\u2019t resist, I apologize) planet. There! I did it again! ",

            "answer_text": "my favorites are the first exoplanets identified. In 1995, three exoplanets were confirmed orbiting a neutron star. How those exotic world's survived the supernova maelstrom that produced their parent neutron star remains a mystery. I like one theory that states that they could be \u201cChthonian\" planets. Prior to the super nova, thoses planets very well could have been Jupiter sized gas Giants, whose outer atmospheric envelopes were stripped away by the cataclysm leaving their Earth sized cores. ",
