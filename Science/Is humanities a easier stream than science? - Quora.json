            "answer_text": "Nullius in Verba Mathematics and Sciences (MS) vs. Humanities (HM) 1. Break a well-established law in MS, and you shall receive a business class ticket to Sweden to receive your Nobel Prize. Break a well-established law in HM, and you shall be dragged and mocked and roasted on twitter and elsewhere and maybe (in the worst-case scenario) you\u2019ll land in jail. 2. MS feels complicated to a beginner, relatively easier to an adept. HM feels easier to a beginner, chaotic and confusing and a constant itch to an adept. 3. If a person pursuing MS discovers a gem, she will most probably go crazy. If a person pursuing HM discovers a gem, she will probably feel proud and satisfied (notice the frenzy-less-ness). 4. A new idea in MS is always welcome, by all (with exception of a few) A new idea in HM is partly accepted, partly rejected, partly mocked, partly cursed, partly celebrated and so (it is a big world). 5. Pick a random page in an MS book and you\u2019ll understand nothing. It is inaccessible to laymen. Pick a random page in an HM book and you\u2019ll understand the thing. It is accessible. 6. MS topics mostly don\u2019t have a human touch. They feel dry and barren and heartless. HM topics are full of human warmth. They are drenched in emotions, full of life, and throbbing hearts everywhere. 7. You can\u2019t survive MS without people around for a long time. Our nature craves for human presence around unless you are a robot. You CAN survive long stretches of complete solitude with books and stuff on HM. 8. MS offers mechanical growth. HM offers natural maturity. 9. MS give chronic exhilaration. HM give smooth joy. 10. In MS, a controversy is mostly accompanied by relentless worldwide efforts to subdue the controversy. And this subduing often happens in one masterstroke. In HM, a controversy is commonplace. Often debated without a conclusion. Often ignored. Often people move on with life. Efforts to subdue it is often accompanied by more conflict and more controversy. In short, HM is controversial without controversy. CONCLUSION? Both are beautiful. Both are hard. Do you want to decide which to choose? Patience with hard math (which may feel meaningless at times) is necessary for MS. HM will mostly try to distract you. Be unmoved. That will aid. A really courageous heart will be an aid in HM. Facing public humiliation while you present your opinion is not so easy. A submissive life will try to distract you. Be unmoved. But be flexible as well. That will aid. ",

History is mind boggling unless you keep skimming the chapters daily. You are expected to write essays in your answers (I\u2019m referring to the 8 markers) with detailed description, taking reference from sources with neat points and underlined subheadings. History is no joke. We have projects too, in all the subjects. Political Science is not a bed of roses either. It requires a lot of dedication, hard work and persistence. Contemporary International Politics is slightly easier than Indian politics because the chapters are comparatively shorter. In 11th grade, Constitution and Political philosophy are pretty challenging. If you are really passionate about your subjects, you won\u2019t really find anything difficult. Also, subjects like history, political science, economics are extremely interesting. It\u2019s worth it, trust me. ",

But to be very honest none of the subjects in class 11&12 go easy you have to work equally hard in all of them. Humanities has many Subjects within it like media , human rights,home science,legal studies, geography, political science, history etc which makes it very interesting for students . Like physics chemistry in 11&12 you have 3 books in history and political science too and one really thick book for Human Rights and Gender studies which needs to me rembered and read thoroughly. Do not take any stream for granted. ",
