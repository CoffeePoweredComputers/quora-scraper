            "answer_text": "Well, to some extent it depends on your counting rules. The Standard Model is usually illustrated with some sort of diagram like this:  So if you count there you find twelve fermions, four gauge bosons and one Higgs. That\u2019s seventeen particles. There\u2019s an anti-particle for each one, though, so that\u2019s thirty-four. Also note that there are three columns of fermions - the second and third columns are in every respect just like the first column except for mass - they\u2019re \u201cfamilies.\u201d It\u2019s always possible that there are further families at higher mass that we simply haven\u2019t had the energy levels to create in our accelerators. All of the matter that just normally floats around in the universe is made from the left-most column of fermions - the up and down quarks, the electron, and the electron neutrino. Protons and neutrons are made from up and down quarks. Also note that this chart doesn\u2019t address gluon \u201ccolor.\u201d There are eight different variations of gluons. The reason that there is one electromagnetic boson (photon), two weak nuclear bosons (W and Z), and eight strong nuclear bosons (gluons) has to do with group theory and the type of symmetries underlying the various situations. If you count all of these then instead of seventeen / thirty-four you\u2019d have twenty-four / forty-eight different particles. Finally, note that no graviton is shown, because no graviton has ever been observed, but physicists are nonetheless convinced of its existence. Physicists are also pretty convinced that dark matter exists, and it would have to be made of something. There are various theories floating around about what that would be. So you see that this is somewhat of an open field - we can talk about what we\u2019ve validated the existence of so far, and that\u2019s what I did above. But there could be more waiting to be discovered, or that will never be discovered. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow \u2026 the question is basically asking for a whole course in particle physics. Nobody can answer this question in a quora answer. You may as well ask for the question to the ultimate answer while you are at it! Lets see\u2026 some of it I can start you off on. We know of about 17 elementary particles\u2026 we divide them into \u201ctypes\u201d depending on what we are interested in. For instance, the two major divisions are \u201creal\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d. However, less trivially we have 4 main groupings: leptonsquarksguage bosonsscalar bosonsThey interact via virtual guage bosons\u2026 ie gluons bind quarks into atomic nuclei, which attract electrons via photons. After that you get the rules of chemistry (atoms interacting via photons) and from there you get biology. Physics is not complete. There may be more elementary particles\u2026 ie gravitons. ",
