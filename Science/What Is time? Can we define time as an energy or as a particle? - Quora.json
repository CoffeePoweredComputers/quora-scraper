            "answer_text": "Time is a function. T(n+1)=T(n) + 1 as n increases in single steps. Where time comes from is unknown but energy may (or may not) be involved. A wave could create time with the change in time coming from the up and down pressure of the wave. While this is speculation, a gravity wave could fulfill that requirement. Gravitational time dilation shows that gravity effects time and that suggests that gravity might be the source of time. On the other hand gravity waves would seem to have a direction and relativity is not variable to direction. In other words, speed has the same effect on time no matter which direction the speeding object is headed in. This suggests that time does not have a direction but may be a stationary function that is in sync with every time function. How can this be? My theory is that time comes from an instability in space that fluctuates back and forth (or up and down) and evenly effects the whole universe. Since space has no substance, the instability can\u2019t be detected unless revealed in energy and particles. ",

            "answer_text": "Your first question is nice. Your 2 nd question is stupid. Can you equalize two different physical quantities!!! Answer to your first question was given by Einstein. Time is reading of a clock and nothing else. If you measure time interval between two events at a single spatial coordinate by single clock stationed at that point, you are measuring proper time interval. If you measure interval between two events at different space coordinates by two stationary mutually sychronised clocks stationed at those two points , you are measuring non proper interval.Your frame is endowed with same identical time if these twoo intervals are same standard of unit say second & this happens in Inertial frames. So in Inertial frame you are in , 1 s proper interval equals 1s noproper interval. Noninertial frames or in gravity field these two do not match and you can not attach a single frame concept globally with finite extension . ",
