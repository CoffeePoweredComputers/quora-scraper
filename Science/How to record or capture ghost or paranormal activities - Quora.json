            "answer_text": "You can record paranormal activity at any time. The only time there is a deeper contrast in photographic images is at night. The darker the better. Twilight and dawn don\u2019t have as deep contrasts as later parts of the night. While cameras may record faint figures and disturbances, only video cameras capture movement and sound effectively. Still cameras get only one frame at a time. Video cameras can get a burst of pictures. Thats common sense. Ghosts are paranormal activity and require the observer taking the picture or video to also have the ability to see. Otherwise where will you point your lens and focus? Electrical, wavelengths, intensity of light, density of darkness all contribute to the image clarity. If you go into a group with one or two members who are gifted with this ability to see and hear these phenomena that will help you see the \u2018spot\u2019 where the activity is taking place. For sure, it is not all around you. It tends to appear in the most familiar places where the spirit is actually acquainted with. When a \u2018seeing\u2019 or hearing\u2019 group member points to a stairwell where the spirit is standing you may not be able to see or hear it. That is the problem. Therefore you will be sceptical. In some ghost hunting searches I have asked the sceptics to go to places where there is definite appearance. I ask them to report their emotions, sensations, stimuli, sight and hearing sensations. The cold shimmer, hand on shoulder, touching of hair, smell and sound are common reports. In many cases sceptics themselves got terrified and were unable to explain why. I think the fear of the unknown is great in all people. Yet the spirits in that area were harmless. I often see corpses of suicide victims and accident victims on trees and highways. Sometimes while walking I can see spirits around fences, where dogs are tied, near lake fronts, near new homes and old mansions and very often around churches, temples, and holy places. Around some Hindu temples I have seen huge numbers of spirits. I found some Christian cemeteries more haunted than others. Yes. You can record these incidents. It is wise not to keep those images stored within your house. At times spirits come calling for images of themselves. I have many ghost stories to tell readers and hopefully will be able to write about these in other questions. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the easiest way is to use your recorder on your phone. Make sure the place where you are recording is as quiet as possible without people and/or animals walking through. Do a walk through and note unusual or normal noises. Does the wind whistle? Does the house creak? Establish a baseline of \"normal\"...then you will have a better idea of what is \"paranormal\". One of the scariest things you can ever do is run a phone tape recorder or a hand held recorder overnight in ANY place. You will be SHOCKED most times what you might hear. The same is true for video.  A static video camera gives you the most chance of recording something. Google paranormal security footage or ghost security footage. Especially at night (due to light and other factors) you will record more than you ever wished you did. I highly recommend video recording OUTSIDE your home with a security camera or a static camera to begin with. You will see orbs, light flashes, crypto creatures and much much more that you can't quite explain. This MAY dissuade you from filming INSIDE your home. I also recommend a black light. Black light reveals a spectrum of light that isn't available without it. You can see WAY more than you ever dreamed with a black light in the room. Here are some helpful articles as well: How to Catch Ghosts on Camera  Whats A Good Way To Record A Ghost/paranormal Activity? - Let's Talk About Ghosts  I personally think it's fun to start out without paranormal equipment. It shows you just how NORMAL and natural all this stuff is ;)   ",

            "answer_text": "From a professional psychic\u2019s point of view. Imagine as a channel of angelic awareness (divine if necessary), imagine having dealt with hundreds of unpleasant phenomena, imagine again that all such phenomena is based on suffering, pain and anguish at a spiritual level. That such phenomena needs to be resolved, healed and dissolved so something can be released, if possible. Why keep a recording of pain. When one knows how it is formed and the ignorance and pain it reflects, why be attracted to it. Ghost hunting groups are children playing with fire that could damage them for centuries, they could be damaged and not even know it until they approach old age, and then it may be too late. My advice is to reflect on why be attracted to chaos that could damage your ethereal existence. Such phenomena are disruptions of astral structures which you also would become a part of if you venture too closely. My advice is to run away from danger, secure to the services if necessary of someone that will resolve the karma that dangerous spiritual phenomena represent and have it dispersed. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't record or capture paranormal activities. Simply because they're not a part of our material world. They may exist in another dimension where the physical laws of our dimension would be different. At the most, you may be able to record some material movement or vague sounds caused by natural sources. If you remain in solitude for some time, you'll notice the same phenomenon!! ",
