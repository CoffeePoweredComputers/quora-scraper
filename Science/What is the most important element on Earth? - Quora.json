            "answer_text": "Energy comes in two different forms. positive, this is an energy that wish to be, or wish to rest at light speed. If this energy is been pulled away from light speed, it is accelerating the shortest way back to light speed again. Then there is negative energy. This energy wishes to rest in infinite speed.If this energy is taken away from infinite speed, it is accelerating the shortest way back to infinite speed. This forces is the origin of contract I\u2019ve gravity, and repulsive gravity. None of this forces can be out there whit out the other counter part. Togheter they forms spheres. This spheres is like a sphere inside another bigger sphere. They could be positive inside and negative outside. Or negative outside, and positive inside. They could also be asymmetrical and thereby create charged particles. The force that keeps them togheter is electromagnetism. Positive and negative charges attract each other. The most important element in the universe is the part that divides the charges in this particles. This part is the light speed itself. Let me explain. If you got a sphere of positive energy, then there is a negative sphere inside this positive sphere. It will then be a spherical shaped singularity that is laying in the middle. This is in between the positive and negative sphere.  This is how it could look like inside a photon. V1 represent negative energy whit the property of repulsive gravity, hence dark energy. V2 represent positive energy whit contracting gravity. V=C represent a spherically shaped light speed singularity that separates the forces and charges. Positive and negative charges acts as glue to the particle, and keeps it togheter. the interaction between positive energy that wishes to accelerate inwardly to a point like singularity, and the negative energy that wishes to accelerate outwardly to infinite speed, hence infinite sized sphere, makes the photon move. When the photon is moving this energies forces the photon to change size, when it moves. The photon is also forced to move in a wave like path. The size of this wave is directly related to the energy content inside the photon. It is this V=C sphere that is the most important structure of the entire universe. I don\u2019t think this structure is discovered by scientists yet, but they will probably find it. Actually, if you are looking at a photon, or the path that a photon moves along, you can see the asymptotically light speed sphere by your own eyes. The first ever photograph of light as both a particle and wave This is an image of photons passing by from left to right in the vacuum speed of light. It isn\u2019t the blobs that is the photons, the photons moves through the line, changing size due to the interaction between negative and positive energy. If you are looking at the red photons, you first can see that the repulsive forces of negative energy expands, then the repulsive force pulls the positive part outwardly to become a spherically cavity. This cavity is fixed in size when there is negative energy outside to keep it inflated by a repulsive, and outwardly pull. You can see how negative energy is being compressed, or how it loses energy and shrinks down to the surface of the light speed singularity sphere. When all positive energy inside is accelerated outwardly against the singularity sphere, and thereby pulled all negative energy down in speed and size. That is what you are seeing at the image. In the end, positive energy is pulling the photon back to light speed, and a new cycle starts. This process could probably a;so be directly related to how the universe is working, and where to find dark energy, hence negative energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Our planet has the seventy percent of water. Our body is conformed from sixty five percent to seventy five percent. Water in our body and environment is essential because without water we could live. Water is the most important element on Earth. We should take care of water because some day water will end. We could reduce water pollution by disposing our waste property, do not flush medication, do not throw trash on rivers or lakes, conserving water, report polluters, and keep your car good. With this 6 actions we could have water for more years and we could help our planet, so we can have a great environment.First of all, we need to dispose our waste property. We cannot pour not a biodegradable thing like paint or motor oil on the ground. If you are not sure what to do, you could go check with your local government. Also, you could contact your sanitation department for information and orientation. For example, if we throw paint of motor oil on the ground, when it rains, the water will be mix it up with that paint and motor oil and it will go to those underground rivers that we have for drinking water. Also, do you know that a single quart of motor oil that go into underground rivers can pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water? ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean what's the most important element to us, meaning to life, I'm going to say, carbon. It's not oxygen, because there was life on Earth before there was free oxygen. Oxygen is something life evolved to tolerate at first, and then to depend on, after the blue-green algae poisoned the entire planet with it and killed off most of the anaerobic life forms. But there can be no life without carbon. The second most important element, from life's point of view, is iron. Earth has an iron core that gives it a magnetic field, and that field shields the surface from cosmic radiation. Without it, it's difficult to see how anything could continue living on the surface.

The geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere as we know them depend critically on hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, calcium, iron and several others.  What is perhaps more interesting is WHY certain elements are important while others function more like bystanders.  It mostly has to do with chemical reactivity-- specifically with the number of \"extra\" electrons or \"needed\" electrons for these elements to acheive a maximally stable state in conunction with other elements.  For example, calcium has one \"extra\" electron and thus tends to participate in various electrochemical reactions with negatively-charged elements.  As a result, calcium is central to phenomena as diverse as the retention of nutrients in soil, the transmission of electrical impulses through neurons and table salt.  Ultimately it is the interplay, the \"molecular dance\" of different elements that gives rise to complex processes. ",

BUT, even if oxygen existed and there was water, life could not have evolved without carbon atoms to form the backbones of large organic molecules so carbon is also critically important. BUT - this list could go on for quite a few more chemical elements that were/are absolutely critical to the existence of life. So, bottom line, there is no one element that is \u2018the most important\u2019 because life as we know it requires the existence of quite a few different elements. ",
