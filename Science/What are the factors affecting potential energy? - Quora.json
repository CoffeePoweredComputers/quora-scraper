            "answer_text": "Potential energy, what is it? Basically speaking it is the energy possessed by a body at rest. It is synonymous to bond energy of covalent molecules(you know what I mean? I'll just explain) when atoms bind to one another covalently, energy is kinda always conserved. Which is why when you combust petrol( Octane and O\u2082 involved) you'd always produce energy.   So now, some factors that P.E depends on are; Mass- mass is always a factor when it comes to potential energy it influences how much energy the body will possess,it is a constant.Gravitational field intensity- for example the gravitational field intensity of the moon is 1/6th that of Earth. The g-force,weight and hence the energy in both places cannot be the same.Height - An object's height in a specific gravitational field is a factor which by dependence on it's mass will determine how much PE it has.All of these is just a consequence of this very equation. E [math]= mgh[/math] I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Who writes these questions? The factors are innumerable! e.g., form of energy, such as chemical, electrical, mechanical, nuclear, etc., Secondarily, its availability, and utilization efficiency. For example, a 20 ton boulder sits precariously at the edge of a cliff, 100 feet above the valley floor below. This boulder possesses 4,000,00 ft.lbs. of potential energy. It is only available if some force causes it to fall over the cliff, and further only if it can be harnessed to do useful work. If not, its potential energy is converted to heat and earth deformation upon inpact of tge valley floor. ",

            "answer_text": "You should have specified the type of potential energy. The potential energy stored in a steel spring has so many factors already. The potential energy stored in batteries has also many factors. The gravitational potential energy has different factors. It depends on the mass of the body, the acceleration due to gravity and the height of the body from the lowest position. ",

            "answer_text": "Potential energy is the capacity to do work, sheerly on account of position of an object in a force field \u2014 may be electrical, magnetic or gravitational. Considering electrical potential at a point due to a charge, it is the work done in bringing a unit charge from infinity to the given point. So potential is independent of magnitude of incoming charge, it is just decided by a position in the field. Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its presence in the field. This will be a multiple of unit test charge in relation to which potential is defined. Thus if the charge is 10 times, the energy will be 10 times. ",
