            "answer_text": "You gots 15 nuclear protons, each massive particle with a FORMAL positive charge, and 18 extranuclear electrons, i.e. 18 species of negligible mass but with a FORMAL negative charge\u2026 And thus the charge of the nuclide is [math]15\u201318=-3[/math]. Agreed? And as a matter of fact we can be more specific, and identify the ion as [math]P^{3-}[/math]. How can I do this\u2026? ",

            "answer_text": "I think since 15 protons and electrons will balance out the charges their sum of charges would be zero plus 3 electrons -1.6*10^-19(3) Total charge of the atom will be -4.8*10^-19 will be the total charge of the atom remember that protons and electrons have the same charges but slightly different masses ",
