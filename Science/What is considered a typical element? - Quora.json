            "answer_text": "thanks for a2a deepak. Actually, I see many of the following answers here are somewhat misguiding. I think my answer is capable to clear your confusion. The third period elements( Na, Mg, Al,Si,P,S,Cl) are called the TYPICAL elements. They are called so because they represent properties of their own group. To be more precise, if you want to study the properties of group 1, then you must better choose sodium and you get the clue about behaviour of other elements of its family. Do not confuse this term with bridge elements, because concepts them are different altogether. Bridge elements are those elements which show diagonal relationship, found in period 2 and period 3. (For example, Lithium and Magnesium or Beryllium and Aluminium) The obvious question is, why not we call second period elements as typical?? The reason is simple. Scientists found some anomalous properties in period2 elements and thus they were not capable to represent the group. Reasons for differences in their periodic properties and hence in their chemical behavior are: Small size of these atomsHigh electronegativityLarge charge/radius ratioNote: Typical elements are also called REPRESENTATIVE elements. all the best regards, arnav kulkarni ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing which makes something a typical element. There is no simply observable physical or chemical property that identifies something as an element, and that would make you say: this is not a composite compound. And elements are so different from each other that I would almost say the same the other way around: there is almost nothing that would immediately tell you it is obvious you are dealing with a non-elemental structure. There are elements that are gases, but they are indistinguishable from composite gases. There are elements that are metallic, but you can't tell them apart by eye from alloys.  And there are elements with allotropes like carbon with diamond and graphite that are so different you would not be able to know they have the same composition.  ",
