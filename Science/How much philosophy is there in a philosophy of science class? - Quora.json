            "answer_text": "Depends on the instructor, obviously, but typically it's a philosophy person so a lot.  Is your question really \"how much science will be in a philosophy of science class?\"  (And, if it's a decent course, there will be some science and even maybe some math.  In the same way you need to learn some logic for a logical positivism course.) Typically, philosophy of science is half epistemology, half metaphysics.  (At least, in an analytic treatment.  But, doesn't have to be: ethics and political philosophy could make substantial appearances as well, as well as philosophy of religion.) Maybe you could expand on the reason for your question a bit - that would help me understand what your concern is. ",
