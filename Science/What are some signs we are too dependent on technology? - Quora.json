Instead of interacting with people, we interact with a magical device. There are more injuries caused by texting and driving per year, 390,000, than there are injuries due accidental shootings, 73,505 Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving, Gun violence in the United States - Wikipedia School boards don\u2019t accept the science behind the leading cause of anxiety in today's teen isn\u2019t from homework assignments, but from their connection to social media. MIT did a study that shows after three hours a day on Social Media teens are depressed and anxious, Teens are anxious and depressed after three hours a day on social media. God forbid anyone point this out because the very media outlets that rely on teens to read them for their information will deny the science Stop blaming teens\u2019 mental health issues on \"screen time\". I think I would rather believe a study out of MIT, than some pathetic journalist from a leftist leaning media outlet like Vox. And they claim conservatives are science deniers. Even the mental health industry recognizes the negative effects of technology usage, Nighttime cellphone usage linked to poor mental health among teens.

            "answer_text": "Being too dependent on our GPS (Global Positioning System) is one sign that we have become too dependent on technology. Sure it does help us get from point A to point B without a hitch and help avoid traffic jams or road construction. But relying too much on the GPS stops us from navigating for ourselves whenever we are in unfamiliar territory as we often rely on the GPS to navigate unfamiliar territory. Sometimes, you will have to rely on your bearings as the GPS isn\u2019t always reliable. Knowing what your bearings are can often help you get to your destination quicker and safely without the GPS, and teaches us how to navigate for ourselves. There have been numerous stories of people driving their cars into a lake or people traveling in the wrong direction from where they are actually headed. With that, you can end up in a life or death situation. It\u2019s a sign that we have become too dependent on technology and that we don\u2019t really give it a second thought when we use the GPS to get from point A to point B. It\u2019s good to have a sense of direction by reading a map and a compass to find our bearings than just blindly relying on the GPS. Knowing how to navigate for yourself and knowing how to read a printed map and road signs and knowing what your bearings are will always be useful and probably save your life if you feel that you could be headed in the wrong direction.
