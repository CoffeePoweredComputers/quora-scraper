            "answer_text": "All currently accepted models of the Atom vary from lousy to absolutely grim. The Atom is not like any of them. The models are muddled and really tell you nothing. They are so bad that Physics actually have the Fine Structure Constant inverted. The coupling of the Strong Force between Protons is only 1/137th of that of the Coulomb Force. The reason for this is that the Coulomb Force is considered repulsive which it is not. Proton are separated by the Nuclear Force which does not change with distance because it is a normal entanglement. The Coulomb Force is a bit weird but it is simply enough to understand that it varies inverse square and is not to be confused with Charge does nor really exists but most closely relates to the Weak Force. Physicists never really thought this through. If a force that does not vary with difference has to balance one that is inverse square, it is pretty obvious that he inverse square force must be the attractive one. The attraction is normally present when particles are Spin Up Spin Down. Where the Neutron Mediates two similar particles can go Spin Up Spin Up to attract via the Coulomb Force. Not understanding this fundamental concept has them muddling up the Coupling Constants. Of course at very close range the Weak Force still repels so the system is very stable because an attractive force is sandwiched between two repulsive forces. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends what you mean by best. The Bohr de Broglie circular orbital model is simplest and gives numbers for energy levels quickly, explaining spectral lines. for school kids. But it doesnt explain periodic table and chemistry. Schrodinger equation and quantum mechanics and electron clouds is then standard unavoidable but is undergraduate level. The bohr model is often not mentioned in schools nowadays as it is too incomplete, which is one thing if you go on to uni and get the whammy schrodinger , but for people who dont do science at uni then Bohr is some satisfaction getting nice formula.
