            "answer_text": "Science requires scientific method. To observe the world and formulate a hypothesis as to how it functions. Then try to disprove your own hypothesis. If it is not destroyed, and results can be replicated, then it is a \u2018law.\u2019 Art implies that you are working more subconsciously. You may take in inputs, but as to how you got that result, you are not exactly sure. This, in popular parlance, is called a black box. Art also implies intuition. Intuition is a higher order process, which is beyond the scope of this document to explain. \u201cIt\u2019 more an art than a science\u201d in the simplest terms, means you are using judgment to make a decision, and, that judgement is very personal and cannot easily be explained nor replicated.

            "answer_text": "Generally, it means that a practitioner of any given discipline, must make a decision based upon incomplete, or apparently conflictiing data.  The \"art\" is being able to determine, the parameters of the problem and solve it. To some degree it is the ability to use what you do know to make the best decisions about what you do not know. Examples would be;  building a bridge that will support the weight of all the traffic on it, without building a bridge that could support all of the heaviest trucks allowed on the road, being on that bridge at the same time. treating the most likely disease, even when the test results do not necessarilly, point to that disease 100%",
