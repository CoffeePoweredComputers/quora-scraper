            "answer_text": "A virus that caused adverse cognitive and emotional changes in humans is readily possible. In fact, the common cold does this if you get sick enough, because running a high fever causes some degree of delirium, and feeling sick makes people more prone to selfish behavior. More alarmingly, rabies is a disease that infects the nervous system and causes irreversible damage often leading to severe behavioral symptoms before death. The mechanism of the \u201cRage Virus\u201d of 28 Days (and sequels) must be different because of the speed with which symptoms emerge after infection, since the human body\u2019s own defenses are what results in the cognitive and emotional impairments commonly resulting from infection with simpler viruses, while the rabies infection of nervous tissue is very slow. This is not impossible, the Rage virus, apparently transmitted by direct contact with body fluids like fresh blood, could easily be much more complex than common viruses capable of surviving in aerosolized mucus and saliva. More complex viruses have been identified as causing very specific modes of infection targeting specific kinds of tissue. A virus transmitted by contact might have the property of targeting neural and glandular tissues, resulting in unbalanced hormone levels and cognitive impairments. It is likely that such a virus could exist? Yes, it is. Is it likely that it does exist, or will exist in the near future? No. Viruses are species specific, the leap from one species to another requires that there be enough opportunities for transmission for a mutation in the genetically specific characteristics of the virus to adapt to the differences in interactome between species. The probability of a successful leap goes down with the increase in complexity and specificity of the viral infection mechanisms. While this has occurred and continues to occur, something like the Rage virus is too destructive of an affected population to remain unnoticed and endemic in any commensal of humans for long. That said, it could be that a virus, in jumping species, becomes much more virulent or the effects are worse. This is improbable but not at all impossible. Could such a virus be engineered by modern science? Not easily. Nor would it be so difficult to find a cure for an engineered virus. While it is not possible to exclude the theoretical possibility of engineering such a virus out of hand, the mechanisms with which genetic engineering now works are much simpler (biochemically speaking). However, such a virus is possible, and if released into the population could indeed spread horrifically quickly with extremely detrimental effects on society. It is simply unlikely to occur, whether naturally or through current genetic engineering techniques. ",

            "answer_text": "No. You can imagine a virus that turns everyone it infects into slavering homicidal cannibalistic maniacs, but slavering homicidal cannibalistic maniacs are easy to kill. Any reasonably equipped infantry squad in a reasonable position should have been able to hold out against the zombies of 28 Days Later as long ammunition lasted. 28 Months Later relied on abject stupidity and hoplophobia as its basic premise. If you were re-populating Britain after a zombie apocalypse wouldn\u2019t you arm every man, woman, and child with automatic weapons? No brainer - we have brains, zombies don\u2019t, so give people tools to fight that maximize the advantages that brains give us. ",

            "answer_text": "Physically possible? Technically I guess. It would require such a perfect combination of genetics to occur that it would almost certainly have to be engineered in the lab by humans, but it is technically within the realm of physical possibility through a few different methods (my bet is on parasites that create a perfect symbiotic relationship with fungi, bacteria, algae, and perhaps a viral component). Likely to ever happen? Not in our lifetimes no and if they ever do exist technology will be so advanced by then that zombies are no longer a possible threat to humanity. The statistical odds of a zombie doomsday are astronomically small. So small it is safe to completely rule it out as virtually any other serious or world ending disaster is more likely to happen than a zombie doomsday. ",
