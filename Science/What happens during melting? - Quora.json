            "answer_text": "Melting is a process that occurs, when matter changes its state from a solid to a liquid. I am goimg to explain this process based on the kinetic molecular theory. This theory says, that everythingis made of small particles named molecules. These molecules are always moving at a chaotic order and interact with other molecules using brownian forces (the famous gravity force plays a really small role, due to the fact that molecules have a really small mass). Now that we explained that, we can get rightto the point. Usually, for an object to change its state, it is requiered a change in the surrounding environment: like heat. Once you start to warm up ice, it becomes water. What happens can be explained based on the above-mentioned theory. (Another thing that you should know, is that the molecules at solid states are organised in a crystal structure) Redirect Notice \u2192 this is an image of the crystal structyre of salt. When heat is applied, it increases the kinetic energy of the molecules, causing them to move faster. As a result, they start hitting other molecules and generating more heat from the impact, thus making the process faster. The molecules keep behaving like this for a while until the browian forces between them become smaller (there are less influenced by other molecules), leading the molecules to escape the crystal-like structure and move freely. This moment, when the molecules escape from the crystal-like structure, is called melting point. (While the substance is at this point, the temperature is constant, due to the fact, that all the given energy is used to counter the brownian forces that keep the molecules together and break crystal bonds) ",

            "answer_text": "When you increase an object\u2019s temperature you cause the molecules and atoms to start moving. In a solid, those particles don\u2019t move much. They stay in one spot and vibrate. Eventually, the particles move so much that they no longer return to their old spots, though they still stay together. This is the point where the rigid structure of the solid is lost; the substance liquifies. Add more energy and the particles can\u2019t stay near each other anymore. The liquid\u2019s consistent volume is lost; the substance vapourizes. Add more energy still and the particles break up into atoms and start to shed their electrons. Most of the chemical properties of the gas are lost as a result; the substance ionizes. Solid, liquid, gas and plasma. ",
