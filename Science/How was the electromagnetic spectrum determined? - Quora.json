            "answer_text": "The spectrum was long known, though it needed Newton to show that it was a collection of different types of light. There had been a rival theory that colours were contaminations of pure white light. Infrared - invisible but also in the spectrum - was found in 1800. Then Ultraviolet in 1801. Maxwell's equations showed the relation between electricity and magnetism. And predicted radiation with a speed matching the known speed of light, suggesting that the various colours were different wavelengths. Heinrich Hertz proved this by producing and detecting what we now call radio waves. This was pure science: that they might also be useful never occurred to him. ",
