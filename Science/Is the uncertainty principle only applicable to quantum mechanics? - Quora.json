            "answer_text": "This question has two sides to it. Yes, the uncertainty principle only applies to quantum-mechanical objects. On classical objects, it has no effect whatsoever. However, this answer is somewhat misleading. Why? Because every object is quantum-mechanical \u2014 because the universe itself is quantum-mechanical. The uncertainty principle is not needed for any objects that can be described entirely by classical mechanics, but there are no such objects; even things on the scale of planets or galaxies must abide by the laws of quantum mechanics, because that is simply how the universe works. The laws of physics do not pick and choose their scales \u2014 they apply equally to all objects, regardless of nature. That would be like asking \u2018Doesn\u2019t gravity only apply to Newtonian objects, and not all objects?\u201d But, I hear you ask, if this is true, then why don\u2019t we see cars quantum tunneling through hills on our way to work? Or why don\u2019t two buildings built too close together pull each other in via the Casimir effect? Well, the answer isn\u2019t that the objects themselves aren\u2019t affected by quantum mechanics. They have de Broglie wavelengths just like everything else, after all. The difference is that the effect of QM\u2019s inherent randomness is incredibly minuscule on most scales larger than a molecule. Save for a few edge cases (such as neutron stars), most large objects can be modeled, to within a very tiny margin of error, using only Newton\u2019s laws, and occasionally relativity. Even on the scale of the human body, our de Broglie wavelength is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck length. So while it exists, its effects are so minuscule as to often be ignorable.

            "answer_text": "Property of acting like waves are the main characteristic of quantum particle ,due to this property all the weird thing happens in quantum mechanics .At large scale due to quantum decohrence ,wave function can easily collapse ,which prevents all those things to happen. Heisenberg uncertainty principle is only applicable to quasi particles or small particle but the particle influenced by this principle can effect classical world ,example Casimir effect,Hawking radiation . This are the macro world phenomena where uncertainty principle is at work. ",
