            "answer_text": "When your carb intake is limited to 20g per day, your body will used up the carb that is stored in your liver and muscles providing glucose (sugar) to your body cells. Your brain and red blood cells depend on glucose to function. Other body cells will switch from utilising glucose to utilising fat as energy fuel. Fat will be convert to ketones which can be used by brain as an alternative fuel for brain. Providing that your body has enough fat to burn, you won\u2019t be in much trouble\u2026 If you are a skinny person, and if this condition prolonged, you will convert your precious amino acids into glucose or ketones to be utilised as sources of fuel for body cells. It is hypothesised that by limiting your carb to 20g per day, your body goes into a ketogenic state, that may help with satiety. A healthy person should consume more carb in a day because limiting carb to this low amount is not sustainable for long term. ",
