            "answer_text": "Jocel, Sodium chloride is an ionic crystal. Sodium ions carry a positive charge while chlorine ions carry a negative one, and the two naturally form a lattice structure. When you put salt in water, the positive ions gravitate toward the negative sides of the water molecules while the negative ions move towards the other sides. In this way, each water molecule disrupts the lattice structure, and the result is a solution of free ions suspended in water. Dissolution happens more quickly if you agitate the solution by stirring or shaking, because the addition of mechanical energy disperses free ions and allows more unmated water molecules to access the salt. At a certain point, the solution becomes saturated, which means that all the water molecules are attached to ions. No more salt will dissolve in a saturated solution.An electrolyte is a solution in which positive ions, called anions, and negative ions, or cations, are able to move freely. Because of this freedom of movement, an electrolyte can conduct electricity. A sodium chloride solution is a strong electrolyte because all the ions from the salt dissolve -- assuming the solution isn't saturated -- and no neutral NaCl molecules are left to weaken the conductance. The ability of salt water to conduct electricity depends on the concentration of sodium and chlorine ions as well as on the absence of impurities. For example, while seawater can conduct electricity, seawater won't conduct electricity as well as pure saline water that has the same salt concentration because seawater contains a host of other minerals and other impurities that act as electric insulators. Short answer is that it all depends on the granular size of the salt. Not the Iodine. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Scott Soloway nailed it. Rock salt and table salt are both sodium chloride. The only difference is rock salt is usually sold for throwing on sidewalks to melt ice which means rock salt can have a lot of impurities in it.It is true iodized salt has iodine added but it is such a small amount of iodine, only about 4 tablespoons of iodide solution for a ton of salt, that I doubt it has much effect on how fast the salt dissolves. When I use pickling salt or \"Kosher\" salt it is usually in bigger bits than table salt is, but I have actually put pickling salt through a blender once because it had become clumpy from very high humidity.By clumpy I mean some of the crystals had absorbed enough water to make lumps but the whole bag of salt had not turned into one solid piece. Anyhow the salt came out very fine. It looked like icing sugar. It also dissolved in water almost instantly. ",
