            "answer_text": "According to my experience, there are various causes for developing a mental illness or a disorder. They are :- \u2022 Congenital- some children are born with mental disorders. Such disorder cannot be reversed after birth. They include Down\u2019s syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder. \u2022 Some mental disorders develop due to physical injuries. Maybe severe head injuries or due to neurological brain disorders. Also due to brain surgeries. \u2022 Some mental disorders develop due to the traumatic experience in a person\u2019s life. Some people suffer severe traumas in early years of their lives. Such traumatic experience may be buried in the subconscious mind and may later develop into mental disorders. Those traumas may be related to severe physical or mental abuse. \u2022 Some mental disorders develop due to advancing age or due to old age. For example- Dementia. To be more precise- Alzheimer\u2019s. \u2022 Some mental disorders develop due to drug abuse or alcoholism. \u2022 Some mental disorders develop due to our present situations and environmental conditions. These may develop due to overthinking and stress. The above are few reasons for developing a mental disorder. I have cited these reason because in my experience as a psychologist, i came across clients with mental illness and these were the few reasons why a person had developed a mental disorder.  ",

            "answer_text": "The brain is a computer. It collects, stores, organizes, recalls, and deletes information that is downloaded onto it. It can also have a variety of computer viruses attack it which can lead to mental illness. Mental illness can occur due to: family history (genetics); malnutrition (whether food or mental stimulus); environment (lack of boundaries, not allowed to interact with others); trauma (child abuse, war, natural disasters); emotional abuse (being told your worthless); lack of medical care (while in the womb and throughout childhood while the brain is growing); substance abuse (eroding of brain cells depending on substance used); age groups (being mute as a child, Alzheimer\u2019s in elderly); brain trauma (car wreck, continuous concussions); and birth defects in regions of the brain that I believe lead to severe mental illnesses (Antisocial Personality Disorder). The one thing that you have to remember is that all mental illness is biologically based because all mental illness comes from the brain and the brain is a physical part of our being. Mental illness is actually a medical problem within the brain and how many computer viruses get downloaded onto it. Each type of brain (computer) virus creates a different type of malfunction in how the brain works and sometimes that malfunction exhibits itself in the form of \u201cmental illness\u201d. Just really look at the term \u201cmental illness\u201d. Your brain is where mental is created and illness just means something about the brain is sick. Although some mental illnesses might be worse than others, I don\u2019t see mental illness as being any different than high blood pressure, diabetes, or irritable bowel syndrome. It\u2019s all a medical issue. ",
