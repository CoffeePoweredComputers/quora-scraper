            "answer_text": "People who blurt out things like: \u201coh, Autism, doesn't it mean mentally ill? Mental health issues? Delusional. Mad. Can't be trusted. They are Simple minded. Don't understand things normal people understand etc\u2026..\u201d Those kind of people who say things like that about people on the aitistic spectrum/Asperger's, are: a) Ignorant. b) Are projecting their own propensity to lie therefore THEY are the ones who can't be trusted. c) Tend to be Bullies with severe unresolved problems, AND real mental health issues. You either have training in autism/knowledge therefore you'd never assume/even suggest that Asperger's equates to having a mental health problem. Or if you don't know - you don't know and you treat people as you find them. Even asking this loaded question is equal to DEMONIZING autistic people. Do autistic people become serial killers? No. Psychopaths do. Autistic: naive, literal, trusting, blurts out the truth Psychopath: savvy, devious, trusts noone, acts charming, lies Neither are acquired (children do not have mental illness, that's aquired, people go mad, not born mad) Autistic - born that way, brain wiring prebirth, genetic component is strong, may skip a generation or two. Psychopathy - born with it. Genetic component is strong, may skip a generation or two Not everyone severely abused becomes evil. But evil born that way AND then severely abused in childhood becomes LETHAL! Born autistic, depending on support, either shines in the area of their special intetest, or falls through the cracks, becomes overwhelmed, dies in poverty, may acquire depression and PTSD from being abused. But autism itself is the opposite of evil psychopath and can not be developed (ie. It's NOT a mental health issue). You're born with autistic brain and that won't ever change. What happens to your life after depends on luck: what kind of care givers you had. If they weren't nurturing, supportive, encouraging - that's not good. But not terrible. You just re-parent YOURSELF! And MAKE YOUR OWN LUCK! Psychopath wouldn't want to change, even if they could. With Autism you CAN really shine! That's the bottom line ",

            "answer_text": "Asperger's as a diagnosis no longer exists. It is now diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Asperger's is what is considered a \u2018high functioning\u2019 form of autism which means social impairments may not affect them as severely as some other forms of autism. But this does not mean they are experiencing their autism less severely; more that they are working harder to mask the autism. Autism is not a mental illness. It is neurological and likely caused by genetics. It causes difficulties in social development due to sensory related factors and how an autistic brain processes the environment differently. An autistic brain tends to be hypersensitive to sensory stimuli on an overwhelming level and therefore has to hyperfocus on more narrow and specific element - which is often unique to individual - in order to cope with the input. This is why we prefer routine and predictability and use forms of self stimulatory behaviours to filter out and process the input. We can get overloaded much easier than others for to this and at times where we are unable to stim or filter out the excess input, we can reach a meltdown or shutdown and struggle to function. It is present from birth and, unlike illnesses, is incurable. But with an early diagnosis, the correct support can be provided for us to live a normal, fulfilling life. People with Asperger's are highly sensitive. This sensitivity brings many unique gifts and a unique way of perceiving the world. Trying to blend in and meet the expectations of society is what exhausts us and causes stress related illnesses to co-occur with the Asperger's. But Asperger's itself is not an illness. In some cases, the individual may feel self conscious from a young age and learn to hide their Asperger's; which can lead to a diagnosis being missed, which can cause a lot of anxiety, stress and difficulties that eventually become too exhausting to continue hiding. This is known as autistic burnout. (This can still happen with an early diagnosis depending environmental experiences). The autism spectrum is very broad and everyone is different in how their autism affects them. We all have the same core characteristics with social interaction and communication difficulties, repetitive and restrictive behaviours and sensory sensitivities; but our individual experiences influence each person's strengths and weaknesses differently.
