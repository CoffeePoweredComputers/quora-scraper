            "answer_text": "Actually, my frirst job in 1967 was commissioning Elliott 4100 mainframe computers as they rolled off the production line at Elliott's. Then later in 1973 I designed, built, and programmed a custom machine much like what was to be the Z-80, but in logic gates not microprocessors (which did not really exist yet - 8008 was about to turn into 8080 but was more expensive to develop for than using  me to DIY! - $10K for me vs $80K for Intels system. Which would have also used the additional $10K for me to drive it.). After that I designed a custom replacement for the Data General Nova 1200 based on the 29000 bit slice chips, though that project got cancelled along with my UK life (for good reasons and good outcome, I would add).

            "answer_text": "Not intentionally. But my first computer was sold as a package with some peripherals that didn't work with it unless you went in and changes some jumpers, so I was thrown in the deep end pretty quickly. And of course once you've opened a computer and shuffled things around it just seems natural to keep doing it. ",
