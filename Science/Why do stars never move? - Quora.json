            "answer_text": "Why do stars never move? A few stars do seem to have what is called proper motion, but these cosmic wanderers are the exception to the rule\u2026 Most folks will say that what I am telling you is cosmological heresy, and that all stars move\u2026 However, let\u2019s take a look at the star with the greatest proper motion, Barnard\u2019s star, and see what we can learn from it.  Above: \u201cBarnard's Star, showing position every 5 years in the period 1985\u20132005 The proper motion of Barnard's Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed of 90 km/s. The 10.3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.\u201d \u2014 Barnard's Star - Wikipedia What is interesting, is that if Barnard\u2019s star keeps its current rate of movement over the next few millennia, it will be proven to be in a 3,000 year orbit around the Sun, which is a paltry time frame compared to Proxima Centauri\u2019s estimated 550,000 year orbit around the Alpha Centauri AB pair. More likely though, Barnard\u2019s star is just an anomalous wanderer. Why do I say that? Notice the other stars in the above image. It is claimed that they all have proper motion\u2026 Yet, other than deviation in brightness and parallax, I do not see even a single arcsecond of movement over the twenty years of observation. Someone no doubt will say: \u201cBut if stars are all orbiting the center of the galaxy, then how can they appear fixed in the heavens?\u201d Another question should be: \u201cWhy has no constellation changed even an iota as they have been recorded for thousands of years?\u201d (ignore computer simulations that claim they have). It all comes down to what galaxies are determined to be: Below: the Andromeda M31 \u201cgalaxy\u201d as it is seen through a backyard telescope.  Below: the exact same M31 galaxy as presented by NASA.  Decide for yourself. Are nebulous galaxies really \u201cisland universes\u201d millions and billions of light-years away that can still miraculously be seen despite the alleged distances? Or, are spiral galaxies like Andromeda above, simply locally obfuscated stars amidst a nebulous spiral of gas and dust? It turns out, the visible universe, could be a whole lot smaller than most people think. Did someone just open another window in the Matrix? ",

            "answer_text": "The stars are moving. All of them. But the stars are very far away\u2014even the ten thousand or so that are close enough to see with the unaided eye. So their motion is not apparent over a human lifetime. Walk down your driveway. Notice how the grass at the edge of the pavement sweeps past a lot faster than the trashcan at the far end of the street. Now imagine if that trashcan were a trillion times farther away. Would you see it moving at all? The same principle applies to the stars themselves. The further away they are, the more slowly they appear to move from our perspective. The Big Dipper, for example, is made up of stars that are about 100 light-years away from Earth. Compared to the stars of Orion\u2019s Belt (below), which are about 1,000 light-years away, the Dipper\u2019s shape will change relatively quickly\u2014though over many thousands of years:  In order to understand the motions of the stars, you have to watch them very closely over many years and filter out all the (much nearer and so larger) motions of the Earth itself. Edmund Hally first pointed this out in 1718, but it\u2019s only in the last thirty years that computers have made it possible to project the observes motions back thousands, even millions of years so really illustrate the proper motions of stars.
