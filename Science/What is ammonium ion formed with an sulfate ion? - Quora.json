            "answer_text": "Ammonium sulfate (American English and international scientific usage; ammonium sulphate in British English); (NH4)2SO4, is an inorganic salt with a number of commercial uses. The most common use is as a soil fertilizer. It contains 21% nitrogen and 24% sulfur.  Ammonium sulfate is made by treating ammonia, often as a by-product from coke ovens, with sulfuric acid: 2 NH3 + H2SO4 \u2192 (NH4)2SO4 Ammonium sulfate - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Ammonium Sulfate is an ionic compound formed by two polyatomic ions, Ammonium NH+4 and Sulfate SO\u22124.In order for these two polyatomic ions to bond the charges must be equal and opposite. Therefore, it will take two +1 ammonium ions to balance the one -2 sulfate ion. This will make the formula for Ammonium Sulfate (NH4)2SO4. ",
