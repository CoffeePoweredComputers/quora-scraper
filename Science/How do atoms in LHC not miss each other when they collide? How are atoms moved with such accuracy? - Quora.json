            "answer_text": "Many of them do miss, but some don\u2019t. Before rings, accelerators shot beams at fixed targets, like liquid hydrogen in big tanks. Eventually one would find one to hit, if the tank was big. The complication in rings is focusing down to a small spot (so higher chance of colliding) but without destroying the stored beam. Collisions have a cross section, which tells how likely they are to occur, and has units of area. Colliders have a value called luminosity, which tells how likely a collision is, divided by the cross section. To get luminosity high, the beam current needs to be as high as possible. That is, as many protons as you can get! The LHC holds trillions of protons (or lead nuclei) passing about every 90 microsecond. Experimental results come from a few hundred collisions. There are many Quora questions about atoms being mostly empty space. (They aren\u2019t electrons take up a lot of space.). But at TeV energies, protons are mostly empty space. The collisions are actually between quarks inside the protons as they pass by (through) each other. ",

            "answer_text": "The atoms are collected together in needle-like packets that are squeezed as they reach the collision point to about 16 microns across, steered to a few microns accuracy. Each packet contains about  protons. Even so, there are only a handful of collisions each time two packets intersect. But the packets collide very frequently indeed, so with only a few collisions per crossing, they can add up to billions per day. ",
