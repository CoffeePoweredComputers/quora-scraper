            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on how powerful the explosion is and how close to the origin of the blast one is\u2026. It can be deafening, actually hurting your ears and head, even causing bleeding from the ears, eyes, nose, and/or mouth, rupturing eardrums and causing internal bleeding. It can create temporary or permanent hearing loss. It can make your head hurt and cause you to feel stunned, confused, disoriented, scared, angry and have blurred vision. If can feel as if someone hit you in the chest or back or side or whatever with a sledge hammer and it can cause you to lose your footing, stumble, fall, fly through the air, and crash into the ground, other people, or solid objects. It can hurt like hell, breaking bones and causing almost anything to become flying debris or \u201cshrapnel.\u201d It can even kill you\u2014dead. That is why we much prefer to visit them upon the enemy in copious quantities. It is most unpleasant and I highly dis-recommend it, if one is able to avoid one. Good day! ",

            "answer_text": "Invisible death even a small device can hurt if you are too close. The faster the explosive propagation speed is the harder the clear air shock wave will hit and the more damage it can do. Like getting hit by a steel door doing 600 miles per hour hurt on you only it can be much mush worse than that steel door. The shock wave can turn tissue in your body to mush and your bones into flying splinters. Think Pink mist where you just were standing. Why we dig into the ground at every chance. ",
