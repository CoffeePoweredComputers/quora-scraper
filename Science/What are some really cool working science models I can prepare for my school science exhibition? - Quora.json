            "answer_text": "Experience is the learning .In order to gain real experience students are asked to prepare model to understand certain principles. While making model one could learn the objective and theory behind working principle One can learn the topic batter than reading many books and hearing many lectures of experts. To understand the scientific law and it's working principles of the law, students are expected to participate in exhibition instead of imagining it with in the four walls of the classroom While preparing the model one can realize practical hardship in experimenting the scientific principles It helps to understand the scientific principle underlying the experimentation.He can improve or modify his experimentation depending upon the problem offshoots. While presenting a model in an exhibition one can earn a new knowledge and also by observing the other exhibit of his class mates It also helps him to develop scientific attitude and aptitude. He can learn different scientific methods of doing things . A question arise why we need a model or why one has to participate in an exhibition . In the process preparing exhibit or witnessing an exhibit gives direct experience and also gives comprehensive knowledge about different scientific principles. We could not learn everything only by direct experience always The other option is learning by model which gives mimic experience of real thing. There are two kinds of model we think off. One is working model and the second one non-working model. When we are not able to learn by real experience or experimentation then option left us is learning by modelling which gives more or less direct experience When we have to go for a model When the real thing so big or so small or costly affairs in providing direct experience or having risk in real experience the only option for learning is only by modelling Whether geography or physics if we want learn about planets and solar system the only option is learning by model.. When we decided to learn by model then a question arise whether to go for working or non working model . We generally opt for working model which gives us realistic experience .Now 3D visuals which give us more or less direct experience . Some times the real object is so small then we have to provide projected model to learn easily .For example learning microorganism or structure of an atom or electron configuration we have to go for macro model and Visuals which magnifies the original size for better vision and understanding . If the process is so complicated then to simplify the process we have to choose model Sometimes to bring about past events then modelling worked out well. Some time if we have to explain complicated scientific process about machine and or to explain its working principles necessarily we have to go for working model to explain better or to learn better . The teacher or learner must decide the model based on his interest , his need and his objectives We can use working model to minimize complexity of a phenomenon or structure or function and to give contrived experience After choosing the topic of interest for preparing a model one should collect information about the materials needed and technical support required To my opinion best model is the one that explains what it intended for. Even low cost or no cost materials may be used to prepare a model i.e.from waste materials. It is all dependant upon interest attitude and aptitude . ",

            "answer_text": "Once, i prepared a working Micro TESLA COIL, for my Class 12 practical Physics Project. It was worth investigating and preparing, also fetched me full marks in my practicals very easily. It also impressed the external invigilator from the CBSE. So,  i think its worth considering, as its fairly easy to make, and looks very different and impressive, so that makes it too cool.       Here,  this should help you :      ",
