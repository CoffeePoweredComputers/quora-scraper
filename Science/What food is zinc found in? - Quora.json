            "answer_text": "Firstly it is important to get a general understanding of how much Zinc an individual needs. According to the Mayo clinic the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Zinc differs depending on a number of factors; gender, age with or without child etc. Generally speaking: American adult males and teenagers - 15 milligrams American adult females and teenagers - 12 milligrams. Now we have a general idea of how much we need and we can now look at the foods that will help us reach that RDA. Here are some foods high in zinc. The Milligrams are not exact measurements but it will give you an idea. \u00b7 Oysters (3 ounces): 78.6 milligrams \u00b7 Lamb (3 ounces): 6.7 milligrams \u00b7 Pumpkin Seeds (1 cup): 6.6 milligrams \u00b7 Grass-Fed Beef (3.5 ounces): 4.5 milligrams \u00b7 Baked beans (\u00bd cup): 2.9 milligrams \u00b7 Chickpeas (1 cup): 2.5 milligrams \u00b7 Cacao (1 ounce): 1.9 milligrams \u00b7 Spinach (1 Cup): 1.4 milligrams \u00b7 Oatmeal (instant pack with water): 1.1 milligrams \u00b7 Low fat milk (1 cup): 1.0 milligrams I have included a link to where I got this list and it will give a further list of foods. We also need to look at absorption. Protein enhances the absorption of zinc whereas phytate rich foods prevent the absorption of zinc.
