            "answer_text": "As you can clearly see for yourself, by referring to this chart (https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/02/02/periodic-table-2017-nocrop.pdf) the rows of elements are referred to as a Period. The subtext of your question really is a matter of understanding why. Sooooo, I\u2019ve included a reference link leading directly to the one organization on the planet responsible for naming the elements where they also explain their procedure and they also provide references for you to research further. You can reference that page here: Periodic Table of Elements - IUPAC | International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Feel free to explore deeper by pursuing more details by using your local public library.  I received the fundamentals of my education in school but that was not enough. My real education, the superstructure, the details, the architecture, I got out of the public library. \u2022 Isaac Asimov ",

            "answer_text": "A row of elements is called a period. The atomic number increases from left to right. The period represents an energy level. The number of elements in one period is equal to the number of electrons that the energy level can hold. Period 1 has just 2 elements, Hydrogen and Helium. The first energy level can only fit 2 electrons. Period 2 has 8 elements which is the number of electrons that it takes to fill the energy level. The number of electrons in an energy level increases as it is farther away from the nucleus. This is because as the radius increases area also increases. ",
