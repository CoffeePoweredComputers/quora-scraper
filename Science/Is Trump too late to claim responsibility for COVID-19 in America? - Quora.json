            "answer_text": "This question is a little confusing. Has Trump even tried to claim such responsibility? If so, that would be a HUGE turn-around in attitude for him. I would have expected him to blame Obama for Trump being unready. I mean, Obama should have made all that documentation he left behind shredder-proof and fire-proof. Isn\u2019t that what ANY responsible President would do? Trump will NEVER claim responsibility for anything that goes wrong. If he slips on a banana peel, it will be Obama\u2019s fault. I DO hope you\u2019re not holding your breath waiting for Trump to take any responsibility. We\u2019ve lost enough people and, sadly, there will be more. ",
