As in \u201cthis piece needs to be a pufteenth longer.\u201d Also used in multiples, as in \u201cI was out by 3 pufteenths\u201d a Bee\u2019s dick \u2014 usually a bit less than a pufteenth. As in \u201cI measured the space three times and only missed getting it right by a bee\u2019s dick.\u201d cigarette paper \u2014 I think this might be an actual measurement. As in \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get a cigarette paper between them.\u201d a country mile \u2014 anywhere between about a [statute] mile and 2\u20131/2 [statute] miles. Also used as \u201cmissed by a country mile\u201d, meaning I didn\u2019t hear or see the shot so it must have missed by a country mile. feel free to use the comments to add more definitions. ",
