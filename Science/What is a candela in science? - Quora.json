            "answer_text": "Candela is the SI unit of luminous intensity. It is one of the 7 fundamental units.  One candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 \u00d7 1012 Hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian. Candela (cd) The candela is used to measure the visual intensity of light sources, like light bulbs or the bulbs in torches. It is the only SI base unit based on human perception. ",
