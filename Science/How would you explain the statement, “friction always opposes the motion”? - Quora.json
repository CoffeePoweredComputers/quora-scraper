            "answer_text": "You have to look at it from the friction\u2019s point of view. Say you are an object or gas or a liquid sitting there minding your own business. Then something comes along moving and shoves you out of the way. Friction results from the resistance a stationary object has to being moved. So the friction is always going to be opposite the motion, but that isn\u2019t the friction\u2019s fault. It is the motion causing the friction and it will always happen depending on which way the motion is going, because otherwise there would be no friction. So friction is just an unfair \u201cmotionist\u201d label on your quite natural resistance to just being shoved aside. The friction will always oppose the motion because it is the motion that is causing the friction. ",

            "answer_text": "by simple example , try running and sliding on dry concrete as compared to flat ice ,you travel further on ice because it has less friction ,likewise it is easier to attain motion in air than it is through water due to waters greater friction ,try running an engine starved of oil it will not take long to cease up to a stop , lubricants reduce friction allowing less impeded motion . However friction does not always oppose motion , sometimes it encourages quite swift motion , for example a nagging wife with a set of unfinished chores for her husband is likely to cause swift motion as hubby heads for the pub ,now friction=motion , that is the Isbester law of physics ,regards Michel .
