Always use mild soapfree cleanser for face which cleanse the face as well keep it moisturized. There are many products in market which are good . I was using cetaphil face cleanser for a long time and was happy with it as i went through so many products but some doesn't suit my skin other doesn't suit my pocket. U til one day i came across BIOBLUSH oat my god .. this heavenly cleanser is my personal favourite now I've ditched cetaphil as well coz deep in my mind i was guilty of using so many harsh chemicals ( cetaphil is nothing but made of chemicals chemicals chemicals .. not at all natural ).BIOBLUSH is available on Amazon and flipkart also check it out it is amazing ..
