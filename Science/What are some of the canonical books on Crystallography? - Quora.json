            "answer_text": "I have three favourites, which I\u2019ve found worth their weight in gold over the years: Fourth Edition (International Union of Crystallography Texts on Crystallography): Amazon.co.uk: Christopher Hammond: 9780198738688: Books (Disclaimer: my copy was given to my grandad to review, and I received it for free; I would happily have paid for it twice over. Also, it\u2019s the first edition, so I can\u2019t comment on any inaccuracies that might have crept in since.) An excellent introduction to and overview of crystallography and diffraction. I particularly like the dozens of helpful diagrams - it\u2019s the sort of subject in which a picture really can be worth a thousand words in helping you to get a concept straight in your head. Second Edition: Amazon.co.uk: Anthony Kelly, Kevin M. Knowles: 9780470750148: Books (Another disclaimer: I know/knew both Tony and Kevin. One was enormously helpful and the other a bit of a prick, but both fantastic scientists. Again, my collaborations with them have no influence on my recommendation of their book.) Arguably a little less accessible, but undoubtedly more mathematically rigorous. A good follow on from the above book, and an invaluable reference. Goes further into defects, including dislocations. Amazon.co.uk: Books Pretty much the canonical book on dislocation theory. Not really a general crystallography book, but certainly an extension of the field in the direction of dislocations. Partners well with Kelly & Knowles. I\u2019ve used - and own - several others, so do feel free to ask for more recommendations. These three - probably in the order I\u2019ve listed them - are definitely where I\u2019d start, however. ",

            "answer_text": "After reading the answers given at this point to the question, I would like to point out that crystallography can be done for various kinds of samples and forms a research discipline on its own. There are excellent introductory texts by B.D Cullity pointed out by Bruce Crawford, and Christopher Hammond, pointed by Phillip Howie. The very clear and thorough treatment of crystal symmetries by the master crystallographer from MIT, Martin Buerger Elementary crystallography Pointed by Ashish Madhavan. I would like to add some resources with regard to single crystal x-ray crystallography, from my answer to this question. What are some good resources to get started on crystallography techniques? Good luck! ",
