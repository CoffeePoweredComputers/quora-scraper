            "answer_text": "A molecule is formed from the combination of two or more atoms.Within the logic of that definition, an ionic compound like sodium chloride would be called a molecule,rightly because it is made up of one atom of sodium and chlorine, respectively.However,the concept of  bonding that separates the word 'molecule' from 'ion'.It is a little twisted but,basic chemistry tells us that all compounds are molecules, until you bring in concepts such as bonding, electronegativity,hydration energy,and so on. These factors that make the difference. A molecule of sodium chloride will be called an ion when there is a huge difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved, when sodium gives out its valence electron to chlorine, and when its crystal lattice solvates and separates into its ions on hydration(i.e.when dissolved in water).In my own point of view,the summary is that all compounds are molecules but a molecule can remain a molecule or become an ion depending on the nature of the bond.You can still do more findings on this.Just like I will do more.

            "answer_text": "A molecule is defined as \u201ca group of atoms bound together, representing the smallest fundamental unit of a chemical compound that can take part in a chemical reaction. And the definition of a compound is , \u201cA substance consisting of atoms or ions of two or more different elements in definite proportions joined by chemical bonds into a molecule. These atoms cannot be separated by physical means.\u2019 Ionic compounds are made up of molecules as well. Ionic compounds have all the characteristics of a compound. The bond that holds the atoms together in it is ionic bond; electrostatic force of attraction. Ionic compounds have 2 or more ions joined together by means of ionic bond into molecules. And the ions in an ionic compound most certainly cant be separated by physical means. Take the example of one of the most common ionic compounds, common salt , i.e, sodium chloride (NaCl). One Sodium cation and one Chloride anion bound together by a strong electrostatic force of attraction makes up a molecule of sodium chloride. And you cant separate the sodium and chloride from common salt by any normal physical methods, can you? If it were that easy salt wouldn\u2019t be as stable as it is. ",

There are two types of compounds : covalent and ionic. Ionic compounds such as NaCl don\u2019t exist as distinct molecules so we can\u2019t call them molecules .NaCl exists as crystal lattice So not all compounds are molecules . Elements such as O2 or H2 are pure substances and they are molecules as the definition says , and they are not compounds. So we can say : Not all compounds are molecules , and not all molecules are compounds. ",

There is no \u201cmolecule\u201d of ionic compounds such as, for example, NaCl, because there are no single units of the compound. Even a very very small quantity of NaCl comprises billions of Na+ and Cl-, where every cation attracts all the anions around and every anion attracts all the cations around. The bond between the cations and anions are not directed between two ions, hence there is no independent single unit or molecule of NaCl. ",
