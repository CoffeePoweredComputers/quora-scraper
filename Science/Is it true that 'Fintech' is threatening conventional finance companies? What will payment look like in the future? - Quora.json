            "answer_text": "Fintech is a tool that can be used by conventional investment dealers, but can also provide automated financial advisory services that bypass traditional dealers. Is it threatening conventional financial advisor firms? Not really, the do-it-yourself market in Canada is about 8% of the market and has been at that level for over 30 years.
