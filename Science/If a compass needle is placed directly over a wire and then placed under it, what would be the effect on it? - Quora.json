            "answer_text": "Imagine a conducting wire lying on top of the page with a current going from left to right. This current produces a magnetic field of closed field lines concentric around the wire coming out of the page above the wire and going into the page below the wire. When you put your compass above the wire, the needle will align with the magnetic field pointing out of the page, Moving the compass to below the wire the needle will flip 180 degrees and now point into the page. I don\u2019t want to begin the discussion of north and south poles, etc. Just know that the compass needle will turn 180 deg. ",
