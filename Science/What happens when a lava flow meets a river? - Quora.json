            "answer_text": "Depends on the size of the flow and the river. McPhee\u2019s Control of Nature goes over this in its first chapter for both Hawaii and Iceland (Westermann Islands). Hawaii had both Mauna Loa and Kilauea both with bombs dropped on it in WW2 to move a flow and the ocean. The Icelanders learned it took 4 cubic meters of sea water to solidify 3 cubic meters of lava or some such ratio. So if you have a small flow and a large river, the flow just turns the water to steam. If you have a big flow, it will cool and form a dam, and that will create other problems. In the Haemay (sp) case, it made a better harbor (lucked out). The medium term problem is if you create a high pressure steam in a confined space and you can get an explosive eruption which is what worries geologists at the HVO right now. Also search on things like pillow lavas. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi - That depends. It depends on how big the river is, how big the lava flow is, and how fast each is flowing. It will be a kind of contest between the colder water cooling the lava, and the extremely hot lava turning the water to steam and boiling water. The faster the water flows, the faster the lava cools - but the larger and faster the lava is arriving, the more water is flashed to steam. In the end, water always wins - but meanwhile, the lava might completely fill the river bed, block the river back turning it into a lake, and the lava may turn and fill the now-empty river bed going downstream - because lava is a liquid also, just like water it, and like water, it will run down the fastest path to lower ground and the sea (or whatever the local low place is - could be a lake). Kilauea\u2019s lava, by the way, recently completely obliterated a reasonably large freshwater lake in Hawaii. It did that by producing enough lava to completely consume (by boiling to steam) all the water in the lake, and then some. ",
