            "answer_text": "Orbitals just represent the shape of the probability density function of the electron around the atom....In a sense, it gives the shape of where the electron can be found around the atom with maximum probability... Now since actually the probability of an electron being found anywhere in space is finite (but really really small for distances far away from the center of the atom), the orbital is generally defined as containing all the points which cumulatively contain about 95% of the total probability of finding the electron.

            "answer_text": "In simple words, only some specific space regions around the nucleus can occupy the electrons, these are known as orbitals. In a deep view, they are mathematical functions that describe the behavior of electron wavefunctions around the nucleus. These are characterized by a set of quantum numbers n, l, m, and s.
