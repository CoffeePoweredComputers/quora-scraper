            "answer_text": "The consequence which would be most difficult to counteract, I expect would be that of growing up in a low-gravity environment. Low gravity would lead to low muscle mass, especially in postural muscles, understimulation of bone growth, leading to too low bone mass and possibly some other negative consequences as well. These effects could possibly be counteracted through a vigorous exercise program and regular stays in an enhanced gravity environment, similar to that of spinning-wheel space stations, but the actions taken to counteract these effects would take up a lot of time and effort in everyday life. Next, as the moon has no atmosphere, steps would have to be taken to avoid radiation. Most of the time, you would have to stay indoors, preferably underground. You would probably need to take vitamin D supplements to compensate for the lack of sunlight, or the lighting would need to include UV rays. Your inner clock would be controlled by the electric lighting cycles, quite possibly giving you a different diurnal cycle than people raised on Earth. Depending on the life support system used, your body could also have adapted to a lower pressure or oxygen content in the atmosphere (probably due to economic reasons), giving rise to a higher red blood cell count, among other things. Those are some gross phenomena which will play very noticable roles in your everyday life, and giving you a different physiology than people having been raised on Earth. The consequences of a low-gravity childhood could possibly be so severe that you would never be able to live on Earth. There are, however, lots of smaller phenomena which could come into play, depending on the nature of the base, such as* Never having been in touch with or directly exposed to any natural environment, such as wind, rain, open bodies of water, forests, grass, soil, etc. This would quite possibly make any first encounters with such environments a frightening, or at least overwhelming, experience.* Quite possibly having eaten only a very narrow selection of foods, limited by the size of the agricultural economy of the moon base.* Quite possibly having had interactions with only a very limited number of people, depending on the size of the base.* Quite possibly having a \"na\u00efve\" immune system, due to growing up in a highly controlled environment with little exposure to pathogens.These circumstances have also experienced by some people living on Earth, e.g. people with ADA-SCID, see Gene Therapy Works for 'Bubble Boy' Disease.
