            "answer_text": "You're absolutely right in concluding that reduced pressure would reduce the boiling point which leads to the vaporization of the liquid in the first place. But you're not considering the fact that the energy for vaporization would be taken up from the liquid itself, which would cause a decrease a temperature, as is the case in any evaporation phenomena. The liquid would continue evaporating until its temperature drops to a point where it becomes saturated with respect to the new reduced pressure. Now if the pressure is so low that even evaporation of the entire pool of liquid would not reduce its temperature enough to become saturated at the new pressure, then the entire liquid would get converted into vapor. Similarly, if the liquid is present in such less amount that even if evaporates completely, the drop in temperature does not bring it to the saturation temperature, it would vaporize completely.

            "answer_text": "Flash vaporisation occurs because at the reduced pressure the boiling point of the liquid becomes equal to or less than that of its actual temperature.  For the vapors to form, latent heat is required, which is extracted from the remaining liquid. So subsequently the temperature of the liquid falls below its boiling point at that pressure. That is the reason why  the entire liquid doesn't evaporate. ",
