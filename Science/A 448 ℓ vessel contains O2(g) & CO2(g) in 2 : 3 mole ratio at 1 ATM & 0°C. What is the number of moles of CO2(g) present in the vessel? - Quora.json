            "answer_text": "Remember one thing that let how many different gases be there in the container , each gas will occupy the total volume of the container. So, PV = nRT. For O2: P1\u00d7 448 = n1 \u00d7 R\u00d7 273K. For CO2: P2 \u00d7 448 = n2 \u00d7 R \u00d7 273K. So dividing both equations. P1 / P2 = 2 / 3 ( from question ). 3P1 = 2P2. But P1 + P2 = 1. 5P1 / 2 = 1 . P1 = 2/5 atm. P2 = 3/ 5 atm. R is 0.082 in this case. So, substituting P2 in equation 2 we get: On calculation we get n2 to be 12.007 moles. Therefore , the number of CO2 moles present in the vessel is 12( answer). Hope you understood!! Thank you. ",
