            "answer_text": "The big bang theory was created by a priest. Obviously chosing his version of how god created the universe. But where did god come from? It is more believable that the universe created god. And later us. I believe god and us are all made from the vacume energy in various concentrations born from the existanof nothing but vacume energy. I wonder sometimes if saten was sent to earth by God to bread the single cell animals that was here into then intelligent life we are today. And then saten then realized hay. I did it. And hay these humans can do anything one day. Even travel into space. Can i use these creatures as vesals to escape god and be my own god. Just a thought. ",
