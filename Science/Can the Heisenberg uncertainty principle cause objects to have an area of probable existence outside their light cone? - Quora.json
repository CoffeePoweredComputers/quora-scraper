            "answer_text": "An excellent question, as this issue is indeed one of the rationales in favor of quantum field theory. Ordinary quantum mechanics does not know about relativity theory, so it certainly can violate relativistic causality and all that. No surprise there. But what about relativistic quantum mechanics? The theory of course had considerable success; it was, among other things, the first theory that predicted the existence of antimatter. As the name suggests, it is a relativistic theory, so we might expect it to obey causality. But it does not. Precisely because of the uncertainty principle, acausal behavior can \u201cleak\u201d in from outside the light cone. But quantum field theory is different. In the case of quantum field theory, things outside the light cone are canceled out exactly. There is no residual probability. No exponentially diminishing but nonzero chance of the future influencing the past or an influence to propagate faster than light. And the best part? This perfect cancellation of acausality is retained even when we do quantum field theory on the curved spacetime background of general relativity. This, along with its ability to account for particle creation and annihilation, are the two main reasons why quantum field theory remains the preferred theory of matter, even though many suspect that it, too, will ultimately be superseded by something better, as it fails to account for gravitation and may break down completely at or near the Planck energy scale.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is no and then no-ish. No: In quantum field theory you can use Feynman diagrams to represent processes. Vertices represent where particles interact and are created or destroyed. Vertices are connected by lines, called propagators; no propagators can connect outside the light cones formed by their endpoints or vertices. Viewed in this way, no particle has any influence outside its might cone; no faster than light influences, even probabilistically. No-ish: the vertices don't quite represent position because \u201cposition\u201d is not a Lorentz invariant quantity - you have to include time as well. How significant this quibble is, I'm not sure. No one else seems to worry about it\u2026.   l ",

Who would have thunk that. Physicists Mash Quantum and Gravity and Find Time, but Not as We Know It | Lab Manager Place one of those two events on the light cone, and since the super-position allows the other event to occur both before it and also after it, if both events occur in the same place you now have an event which when it occurs before the event on the light cone, must lie outside it, because there is no longer time for that signal to get to you at the speed of light.
