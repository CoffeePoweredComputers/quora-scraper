            "answer_text": "Amateur here! I should probably tell you that my sudden interest towards String Theory landed me here. So here\u2019s a very simplified form of explanation. String theory proposes that the fundamental constituents of the universe are one-dimensional \u201cstrings\u201d rather than point-like particles. What we perceive as particles are actually vibrations in loops of string, each with its own characteristic frequency.  Vibrating Strings are assumed to be something like this:  Strings vibrate in different patterns to produce different particles making the world around us. Here\u2019s the catch: This does not work in a universe that just has 3 or 4 or 5 dimensions of space, rather it requires a universe of 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time. When we talk about extra dimensions, they are imagined to have a very rich, intertwined geometry. Something like this:  And the idea is that, if this is what the extra dimension would look like, the microscopic landscape of our universe would look like this on the tiniest of scales. Can we test these Extra Dimensions? In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, a machine called Large Hadron Collider is built that accelerates the particles around a tunnel opposite in direction, near the speed of light.  Every so often the particles are aimed at each other, so there is a head on collision. If the collision has enough energy to eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimension, forcing it to enter other dimensions. If, The measure of the amount of energy after collision < The measure of the energy before collision, then it is evident that the energy drifted away is responsible for the extra dimensions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- All the above information were from Brian Greene\u2019s TED talk, which I just recently saw. For a more brief understanding, do watch it fully. He\u2019s brilliant.  P.S. Thank you, Sheldon! Bazingaa! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the goals of Physics is to find a single theory that unites all of the four forces of nature. These are; electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. The first two are familiar. Electromagnetism is the force that holds a fridge magnet to a refrigerator while gravity is trying to pull it off towards the earth. The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding the central part of atoms (their nuclei) together, while the weak nuclear force is involved in the decay of these nuclei. In the attempt to tie all the four forces together a lot of interesting ideas and new theories have been proposed. One of the most promising of these new theories is string theory. In attempting to unite gravity with the three other forces, string theory requires us to change the way we view the universe. According to the theory all particles are actually tiny vibrating strings and each type of vibration corresponds to a different particle. The different particles are like the different notes that can be played by bowing a violin string. However, the strings of string theory almost certainly would not look like violin strings. String theory also requires us to accept the existence of extra dimensions in the universe. We are familiar with the four usual dimensions: up-down, forwards-backwards, left-right and time, but string theory requires seven more dimensions!A universe of eleven dimensions seems strange to us but many physicists think these extra dimensions are possible and are looking for ways to detect them.
