            "answer_text": "No. Hydrogen and oxygen are both separate elements. An element is the most basic unit in chemistry that retains specific chemical properties. Elements are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. Let\u2019s have a look. Hydrogen is a very simple atom. It has one proton and one electron normally and typically no neutrons. Thus, it looks like this:  [1] Built using. The proton is at the center, while the electron is farther out. Oxygen on the other hand, looks like this:  It has eight protons, eight neutrons and eight electrons (neutrons are white). These elements are independent. It is only through special reactions that they form water. These reactions are generally guided by a desire to have a full electron shell. The rule is often called the octet rule. All shells, except the first, require eight electrons to be stable. The first requires two, as observed above. Hope this helps! Footnotes[1] \u202aBuild an Atom\u202c",

In order for Hydrogen and Oxygen to chemically combine, some spark or energy source must be present. Then water can form. ",
