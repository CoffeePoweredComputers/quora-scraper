            "answer_text": "There\u2019s other fantastic answers here, but - with respect to the other Quorans posting here - I don\u2019t think they go far enough, or stridently enough. So at the risk of stretching some readers\u2019 BN,BR conceptions, I\u2019m going to try and offer a more \u2018full-throated\u2019 answer \u2026 First, I want to put a descriptive qualification down: I\u2019m going to include the concepts of statistical analysis, and its derivative, risk analysis (aka probability + cost), plus some extremely basic economics, in the family of \u2018science\u2019 in this answer. (I think it would be more accurate to use \u2018reason\u2019 or \u2018logic\u2019 as terms, but we\u2019ll stick with \u2018science\u2019.) Second, I\u2019m going to group Americans into two monstrously, unfairly simple generalizations - Conservative (the term OP used) & Liberals - and then make wild generalizations about these groups. This is totally unfair; Americans, even among and within these groups, are wildly diverse & \u2018a-la-carte\u2019 with their views \u2026 but I\u2019m going to generalize regardless! OK, let\u2019s see who\u2019s actually (ALSO) denying science in America: Genetically Modified Organisms (aka GMOs) \u2026 So who\u2019s usually against these? The farmers, on the Prairies, who are overwhelmingly Conservative, and who are actually dealing with real crops? Or the Liberal Hipsters in Cali and NY, who \u2018know\u2019 that kale gets born in supermarkets? I know exactly zero farmers who are systematically against GMOs; they all know selective breeding\u2019s been going on forever. Mention GMOs to some Liberals and you\u2019d think it was an alien invasion. And what \u2018science\u2019 is there against GMOs? Almost zero. And what benefits? Countless millions saved from more and better food, less pesticides, irrigation, etc, etc. Next time you hear a Liberal wax on about GMOs know that they are directly advocating for the death of millions of their fellow humans.The Anti-Vaccination Crowd \u2026 So how are these people voting? Where is Anti-Vaxx \u2018a thing\u2019? Mostly in CA, WA and among affluent coastal suburbs - meaning with Liberals. Again, the science here is essentially ironclad: The harm caused, to an infinitesimally small number of recipients, is directly contrasted with the actual children who die of preventable and curable diseases every year. The Press loves promoting a certain blonde HS dropout, who was briefly a third-rate TV personality, about how she \u201cfeels\u201d vaccines are linked to her son\u2019s (tragic) development problems. BUT do you ever hear the Press interview the mother of the child who actually died from whooping cough? The Anti-Vaxx\u2019ers are usually Liberals, and again have much to answer for, since their junk idea is actually killing their fellow Americans, sometimes even their own kids.Homeopathy & Aromatherapy \u2026 Sorry to tell you, but: these service provider\u2019s clienteles are not well attended by Conservatives. It\u2019s the Liberals who are spending their weekends doing \u201ca cleanse\u201d on the misbegotten idea that there\u2019s somehow \u201ctoxins\u201d secretly hiding in their body, and the solution to this perceived problem all rests with a blender and a toilet. There\u2019s been exactly zero scientific studies showing that spending your whole weekend in the bathroom is any better than a placebo. Likewise, having \u201cnice smells\u201d around you has cured exactly nothing! The whole concept of \u201csmells heal (and hurt)\u201d is hilarious, since that idea was at the cutting edge of science \u2026 in the Middle Ages!; since the Enlightenment, not so much. Liberals: reason more, so you can $hit less!Oil pipelines \u2026 Again, who exactly is promoting these? Conservatives. Why? Because they\u2019re safer! Announce a \u2018site plan\u2019 for an oil pipeline and watch every Liberal for hundreds of miles go nuts. Sure there\u2019s lots of basic NIMBYism going on here, but many Liberals are systematically, irretrievably against pipelines, always and everywhere \u2014- because you know: transporting the stuff by rail is only MANY TIMES riskier. Plus, while the Liberals are essentially advocating for much-more-dangerous transportation options, Daryl Hannah might show up and address the crowd! \u2026 direct from her jet plane \u2026 \u2018powered by 100% organic kale\u2019? [Also, don\u2019t like our carbon footprint? Well then, listen to the Liberals advocate for the government making \u2018other people\u2019 use less gasoline! After which they all drive home to their McMansions in the Suburbs.]Nuclear Power \u2026 Liberal: \u201cWe need a cleaner future, less reliant on fossil fuels!\u201d Conservative: \u201cOK, let\u2019s build some reactors; they\u2019re clean and provide lots of cheap power for generations.\u201d Liberal: \u201c#%$^&*!!! Never!!!\u201d Conservative: \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d Liberal: \u201cI\u2019m an environmental organizer!\u201d Conservative: \u201cWhere\u2019d the electricity for your LapTop come from?\u201d Liberal: <silence>\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Nuff Said.TLDR: Sorry, the Conservatives don\u2019t have a monopoly on \u2018science denial\u2019, not by a long shot!! Liberals have their own things going in this sphere too.  I\u2019d also like to add an aside, as an atheist, and in defense of SOME conservatives: It seems to me that the vast number of \u2018science deniers\u2019 among Conservatives in the US flow from the Religious, who tend to electorally herd with Conservatives. I would argue that these people are \u2018science deniers\u2019 not because they are conservative, but because they are religious. Some think that \u2018Science\u2019 and \u2018Faith\u2019 are separate, unlinked matters. I totally disagree! I think Science and Faith are incompatible, irreconcilable and antithetical ideas. And because they are, wherever science advances, faith must retreat. Religious Faith belongs to the ancient, ignorant, infantile part of our collective history, when we simply didn\u2019t know better; Science, through its methodology, and by repeated proofs and verifiable evidence, offers the prospect of actual advancement of human knowledge. Consequently, the Religious view science - rightly! - as a direct threat to, and assault upon, their Faithful beliefs! And from there it\u2019s only a short, all-too-human step into science denial. The \u2018deniers\u2019 aren\u2019t Conservatives, as you assert; but instead are the Religious, who are threatened by science itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. First, some clarification. US conservatives are most definitely not the only group in the world to engage in science denial. Try peddling evolution to a fundamentalist Muslim. Nor are they the only group in the United States. Try convincing a crystal-wearing new ager that vaccines are safe. Still, the US conservatives are a troubling case for a number of reasons. Unlike anti-vaxers, they actually have a huge impact on public policy. Global environmental issues? They think it\u2019s all a hoax. Or at least they say they do. Why? Because of their proclivities in a couple of areas. First, they\u2019re pro-business. Whatever makes Exxon happy is what they\u2019re for. And they can rely on well-funded reelection campaigns as a result. There\u2019s simply no money in environmentalism. And money is what makes Washington go-round. Second, they never get tired of hippie punching. If those granola-eating pot smokers are for it, we\u2019re against it. Third, solving this kind of problem will require international cooperation. They don\u2019t like this. America goes it alone, listens to no one, and never does anything outside of its own narrow interests. That\u2019s how they prefer it. There are other issues where they can get weird. Like when you show them the science behind making free, high quality contraception available. Unwanted pregnancies drop precipitiously. And so does abortion. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be all over it, passing the collection plate in church to fund such programs in their towns and cities. But no. Not interested in the slightest. This case is a little different. They\u2019re not actually interested in abortions or fetuses or \u201clife.\u201d If they were, they\u2019d be onboard. When you ask them why they are not, they say things like \u201cit sends the wrong message\u201d and \u201cactions should have consequences.\u201d What that means is that they\u2019re more interested in policing the sexuality of young women than they are in \u201cbabies\u201d or whatever they\u2019re on about. Totally disingenuous about what they want and care about. Which is why the science of the issue isn\u2019t relevant to them. The science doesn\u2019t show how to more effectively slut-shame. It shows how to prevent abortions. So they\u2019re not interested. ",
