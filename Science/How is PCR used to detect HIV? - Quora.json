            "answer_text": "How is PCR used to detect HIV? Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are used to detect HIV's genetic material, called RNA. PCR amplifies the signal severa thousand folds making it very sensitive and very accurate. Although PCR tests are the most accurate, they are not performed as often as the other HIV tests because they are expensive and also time- and labor-intensive. PCR tests can be used to screen the donated blood supply and to detect very early infections before antibodies have been developed. This test may be performed just days or weeks after exposure to HIV. HIV PCR is particularly useful in testing infants of HIV-positive mothers; these infants may carry maternal antibody to 15 months of age rendering antibody testing a baby inconclusive. HIV PCR is also useful when testing patients who are agammaglobulinemic or in rare cases where patients appear to have symptoms of advanced HIV infection but do not demonstrate HIV-specific antibodies. Apsrt from diagnostic HIV testing, laboratories may also offer quantitative PCR (RNA) testing (viral load), which is used to help determine the initiation of drug therapy and monitor the effectiveness of therapy. HIV genotyping is a newer addition to patient management and is used to assist in tracking the development of drug resistance and guide the modification of antiretroviral drug selection. ",
