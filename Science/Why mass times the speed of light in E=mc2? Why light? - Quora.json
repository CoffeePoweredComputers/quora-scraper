            "answer_text": "[math]E = mc^2[/math] comes from simple physics. This derivation is brief, giving only the essential details. 1. We assume that the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant (which we call c), because no one has ever found an exception to that axiom. 2. Define [math]\\beta = v/c[/math], where [math]v[/math] is the speed of the object in question. Note that [math]v = c\\beta[/math]. 3. Here is the one new quantity that we need here: proper speed [math]v_{proper}/c =\\operatorname{arctanh}(\\beta) [/math] 4. We also need [math]\\gamma = 1/sqrt(1-\\beta^2)= \\operatorname{cosh}(v_{proper}/c)[/math]  5. It is well known (and easy to show) that, in Special Relativity, momentum p is [math]p = m_{rest} c \\beta \\gamma[/math], which becomes [math]p = m_{rest} c \\operatorname{tanh}(v_{proper}/c) \\operatorname{cosh}(v_{proper}/c)  = m_{rest} c \\operatorname{sinh}(v_{proper}/c) [/math]  6. Now we apply simple Lagrangian dynamics formulation: total mass = the derivative of momentum with respect to speed [math]v_{proper}[/math]: [math] m_{total} = dp/dv_{proper} = m_{rest} \\operatorname{cosh}(v_{proper}/c)[/math] Total energy = the integral of momentum with respect to speed [math]v_{proper}[/math], giving: [math]E_{total} = m_{rest} c^2 \\operatorname{cosh}(v_{proper}/c) [/math] from which we immediately get Einstein's famous equation: [math]E_{total} = m_{total} c^2[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "It has to do with the Einstein's postulate of Relativity which says that the SPEED of the light in vacuum is the upmost limit of the motion for anything which carries energy and or information. This postulate has its genesis in the Maxwell and Lorentz mathematical description of the electric and magnetic phenomena, including the visible light. That is why [math]c[/math] is the SPEED of light (in vacuum) in the equation [math]E=m_0 c^2[/math] in which [math]E[/math] is the rest energy and [math]m_0[/math] is the (inertial) rest mass of a particle. In this context [math]c[/math] is a absolute physical constant. The postulate and the equation is confirmed by all kind of experiments and observations we got so far. If the particle is observed with a relative speed [math]v[/math] its energy is given by [math]m c^2 [/math] and some authors set [math]m=\\gamma m_0[/math] in which [math]\\gamma[/math] is the Lorentz factor [math]\\gamma=1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}[/math].
