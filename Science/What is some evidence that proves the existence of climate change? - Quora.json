Is the evidence for global warming increasing, decreasing, or staying the same?Do we have conclusive evidence that humans are the root cause of climate change?What percentage of climate change is human caused?For people who are not convinced that climate change is caused by human activity, what evidence would you need to see to convince you it is occurring?Here\u2019s some evidence that the planet is changing:[1]  Here\u2019s a video showing thermometer readings 1850\u20132013:[2]  Here's where things were headed before fossil fuels:[3]  This NASA[4]/Bloomberg[5] animation does a great job of ruling out everything that is natural, leaving only the man made portion as the cause: What's Really Warming the World?  Some will try to say that correlation doesn't mean causation. But the lack of correlation sure can rule out theoretical causes.[6] And using computer regression analysis, we can see how much of the warming is explained by the analysis and how much is left unknown (called by mathematicians the residual). This independent research did a great job of that: A New Estimate of the Average Earth Surface Land Temperature Spanning 1753 to 2011 the entire change can be modeled by a sum of volcanism and a single anthropogenic proxy.[7] And here is a graph[8] to show what they are saying, volcanoes make it briefly cooler, man made greenhouse gases make the globe warmer:  Neil deGrasse Tyson reminds us that man made climate change is an emergent truth.

            "answer_text": "A2A: Tell them its basic physics which follows the same principles as other laws of nature. The two stone cold facts:CO2 happens to have a special feature naturally. It absorbs heat radiation very effectively. It has to do with the vibratory and rotational properties of the molecule itself. The structure of their molecules makes them especially effective at absorbing heat radiation while the major atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are essentially transparent to it. We can easily measure their properties in laboratories, and derive them from quantum physics. This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2 an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2 molecules can vibrate in ways that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2 molecules to capture the IR photons.\u201dThe carbon in the atmospheric CO2 contains information about its source, so that scientists can tell that fossil fuel emissions comprise the largest source of the increase since the pre-industrial era. The carbon from burning fossil fuels have a different isotope signal (radioactivity) than C02 coming from natural sources. Its like a fingerprint. It\u2019s like DNA proof in a murder investigation.That\u2019s just how it is. Nature made that happen. That\u2019s what basic physics tells us. Tell them the greenhouse effect itself is as established a phenomenon as any: it was discovered in the 1820s and the basic physics was essentially understood by the 1950s.

It absorbs heat radiation very effectively. It has to do with the vibratory and rotational properties of the molecule itself. The structure of their molecules makes them especially effective at absorbing heat radiation while the major atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are essentially transparent to it. We can easily measure their properties in laboratories, and derive them from quantum physics. This have been known since 1859. John Tyndall's experiments also showed that molecules of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone are the best absorbers of heat radiation, and that even in small quantities, these gases absorb much more strongly than the atmosphere itself. That\u2019s just how it is. Nature made that happen. That\u2019s what basic physics tells us. Iain Stewart demonstrates a simple experiment that shows that carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation. Scene from BBC's 'Earth: The Climate Wars' documentary:  2. Anyone can take out their spectroscopes and see with their own eyes C02 traps heat that would otherwise escape into space. Spectroscopy is a method of detecting elements by looking at how electromagnetic radiation passes through them. Different elements have electrons in orbits at varying energy levels, and this affects the way they resonate. It's the reason why neon lights produce different colors depending on what gases we fill them with. It's also the way we're able to tell what proportions of hydrogen, helium, and other elements are in distant stars: the spectrum of light coming from them has peaks and valleys that are chemical fingerprints of exactly what gases are in them.  \u201cThe Earth's surface is warmed by the sun, and as a warm globe in space, the Earth itself emits that same heat right back out, as infrared radiation. If we go outside and point a spectrometer at the sky, we can see there are peaks and valleys in the infrared spectrum. Some wavelengths of heat fly right out into space unhindered, while other wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere, and that heat stays there, where we're able to detect its wavelength with our spectrometer. And exactly the same way as we're able to identify the elements in a distant star, we're able to identify exactly which greenhouse gases are trapping the Earth's radiative heat. This is how we were able to identify those five main gases. And this isn't new; we've understood this for 200 years. It's a direct measurement that anyone with a spectrometer can reproduce. Not a model, not a prediction, not a guess.\u201d \u201cWater vapor, which is the most prominent, defines the basic shape of the greenhouse spectrum. Most of the infrared radiation that escapes the Earth goes through a window left open by water vapor, which we call the infrared window. This window in the spectrum, which is pretty wide, is centered around a wavelength of about 10 \u00b5m (micrometers). At higher and lower wavelengths, water vapor absorbs much of the Earth's radiated heat, so the Earth has always relied on this open window in the spectrum to allow the excess heat to escape. One end of the infrared window is overlapped by CO2's absorption range, which is centered around 15 \u00b5m. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere acts like a sliding door which widens or narrows the infrared window. As CO2 increases, the infrared window is narrowed, less radiation escapes into space, and more heat is absorbed by the atmosphere. At the other end of the infrared window, around 7.5 \u00b5m, methane has a similar effect, contributing about 1/4 as much warming as CO2.\u201d  \u201cSpectroscopy is hard science. We don't have to model or predict. Simply by pointing our instruments at the sky, we can, right now, directly observe and identify the greenhouse gases, and measure exactly how much radiative energy the atmosphere is absorbing and keeping here on Earth. This direct, non-ambiguous spectroscopic reading is the \"smoking gun\" that proves the excess heat energy being trapped in our atmosphere is due to CO2.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cWithin that infrared window defined by water vapor, there is one big spike. It is the 15 \u00b5m range of CO2. This is explicit, unambiguous proof that the increased heat in our atmosphere is due to CO2. It has nothing to do with models or predictions; it is a direct observation, it is hard chemistry and basic physics, not guesswork or extrapolation.\u201d \u201cAs we burn fossil fuels, the CO2 in the atmosphere increases, the infrared window narrows, less heat radiates away from the Earth, and more heat goes into the Earth's system. These are simple, solid facts.Energy being trapped in the atmosphere corresponds exactly to the wavelengths of energy captured by CO2.\u201d  https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/100737.pdf The Simple Proof of Man-Made Global Warming  Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources 3. HOW DO WE KNOW ITS OUR CO2 CAUSING THE WARMING? Here\u2019s how scientists know. The carbon in the atmospheric CO2 contains information about its source, so that scientists can tell that fossil fuel emissions comprise the largest source of the increase since the pre-industrial era.The carbon from burning fossil fuels have a different isotope signal (radioactivity) than C02 coming from natural sources. Its like a fingerprint. Its the carbons \"DNA\". Its unique. \u201cWe can carbon date the CO2 in the atmosphere, and tell exactly how much of it comes from humans burning fossil fuels. It's a direct measurement. It leaves no room for interpretation\u201d. \u201cThe same elements (i.e. same number of protons in the nucleus) with different mass numbers (arising from the different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus) are called isotopes. Each carbon molecule has six protons in the nucleus, but there are many different isotopes with varying numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. Carbon isotopes from different sources are \u201clighter\u201d (high negative value) or heavier (lower negative value). For example, carbon from ocean is the standard with a value of \u201c0\u201d while carbon from fossil fuels ranges from -20 to -32. While atmospheric carbon has an average value of -5 to -9, it is becoming \u201clighter\u201d over time as carbon from fossil fuels become more abundant in the atmosphere.\u201d How do we know that recent CO2 increases are due to human activities?  The Suess Effect is a term which has come to signify the decrease in 14C in atmospheric CO2 owing to admixture of CO2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. This term is here extended, as a concept, to the shifts in isotopic ratio of both 13C and 14C in any reservoir of the carbon cycle owing to anthropogenic activities. The Suess effect: 13Carbon-14Carbon interrelations Changes in the 13C/12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 are also caused by other sources and sinks, but the changing isotopic signal due to CO2 from fossil fuel combustion can be resolved from the other components (Francey et al., 1995). http://bluemoon.ucsd.edu/publications/ralph/25_Partition.pdf Additional confirmation that rising CO2 levels are due to human activity comes from examining the ratio of carbon isotopes found in the atmosphere. Carbon 12 has 6 neutrons, carbon 13 has 7 neutrons. Plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than in the atmosphere. If rising atmospheric CO2 comes from fossil fuels, the C13/C12 should be falling. Indeed this is what is occurring (Ghosh 2003). The C13/C12 ratio correlates with the trend in global emissions. http://www.bgc.mpg.de/service/iso_gas_lab/publications/PG_WB_IJMS.pdf Roger Fjellstad Olsen's answer to What are the causes of climate change? BONUS: C02 IS A FORCING AND WATER VAPOUR IS A FEEDBACK. There are non condensable gases and there are water vapour which rains out. Note that perturbations in atmospheric water vapour content equalize over a 9-day period, and that, as a condensable GHG, water vapor can not act as a forcing to temperature. \"As the largest contributor to the natural greenhouse effect, water vapor plays an essential role in the Earth\u2019s climate. However, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled mostly by air temperature, rather than by emissions. For that reason, scientists consider it a feedback agent, rather than a forcing to climate change. Water vapor behaves differently from CO2 in one fundamental way: it can condense and precipitate. When air with high humidity cools, some of the vapor condenses into water droplets or ice particles and precipitates. The typical residence time of water vapor in the atmosphere is ten days. The flux of water vapor into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources is considerably less than from \u2018natural\u2019 evaporation. Therefore, it has a negligible impact on overall concentrations, and does not contribute significantly to the long-term greenhouse effect. This is the main reason why tropospheric water vapor (typically below 10 km altitude) is not considered to be an anthropogenic gas contributing to radiative forcing. Currently, water vapor has the largest greenhouse effect in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, other greenhouse gases, primarily CO2, are necessary to sustain the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere. Indeed, if these other gases were removed from the atmosphere, its temperature would drop sufficiently to induce a decrease of water vapor, leading to a runaway drop of the greenhouse effect that would plunge the Earth into a frozen state. So greenhouse gases other than water vapor provide the temperature structure that sustains current levels of atmospheric water vapor. Therefore, although CO2 is the main anthropogenic control knob on climate, water vapor is a strong and fast feedback that amplifies any initial forcing by a typical factor between two and three. Water vapor is not a significant initial forcing, but is nevertheless a fundamental agent of climate change.\"  https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessme... http://www.climatechange2013.org/.../WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf Roger Fjellstad Olsen's answer to How long have we known about the greenhouse effect?

            "answer_text": "As stated elsewhere, there are multiple lines of evidence. There is the fact that countless laboratory experiments have shown that CO2 and some other gases (like methane) absorb the frequencies of infrared radiation that the Earth radiates and would normally escape into space. These laboratory experiments show that when the gases absorb this radiation, they heat up. There is the fact that after peaking after the end of the last ice age, the world had started slowly cooling again at a rate of about 0.1 C (0.18 F) for the last 7,000 years. Then, suddenly, just as humans started burning massive amounts of fossil fuels, the temperature started to skyrocket and has risen 1.15 C (2.07 F). Here is a graph.  Notice the unprecedented increase in temperature in red at the extreme right of the graph. It is important to note that the natural forces that had been causing the cooling (such as the position of the Earth in its orbit) were still active. By all rights, the world should have continued cooling. Only the sudden increase in CO2 and other greenhouse gases can explain the sudden increase. There is the fact that studies of past events show that when some natural force (like a super volcano) released a massive amount of CO2 into the air, the world warmed up. ",

You realize that the number of bodies has been growing steadily since the cemetery was founded in the 18th century.

The largest man-made explosion was <0.0001% of a modest volcano, and is only known by those who heard of the Soviet Union\u2019s 100 megaton experiment in about 1961Tsar Bomba - Wikipedia. The largest pollution in the US was the near eutrophication of Lake Erie, but Erie has largely recovered.Lake Erie United - Walleye, Bass, Perch Fishing Forum Every dam built has been acclaimed a disaster by one or another environmental group, but they turn out to be fine. Look up Aswan, Grand Coulee\u2026 Perhaps the largest ecological disaster with lasting effects is the result of blocking rivers to the Aral Sea. That was man-made, and a climate did change, a local climate as all climates are, and afaik it had no global effects. The Gobi Desert has remained a desert, as has Atacama (Peru). The Costa Rican rainforest is still a rainforest, as is that of Hawaii, and the no. CA/OR/WA/CD temperate rainforest got that way some 8\u201310,000 yo, and remains (oddly, about the same time that the Sahara dried up See Nubian subarticle). The climate of OK and other plains states got nasty in the 1930s without human help, and has now recovered. The list of short-term changes has never summed to anything global, or within thousands of years been fundamentally changed, or at any time been demonstrably changed by human activity. Some point at the Brazilian rainforest as potentially being changed, but the suspicion of its significance is just that. Many climates, but no such thing as a global climate. So the first element of the question has to be debunked almost as fast as the second, since we have no evidence of global climate change even related to Man\u2019s efforts, much less caused by them (as is inherent in OP\u2019s formulation/phrasing of the question).

            "answer_text": "This all depends on what you mean with climate change, as the global mean temperatures have been varying for the past 4.5 billion years. We are now living in what is called the Holocene interglacial warm period that is taken to have started 11,700 years ago. Interglacials provide relief from the much colder ice ages for about 15,000 years, before the cold returns and lowers sea levels by as much as 125 metres and dries out continents by storing huge quantities of snow and ice at the poles. The Holocene has been cooling cyclically for the last 6,000-8,000 years and is continuing to do so from solar system cycles ranging from about 20, 60, and almost 180 years to 973 years and more. This confirms that climates don\u2019t just change seasonally but at longer time scales too. These plots (own work) of the zonal NASA GLOTI temperatures show that they change all the time, even at frequencies of less than 20 years. To show the variations and roughly match their latitudes the traces are all on the same vertical scale and were vertically separated by incrementing them by \u00b10.5 oC. The global means and their 5-year mean were plotted about the zero line at the same vertical scale too.  The gradual increase in temperatures after 1960 corresponds to the rise in CO2 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, that has been added artificially as part of the model. The reason why we now that they are artificial, is that they show the same level of increase which is impossible as sunshine changes with latitude. The amplitude variations are the greatest at the poles and least near the equator where most human beings live. The plot below shows the same data with a -0.01 correction applied from 1959 onwards.

            "answer_text": "Hii yash , recently NASA has given an conclusive proof of global warming caused by humans. The US space agency said it had \"chilled the sceptics\u201d after one of its scientific studies found long-term planetary warming will only happen if external drivers such as greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. Its findings came as NASA was criticised for now appearing to be more concerned with research into climate change than getting into space and understanding the universe. Commentators say the new NASA budget released by US president Barack Obama this week is focused on climate change research rather than its main mission of space exploration. The results of a NASA/Duke University study released this week \"provides new evidence that natural cycles alone aren't sufficient to explain the global atmospheric warming observed over the last century,\" according to a NASA spokesman. It is said the study shows, in detail, the reason why global temperatures remain stable in the long run unless they are pushed by outside forces, such as increased greenhouse gases due to humans. The spokesman said: \"Scientists have long known that as Earth warms, it is able to restore its temperature equilibrium through a phenomenon known as the Planck Response. \u201cThe phenomenon is an overall increase in infrared energy that Earth emits as it warms. The response acts as a safety valve of sorts, allowing more of the accumulating heat to be released through the top of Earth's atmosphere into space. \"The new research, however, shows it\u2019s not quite as simple as that.\" Lead author Patrick Brown, a doctoral student at Duke\u2019s Nicholas School of the Environment, said: \"This study underscores that large, sustained changes in global temperature like those observed over the last century require drivers such as increased greenhouse gas concentrations.

Ocean Rise: We are already seeing the effects of ocean rise, mainly in the Pacific ocean. In the Pacific ocean there are islands that lay within a foot or less of sea level, so they feel the effect quicker then most other places. The Nation of Kiribati announced plans of evacuation 3 years ago, I am not sure where they are now but im sure they are still moving on with the evacuation plans. (Rising sea levels force Pacific islanders to evacuate) Glacial melt. A guy on youtube made an excellent presentation on this, summed up it states that a glacier in  France has receded 5X more in the last 25 years then it had in the previous 125 years.   Weather pattern changes/ Extreme weather: 9 of the 10 strongest hurricanes on record have happened in the last 50 years. 6 of 10 in the last 20. Strongest Hurricanes: 10 Most Intense Atlantic Hurricanes on Record Add to that the droughts hitting California and the floods in the south and east of USA (sorry for not having an international list, google was being unhelpful) and you get a pretty grim picture. That says nothing of what is predicted to happen to the Great Plains in the next century. And this is just what has taken place so far. With humanity seemingly unwilling to alter course and attempt to co-exist with our planet, combined with the snowball nature of climate change, we will likely see enormous changes take place over the next century unless Humanity as a whole takes massive steps to reverse course.

The polar ice caps are as large as ever, though more on the south pole (and nobody knows why \u2014 because climate models don\u2019t work). The problem with greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels is that the major one has been neglected. CO2, which has no historical correlation to the earth\u2019s temperature, is fawned over. But its only 30% of TGHG. The important one is water. Steam. Its 70% of GHG. And what does water vapour do? It makes clouds. What do clouds do? They reflect the sun\u2019s heat away from the earth. That\u2019s why every breathing human knows that it is cooler on a cloudy day than on a sunny day. But clouds are way too complicated for computers to model. The water could simply fall as more rain. Or it could blanket the entire planet with fluffy, white sun-blockers. We don\u2019t know. We won\u2019t know. However, there is a very large risk that the main GHG, water, may result in man-made global cooling. Stay tuned. You will only know by experiencing it.

They can measure the average global temperature with rigourous precision. There\u2019s no question that the Earth\u2019s temperature is rising. In fact, all five of the hottest years on record have taken place since 2015. Even with the pandemic, 2020 is trending to become the hottest year ever recorded. We also know for certain that the rise in temperature is caused by human activity. The temperature in the lower atmosphere is warming. At the same time, the temperature in the upper atmosphere is cooling. If the warming was due to changes in the Sun or some other factor beyond Earth, the opposite would be true. We\u2019ve understood the greenhouse effect since the 19th century. There are news articles from that era predicting that the use of coal and petroleum would lead to global warming within a century. The increase in greenhouse gas levels, especially C02, correlates extremely closely with the increase in temperature. Of course, correlation is not causation but the isotopes of carbon we find in the atmosphere have a \u201cfingerprint\u201d that links them with industrial, rather than natural processes. We also know that these temperature rises are a serious threat. The expert consensus is that we need need to keep the increase below 2\u02daC and preferably below 1.5\u02daC. Even then, hundreds of millions of people are going to face floods in some places and drought in others. Coral reefs will be bleached away and we\u2019ll have coastal damage from storms. More people will die in the floods and droughts along with the heat waves. It will be a massive problem but managable. If we let things go past 2\u02daC, the coral reefs will die off entirely. We\u2019ll lose about 30% to 40% of global species. The floods, droughts and heat waves will be far worse and we\u2019ll see even higher death tolls.

            "answer_text": "[1]To do this is inspired by the principle\u2014which is quite true within itself\u2014that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. [2]The primary rules are: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one item at a time and blame it for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it. Never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political whirlwind.

            "answer_text": "Very few people deny the climate changes-. It obviously does, or you would be under a mile of glacial ice right now. The debate questions are- is it natural or anthropogenic? Is it harmful or will species adapt ( as they have in the past)? If harmful, can it be stopped without billions of people dying (stopping the use of fossil fuels would kill you. If you're reading this you live a western lifestyle. How long would you live without running water, food, sewer, heating? To say nothing of almost all your clothes are fossil fuel based. And fossil fuels are allowing millions of Africans to escape death by starvation and poverty)? Let me show you proof that some people don't believe in harmful anthropogenic climate change: I could get into the weeds on the science, the piss-poor success rate of past predictive efforts or the specific heat of H2O molecules. Instead I'll go for evidence everyone can see and understand.  This is the 450\u2032 yacht president Obama likes to party on.  This is the 14000 sq ft home the Obama's bought in Martha's vineyard. It is 6 ft above the high tide mark. It is the Obama's 3rd home.  This is one of Al Gore's homes. It's really large. It has a huge carbon footprint.  This is his yacht. Please note the 2 stroke jetski on the back. Much more pollution than a 4 stroke.  This is James Cameron's home. He also owns 2 planes, a helicopter, 5 cars and a submarine. All powered by fossil fuels.  This is John Travolta's house. It's an airport. He owns 5 jets including a 707 that no airline uses anymore due to its high use of jet fuel.  This is the yacht that Greta Thunberg came to the USA in. It claims to be zero emissions but that does not include the extra co2 generated to make it, which were considerably higher than the construction of a standard sailing yacht. It is owned by the royal family of Monaco, who flew the crew back to Europe on a private jet after it dropped off Greta in the USA, thus negating any savings in carbon emissions. This is a common practice for crews of yachts, even \u201czero emissions\u201d yachts..  This is His Highness Prince Charles Prius. He had it flown solo on a 747 expedited shipping.  This the the airport at Davos Switzerland during a special climate symposium. These are all private jets with one or two passengers. I hear leo DiCaprio had a great time.  This is the Robert Kennedy Jr home in Martha's vineyard. He is the head of the Environmental Defense Fund. In the 1990\u2019s, he sued to stop the construction of windmills (no carbon emissions) off the coast because it would spoil his view of the ocean from his 10,000 ft home. (BTW, the windmills would have been so far away, they would appear 1/2 an inch high to his view) So that's the evidence that you can see that none of the people who claim to believe in anthropogenic global warming actually believe it is happening. All of the above claim that carbon is literally killing the planet. All of the above live a significantly more carbon intense lifestyles than anyone you know. All but Greta own property at or near sea level. Do you think they would buy those homes if they actually believed that they would soon be underwater? The above facts tell you that not one of the people warning of the dangers of carbon emissions believe a word of it. They just want you to not clutter the slopes of Davos or the beaches of Tahiti. Even the \u201cnormal\u201d people on Quora really, deep down, don't believe it. All of them live Western Civilization lifestyles- they travel via carbon powered vehicles (Teslas get electricity from coal plants), they sleep in bedrooms larger than most 3rd world homes. Their homes have central heat and air. They travel via airplane. Many fight nuclear power ( the only 0 emission power we have) with vigor. These are not the actions of someone that actually believes carbon will kill the planet. Sure, they make token changes. They buy a Tesla. They recycle. But none of those things make any difference at all in carbon emissions. In fact, most of those actually increase the net carbon output. The funny thing is that most of the things that actually do reduce carbon they fight against tooth and nail. Fracking has successfully lowered USA emissions more than any other industrial country. Our emissions are at 1990 levels due to natural gas from fracking. Nuclear power is the safest power source ever discovered. It's better for the environment than any other power source. You think spent fuel is bad? Look into the tailings from solar panel manufacturing. Anyway, I await intellectual response with a sad sense of pessimism. UPDATE: of course I believe the climate is changing. Literally ALL things change over time. That's like saying Im an aging denier. Or that I deny animals and plants have become extinct. The question is are humans causing it and if so how much and what's the best way the ameliorate it. Is co2 the culprit or is water emissions? BTW, please note water is a worse greenhouse gas but even Al Gore isn't crazy enough to claim water is a pollutant. Capitalism seems to be the best way to reduce co2 emissions as evidenced by USA precipitous drop in CO2. Communist China seems to be the worst offender, but you don't see Greta lecturing them because they don't take policy advice from 16 yr old children. Perhaps greta could tell us how to balance the budget or solve the Israel/Palestine conflict while she's at it ",

I have a degree in Physics, I taught Senior High Science for several years and one of my daughters is a consulting physician. But what\u2019s the evidence that smoking causes cancer? I have to say I don\u2019t really know. The more I think about it, the more I realise I know almost nothing of the evidence. But hey, there\u2019s no way I would take up smoking because all the people working in the field and who have studied it believe smoking causes cancer (and a whole lot of other diseases.) I value my health too much to take the risk and I reckon I really don\u2019t need to know the evidence personally. I think it\u2019s pretty much the same with climate change. I have an elementary understanding of the mechanisms that could result in human induced climate change. But no way I could say one way or another whether the evidence is overwhelming or not. I sort of value the continued existence of humankind on this planet too important to NOT take the word of those who have spent their lives studying the issue. ",

I\u2019ve included a couple of links to early research conducted in the oil industry that predicted the effects of continually adding more CO2 to the atmosphere.

So much for global warming\u2026. Right? \u2014 The Climate Consensus http://www.columbia.edu/~lmp%20/paps/randel+polvani+etal-JGR-2017.pdf Climate Q&A The cooling trend in the upper atmosphere is probably the most telling evidence. A warming troposphere and cooling stratosphere rules out causes for temperature increases being driven by the sun, or any other source external to the earth. It is a cornerstone prediction of global warming caused by increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere that has come to pass. Don\u2019t be taken in by climate change denier claims of a conspiracy or that the data has been doctored. Most of them are amateurs with a bit of a penchant for conspiracy theories, little or no understanding of the scientific method (although they often seem to think they are some kind of closet scientific genius), and poor critical thinking skills. They tend to like authoritarian leadership and are led by a small but powerful group of professional climate change deniers, funded by organisations such as the Koch Foundation and others with a vested interest in causing confusion amongst the public with regard to climate change. They use basically the same strategy the big tobacco used to confuse the public for years and in many cases the same lobbyists. Political activities of the Koch brothers - Wikipedia Harvard scientists took Exxon\u2019s challenge; found it using the tobacco playbook | Dana Nuccitelli Here are articles referencing some more studies that site research showing clear evidence of the unprecedentedly rapid and global increase in CO2 and the subsequent global temperature. The second one in particular destroys one of the last climate change denier lies about recent warming and cooling events that are observed in the record being evidence that the global temperature has had similar changes before the industrial age. These temperature excursions (the medieval warming and little ice age) are shown to be localised events. Not global. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/still-hotter-than-ever/ 'No doubt left' about scientific consensus on global warming, say experts Here are a couple of links directly to the cited studies. No evidence for globally coherent warm and cold periods over the preindustrial Common Era Last phase of the Little Ice Age forced by volcanic eruptions Finally, climate change is complex. At some point, you have to either spend decades of study and research to become an expert yourself, or trust in the assessment of the climate change scientists who are experts. The often quoted 97% consensus is only increasing as more studies are published, evidence gathered and predictions observed to come true. https://skepticalscience.com/97-consensus-study-hits-million-downloads.html You will note that as the climate change deniers are being decisively beaten on the science, they are moving to use political pressure to try and censor organisations such as NASA. That should be a clear indicator to you that they are lying. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look in old physics books, global warming was simply listed as a fact decades ago. The basic physics of greenhouse gasses preventing some light=energy from going back into space are well know, we can measure it on Earth, measure it on Venus (where it is extreme.) NASA can measure the exact wavelengths of light (which means energy) being returned to a square meter of the planet\u2019s surface, and \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 they don\u2019t break the laws of physics that we\u2019ve known for a very long time. That energy has to go somewhere, oceans or atmosphere. It depends a bit more on what you mean by global warming. Honest debate about global warming, not the bs that now dominates our political conversations, has always been about how much and how bad \u2026 will the atmosphere have positive or negative feedback to an initial change. It\u2019s very clear and basic physics, that releasing more greenhouse gasses will warm the planet. Which then might increase or decrease cloud cover at certain heights, which could either multiply or reduce the initial impact\u2026 CO2 and warming could increase plant growth so that CO2 is absorbed back into forest (so it is reduced) or might cause forest fires that release even more CO2. How much goes in the ocean and how much in the atmosphere. There are a lot of questions like this. The basic physics of CO2 causing their to be more energy=heat not escaping into space is quite simple to anyone not near a politician and was \u201cproven\u201d at least a century ago, but the details and wondering how big a disaster it is likely to be are very complex, and not something you can \u201cprove,\u201d just something you can model and then let the next generation find out what you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a bit like smoking if there was only one person and no way to run tests until the person either got sick or didn\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019d know it produced carcinogens but couldn\u2019t prove much, there\u2019s no control group for a whole planet increasing it\u2019s greenhouse gasses.

            "answer_text": "The paleoclimate record essentially \u201cproves\u201d that the climate has changed over the eons many times. But if you are actually asking for proof that human emissions of CO2 are leading to catastrophic global warming (as so many climate alarmists claim), there is none. In addition, the ONLY evidence that the Earth has even recently undergone a slight global warming is the unreliable global temperature record. Everything else is completely supposition and hypothesis, all unproven, all even untested. You may ask why I describe the global temp record as unreliable. The reasons are numerous, and all are supported by credible evidence. The following discussion is rather lengthy, but it is necessary to convincingly expose the complex and extensive deceit and disinformation by promoters of the unproven hypothesis of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming. \u2022\tNASA, NOAA, CRU Data Alterations/Estimations \u201cA conclusion from all findings suggest that global [temperature] data bases are seriously flawed and can no longer be trusted to assess climate trends\u2026\u201d http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/noaa_2010_report.pdf \u201cIn the case of global warming, a number of bodies are telling us they have all the evidence, but refuse to tell us what it is. The data have been processed, but how? Time series have been altered, but why? Some phenomena have been left out of the equation, but on what grounds? We do not know, and we are simply required to keep quiet and do what we are told. No second opinion is permitted\u201d http://www.scmsa.eu/archives/SCM_RC_2015_08_24_EN.pdf \u201cThe very definition of a global temperature for the Earth poses some serious problems. Determining an average temperature for a system as complex as the Earth has no physical meaning. Unfortunately, this question, fundamental though it is, has never been tackled by organizations involved in meteorology. For them, the answer is simple: you take all the sensors and calculate the average! The competent organizations use an arithmetic mean, adding up all the temperature readings available and dividing the total by the number of sensors. But this poses some serious problems. Now let us imagine that one sensor covers 1 km2, while the other covers 5 km2. The sensors give readings of 10\u00baC and 12\u00baC. How are we going to calculate the average temperature? Nobody knows!\u201d http://www.scmsa.eu/archives/SCM_RC_2015_08_24_EN.pdf \u201cIt is impossible to measure the average surface temperature of the earth, yet the IPCC scientists try to claim that it is possible to measure \u2018anomalies\u2019 of this unknown quantity. An assessment of all the temperature data available, largely ignored by the IPCC, shows no evidence for overall warming, but the existence of cyclic behaviour. Recent warming was last recorded around 1950. An absence of warming for 10 years and a current downturn suggest that the cool part of the cycle is imminent.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Vincent Gray, PhD chemistry, IPCC reviewer THE GLOBAL WARMING SCAM by Vincent Gray free pdf. My annotations added.The global warming scam is the result of the widespread belief in a new religion, based on the deification of a nebulous entity, \u201cThe Environment\u201d. \u201cSo far in 2019, sixty-one percent of the monthly temperature data is now estimated by a computer model, rather than actual measured thermometer data. The amount of fake data is up 500% since 30 years ago.\u201d 61% Of NOAA USHCN Adjusted Temperature Data Is Now Fake There are numerous published reports providing evidence that NOAA, NASA, and the UK\u2019s Met/CRU (the 3 most utilized global climate data services) have altered, manipulated and/or estimated temperature data over the years, making the data appear to better correlate with the theory of CAGW and the rise in atmospheric CO2. A few of these are presented here: James Hansen, the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the theory of CAGW, apparently changed (without any supporting evidence) his previously reported (http://www.sealevel.info/1981_Hansen_etal_1.pdf, 1981) value of the mean global temperature from 15 degrees C (288 K) to 14 degrees C (sometime after 1997) in order to announce a spurious increase in global temps to 14.6 degrees C in 2002! The IPCC and other climate scientists (including Michael Mann of Climategate and the discredited \u201cHockey Stick\u201d[see below] fame) had all originally used 15 C, but also switched to 14 C in order to fallaciously agree with the global temp increase of 0.6 degrees C: \u201cThis year the Earth's average temperature was 14.64C, compared with the long-term average of 14C, said James Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who analyses the data collected from thousands of weather stations around the world.\u201d \u2013 Sydney Morning Herald, December 14, 2002 Global warming blamed for heat This mendacious action apparently created the need to alter all temp records of the 20th century to coincide with Hansen\u2019s deceit. Fourteen Is the New Fifteen! In its 2018 Global Climate Report Summary, NOAA claims: \u201cThe yearly global land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.13\u00b0F (0.07C) per decade since 1880\u201d. Global Climate Report - Annual 2018 That would mean it had supposedly risen 0.91 degrees C by 2010 and 0.98 degrees C (1.8 F) by 2020. But such small increases (0.07C per decade or 0.007C per year!) far exceed the margin of error for such measurements, especially considering the level of technology in the past. Is it actually reasonable to believe that, not only the US, but enormous regions around the world (such as Russia, Africa, Asia, India, etc.) had hundreds of thermometers capable of measuring hundredths or even thousandths of degrees centigrade before 1920?, 1940?, 1960 or even now? This alone makes the NOAA (and all) global temp data suspect. \u201cThe estimated average \u00b10.2 C station error has been incorrectly assessed as random, and the systematic error from uncontrolled variables has been invariably neglected. The systematic errors in measurements from three ideally sited and maintained temperature sensors are calculated herein. Combined with the \u00b10.2 C average station error, a representative lower-limit uncertainty of \u00b10.46 C was found for any global annual surface air temperature anomaly. This \u00b10.46 C reveals that the global surface air temperature anomaly trend from 1880 through 2000 is statistically indistinguishable from 0 C, and represents a lower limit of calibration uncertainty for climate models and for any prospective physically justifiable proxy reconstruction of paleo-temperature. The rate and magnitude of 20th century warming are thus unknowable, and suggestions of an unprecedented trend in 20th century global air temperature are unsustainable.\u201d Surface temperature uncertainty, quantified \u201cIn a high-quality glass environmental thermometer manufactured in 1960, the accuracy would be +/- 1.4F. (2% of range) The resolution of an astute and dedicated observer would be around +/-1F. Therefore the total error margin of all observed weather station temperatures would be a minimum of +/-2.5F, or +/-1.30C.\u201d The Metrology of Thermometers Even if one assumes that, somehow (maybe alien technology), such minute measurements could be accurately made in the past, and that no manipulation of temp data has occurred, the estimated total increase in global temperatures since 1880 (0.8 -1.0 degrees C) falls within the range of natural variability as well as the margin of error for such a long time span. In fact, the margin of error for any temperature measurement (1.3 degrees C) exceeds the entire supposed total increase in temperature of 1.0 degrees C since 1880! Yet, alarmists demand we make prodigious, inordinately expensive and exceedingly disruptive changes in civilization based upon these dubious figures! One need not be particularly conservative to see this is utterly illogical, if not completely absurd. \u201cPatrick Frank is a scientist at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), part of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University. Frank has published papers that explain how the errors in temperatures recorded by weather stations have been incorrectly handled. Temperature readings, he finds, have errors over twice as large as generally recognized. Based on this, Frank stated, in a 2011 article in Energy & Environment, \u2018\u2026the 1856\u2013 2004 global surface air temperature anomaly with its 95% confidence interval is 0.8\u02daC \u00b1 0.98\u02daC.\u2019 The error bars are wider than the measured increase! It looks as if there\u2019s an upward temperature trend, but we can\u2019t tell definitively. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the world\u2019s temperature has not changed at all.\u201d Flawed Climate Models by David R. Henderson, Charles L. Hooper Flawed Climate Models But even the small alleged increase in global temps reported in NOAA\u2019s 2018 Global Climate Report Summary is in stark contrast to what it claimed about US temperatures in 1989 (but no longer claims) and published in the Geophysical Research Letters: \u201cThere has been no significant change in average temperatures or rainfall in the United States over the entire period [from 1895 to 1987] based on temperature and precipitation readings taken at weather stations around the country.\u201d- NYT, January 26,1989:  61% Of NOAA USHCN Adjusted Temperature Data Is Now Fake So, somehow the area of the world (the US) with the most comprehensive and modern temperature measuring equipment (see below) had no warming from 1895 to 1987, but the rest of the world, with much less temperature measuring capability, had (too small to reliably measure) warming of from 0.8 to 1.0 C from 1880 to 2018! Does that really seem plausible? \u201cIn 1999, NASA showed 0.6 C warming [globally] over land from 1880 to 1999, with a cooling period from the late 1930s to about 1978\u201d:  https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1999/1999_Hansen_ha03200f.pdf 1999 \u201cBut NASA now (2017) shows 1.0 C warming from 1880 to 1999.\u201d [a 0.4 C increase!]:  \u201cOverlaying the two graphs at the same scales, and normalizing to the most recent common years (1995-1999) it becomes clear what NASA did. They massively and increasingly cooled the past, to create non-existent warming.\u201d [i.e., NASA created a fake, non-existent increase in warming of an additional 0.4 C!]:  Note: the above graph uses temperature anomalies. Now look at actual temperatures to truly see how deceitful the manipulation was:  NOAA US Data Tampering Update | The Deplorable Climate Science Blog \u201cNo legitimate scientist would alter data like this. If they have theories about possible issues with the data, the correct way to handle it is to put error bars on the graph \u2013 not alter the data and present it as if it is the actual thermometer data. That is fraud, not science. Between 1999 and 2016, NASA completely altered the shape of the US temperature graph to turn seventy years of cooling into warming.\u201d Overwhelming Evidence Of Collusion \u201cThe (2017) data before 1999 is fake. But what about the hockey stick [discussed below] since 1999? That is even faker. Satellites show that the post-1999 NASA hockey stick doesn\u2019t exist\u201d:  Interactive Graphs (Green is land-based data used by NASA and forms a line similar to the business end of a hockey stick, which is much better visualized below). Red and blue are from satellite data, which has proven to be more reliable.) \u201cTo be fair, NASA is just one player in the greatest scientific fraud in history. But the story gets worse. By 1999, NASA had already erased most of the 1940-1970 global cooling reported by NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) and the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.\u201d  14 Jul 1974, Page 1 \u2013 Lincoln Evening Journal (NCAR graph) NASA\u2019s Completely Fake Temperature Graphs and Climate Junk Science At NCAR (Some skeptics have disagreed with calling the above altered temp data \u201cfake\u201d as if simply made up with no basis. They prefer to state that the data was \u201cadjusted\u201d, \u201cmanipulated\u201d, or extrapolated based upon contrived or faulty reasoning. The \u201cbasis\u201d for some of these changes are discussed below, but any way one looks, it raises skepticism of the data, at least for logical and intellectually honest individuals.) Compare the 1974 NCAR graph to a 2017 NASA graph. Overlaying the 1974 NCAR graph on the NASA graph, it becomes clear that NASA has not so subtly erased the 1940 to 1970 cooling:  Climate Junk Science At NCAR Even if one does not call the temp data \u201cfake\u201d, the alleged correlation between global warming and CO2 appears to be based upon frequently adjusted, manipulated, selective and/or extrapolated/estimated temperature data. In most years, NOAA estimates or extrapolates much of its temperature data (which always seems to better fit the AGW/CAGW theory), often using computer models of tenuous reliability. Despite the presentation by NOAA et al of neat, official-looking graphs of temperature data claimed to be completely reliable, arriving at that data is apparently a very convoluted and unreliable process. http://www.scmsa.eu/archives/SCM_RC_2015_08_24_EN.pdf \u201cSo far in 2019, sixty-one percent of the monthly [global] temperature data is now estimated by a computer model, rather than actual measured thermometer data.\u201d 61% Fake Data | Real Climate Science Of course, it\u2019s much easier to deceptively manipulate global temp data than US data, since the capability to accurately measure global temps is much less than US temps, there are so fewer global stations and temps in huge expanses are estimated. That explains why global data claims warming and US data does not! Also, as noted above, on several occasions NASA and NOAA changed temperatures they had previously reported, the new data making it appear cooler in the past and warmer more recently. They mysteriously decreased the strikingly warm period of the 1930s and diminished the cooling after 1940, allegedly by changing/cherry-picking temperature monitoring stations to ones where the reported temps better fit the alarmist theory (discussed more below). Every time they made changes, they lowered past temps and increased more recent temps making it appear there is a closer correlation with rising CO2 levels. And lots of people apparently have simply accepted it without question. From 1960 through 1980, there were more than 6000 stations globally providing temperature information. After 1980, NOAA began cutting stations around the world. Around 1990, the number was reduced to less than 3000. \u201cIt can be shown that systematically and purposefully, country by country, they removed higher-latitude, higher-altitude and rural locations, all of which had a tendency to be cooler. The thermometers kept were near the tropics, the sea, and airports near bigger cities [see article on urban heat islands below]. These data were then used to determine the global average temperature and to initialize climate models. \u201cCalculating the average temperatures this way ensured that the mean global surface temperature for each month and year would show a false-positive temperature anomaly, a bogus warming trend. Interestingly, the very same stations that were deleted from the world climate network were retained for computing the average-temperature base periods, further increasing the bias towards warming.\u201d Greenhouse Gases in the Atmosphere Cool the Earth! | PSI Intl Also noted after the 1990 cut was \u201ca significant increase in missing monthly data in the stations that remained. (Note: This increases uncertainty \u2013 greatest in regions where they claim the warming is the greatest). There are uncertainties in ocean temperatures; no small issue, as oceans cover 71% of the earth's surface. These factors lead to significant uncertainty and a tendency for over-estimation of century-scale temperature trends. A conclusion from all findings suggest that global data bases are seriously flawed and can no longer be trusted to assess climate trends or rankings or validate model forecasts. And, consequently, such surface data should be ignored for decision making. Numerous peer-reviewed papers have estimated that these local issues with the observing networks may account for 30%, 50% or more of the warming shown since 1880.\u201d http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/originals/noaa_2010_report.pdf  The global decrease in monitoring stations from 1976 to 1997 revealed on the above graph is striking. Six other findings are noteworthy: 1 . the US has by far the most stations of any country (about half of the total global number!) and is completely covered, suggesting the US record should be much more accurate and reliable than the global record; 2 . the stations remaining globally are clustered near the coasts where temps are often higher than in higher elevation regions; 3 . there are very few stations over the oceans which compose over 70% of the global surface; 4 . the Northern hemisphere is over-represented and the Southern under-represented; 5 . there are very few stations in the coldest portions of the world (the Arctic and Antarctic); 6 . except for the US, the global stations in all areas not clustered are spread quite widely apart, meaning that temps in huge global areas are not monitored (about 56% of the globe). To compensate, NOAA/NASA/CRU extrapolate temps in intervening areas from surrounding areas, sometimes as far away as 1200km to the closest station! Multiple climate scientists admitted in the past that there was insufficient data available for nearly the entire Southern hemisphere (and the oceans) to draw credible conclusions about global temperatures. \u201cData from the Southern Hemisphere, particularly south of latitude 30 south, are so meager that reliable conclusions are not possible, the report says. The 30th parallel of south latitude passes through South Africa, Chile and southern Australia. The cooling trend seems to\u2010 extend at least part way into the Southern Hemisphere\u2026\u201d International Team of Specialists Finds No End in Sight to 30\u2010Year Cooling Trend in Northern Hemisphere \u201cIn this 2009 Climategate E-mail, Phil Jones from CRU said there was very little ship data in large areas of the Southern Hemisphere, and that the historical data in those regions was \u2018mostly made up.\u2019\u201d  http://di2.nu/foia/foia2011/mail/2729.txt and Overwhelming Evidence Of Collusion There are still very large areas of missing land data, represented by gray in this 2018 NOAA map (plus all of the white areas in the oceans):  However, the lack of data doesn\u2019t stop NOAA from declaring record heat in places with no thermometer data! (compare with map above):  Fake Data \u2013 The Basis Of Climate Science | The Deplorable Climate Science Blog This is more evidence that the global temp data is far less reliable than the US data (at least prior to being manipulated). If there are significant differences between these two data sets, isn\u2019t it reasonable to consider it is due to inaccuracies/inadequacies of the global data set rather than assuming that the US temps actually somehow differ significantly from the rest of the world? Really! Why would one country be so different from every other country? After the 2015 UN Paris Climate Conference, a group of French mathematicians and mathematical modelers explained: \u201cThe Earth has a total surface area of approximately 500 million km2; this means that a reliable global analysis would require at least five million sensors, which is 1,600 times more than the 3,000 stations being used at the moment. And that is simply for the calculation of surface temperatures. This distribution would have to be repeated at every layer of the atmosphere and every depth of the seas. This simple calculation clearly demonstrates that there are not enough stations to model the surface temperature of the globe, and satellites cannot replace surface stations. The reduction in the number of sensors being used is fundamentally unsound: temperature varies from one place to another, from one hour to the next, and this natural variability can be tracked only by a very dense network of sensors. All that we are recording (today and even more so in the past) are variations that derive simply from inadequate observations. So, in these conditions, one cannot come to any conclusion about climate change in any sense. None of the information on global temperatures is of any scientific value, and it should not be used as a basis for any policy decisions. It is perfectly clear that there are far too few temperature sensors to give us a picture of the planet\u2018s temperature; the data have been subject to much dissimulation and manipulation; and direct use of the available figures does not indicate any genuine trend towards global warming!\u201d http://www.scmsa.eu/archives/SCM... In addition, many of the stations changed locations over the decades so that they were not reading from the same location over time. So, what caused any change in measured temp- an actual average increase or the change in location? Also, most stations failed to report temperature results for 1 or more months each year from 1880 to 2010. (sometimes as many as 80\u201390% of stations in some global regions!) And it turns out that the months most commonly absent were during the winter, reducing the accuracy of cooler temps, a huge portion of which were estimated:  (Note the left vertical axis should be labeled as \u201cPercentage of stations with one or more missing months\u201d.) https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com \u203a chap3-published-in-elsevier So, how can obtaining measurements from only approx 46% (which includes the US) of the global surface (many of which are biased towards a warmer location, have months of missing data, and many of which are extrapolated or estimated) represent an accurate record of global temperature change??? Isn\u2019t it quite possible that the US temperature record is more representative of overall climate change than the less accurate global record? If so, it presents a very different picture of changes in temperatures from 1880 to the current date, at least prior to all of the manipulations! It would reveal very little, if any, sustained increase in temperatures, which is what growing numbers of skeptics are beginning to suspect! In its original US data base (used until at least 1999), NOAA had an adjustment for urban heat island (UHI) effect (see below). The data revealed a net cooling trend of 0.35 C from the late 1930s to about 1989 (although temps had started to slowly rise from their lowest point after 1980):  This 0.35 C net cooling period from the late 1930s to 1989 led to the impending catastrophic global COOLING scare from numerous climate scientists in the 1970s, another failed/false prediction. (Yes, indeed, there was definitely a dramatic global cooling scare promoted by numerous top climate scientists at NCAR, NASA, NOAA and elsewhere: https://www.quora.com/If-you-had-a-10-minute-appointment-with-President-Trump-how-would-you-convince-him-to-act-on-climate-change/answer/John-Walker-922/comment/123310079 and https://www.quora.com/Is-global-cooling-an-inconvenient-truth-for-Al-Gore-and-other-climate-alarmists/answer/John-Walker-922 ) But the net cooling in US temps did not correlate so well with the rising CO2, and there was concern about the differences between US and global temps. Comparing the two graphs below from 1999, the US temps show the net cooling from the late 1930s to 1989 while the global temp graph shows a net warming for the same period:  1999 Graphs - 61% Of NOAA USHCN Adjusted Temperature Data Is Now Fake But rather than assuming the global data (indisputably much less robust than US data as explained above) was incorrect (or perhaps knowing but dismayed with what the more reliable US data revealed), NOAA and NASA began re-adjusting the US data by reducing the UHI adjustments (and possibly by using different dates to calculate the time period upon which the anomalies were calculated) used in the previous years\u2019 data. By 2009, the urban heat island adjustment had been eliminated completely from past data, resulting in a net increase of 0.3 C in warming from the late 1930s to 1989! Thus, plotted US temps exhibited an increasing rise as urbanization (and, therefore, UHI effect) increased during this same period. And voila! The resulting plot more closely correlated with the rise in CO2 and the theory of CAGW! Compare the 1999 US graph above (with the UHI adjustments) to this US graph (just below) made in 2010 without (1930s went down; 2000 went up):  In addition, the 0.35 C net cooling in the US from the late 1930s to 1989 has been \u201cdisappeared\u201d and better matches the global temp graph below! Ah, that\u2019s much better!:  2010 Global Temps In addition, in 1989, NOAA said most global warming occurred prior to 1919, and that the earth experienced a net cooling from 1921 to 1979 (which certainly does not match either the above 2010 graph or the 2018 graph below the newspaper article:   So, again, it\u2019s clear that, somewhere along the way, NOAA changed its temp data to that seen in the 2018 graph above, somewhat resembling the debunked \u201chockey stick\u201d (see further below). If it were not for the historical records being preserved in newspaper articles such as the above, it\u2019s likely that the public would never know about these deceptions. Thus, which NOAA claim should we believe: most warming occurred prior to 1919 or warming has steadily increased since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution? NASA also changed its data over the years to magically morph it into a partial \u201chockey stick\u201d so it fit better with the theory of AGW:  The following graph reveals just how much NASA has changed temp data over the years, up to the year 2000, with nearly all temps before 1970 progressively decreased and nearly all temps after 1970 progressively increased!:  It\u2019s obvious that NASA lowered past temps and raised more recent temps, making them appear to fit the rise in CO2 levels! Is this fraudulent? You decide. Doubling The Hockey Stick Fraud Data manipulations like this tend to make intellectually honest individuals skeptical, to say the least. But they should make everyone at least a little skeptical! And now their graphs/data not only correlate better with the rise in atmospheric CO2, they have simultaneously eliminated that pesky evidence for the global cooling scare. This is why so many CAGW alarmists ignorant of the past data adamantly claim there was no such scare or consensus in the 1970s. Apparently few people pay attention to history and previously reported data, something the reporting services presumably understand all too well! The fewer who know the past the easier they are to deceive. \u201c\u2018Data adjustment\u2019 is used to continue the perception of global warming. For the first several years of my research I relied on the climate data banks of NASA and GISS, two of the most prestigious scientific bodies of our country. After years of painstaking gathering of data, and relentless graphing of that data, I discovered that I was not looking at the originally gathered data, but data that had been \u201cadjusted\u201d for what was deemed \u2018scientific reasons.\u2019 Unadjusted data is simply not available from these data banks. Fortunately, I was able to find the original weather station data from over 7000 weather stations from around the world in the KNMI database. (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute). There I was able to review both the adjusted and unadjusted data as well as the breakout of the daytime and nighttime data. The results were astounding. I found that data from many stations around the world had been systematically \u201cadjusted\u201d to make it seem that global warming was happening when, in fact, for many places around the world the opposite was true. Following will be a few of the myriad of examples of this data adjustment. When I present my material during presentations at local colleges, these are the charts that have some of the greatest impact in affecting the opinion of the students, especially when they realize that there is a concerted effort to misrepresent what is actually happening. Another amazing result was that when only graphing the daily highs from around the country, a very different picture arises from the historical temperature data.\u201d - Mike van Biezen, data analyst, adjunct professor of Physics, Mathematics, Astronomy, and Earth Science at Compton College, Santa Monica College, El Camino College, and Loyola Marymount University      The Most Comprehensive Assault On \u2018Global Warming\u2019 Ever All of the above information certainly explains the following quotes: \u201cGovernment reports, writers of opinion pieces, and bloggers posting graphs purporting to show rising or record air temperatures or ocean heat, are misleading you. This is not actual raw data. It is plots of data that have been \u2018adjusted\u2019 or \u2018homogenized\u2019 (i.e., manipulated) by scientists \u2013 or it is output from models that are based on assumptions, many of them incorrect. UK Meteorological Office researcher Chris Folland makes no apologies for this. \u2018The data don\u2019t matter. We\u2019re not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We\u2019re basing them upon the climate models\u2019.\u201d Climate: The Real 'Worrisome Trend' (Part I: Faulty Science) - Master Resource And, of course, the climate models are based upon those manipulated temperature data sets and \u201ceducated guesses\u201d about the climate sensitivity to CO2, so they are as specious as the data sets, if not more so! Here is more information about the Urban Heat Island effect and how it has falsely elevated temperature measurements, further corrupting the data: \u201cOne of the fundamental components that sets a city apart from its rural surroundings is the climate that prevails over urban environments. In urban areas buildings and paved surfaces have gradually replaced preexisting natural landscapes. As a result, solar energy is absorbed into roads and rooftops, causing the surface temperature of urban structures to become 50-70 degrees F higher than the ambient air temperatures. (Taha, Akbari &Sailor 1992). As surfaces throughout an entire community or city become hotter, overall ambient air temperature increases. This phenomenon, known as an \u2018urban heat island \u2018, can raise air temperature in a city by 2-80F. (Oke 1987 and World Meteorological Organization 1984).\u201d https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/1998/data/papers/0903.PDF Many of the temperature monitoring stations used for global (including US) temperature data are located in urban areas (some originally but more after urban encroachment) and thus surrounded by abundant concrete and asphalt. This creates \u201curban heat islands\u201d which artificially raise temperatures. (Like this one in Tucson, AZ now located on an asphalt parking lot!):  BIG NEWS \u2013 Verified by NOAA \u2013 poor weather station siting leads to artificial long term warming And this one in the foreground next to the asphalt and an A/C heat pump! It replaced the one in the background in a grassy area. Do ya think the new one might have a warming bias over the old?:  And this from Sydney, Australia, surrounded by tons of black asphalt:  A paper from the Journal of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) reported this problem and how much it was artificially raising measured temperatures: \u201cA data set derived from the United States Historical Climate Network has been compared to two global land-based temperature data sets that have been commonly cited in connection with the detection of the greenhouse effect and in other studies of climate change. Results indicate that in the United States the two global land-based temperature data sets have an urban bias between + 0.1\u00b0C and +0.4\u00b0C over the twentieth century (1901\u201384). This bias is as large or larger than the overall temperature trend in the United States during this time period, +0.16\u00b0C/84 yr. Temperature trends indicate an increasing temperature from the turn of the century to the 1930s but a decrease thereafter. By comparison, the global temperature trends during the same period are between +0.4\u00b0C/84 yr and +0.6\u00b0C/84 yr. At this time, we can only speculate on the magnitude of the urban bias in the global land-based data sets for other parts of the globe, but the magnitude of the bias in the United States compared to the overall temperature trend underscores the need for a thorough global study.\u201d -NOAA and University of East Anglia Urban Bias in Area-averaged Surface Air Temperature Trends (https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281989%29070%3C0265%3AUBIAAS%3E2.0.CO%3B2) (1989) And this from an AMS fellow: \u201cThe global surface-station data is seriously compromised. The data suffers significant contamination by urbanization and other local factors such as land-use/land-cover changes and instrument siting that does not meet government standards. There was a major station dropout, which occurred suddenly around 1990 and a signi\ufb01cant increase in missing monthly data in the stations that remained. There are also uncertainties in ocean temperatures; no small issue, as oceans cover 71% of the Earth\u2019s surface. These factors all lead to signi\ufb01cant uncertainty and in most cases a tendency for overestimation of century-scale temperature trends. Indeed, numerous peer-reviewed papers cataloged here have estimated that these local issues with the observing networks may account for 30%, 50% or more of the warming shown since 1880. After the data with all its issues are collected, further adjustments are made, each producing more warming,\u201d - Joseph D\u2019Aleo, CCM, AMS Fellow https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com \u203a chap3-published-in-elsevier \u201cAs meteorologist Anthony Watts\u2019 team of volunteers documented, 90% of the US climate stations were found to not meet government standards. They found stations located next to the exhaust fans of air conditioning units, surrounded by asphalt parking lots and roads, on blistering-hot rooftops, and near sidewalks and buildings that absorb and radiate heat. They found 68 stations located at wastewater treatment plants, where the process of waste digestion causes temperatures to be higher than in surrounding areas. In fact, they found that 90% of the stations fail to meet the National Weather Service\u2019s own siting requirements that stations must be 30 m (about 100 feet) or more away from an arti\ufb01cial heating or re\ufb02ecting source. The average warm bias for inappropriately-sited stations exceeded 1 C using the National Weather Service\u2019s own criteria. NOAA first denied it was an issue (Menne 2009) but then asked the government for $100 million to upgrade/correct the siting of 1,000 climate stations. Is NASA better? In a 2007 email obtained under FOIA to Doyle Rice of the USA TODAY, NASA's Dr. Reto A. Ruedy replied with an unequivocal \u2018no\u2019. He admitted that some of their own procedures led to less accurate readings.\u201d WHY NOAA AND NASA PROCLAMATIONS SHOULD BE IGNORED http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/originals/noaa_2010_report.pdf and https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com \u203a chap3-published-in-elsevier Pielke et al found a majority of stations did not meet World Meteorological Organization (WMO) requirements for proper siting. They extensively documented poor siting and land-use change issues in numerous peer-reviewed papers, many summarized in the landmark paper \u201cUnresolved issues with the assessment of multi-decadal global land surface temperature trends\u201d. JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, D24S08, doi:10.1029/2006JD008229, 2007 (http://pielkeclimatesci.\ufb01les.wordpress.com/2009/10/r-321.pdf.) Urbanization is directly related to population. J Goodridge showed the importance of urbanization to temperatures in his study of California counties in 1996. He found for counties with a million or more population the warming from 1910 to 1995 was 4 F, for counties with 100,000 to 1 million it was 1 F, and for counties with less than 100,000 there was no change (0.1 F). -Goodridge, J.D., 1996. Comments on Regional simulations of Greenhouse warming including natural variability. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 77, 1588e1599. In other words, in rural areas with minimal urbanization, there was NO warming from 1910 to 1995! NO WARMING! And in a study from China, 2019: \u201cwe conclude that about 50% of the recorded warming of China since the 1940s could be due to uncorrected urbanization bias. In addition, we also find that the Tmax record from May to October over China shows the 1940s and the 2000s equally warm, in contrast to the 1\u202f\u00b0C warming predicted by the CMIP5 models.\u201d Detection of UHI bias in China climate network using Tmin and Tmax surface temperature divergence As expected, there are some climate scientists who dispute the idea that the UHI effect has fallaciously increased US and global temperature data, but many studies contradict that claim in no uncertain terms with well-documented evidence. ****So, is the warming reported over the past century real, or is it due to the urban heat island effect on temperature monitors, frequent manipulations and estimations of temperature data, inadequate precision of thermometers, poor measuring techniques, margins of error, natural variability and inadequate coverage and data from many global locales??**** Fortunately, since 1979, satellites have been able to provide temperature data on a global scale without the bias issues and easy manipulations that occur with surface-based measurements. Satellites also offer measurements in areas not previously available to land-based stations (although they are limited to latitudes between 66\u00b0 S and 66\u00b0 N, which excludes the polar regions, and are affected by positioning errors in their ground beacons). Of course, such data can still be manipulated by those seeking to promote an agenda, and there are adjustments which are usually made by the two main groups which analyze the data- University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS). Their temps usually agree fairly well with one another. Thus, satellite data is considered to be more reliable (but limited to post 1978) and has shown significant differences with the land-based data: \u201cWhen the satellites were \ufb01rst launched, their temperature readings were in better agreement with the surface-station data. There has been increasing divergence over time which can be seen below (derived from Klotzbach et al., 2009)- temperature anomalies as computed from satellites and assessed by UAH and RSS, and the station-based land surface anomalies from NOAA NCDC (Fig. 1 below). \u201cThe Klotzbach paper \ufb01nds that the divergence between surface and lower tropospheric trends is consistent with evidence of a warm bias in the surface temperature record but not in the satellite data. Santer refers to the (warming) effect as \u2018tropospheric ampli\ufb01cation of surface warming\u2019. This effect is a characteristic of all of the models used in the UNIPCC and the USGRCP \u2018ensemble\u2019 of models by Karl et al. (2006) which was the source for Karl et al. (2009), which in turn was relied upon by EPA in its recent Endangerment Finding\u201d. (Federal Register/Vol. 74, No. 239/Tuesday, December 15, 2009/Rules and Regulations at 66510.) \u201cAs Dr. John Christy, keeper of the UAH satellite data set describes it, \u2018The ampli\ufb01cation factor is a direct calculation from model simulations that show over 30-year periods that the upper air warms at a faster rate than the surface, generally 1.2 times faster for global averages. In models, the convective adjustment is quite rigid, so this vertical response in models is forced to happen. The real world is much less rigid and has ways to allow heat to escape rather than be retained as models show.\u2019\u201d  [As can be seen, the divergence between reported land-based temp anomalies and the two satellite-based sets increases from 1979 to 2008, by which time the difference is nearly 0.6 degrees F, easily accounting for the supposed global warming during that period!] And this graph reveals only minimal increase in lower tropospheric temps with rising CO2:  ***\u201cThis strongly suggests that instead of atmospheric warming from greenhouse effects dominating, surface-based warming very likely due to uncorrected urbanization and land-use contamination is the biggest change. Since these surface changes are not fully adjusted for, trends from the surface networks are not reliable.\u201d*** https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com \u203a chap3-published-in-elsevier And this graph from 2014 reveals further divergence:  GISTEMP LODI Global Mean Temps by Satellite v Land Stations Wood for Trees: Interactive Graphs Wood for Trees: Interactive Graphs And satellite records from 1978 also show no significant warming, with spikes due to El Ninos:  Graph from: Murry Salby, PhD, atmospheric scientist: \u201cWhat is Really Behind the Increase of Atmospheric CO2?\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1cGqL9y548&feature=youtu.be More References about altered data: Zombie Climate Science (February 29, 2020) Tony Heller: \u201cDaily temperature data from NOAA\u2019s United States Historical Climatology Network shows that US maximum temperatures last year were tied for second coolest on record with 1912.

This graph became the \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence for the theory of human CO2-induced global warming, where global temperatures were supposedly relatively level over the past 1000 years, and then, around 1900 AD, suddenly started dramatically rising unabated as industrial CO2 started rising. To create this graph, Mann changed historical temperature data in order to remove the previous warmer Medieval Warm Period (1000\u20131300 AD+/-) (the IPCC in AR5 used the deceitful term \u201cMedieval Climate Anomaly\u201d!) and the cooler \"Little Ice Age\" (1500\u20131700 AD+/-). Both periods had been well established in the scientific literature. The IPCC described them in their earlier reports and used a graph clearly showing them based upon temp data compiled by none other than CAGW \u201cgodfather\u201d James Hansen in 1984, while he was director of the NASA Goddard Institute.  Below is Mann\u2019s drastically altered (\u201cHockey Stick\u201d) graph of Northern hemisphere temperatures for the past 1000 years, published in 1999 and completely eliminating the MWP and LIA! It also diminishes the decline in global temps after the late 1930s (often referred to as \u201chide the decline\u201d):  According to Hide-the-Decline Plus, Mann developed his \u201chockey stick\u201d graph using primarily tree ring data, which has often proved unreliable as a proxy for global temperatures. This was evident by the fact that the tree rings did not correspond with global temps after 1940. So Mann switched to thermometer readings after that, although those readings were also incorrect as evidenced by his \u201chide the decline\u201d. The graph below shows multiple temp reconstructions by different authors based upon different sets of temp data. Mann\u2019s is the dark blue line up to 1940. The solid red is supposed thermometer readings, which Mann used after 1940. But the actual temperatures from earlier NOAA records are shown by the orange line revealing a sharp decline from about 1940 to the 1970s:  Also see: Hide the Decline: Sciencemag # 3 and Mann Misrepresents the EPA \u2013 Part 1 BTW, Mann and a few other CAGW alarmists claim that the LIA was only a regional event; therefore, it cannot be used as an example of global climate change. But numerous studies have debunked that claim as well: The Little Ice Age climate of New Zealand reconstructed from Southern Alps cirque glaciers: a synoptic type approach\t Clim Dyn (2014) 42:3039\u20133060 https://www.stevenphipps.com/publications/lorrey2014.pdf But since Mann\u2019s version \u201cfit\u201d so much better with the theory of CAGW, the IPCC dropped their original graph and substituted Mann\u2019s in their reports from 2001 through 2003:  And, of course, former democrat VP turned CAGW evangelist and climate change industry multi-millionaire, Al Gore, chose to use it in his alarmist presentations, including his movie An Inconvenient Truth. (It may have been inconvenient but it wasn\u2019t truth.):  See how well Mann\u2019s \u201cHockey Stick\u201d graph (left) correlates with atmospheric CO2 levels! They\u2019re almost identical. No wonder so many people were taken in! (More skepticism alarm bells sound for non-gullible conservatives.)  But the \u201cHockey Stick\u201d graph has been debunked by numerous sources, including the Climategate emails discussed further below. For a great discussion of this see: Dave Burton's answer to Why were those involved in the \"climategate\" fiasco completely absolved of any wrongdoing? \u201cDo I expect you to publicly denounce the hockey stick as obvious drivel? Well, yes.\u201d - Jonathan Jones, Professor of Atomic and Laser Physics, University of Oxford \u201cDid Mann et al. get it wrong? Yes, Mann et al. got it wrong.\u201d - Simon Tett, Professor of Climate Science, University of Edinburgh And this Youtube from Dr. Richard Muller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=8BQpciw8suk&feature=emb_logo And this Youtube from Steve McIntyre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=115&v=SqzcA7SsqSA&feature=emb_logo And this Youtube from Dr. John Robson:  Consequently, the IPCC and more scientifically honest climate scientists no longer use it. Unfortunately, some less honest scientists and alarmists like Gore continue to promote it in their attempts to convince the public that CAGW is real. (Also note in the text immediately below that 6 editors were fired by the publisher of the journal Climate Research because they dared to publish one of the papers debunking the IPCC-favored \u201chockey stick\u201d!)    The above comment and attached graph are from the very informative: : CO2: The Greatest Scientific Scandal of Our Time (Zbigniew Jaworowski) Poland - Environmentalists For Nuclear USA Here\u2019s another graph representing the last 11,000 years of global temperatures, revealing that the recent slight (reported) warming is NOT at all \u201cunprecedented\u201d:  Note that by looking at an expanded view of temps (rather than minimizing the view to the past 150 years or so), there is a definite overall COOLING trend that began about 6000 years ago after the peak of the first Holocene Optimal Warm Period! Note also that there have been at least 3 periods when temps were warmer that currently, all called \u201cClimate Optima\u201d, for good reason- the warmer temps were optimal for the expansion of agriculture and allowed successful human settlements farther north and south from the equator. Thus, slightly higher global temps (and higher CO2 levels) would likely be a benefit to civilization, not a catastrophe! Interestingly, Dr. Tim Ball, a Canadian climatologist, who was one of the scientists who had debunked Mann\u2019s \u201cHockey Stick\u201d, was subsequently sued by Mann for libel. After nearly 9 years, the Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed Mann's case on Aug 23, 2019 and ordered him to pay Ball's legal costs! Mann lost his case because he refused to provide the court his R2 regression numbers (the \u201cworking out\u201d) behind his \u201chockey stick\u201d graph, which statisticians have shown are unreliable.  \u201cReal science, not the phony \u2018consensus\u2019 version, requires open access to data so skeptics (who play a key role in science) can see if results are reproducible. Of course, there are no falsifiable experimental data associated with the global warming predictions of doom, so it doesn't really stand as science as Karl Popper defined it. This is an important victory in the process of debunking the warmist scare.\u201d Leading global warming scientist ordered to pay opponent\u2019s legal costs in libel suit More References about the \u201cHockey Stick\u201d: Climatology Sees One Of The Greatest Scientific Reversals Of All Time - The Rise And Fall Of The Hockey Stick Charts A New Low in Climate Science (https://www.john-daly.com/hockey/hockey.htm) IPCC HOCKEY STICK CURVE DEBUNKED STILL FURTHER IPCC throws Mann's Hockey Stick under the bus? Global Warming Bombshell Unscientific hockey sticks and hidden data Doubling The Hockey Stick Fraud The Hockey Stick Illusion: Climategate and the Corruption of Science\u201d by Andrew Montford (2010) It\u2019s quite interesting that Mann had a completely different view about AGW earlier in his career: \u201cIn 1996, Michael Mann (who shot to fame during the Climategate scandal as the creator of \u2018Mike's Nature trick\u2019 to \u2018hide the decline\u2019) co-authored a paper titled Greenhouse Warming and changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature: Model versus observations. (http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/shared/articles/MannPark1996GRL.pdf) The paper pointed out that the predictions made by climate models were not consistent with observed data and the variability in temperature likely resulted from natural phenomena: \u2018... the signature of greenhouse warming is scarcely evident in the observational data... It is possible that observed trends in phase, largely influenced by mid-latitude continental interiors, do not arise from greenhouse warming, but rather from natural variability. Such a notion is reinforced by the fact that marginally-significant trends are found in the control GFDL annual cycle, presumably due to organized century-scale internal variability. If, on the other hand, the observed variation in the seasonal cycle truly represents a fingerprint of greenhouse warming, the GFDL and CCM1 models do not appear capable of capturing the detailed responses of the seasonal cycle to greenhouse forcing...Discrepancies between the observed and model-predicted trends must be resolved before a compelling connection can be drawn between 20th century changes in the behavior of the annual cycle in temperature, and anthropogenic forcing of the climate.\u2019 \u201c Fourteen Is the New Fifteen! \u201cThe first ever audit of the world\u2019s most important temperature data set (HadCRUT4) has found it to be so riddled with errors and \u201cfreakishly improbable data\u201d that it is effectively useless.

This is what consensus science brings you \u2013 groupthink with no quality control.\u201d UPDATE \u2013 BOMBSHELL: audit of global warming data finds it riddled with errors 170 Years of Earth Surface Temperature Data Show No Evidence of Significant Warming So, once you know about all of the rather significant problems with the temperature data, there is strong reason to be skeptical about if, and how much, global warming has occurred.
