            "answer_text": "What benefits of rock collecting? Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019ve been collecting rocks for years now. There are many benefits as I look at it. First, excercise. That\u2019s a huge benefit. Secondly, my back is really messed up and it used to be so bad that there were days I couldn\u2019t move. However, if I didn\u2019t move it would get worse and yet it hurt so badly to move. Catch 22. Anyhow, on those days I would literally force myself to get up and go rock hunting. It was pleasing to me and gave me the incintive to push through the pain. I\u2019d take along a backpack and fill it up. Eventually, my back became stronger and because it did the pain is virtually gone now. Big benefit for me! Which brings me to number three. I\u2019d bring home those rocks and didn\u2019t know what to do with them, so I began doing some landscaping with them. My yard looked awesome, myback felt better and ultimately my piece of mind was restored as well. There are so many benefits to rock collecting , far more than is easily seen. If you have an idea to start, I\u2019d definitely say go for it. I doubt you\u2019ll regret it. ",
