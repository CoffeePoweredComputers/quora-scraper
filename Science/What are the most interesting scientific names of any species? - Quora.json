            "answer_text": "I found this question after a friend told me that a recent trend in biology is to name species in honor of a contemporary celebrity, to spark people's interest in the species, or in biology in general. Of course, the custom of naming species after people is not at all new. But after finding out about this, I ended up on the Wikipedia page dedicated specifically to organisms named after famous people.  And below is a selection of my favorites from that page: Crikey steveirwini (after Steve Irwin)Aleiodes shakirae (after Shakira - because this species infests a caterpillar which as a result tries to reduce the discomfort by... shaking its bum)Captaincookia (after James Cook)Gagadon minimonstrum (after Lady Gaga)Mozartella beethoveni (after both Mozart and Beethoven, but I'm throwing in my guess that it's also after mozzarella)Nanochtulhu lovecrafti (after H.P. Lovecraft and of course his famous creation, Chtulhu)Scaptia beyonceae (a fly named after Beyonc\u00e9, for the reasoning that it has a \"striking golden behind\")Sylvilagus palustris hefneri (after Hugh Hefner... and you bet your pointy ears it's a species of rabbit!)",

            "answer_text": "I can't claim that I actually knew this (I'm an engineer, not a biologist) but this question reminded me of a great entry on the website Futility Closet that has always stuck in my mind: Certain wasps belong to the genus Heerz. So an entomologist named Paul Marsh named two new wasp species Heerz tooya and Heerz lukenatcha. Here's an excerpt from Futility Closet: The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature insists that \u201cA zoologist should not propose a name that, when spoken, suggests a bizarre, comical, or otherwise objectionable meaning.\u201d But a few get through. Examples:\u00b7        Vini vidivici (parrot)  - I believe this is actually called the Conquered Parrot and is in fact extinct.\u00b7        Apopyllus now (spider)\u00b7        Lalapa lusa (wasp)\u00b7        Agra vation (beetle)\u00b7        Phthiria relativitae (bee fly)\u00b7        Pison eyvae (wasp)\u00b7        Ba humbugi (snail)\u00b7        Eubetia bigaulae (\u201cyou betcha by golly\u201d) (moth) Three mythicomyiid flies are named Pieza kake, Pieza pi, and Pieza deresistans. In 1912 the Zoological Society of London criticized entomologist George Kirkaldy for giving a series of hemipterans the generic names Polychisme, Elachisme, Marichisme, Dolichisme, Florichisme, and Ochisme (\u201cPolly kiss me,\u201d \u201cElla kiss me,\u201d \u201cMary kiss me,\u201d \u201cDolly kiss me,\u201d \u201cFlora kiss me,\u201d \u201cOh, kiss me!\u201d). In the same spirit, in 2002 a hopeful Neal Evenhuis named a fossil mythicomyiid Carmenelectra shechisme. \u201cThe offer\u2019s still good,\u201d he told the Chicago Tribune in 2008. \u201cI\u2019ll be willing to meet her.\u201d Source: Futility Closet ",
