            "answer_text": "If there need to be two forces, i would firsthand mention intermolecular forces and gravitational forces. The strength or weakness of intermolecular forces determines the state of matter of a substance (e.g., solid, liquid, gas) and some of the chemical properties (e.g., melting point, structure). Solar nebula is a product of a fragment of Molecular cloud (stellar nursery), which is composed of molecules Gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud forms solar nebula from which the Sun and the protoplanetary disk is created Gravity, or namely self-gravity is what brings the nebula together, while intermolecular forces keep the nursery alive.
