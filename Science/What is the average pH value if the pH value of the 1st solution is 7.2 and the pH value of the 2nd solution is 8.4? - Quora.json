            "answer_text": "The question is not clear and well-defined. If the question is \u201cIf equal volumes of two-solutions with pH= 7.2 and 8.4 are mixed then what is the pH of the resulting mixture? From the pH values, both the solutions are basic in nature. So pOH of I-solution= 14\u20137.2= 6.8 The pOH of II- Solution= 14- 8.4= 5.6 [OH-] Conc.of I-solution= 10^-6.8 =1.585x10^-7 [OH-] Conc. of II-solution=10^-5.6 =2.512x10^-6 Average conc. of both solutions = [(1.585x10^-7)+ (2.512 x 10^-6) ] \u00f7 2 =1.3352 x 10^-6 M. pOH of the mixture= - log(1.3352 x 10^-6) = 5.874. So pH= 14.000 - 5.874 = 8.126 ",
