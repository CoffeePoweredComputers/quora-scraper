            "answer_text": "Many of you have heard of Stephen Hawking\u2019s time travel party in which he hosted a party that he didn\u2019t tell anyone about, then sent the invitations the next day. Since nobody showed up for the party, he \u201cproved\u201d that time travel doesn\u2019t exist! But there\u2019s a problem with that. For someone who could actually travel through time, what would it prove if they showed up at the party? If I could dance the cha-cha while lifting 100 pounds over my head and singing The Star Spangled Banner, why should I care if you believe I could do it or not? (Unless, of course, we found ourselves in some highly specific circumstances that required that particular set of talents\u2026 \u201cAll we have is this 100-pound weight! How are we going to get close enough to that weird yet dangerous group of Cubans and very patriotic Americans to take out their leader?\u201d \u201cFollow me. I have an idea\u2026\u201d) All it really proves is that nobody from the future wanted to party with Stephen Hawking. And really, why would they? \u201cHey, Future Steve. What do you want to do tonight?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Future Donna\u2026 We could go to this really boring party in the past that I heard about. I mean, nobody ever showed up or anything, but \u2026 free booze, I guess?\u201d (It\u2019s important to note that, while this conversation does take place in the future, \u201cFuture\u201d is Steve and Donna\u2019s family name. In the future, as it turns out, everyone has switched to the Eastern order to make things easier for future database administrators. And Future database administrators, for that matter\u2026) String theory doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent the notion of time travel, but it does prevent propagating changes. Meaning that if someone were to go back to the past, they couldn\u2019t change anything that happened because it always happened exactly that way the first time around. There\u2019s also the problem with space travel as it relates to time travel because our planet is constantly moving through space as well as time, so it\u2019s also possible that time travel exists and people keep getting sent back to random empty pockets of space. Incidentally, this is another way around the paradox problem\u2026 \u201cWe keep sending people back and we keep existing, so I guess time travel is safe!\u201d Meanwhile, the frozen corpses of thousands of people are drifting through the inky void, all dressed in different era-appropriate costumes\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Time travel is possible, but as far as I\u2019m aware, only in the forward direction. It also requires a pretty extreme environment, and it only really happens relatively. For example, one way forward time travel could occur, is using black holes. Supposedly, black holes warp the time and space around them. Basically, time passes faster near black holes. So let\u2019s set up a hypothetical scenario to understand this. Imagine it\u2019s the year 2100. You\u2019re on a space research mission, orbiting a small black hole for 1 year. You can\u2019t enter the black hole, mind you, your very atoms would be ripped to shreds, but as long as you stay a safe distance from the event horizon, you\u2019ll be okay. After your year of orbiting has concluded, you are teleported back to earth to find that 4 years have passed by there. It\u2019s now 2104, and it only took you 1 year to get there! As far as we know, time is a continuum. It goes in the forward direction. There are potentially ways to speed time up, so you experience it faster than others do, therefore you\u2019d technically time travel. But we aren\u2019t going to see anyone from the future any time soon. Plus, backwards time travel would be very paradoxical. Think about the Butterfly Affect. The idea that even small occurences throughout history could\u2019ve drastically altered what happens in the future. Take, for example, Hitler. Some of you might know he wanted to be a painter when he grew up, but was rejected. Eventually, he, well, took a different route to fame. Imagine if someone went back in time and allowed him to be a painter. Would WW2 ever have happened? Would some other, even more catastrophic conflict occurred instead? What if the time traveller\u2019s great grandpa was a Jew, trying to escape Europe during Hitler\u2019s reign. If WW2 never happened, he would\u2019ve never fled Europe, therefore might\u2019ve married someone else or lived elsewhere, had different kids or none at all, etc. But wait. That would mean the time traveller wouldn\u2019t exist. But then he couldn\u2019t alter time if he never existed in the first place. But if time weren\u2019t altered, then he WOULD exist! See? Be thankful you don\u2019t see people from the future. You think the world\u2019s fucked up now, just you wait!! ",
