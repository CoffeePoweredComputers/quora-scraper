            "answer_text": "A free body diagram is a sum total depiction of all of forces acting upon the body inclusive of the resulting or causative shears, moments and reactions - keeping the body in resultant equilibrium. There is nothing that is amiss. The free body diagram can be that of a member, multiple members or segment of a member. The force diagram on the other hand simply shows the forces acting on the body in direction and magnitude. The diagram as well might be that of external forces alone. It might as well just not show the stable whole of the body which comes into being as a result of the causative actions. ",
