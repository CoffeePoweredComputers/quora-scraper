            "answer_text": "I would argue that a probability distribution is a statement of your current state of knowledge over an uncertain outcome. It may or may not be informed by data and frequency estimations of outcomes. Data on frequency may simply not be available. Consider that probabilities can exist for events that only happen once and for events that have never happened yet. A probability distribution is how one reasons about the unknown. It\u2019s an expression of what one knows and what one doesn\u2019t. Therefore, it isn\u2019t a physical quantity or attribute. It can be informed by physical qunatities, but it isn\u2019t one itself. Consider this. We have never met. You provide a coin from your own pocket and I ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the probability that flipping that coin will come up heads?\u201d Most would answer [math]\\frac{1}{2}[/math]. This is because we all have this common knowledge and set of beliefs about fair coins. Those beliefs might also be informed by observing data from many coin flips. However, if after we met, I did some card tricks, some slight of hand magic, impressed you with my trickery, and then asked you pull a coin out of your pocket, and said \u201cMy favorite side of the coin is heads. What is the probability that would come up heads?\u201d Would you be so quick to argue that the answer was [math]\\frac{1}{2}[/math]? Most would hesitate, and some might argue it\u2019s probably greater than [math]\\frac{1}{2}[/math]. Why? Because now you know something more. It has nothing to do with what you know about the coin. It was still your coin after all. But you know something about me, and the situation, and it would lead you to believe that it\u2019s not going to be a fair flip. But you don\u2019t have any data on this experience. So, the probability is not an attribute of the coin. It\u2019s a statement of what you know. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, probability distribution is a generic formula to which the geometry of probalistic outcomes of a large number of events will converge to. Please note that although we have ideas like these distributions in the popular ones like Gaussian, Boltzmann, Poisson etc, the underlying fact and motive of the study is to be able to predict the outcome of one single event. Each event stands alone in all the experiments, they are all mapped down to outcomes which are just elements on S. Then we create partitions of these outcomes and assign random variables X[or whichever alphabet you like in Upper case] which actually talks about all the probabilities below a specific value. What this basically does is making it easy for us to understand the increasing/decreasing nature of probabilities or say clubbing the events in the terms of probabilities. So does it mean that values of X cannot be above 1? No. They can have any random values so far as there is a function to determine a value for each outcome. Tossing a coin, number of handshakes, blah, blah, blah are not more important than a highschool textbook written to get a kid to understand the idea of math in chance of an event. Although a heads and a tails are equiprobably by logic of mathematics, 10 events of tossing may get you 7 or 8 straight H or Ts. Does this mean that that probability lesson was just waste of so worthy trees and inks and printing machine's time? No, the idea is and has always been that these definitions are strikingly accurate in predicting outcomes when a large number of them are considered. If you go to a text which is not entirely about just formulae, it will probably tell you that probability calculation is not always of frequency form, a lot of it is often calculated experimentally as frequency view is very convenient to be realistic at all in so many instances. Now, the density/derivative of this probability of random variable is called a probability density function which basically is the idea of relative chance of random variable taking a value within a range. The dataset with a lot of experimental outcomes of an event like likelihood of electrons getting from valance band to conduction band are studied experimentally and found to fit to an approximate mathematical expression that may then be integrated to get us the random variable. This expression, my friend, is probability distribution. The beauty of nature is that there actually are mathematical expressions which convinsingly accurately give the curve within which the values of probability of random variable can be found, there are identifiable peaks or say regions which give the highest probable events in terms of probability of random variable used; since this is done on a dataset of several thousands of outcomes, they can be seen as 'the pattern' for the outcomes and hence the 'prediction' that we sought.
