            "answer_text": "dNTP stands for deoxyribose nucleoside triphospate. These molecules are your nucleotides in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The specific acronym for each nucleotide in a PCR are as follows: cNTP (cytosine), gNTP (guanine), aNTP (adenine), and tNTP (thymine). The role that dNTP\u2019s have in a PCR are to allow the extension of your primed DNA strand. Once the double stranded DNA has been separated and the primers are annealed (attached); the polymerase (usually TAC1) will use these dNTP\u2019s to extend a strand of DNA that is complementary to the primed strand of DNA. dNTP\u2019s are very important to the extension of your DNA strand. The name \u201cde-oxy\u201d refers to the missing oxygen or hydroxyl group on the 3\u2032 end of the sugar structure (ribose). The reason extension is possible is due to the missing oxygen on 3\u2032 end of the ribose. Allowing one hydroxyl group to exist on the 3\u2032 end of the sugar ,instead of two, allows the polymerase to attach the 5\u2032 end of the next dNTP to the 3\u2032 end of the bound dNTP via a phospodiester bond. 5\u2032-sugar-3\u2032~~~5\u2032-sugar-3\u2032 The extension of your DNA strand will continue as long as there is enough template(strand being replicated) DNA and dNTP\u2019s. The polymerase will keep binding a dNTP to the the hydroxyl end of the previous dNTP until one or both of the previous conditions are met (time is also a factor since cycles of extension usually last for a specific amount of time). Whooo, that was wordy, but the jargon is necessary for a biological understanding. It is possible to dive deeper into the subject, but dNTP\u2019s are like chain links. When it comes to PCR, one chain link (dNTP) is added on to the next link until you have a chain (DNA strand). <><><><><><><><>   Hope this helps, cheers ",

            "answer_text": "The purpose of the deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) is to supply the \u201cbricks.\u201d Since the idea behind PCR is to synthesize a virtually unlimited amount of a specific stretch of double-stranded DNA, the individual DNA bases must be supplied to the polymerase enzyme. This much is obvious. What might not be as obvious is the fact that the PCR reaction requires energy. The only source of that energy is the \u03b2 and \u03b3 phosphates of the individual dNTPs. One useful hint here: while the PCR buffer and the MgCl2 will stand up to repeated freezing and thawing, the dNTPs are a different story. It is best to obtain them commercially as a 10 mM dNTP mix and to immediately aliquot them into smaller working volumes such that only a fraction of the original dNTP supply is ever thawed out at any one time. The remainder remains frozen until needed and should not cause any difficulty. ",
