            "answer_text": "Management Science is a vague topic that could be one of a few areas: when you study statistics in Business, it\u2019s often about forecasting and being able to make good business decisions (ie. Business Analysis). Sometimes they\u2019ll call this Business Science or Management Science or Statistics For Business or whatever title that school came up with.At a graduate level, it\u2019s probably referring to the Management and Leadership theories and academic research and study of these topics. Also, since most Masters Of Science (MSc) programs require a Thesis, it\u2019s a way to allow business management/MBA/etc folk to do a legitimate science masters thesis on the topic of Management. By contrast, some programs will only be MA programs if you don\u2019t do a thesis (even in the same courses/topics/concentration), so having both an MA non-Thesis and MSc Thesis option allows them to serve a greater overall education market.More into the research of this, Leadership can be high-level and hard to operationalize for research. But, a good Management Theory should be more crunchy and specific- LMX being a great example. This allows more measure and behooves good social science research, like experimental vs control group stuff, or A/B, or quasi-experimental (non-randomized), research designs. In that way, Management Science is anything dealing with the research and measure around a management topic. By contrast, it\u2019s hard to measure or falsify or improve, say, Authentic Leadership, or whatever doesn\u2019t lend itself to experimental research easily.",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know of a specific definition for the term Management Science. Lacking any other context for the question, I can guess an answer. Maybe you are referring to Scientific Management. In 1911, Frederick Winslow Taylor published a paper titled \u201cThe Principles of Scientific Management.\u201d In the paper he argued that management of people should be based on scientific ideas and data, not only experience and common sense. Some cite this paper and his work as the beginning of management as a modern profession. ",
