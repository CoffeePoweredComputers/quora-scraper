            "answer_text": "It is a complex topic, but it is not a mental illness. Therapy is generally not helpful and often harmful when the goal is change of preference. Theories about causation of homosexuality have changed enormously over the last forty years. When I was in training, the explanation was that there might be some biological contribution but the psychological etiology was important. Male homosexuality was attributed to an immaturity--a failure to successfully negotiate certain developmental tasks--i.e. to satisfactorily resolve the Oedipus complex with his father, so that women could be seen as the main love object. A similar path with was described for women--giving up mother to see men as the main love object. Confused?  Well, when you observe little children, they do love the parent of the opposite sex fiercely. This is around ages 3-5. Does this behavior, though, define sexual preference? Children who grow up to be homosexuals also go through this triangular drama--and if this was the sole cause, you would expect that they would show opposite gender preference from toddler-hood on, and they don't.  Bisexuals were said to have poor \"object constancy,\" which is the ability or inability to hold a picture of an object in your mind. An example of this would be how when a woman thinks of romance, she sees a man in her mind's eye--her imagination. She equates love with men. A bisexual woman might see a man or she might see a woman. Love doesn't have a specific gender for her.  2 year olds don't have object constancy. \"The blanket game\" is a way to show this. Mother and 2 year old are playing. Then mother puts a blanket over her head and \"disappears.\" The baby cries. She doesn't know that mother still exists under the blanket. Fast forward one year. The baby has developed to a point where she knows that although she can't see mother, mother is still there, just hidden by the blanket. People with a lack of object constancy experience the temporary absence of something as a permanent disappearance. A 2 year old will experience that with everything. Adults who have certain kinds of issues (abandonment, abuse by one gender or the other)will have poor object constancy with objects related to the traumatic experience.  A bisexual then would theoretically be unable (in her mind's eye) to psychologically remember that men exist as love objects when she sees a desirable woman.  This, though, doesn't necessarily explain sexual preference. Is it mental illness if a woman (say) likes men, but occasionally likes women, too? There may be an explanation for this, but it is not mental illness.  There is another interesting phenomenon called \"fluidity\" occurring more commonly in lesbians--which is a complete shift in preference from one gender to another. Usually, the shift occurs once. There's no conscious thought about making the change.  As homosexuality was described more clearly, it became clearer that even when a feeling was explained adequately by a psychological theory,  there was no proof that the feeling led to a given behavior. As psychological explanations were viewed with more suspicion, homosexuality was then thought to have been caused by \"biological factors.\"  Whatever those were.  There was also loose talk about genetics. It became important that no one feel blamed, sick or unhappy.  Then the human genome was mapped and it was found that there are no genes for homosexuality. None.  \"Biology\" was lost as one of the murky reasons why people are homosexual.  Then the psychological theories got a work-over--male homosexuals were believed to want a loving father figure because their own father was absent, abusive or non-loving.  Lesbians loved women because their mothers were the only safe people to love. But how does this explain lesbianism in a woman who has a great relationship with her father, and maybe even her mother, too? How does this explain a male homosexual who feels loved and respected by his father, who is also a great guy?  The next explanation makes me feel a little crazy. Homosexuality is now said to be due to \"epigenetics,\" which could loosely trace back to environment, or family or psychology. A nasty vicious circle--especially if you are looking for a reason to discriminate against, or condone violence against homosexuals.  Homosexuality is a variant of heterosexuality. You can say it the other way, too: heterosexuality is a variant of homosexuality. It is limiting and probably wrong to label one the \"normal\" way and the other the \"abnormal\" way. It is fiercely unpopular to question the normalcy of heterosexuality, these days, ironically, given the history of discrimination against homosexuals. But that has also made it fiercely unpopular to question, hypothesize or do research on causes of homosexuality. Historically, theories about homosexuality have been used to condone discrimination or mistreatment.  So even if  such research could be funded, at this point, any theories could be construed as a reason to deprive homosexuals of their rights. Cause could be equated with abnormality.  So can such research ever be done? Probably not for awhile. The history of violence and discrimination against homosexuals is too recent. Some forms of prejudice are still present.  Lots of people equate it to a sin against God. So we may not find out for quite awhile what causes homosexuality--or for that matter, heterosexuality. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a complex topic. Before 1973, homosexuality actually was considered a \"mental illness\", at least by the psychiatrists that authored edition 2 of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II).  In edition 3, it was reclassified as normal, see: When Homosexuality Came Out (of the DSM) - Mad In America But just because a phenomenon is considered by some to be a \"mental illness\" doesn't mean it actually is.  Even the very notion of mental illness is controversial.  There are behavioral patterns, psychological makeups, and syndromes that may or may not be in alignment with the dominant social norms of the day, and when a behavior deviates sufficiently far from what people with \"authority\" think is common, then someone somewhere labels the behavior deviant, or an illness. As one psychiatrist quipped, what might be considered obsessive-compulsive disorder in America today, might be seen as a healthy desire to maintain a spotless home in, say, Germany or Japan. The definition of \"mental illness\" that is emerging in the mental health field today focuses on whether a behavior pattern is dysfunctional or not. If someone is not having a problem getting along in the world, then there is no illness. In the 1600s, there were \"witch hunts\" in which women, identified by their \"bizarre\" behavior, were ostracized and killed. Their behavior was \"dysfunctional\" in the sense that it led to their ostracism from society, however this \"dysfunction\" was entirely manufactured by society and the women were the unwitting victim. So even with \"functional\" as a definition of illness, one needs to be cautious in defining which problems are the result of the individual and which are ultimately the fault of a society that is being rigid and judgmental. As recently as 1980, \"hysteria\" was classified as a mental disorder affecting only women until it was deleted from the DSM. For homosexuality specifically, the main arguments for it being an \"illness\" are: some rationale about procreationthe trouble it can cause people in their lives due to non-acceptanceits arguably low frequency (less than 10% of society)The main flaws in the \"mental illness\" claims are that: people with this \"condition\" lead happy successful liveshomosexuality has been a phenomenon for as long as recorded historyit seems to have a biological basis (from studies on rodents) and is present in other species.its arguably high frequency (as much as 10% of society)Ultimately, the concept of a \"mental illness\" is a new and constantly evolving idea, and it's not clear why homosexuality should be treated differently from any other sexual preference (e.g. blonds vs. brunettes). If the importance of procreation were really the dominant argument, then celibate priests and people not wanting children could be considered sexually deviant as well. ",

            "answer_text": "For the longest time it was considered a mental illness. Being a homosexual, I'm not entirely convinced it is not. However, an illness is something that causes disease. It can genetic or caught. Homosexuality does not fall into this category. I do not consider it a personal choice. I knew I was \" different\" before I knew there were two uses for my penis. NOBODY would choose ridicule, shame or not being able to have children. I believe a current theory is that since the youngest boy in a family of boys is vastly more likely to to be homosexual, It would be advantageous to have a non breeding male to help rear his nephews as they carry the my genes. I think the the Bible, (if you actually take as a literal history of man), put it in there so more babys wiuld be produced. At that time, the world needed more people to flourish. I could elaborate quite a bit more but it's 3 am and time to punch in. It should be noted that 1/4 of all black swans are exclusively homosexual are very adept at raising young because they are larger and can protect the young . Almost all higher Mamals like sheep, monkeys, etc. exhibit this behavior. To be blunt and honest, when I knew, I tried everything imaginable to become straight - everything fron masterbating to hustler ( my mind would always wander to men) to outright denial. Then I turned to drugs to alleviate the shame. Is it abnormal? Without a doubt. But so is red hair. We are not hurting anybody so Pls let us be. It should also be known that hardly any homosexuals wear makeup and have feathers in their hair. NOBODY believes I am a homosexual untill they meet my partner, and even then, I have to kiss him for them to believe. HOLLYWOOD created the current stereotype of what a homosexual should look like. Those without role models try emulate what they think a homo should act like. Hope that helps ",

            "answer_text": "No. I met homophobes long before I met a homosexual. The adolescent vocabulary holds a number critical terms, and the word \u201cQueer\u201d ranks high among adolescent pejoratives, notable by the likelihood the speaker has no idea what it means; its just demeaning. For an insecure young person on the threshold of a sexual identity and experiencing incomprehensible feelings, homophobia identified a group he would like to be part of. This could be just a short lived phase, but in some cases he feels an innocent attraction to another male would end in a rejection from the group. He becomes defensive and belligerent, setting course for full blown bigotry. It bothered me that there was a false note in his denial. I didn\u2019t like that. Some time later I met an effeminate person I liked. Where my bigot acquaintances sounded false, I saw something like truth in this person, who was liked by people I liked. I really didn\u2019t think about it. In fact I was totally intrigued by a pretty girl. If it hadn\u2019t been before, my die was cast. As a consequence of living in a particular place I continued to encounter a number of racial bigots. Hamlet would have said \u201cThey protest too much..\u201d I recognized they were using hate to vent the pain of something else. I majored in Psychology and found reasonable explanations for this behavior. This was in the late sixties and homosexuality was still a legal no-no. I thought that was wrong. Navy Flight School came after graduation, and with it came an intense identification with the others in my Flight Class, including a guy named Greg. He was a consummate pilot, organized and unflappable, who like designing and sewing women\u2019s clothing. It was also apparent he liked dressing women, rather than undressing women, one of my aspirations. He came back from Viet Nam with an amazing number of medals. He was a Holy Terror in a Huey with rocket pods. He was (or I hope, is) gay, content with himself and un-bothered by Homophobes. He is not sick. Back to my Bigots. They are sick. Life has failed them. It\u2019s all someone else\u2019s fault. Hate is their only relief. Guns are their great equalizers. Healthy people don\u2019t need equalizers. ",

            "answer_text": "Today it is not classified as a mental illness. The biggest reason it is not classified is due to wanting to rid the stigma associated with being LGBTQ. When you label someone with a mental illness society has a tendency to treat people less favorable. In their reevaluation of homosexuality, they realized that most of the mental health components associated with homosexuality had more to do with how the world treated them, and how they saw themselves rather than the actual sexual identity. In the 1970s they officially removed it in the DSM. With this being said, there are still many psychologist and psychiatrist that still believe there is a mental/emotional aspect in the development of homosexuality. There seems to be a strong environmental correlation to it\u2019s onset, with a higher than average amount of individuals coming from abusive families where sexual abuse occurred in childhood. Although not scientific, my own personal sampling of close friends/family in the LGBTQ community seem to also agree with these statistics. 6 out of 10 have related having been sexually abused or had emotionally abusive fathers. So although there is not a clinical diagnosis today for homosexuality, I do believe there is support in literature and in practice that homosexuality may be a result of some sort of childhood trauma that causes an individual to have a subconscious fear of the sex that hurt them (more in Lesbians) or as in other mental illness like eating disorders, or sadomachosistic behavior, there is a need to regain a sense of control. But these of course are just theories. Psychology is not an exact science. If you don\u2019t like one theory, just move on to the next one. ",

            "answer_text": "I might define mental illness differently to others. I define it as when something is not working as it should, and requires a medical intervention to help it to work properly. For example, if you drink a bottle of whiskey you have a real chemical imbalance in your brain. You can\u2019t walk straight, think straight, and your liver may not forgive you, but you are not considered to have an illness, everything is working as it should given the circumstances. If someone has a phobia of spiders, it is a way of thinking and feeling about something that is perfectly understandable. If you look at that fear you will probably find the reason for it and be able to resolve that to peaceful and calm. This does work: a friend of mine tells me that they stared at the big spider thinking, \u201cthis is interesting we have never been here before what am I supposed to do with you now I\u2019m not afraid of you?\u201d Is a phobia of spiders a mental illness, even though it can create an extreme, even hysterical reaction? As far as I know the brain is working perfectly well, memories are working ok, emotions are definitely in play. The reason for it can be identified and resolved. Most of what people think of as a mental illness, when analysed in detail, turns out to be perfectly understandable. It may not look rational to you, but if you had been through what they have been through, you would react in the same way. Therefore you cannot really designate something as a mental illness until you have looked at all known and understandable emotional issues. When you have resolved everything that has an explanation, only then can you suppose that what does not respond might be a genuine mental illness. Since there is not a single person currently on the planet that has resolved all of their emotional problems, it is very unlikely that you get to discount all understood causes. Looking at things this way, in 20 years as a therapist I have never seen an actual mental illness, other than that which has actually been caused by medications, ECT, brain-damage or dementia. With regard to homosexuality, its no different to hetrosexuality, everyone has emotional issues to work through, and I would encourage anyone to go deep to resolve any and every negative emotion that they have. Every anxiety, every worry, insecurity, feelings of rejection, and so on; we all need lots of work. What I would like to say though, is that I have met some gay guys, who had issues which have a profound effect on how they feel about themselves and their relationships, and their feelings changed as they had therapy for those issues. Some of those issues led guys to think that they were gay, even though they themselves later realised that they weren\u2019t. It does happen. I have also met a couple of people with DID/MPD who had some gay personalities and some straight ones, although they are technically the same person in different states of amnesia. Therefore, I don\u2019t think that anyone should put a label on themselves, at least until they have made sure that all of the negative nurture influences have been resolved. You, me, every person owes it to themselves to find out who they really are, not who their parents dressed them up to be, not who their fears tell them to be, their peers, their neediness, or pain. Especially since all of those negative things can be resolved, they shouldnt be allowed to define who anyone is. Designating something as a mental illness basically an attempt to label, categorise, and prejudicially relate to the label, rather than relating to the person, as, you know, a person. Don\u2019t do that, it doesnt help anyone. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it definitely is not and I feel it is illogical to assume so. I am a straight female and I\u2019ve never been attracted to the same sex; not physically, emotionally, or sexually. I could not \u201cforce\u201d myself to like and/or fall in love with someone of the same sex. Same goes for homosexuals, they didn\u2019t ask to be the way they are, they just are. It\u2019s already destined for them. Most homosexuals that I have spoken with said they already knew they felt \u201cdifferent\u201d at a very young age. A straight person does not and cannot control who they find of the opposite sex to be attractive. It\u2019s instinctive for us to automatically feel an attraction towards whoever we find appealing. You know the feeling you get upon first seeing someone, the feeling that speaks subconsciously, your brain saying \u201chey that one is attractive, they are someone who I would like to talk to and get to know, someone that may be a potential mate\u201d. It\u2019s already hardwired in the brain to automatically respond to that, it\u2019s one of the few animalistic behaviors that we still have that is innate. It\u2019s an old \u201csurvival tactic\u201d, if that makes sense, that humans have carried for thousands of years. Well, all of the above also applies to homosexuals as well. They cannot avert an instinctive, innate behavior. So their mind works the same as a straight person\u2019s when it comes to attraction, it\u2019s just that their attraction is to the same sex. Do you think a straight person would try to intentionally force themselves to be attracted to the same sex? Of course not, because that\u2019s impossible; it doesn\u2019t work that way! So, think of that from a homosexual\u2019s perspective. They simply cannot force themselves to be attracted to the opposite sex. Their brain works just the same as a straight person\u2019s. The only difference is that they find the same sex attractive. They aren\u2019t sick, mentally ill, or anything of the sort; that\u2019s just nonsense! ",

            "answer_text": "No. I just taught a class of college students about this.   The reason it's not is not just about stigma and acceptance.  Panic Disorder is a mental health diagnosis, and yet we should not think that people with panic disorder are bad.  We can accept both gays and people with OCD, but only OCD is a mental illness.  Part of the reason for this is that OCD can have a negative impact on your daily functioning and involve emotional distress.  Question I challenged my college students with:  Homosexuality can, for some, be associated with anxiety, depression, and other distress, and can even lead to lifestyle problems like interpersonal conflicts, so why isn't it a mental disorder like other mind-body conditions associated with mental distress? Answer my students had trouble finding, because they were focused on the acceptance issue: Homosexuality, though associated with distress for some, is not a mental disorder because the distress is not caused by homosexuality itself, it's caused by the contrast between one's sexuality and society:  discriminative policies, bigoted attitudes, and internalized shame and confusion.  I hope we don't assume that calling a condition a mental illness means that we're saying that it's morally wrong.  Does classifying Gambling Addiction as a mental disorder lead to anti-gambler actions?  People creating diagnoses are not the cause of stigma and bigotry. The bigotry was already there, and the bigotry is the real problem, and that's the clinical reason that homosexuality is not itself the cause of distress or dysfunction and thus is not a mental or behavioral disorder.  One final way to frame the point I'm making; the purpose of labeling something as a mental disorder is to suggest a focus for treatment.  Gambling addiction was added to the DSM not because gamblers are bad, but to say that some problem gamblers need addiction treatment, and to define how we can tell it's gotten to that point.   Homosexuality is not a condition that needs to be cured or treated. ",

            "answer_text": " No. What may be a good read is: \u201cHow psychology has helped society accept homosexuality: Attitude change and acceptance have been facilitated through psychological science.\u201d on the APA website[1]. The short history lesson explains early psychologists primarily were learning about homosexuality from convicts and committed persons, which led to a belief that there was a connection. An excerpt: Evelyn Hooker, a brave psychologist at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), began undoing this belief in the early 1950s. A gay former student told her, \"Evelyn, it is your scientific duty to study men like me.\" Hooker agreed, \"He's right \u2014 we know nothing about them.\" (cited in Burr, 1993). When she told the psychiatry department chair she wanted to study normal homosexuals, he replied, \"There is no such person!\" (Hooker, 1993, p. 450[2]). The efforts to destigmatize homosexuality and distance it from mental illness is outlined in the article from the perspective of expanding psychological science. The unfortunate past of regarding homosexuality as mental disease makes it difficult to have conversations about non-heterosexuality and the greater risk for psychiatric disorders, not related directly to the psycho-social conflicts arising from being homosexual. It can be difficult to have a conversation when the premise of sexual preference as a mental health risk factor strongly feels as if psychologists are implying co-morbidity. The avoidance of researching anything other than outcomes, instead up origins, can do as much disservice as when homosexuality was thought to be a mental health disorder in itself. The concerns of the community in trying to separate from a biological association entirely (as many LGBT+ do not have mental health disorders) are starting to be shared more openly, such as in: LGBT people are prone to mental illness. It\u2019s a truth we shouldn\u2019t shy away from | Alexander Leon Higher Risk of Mental Health Problems for Homosexuals Even back in 1999, a research project wrote: \u201cNo Topic has caused the field of psychiatry more controversy than homosexuality, and articles in this issue of the ARCHIVES are likely to reopen past controversies and begin new ones. These studies contain arguably the best published data on the association between homosexuality and psychopathology, and both converge on the same unhappy conclusion: homosexual people are at a substantially higher risk for some forms of emotional problems, including suicidality, major depression, and anxiety disorder. Preliminary results from a large, equally well-conducted Dutch generally corroborate these findings. (Archives of General Psychiatry 56(10):883-4 \u00b7 November 1999\u2002)[3] So, no, homosexuality is not a mental illness but mental illness is associated with psychopathology risk factors. Risk factors does not equate to having a condition. The reverse example would be that someone with mental illness would not be expected to be homosexual. There is 100+ answers to this question and plenty of useful resources shared from those answers. I wanted to contribute by acknowledging the above, which I feel was being left out in many answers, likely many in an attempt to divert affiliation. Unfortunately, doing so actually adds to the stigma of mental illness, a prejudice itself. A useful reference point for exploring the topic more comes from the American Psychological Association website on sexual orientation[4]. Another resource can be from the website created by the LGBT Issues Committee / Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP) to teach psychiatry residents [5]about treating mental health concerns of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex patients.

            "answer_text": "It never occurred to me that anyone would think of homosexuality as a mental illness as mental illness is defined! All medical reliable research shows that people are hard wired in the womb as to their sexuality. There are several theories and areas of current study to determine if it is hormonally related, genetically predisposed, etc. Many are studies of identical twins sharing DNA where one is straight and the other is gay. Sexuality is on a spectrum like so many other characteristics that make us who we are! If one were to put \u201ctotally\" homosexual on one end of a spectrum and \u201ctotally\" heterosexual on the other end almost everyone would fall along the spectrum between the two extremes. This doesn't mean they necessarily act on their sexuality. Any mental illness in gay people is most generally caused by the fact that their friends and families and religious and ethnic cultures are not accepting of their sexuality. This can cause anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD, physical illnesses etc. Those homosexuals who are raised in a supporting family and with supporting acceptance are almost always very well adjusted and productive members of society. Many are married and/or living in long term partnerships and have children either through adoption, in vitro, or artificial insemination. Their children are generally very stable also with loving parents. Unfortunately, the tremendous suicide rate of LGBTQ teens is escalating every year. Professionals agree this is NOT due to their sexuality or gender identity. It is because of what society does to them. Our society needs to educate themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Illness is defined[1]as 1 a : wickedness b : unpleasantness 2 a : an unhealthy condition of body or mind b : sickness Homosexuality is neither. It's not unhealthy. You don't suffer biological consequences from being homosexual. Now, I'm sure what you're referring to is the misconception that homosexuality is both sick and curable. But it's neither. I have yet to find a single reason as to how one\u2019s sexual preference affects another human being. Because it doesn't. Who one goes to bed with and has sex with has no impact on others whatsoever. The only time a same-sex relationship would affect someone else is if they're of the same gender and are attracted to one of the people in said relationship. But if that's the case, then you're most likely homosexual to some extent (or bi/any variation of bisexuality). Lastly, \u201cillness\u201d and \u201csickness\u201d both imply that, to some extent, it's possible to either cure it or at the very least \u201clessen\u201d the impact of the \u201cillness\u201d on one\u2019s life. Many times people believe that this is possible through so called \u201cconversion camps,\u201d sometimes also called \u201cstraight camps.\u201d This is where homosexual people are supposed to \u201clearn\u201d that they are sick and actually straight. They're \u201ctaught\u201d how to act according to their gender which in return supposedly helps them be attracted to the opposite-gender. However, you can't unlearn something you didn't learn to begin with. If it was like that, I ask you to do only one thing: For only one minute of your life, imagine being a homosexual. Imagine being with someone of the same gender. Did you try it? Were you successful? Were you gay for just one minute of your life? If you were: Then you're probably not as straight as you thought. But if you failed, then how can being homosexual be a choice? Because, again, an illness implies it's curable. But it's not. If it's curable, you should be able to say \u201cI'm gay now!\u201d and actually be gay. So no, being homosexual is not an \u201cillness.\u201d Footnotes[1] Definition of ILLNESS",

            "answer_text": "A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a diagnosis by a mental health professional of a behavioral or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life. [Source: Wikipedia] You could argue that (practiced) homosexuality is a behavioral pattern that may cause suffering in life. It is a behavioral pattern, because it causes the person to act in a certain way, which is not exactly a choice, as many activists are eager to point out. It does cause suffering in the majority of cultures humans are living in right now due to still widespread stigma and social exclusion. In fact, a sizable amount of people are seeking psychological or psychiatric treatment, because they are homosexual or think they might be and have problems coping with that for a variety of reasons. In the ICD 10 this is diagnosed under F52.8 or F52.9 Unhappiness or confusion related to sexual orientation. F66.0 for adolecents or people who experience changes in orientation. F66.1 if you would prefer to have another orientation than you actually have F66.2 if your sexual orientation gives you trouble in your relationship. So yes, being unhappy or confused about your sexual orientation is officially a mental disorder and you should feel free to seek out professional help, should you feel you might suffer from it. With some luck, your health insurance will even cover it. But your question is: Why not the actual thing? Easy. Because homosexuals are generally not suffering from being homosexual. In the rare case they do, there are a number of codes that diagnose them and offer treatment. When they are happy again, they can stop treatment and continue sleeping with whoever they like. They are \u201chealed\u201d, because they are no longer suffering. (Actually, they will probably be only symptom-free, because these sorts of problems usually don\u2019t go away. It is more like being a sober drunk, but details. ) But wait, does that mean you can \u201cheal\u201d all mental disorders by giving people a lot of happy pills? Well, it is tricky not to interfere with the functioning part, but this is part of what psychiatry is doing. As long as someone is a happy, generally productive member of society, they are not insane. Even if they suffer from something that is on the ICD, such as asexuality. If you don\u2019t want to have sex and are happy with it, your psychologist won\u2019t make you. The only reason homosexuality is explicitly not on the list is to make it absolutely and abundantly clear to everyone that (most) homosexuals are not crazy. So, yes. Even if homosexuality were a mental disorder, most homosexuals would nor have it. Crazy, hmmm? ",

            "answer_text": "No homosexuality is not a mental illness, but coping with being homosexual can manufacture mental and emotional stress, which can lead to needing therapy to accept being homosexual. I actually covered this topic in one of my Human Services classes, and submitted a paper on homosexuality. Science has attempted to prove the theory of how people are born with their homosexuality already formed during the early gestation period. There is a phase in pregnancy that determines the sex of the fetus, sometimes the mother suffers traumatic issues and the result is that the child is born with male or female genitalia, but their mental and emotional leanings are opposite of their genitals designation. There is also scientific conclusion that the stronger testosterone is at certain prenatal times determines how masculine a male fetus will be after birth and into adulthood. Less testosterone leads to the fetus usually developing female genitalia. There are still some professionals that believe that a homosexual person can be cured of being homosexual. I surmise that because of how hectic life is these day, it might account for so many people having bi-sexual orientation. ",

            "answer_text": "Should being a homosexual be considered a mental disorder? \u201cA mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. ... Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional. The causes of mental disorders are often unclear.\u201d Wikipedia Homosexuality was once considered a mental disorder. Frequently, health professionals would study homosexuals in prison or in mental hospitals. And, guess what, they found they were in significant distress or impaired in personal functioning. Not really genius level work there. Then a new breed of mental health professional came along. They were particularly lead by a woman named Evelyn Hooker. She had gay friends, and she used these men to help her find other normal, successful gay men. See, most people were in the closet then, and it was dangerous to be public about your sexuality. In those days, it was not uncommon to treat homosexuality with brain surgery or castration as well as other forms of torture. But once Dr. Hooker began to study and publish, more and more people began to do more careful studies, and they realized that homosexuality did not fit the definition of impairment in personal functioning. In fact, they found that despite the hate and discrimination, homosexuals were establishing stable couples and raising happy families. They have successful careers and achieved high levels of education. They were not sick at all in any way. So, no, while you might harbor a religious objection to gay people, that is probably your mental problem and not the problem of gay people. I frequently read rants where people insist that gay people should get help and seek psychiatric assistance. No credible mental health professional will treat gayness as an illness. Let me restate that for emphasis. No credible mental health professional will treat gayness as an illness. ",

            "answer_text": "Homosexuality was a listed as a mental illness and then it was removed from the DSM in 1969. The reason behind it? It was because psychiatrists decided that homosexuality did not fit the criteria for an illness. How so? Illness is a concept created by people. In the past many behaviors were not an illness, but they are now. ADHD for example, was not an illlness until the psychiatrists believe so. Those behaviors existed but they were not called a mental illness. Other behaviors have fallen off the mental illness list in similar fashion. Hysteria, for example, was the single most popular diagnosis in the early stage of psychiatry. They have fallen off because the psychiatrists decided that it makes more sense that way. finally, your logic is woefully ignorant. Sexual behaviors come in a variety of color, and society standard determines whether or not they are normal, illegal, or a mental illness. You assume that attraction towards the opposite sex who are adults and who are not your family is the only \u201chealthy\u201d way. What if there are more than one way to be healthy? You said that incest is a mental Illness. It could be. Now, what is incest? Outside of the ancestor, descendant, sibling realm, each cultue defines incest differently. Some cultures, you have be more then 3 degree removed away. Some cultures, first cousins can marry. In ancient China, people of the same last name can't marry, but cousins on the mother side can get married. In ancient Egypt, incest in royal bloodline is mandatory! The bottom line is, people come up with the concept of illness, and then people also come up with the concept of accaptable sexual behavior. Those standards are imposed by the authorities and then spread to the population, but each population has a different standard. What is popular at the time will be what determines society behaviorl So why is homosexuality not a mental illness? Because those who have authority said so. If you are still reading: why is depression an illness and not just a sad feeling? Well it was a sad feeling for thousand of years, until the authorities said otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "That is something of a loaded question! I think I am right in saying that Freud defined any sexual activity that does not lead even very indirectly to the procreation of the species as a \u2018perversion\u2019 of the sexual drive. So cross-dressing would not be a \u2018perversion\u2019 if it lead to intercourse between members of the opposite sex, but homosexuality might qualify. However, Freud was using the word \u2018perverse\u2019 in a very technical sense, not as a disparagement, or a moral condemnation. He was taking the long view, and trying to understand himself and others. He wrote that \u2018sex has no object\u2019, meaning in our modern understanding, that he thought the sex drive was a genetic instinct, but that sexual preference is psychological and contingent. So young children have instinctual sexual feelings - you see male babies having erections - but these feelings are \u2018polymorphously perverse\u2019 - i.e. they are quite indiscriminate - and become attached to the opposite or the same sex only during development, through the psychological process of \u2018identification\u2019, typically identification with a mother or father. So when Freud says something is \u2018perverse\u2019 he means that the evolutionary aim of something is not being met, not that something is \u2018wrong\u2019 or a \u2018mental illness\u2019. Indeed in Freud\u2019s theory one could say that homosexuality is not a mental illness, it is simply the circumstance that a child during her development has made an identification with her father, instead of her mother. If she does this, in identification with her father\u2019s choices, she may be sexually attracted to the same objects her father preferred, that is other women. Of course, if the society we live in does not have such a tolerant view, then because our homosexual identification is so important to us (sex being so compelling) we may suffer mental health issues as a result of being a member of a denigrated minority.

            "answer_text": "As many of the other people answering this question have said, homosexuality cannot be classified as a mental illness. Decades ago, in the medical school we learned about the development of sexuality in the growing child. Keep in mind that decades ago, sexuality of any kind was taught and talked about in whispers and without much in-depth discussion. In any case, we were taught that a growing child goes through three phases of sexual development, called auto-erotic, homo-erotic, and hetero-erotic. As the puberty sets in, the first tendency is to get fascinated with one's own body organs. As we were taught then, after the auto-erotic phase, the adolescent person goes through a period when there is a sexual attraction towards members of the same sex. Both of these phases are brief, and finally give way to the sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Going through those phases, we were taught, was perfectly normal. Using that model of human sexuality, one may postulate that some people, for one reason or another, do not progress beyond the homo-erotic phase. If one can accept that idea, one can think of steps that may help to steer the growing adolescent population towards a more generally accepted pattern of sexuality. But before going into a discussion of the specific measures, I would like to share an observation about this issue. The sexual attraction between the male and female of any species is so strong, and the stigma of being homosexual, at least until recently, was so devastating that one cannot dismiss the homosexual behavior merely as a (wrong) choice. Additionally, once a person has declared his/her choice, it is my belief that any psychological treatment etc. is going to be futile. In the current climate of deep and crystal clear distinctions, when we are we and they are they; the noise level is so high, and the wall of distinction so high that any suggestion(s) that might help change the attitudes of the current pre-pubescent generation, are more likely to be booed than heard. Still, we must talk about them. My first suggestion would be to eliminate rampant nudity in schools, gyms, and all other places where children of the same sex are gathered. It is reasonable to postulate that by assembling the naked youth, in their homo-erotic phase, the chances of that child becoming attracted to the same sex are far greater than when there is a barrier of sorts provided by some clothing. I believe that it would also drastically reduce the incidence of coaches molesting the children and teenagers.  Secondly, now that the gays have gained rights at par with the straights, let everyone calm down, especially the news media. We all have our rights, and our ways, let us now live and let live. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with classifying many human behaviors as 'illness', is that many behaviors were arbitrarily placed into the 'immoral' category, and with various religious believes and attendant laws defining crime, such behavior was cause for punishment. This moral issue was transformed into a 'medical' issue by defining such behavior as 'homosexuality' to be a sign of 'mental illness'. The problem there is there are many groups over the course of history which have included various types of homosexual activity into their social fabric, and not resulted in the demise of those cultures. Of course, because of the prohibitions expressed in the Old Testament, the constant attribution of the punishments of the Tribes of Israel to sexual, or 'worshiping via sex' sins, any sexual activity outside of the procreative process was given a negative value, and homosexuality was on the top of the targeted list of sexual prohibitions FOR MEN... there is no Old Testament prohibition on women having sexual contact with other women, and there is only a vague implication, which could be read other ways, in the New Testament that lesibanism was even in the minds of the Bible writers. As for 'goes against biology'... well, Artificial Insemination goes against 'biology'... if a couple can't conceive, then 'biology' has so order that they remain childless. Using the 'goes against' nature logic, then that couple should either, find another partner where conception can occur, or accept their biologically determined faith, separate, and live chaste lives for the remainder of their respective lifetimes. In fact the Roman Catholic church does hold artificial insemination, in vitro, etc. to be against church teaching. The church requires fucking to be done to conceive. ",

            "answer_text": "As the other guys said, no it is not a mental illness, but sadly it was considered a mental illness till quite recently.   A history of pathologising gay people  Until 1993 \"homosexuality\" per se was deemed a mental illness by the World Health Organization.  (WHO, 2011). Although this does not just apply to someone who is homosexual: Transgender identity was still deemed pathological as evidenced by Gender Identity Disorder(GID) in DSM-IV(APA, 1994), although at least the new diagnostic manual (DSM-5) focuses on the distress (\"Gender Dysphoria\") of feeling trapped in the wrong body and acknowledges that the main ideal treatment is gender reassignment surgery.  There is a long history of theories that argue that homosexuality causes mental illness or vice versa; especially regarding schizophrenia, mania, borderline personality, and general \"insanity\".  (As evidenced by Evelyn Hooker onFriedman, 1994; Gonsiorek, 1982; Hooker, 1957; Nurius, 1983; Remafedi, 1991).  http://www.outminds.com.au/-mental-health.html   The History of Psychiatry & Homosexuality  Homosexuality had been officially classified as a mental disorder in the APA's first  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM-1) in 1952. There it was designated as a \"sociopathic personality disturbance.\" Viewing homosexuality as a mental illness was not controversial at the time as it coincided with prevailing societal attitudes. DSM-II, published in 1968, listed homosexuality as a sexual deviation, but sexual deviations were no longer categorized as a sociopathic personality disturbance.  The publication of DSM-II coincided with the emergence of the gay rights movement. The  Stonewall riots in 1969 in New York City marked a watershed event in the movement. Having successfully challenged the police and government attempts to shut down public places where gay people gathered, gay activists would soon challenge psychiatric authority as well.  Before the Stonewall riots,  homophile groups had accepted the medical view of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Their view had been that accepting homosexuality as disease meant treating it as a disability, rather than a moral or religious sin, and would lead to more objective and humane attitudes.  A new generation of gay rights activists viewed medical and psychiatric portrayals of homosexuality to be just as problematic as the religious views. Gay men and women were still being denied many basic rights and the designation of homosexuality as a mental disorder had only exacerbated antihomosexual societal prejudices, leaving gay men and women vulnerable in terms of their physical safety, economic security, and overall well being.   Barbara Gittings marching at a homosexual rights demonstration  Gay activists began to confront the APA about its position on homosexuality. There were a series of dramatic encounters between activists and psychiatrists at the annual meetings of the APA between 1970 and 1972. While the opposition to the activists was vehement by some in the APA, there were increasing numbers of psychiatrists (e.g., Judd Marmor) who supported the activists' view.  These were members who were familiar with the research findings showing that homosexuality occurred in large numbers of people, in persons who demonstrated normal psychological adjustment, and that it is present across a range of cultures.

There is such evil in that complying comfortable exercise of \u201cmedicine\u201d. Is it true that idleness is the mother of all vices? I do know that we humans are curious. We are very curious and this is a sign of intelligence. It is also a sign of intelligence to be able to decipher what the consequences of our actions will be. So, while I believe most of us will be curious about sexuality as long as there is some degree of attraction \u2014and EVERYONE is attractive in some way\u2014, the difference in finding happiness lies in continuing to choose the freedom to pursue discipline. It seems counter-intuitive that a degree of routine and discipline should breed happiness, but cells and Nature work by following rules. ",

Only in 1973, did APA (American Psychological Association) remove homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses. So, one can imagine, until 1973, people with homosexuality were being \u2018treated\u2019. Its high time we clarify some of the questions/concerns. Homosexuality is not wrong. It is okay to be homosexual.You cannot be treated for homosexuality. Think of it this way, can you be treated for your color preference? Some people like dark colors and some people like light ones. And, there are those who like both (bisexual) or no color at all (asexual). If you cannot be treated for what color you like, you cannot be treated for homosexuality.Because the society is still learning to accept homosexuality, sadly, if you are a homosexual person, you might face discrimination. And such treatment may induce feelings of sadness, guilt and general levels of stress for which you can seek help from a professional.",

            "answer_text": "For use of a better terminology, rather than mental illness, psychological disorder would suffice. This stands to imply that ones behaviour is out of sync with the natural, biological order of a living creature. This biological order is a course of ensuring the survival of the human species. To deviate from this order quite simply is a disorder!!! Why are we disputing this!!! ... There is the argument that some harm must be done in order for a disorder to be classified... The truth is - however unpalatable - this world is increasingly becoming ever more individualistic. We tend not to see harm beyond our immediate existence - our mind and body - What we forget is the intermediary between these two aspects of our existence, our spirit. Because the modern education omits the complete trinity of existence from its curriculum, most of us are oblivious to the spiritual harm caused by such psycho-sexual disorders, furthermore we are unawares of the interconnection and universality of the spirit, so to say, what's bad for my spirit is not good for yours ... In conclusion - Homosexuality is a deep rooted desire for sexual relations with the same sex. Are we biologically designed for such relationships? The answer is quite clearly no.. So why do some people engage in homosexuality? Answer: Because they are psychologically inclined that way.. ",

            "answer_text": "How is homosexuality not a mental illness? Before you start crying the words \u201cHOMOPHOBE!\u201d \u201cBIGOT!\u201d this question is not to upset anyone. It is a sincere scientific question I have. Here is my thought process. People attracted to children, animals, family, dead bodies, etc, are often tied to a mental illness. How are gay people any different?  You can find more info here: Homosexuality - Wikipedia People attracted to children - this is wrong because there is no consent on a rational level. People attracted to animals - there is nothing wrong here save for social norms. People attracted to family - there is nothing wrong here save for social norms. People attracted to dead bodies - this is wrong because there is no consent on rational level. People attracted to other people (e.g., homosexuality) - there is nothing wrong with people finding each other attractive. In 1952, when the American Psychiatric Association published its first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, homosexuality was included as a disorder. Almost immediately, however, that classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in research funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. That study and subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality, rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation. As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system. In recognition of the scientific evidence, [150] the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that \"homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.\" After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data, the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975, and urged all mental health professionals \"to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations.\" The National Association of Social Workers has adopted a similar policy. Thus, mental health professionals and researchers have long recognized that being homosexual poses no inherent obstacle to leading a happy, healthy, and productive life, and that the vast majority of gay and lesbian people function well in the full array of social institutions and interpersonal relationships.

This means it is a behavioral observation and the judgment of a behavioral scientist that says your lifestyle is not working for you because of your behavioral patterns according to DSMV guidelines and regulation and here is where they go like Christian theologians looking for things that do not physically exist and creating them via their version of a religious text DSMV = religious text. I went to a religious private school or Christian colonizers created the 5 day work week, leaving the remaining 2 days for his priesthood (Illuminati/Bloodline of God) and slaves to attend his houses of obedience. Education = Illuminati or the enlightened ones. Today you refer to these houses as The Church, The Mosque and The Synagogue. Now you can see the setup between theology and education because of Seminary and religious based schools combining with behavioral scientist thus creating theses pseudo illnesses based on non-conformist behaviors the Illuminati's and religious colonizers deem disruptive This is why in my daughter\u2019s decision to be a lesbian and marry her wife I have always supported them and they live with us. They are part of our family regardless and accepted as they are unconditional love is nonjudgemental and accepting of all as all life is sacred and to be respected. Well, let us reframe this whole thing and strip the Sexism completely away because as my own background comes out of seeing this witchhunt used against any nonconformist behavior A child is inattentive in class and displays signs of being bored or disinterested in the class. Oh the child has a mental or developmental illness we can exploit and label that child with that has no physical cause to medicate. It is then the social condition that had dictated medicating the child and or individual who displays atypical social adaptation. This is a failure of the individual and society to accept all individuals equally without sexism, racism, or speciesism to love them without any conditions and embrace them as equals. ",

Here\u2019s what I also don\u2019t understand.. homophobic people out there say that we\u2019re nothing but sick and disgusting and careless people, yet some of the homophobia is what makes a homosexual lose confidence in themselves and leads to suicide. So I don\u2019t understand how the LGBT community are bad influence on children and future generations when we have people doing massive shootings at gay nightclubs and pride parades. If the hate didn\u2019t exist, I believe we would all be having the greatest time together as one big community. Sadly, some people are too ignorant. ",

If you are looking to understand what is or is not classed as a mental illness or disorder I suggest you refer to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). That is the reference book that is considered most useful. However, if people are engaging in consensual behaviour that does no harm to anyone, even if you don\u2019t understand it at all, it almost certainly is not a mental disorder. You might want to examine your reasons for assumeing it might be. The only way you might have a point is that I have heard people describe love as a mental disorder as people in love often behave irrationally. I don\u2019t think love is something we are trying to cure.  ",

But it's all merely for procreation. From a biological standpoint it is just for procreation in order to keep the species alive. We have the two genders. In order to bring them to procreate, these get sexual urges for each other. This is the reason for sexuality. However two people of the same gender can't procreate with just each other. Human beings weren't made for this. It is still something wonderful of course. I am thankful that this counts as normal and is legal, as that is good for me. But from a biological standpoint it truly doesn't make sense. In the end I would say no. It is not a mental illness. Despite it being odd to me. But biology is not the only thing that counts in life I guess. Sorry for exaggarating. I just wanted to explain\u2026 ",

Others suffered because of attempts to convert them from what they were. Still more suffered because they pretended to be heterosexual to fit in. Often this caused great suffering to family members as well. Fortunately these days, many people have realised that some people are homosexual, and that is just the way they are. So overall, the laws against it are being dropped, laws are being made to give homosexual people rights that others have enjoyed all along, and in general, homosexual people are facing considerably less discrimination than in the past. However, they still face discrimination from some people. This still makes it very difficult for young people to accept themselves. Imagine growing up as a young person, coming to realise that you are attracted to people of the same sex, and then seeing or hearing about others who think it is a mental disorder or a sin? What does that do to a young person who is still developing a sense of self, as they mature into an adult? ",

Males do have a spot in their rectum that when properly assigned pressure to, gives them orgasm. Not familiar with the works, but that is pretty common knowledge.As to females, we are better at giving pleasure to our partners and I mean 100% orgasm every time when you are a homosexual.. Or not, I don't know since I am pretty straight. Sexuality is in the brain located in different parts on different genders. Scientists have not found how women use their brain to orgasm, but for men it is pretty studied. Women use more of the brain.I assume mental problems reside in your mind and that they disable you from functioning normally. Not an illness to get aroused, right. Frigidity an illness, or asexuality, when there is no interest? Some drugs cause omnipotence. All people are sexual beings... It doesn't matter when they do it or who with. Get this monkey a banana, I'm hungry. Will write more for food. ",

It's that mental affliction a Southern doctor named Samuel Cartwright identified in a speech to the Medical Society of Louisiana in 1851--the one that compelled black people held in slavery to run away.  Up until recently, there was another disorder called \"nymphomania,\" whose symptoms consisted of  being female and really liking sex.  How are these 'conditions' similar? Well, their only symptom is being different than people with more power think you should be. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess that it would not be a mental illness, any more than a bull wanting to fornicate with a horse, or a cat with a dog, or a dog with a humans leg, or a giraffe with a rhinoceros. I thought that God made humans different. That we could have sex with our opposite sex and have orgasms whenever we chose to. Where as, animals did not have those desires until the female came into heat. That God gave us the freedom to be able to control ourselves. Mind over matter, rather than His creations being controlled by a timing mechanism (being in heat). I imagine that if you were in love, in your heart, with someone of the same sex, that it wouldn't require you wishing to have sex with that person. But, if you were to loose control of yourself and have sex with them, with any orfice to orfice, that what difference does it make, than to screw the dog that you love or kitty that you love. I think that it would be like going out of control. And if you are out of control, you are out of your mind and that would be an illness. In fact, if there isn't a general order to things and you want the rules changed, why not marry your cat, or dog, or parrot? ",

            "answer_text": "I believe it is\u2026.. We all know what the norm is a man should be attracted to a woman and vice versa\u2026. So people choosing to accept it should also leave those that do not\u2026.. We are trying to evolve a mental illness into a right, which shouldn't be. But when you look at it from another angle homosexuality wasn't acceptable some years back, now it is, you might not agree with me on this but a pedophile doesn't know he has a mental issue, he/she knows he/she isn't supposed to be attracted to kids but they are anyways which moves us to the question of acceptance, should we accept them for who they are even when it's obviously wrong? Necrophilia, paraphilia, bestiality, pedophilia and homosexuality all fall under the same umbrella of abnormal sexual orientations, so choosing to accept a group and neglect the rest leaves a space open for questions, it's either we accept them all or reject them all, they are all mental illnesses anyways\u2026. My two cents. As Its already happening in some places, pedophiles are fighting for their rights to be recognized as pedosexuals, so yeah its only a matter of time before wr accept them, and Necrophiles follow with theirs and the whole world can burn in peace.

Studies by the World Health Organization to determine how transgender individuals should be classified found, for instance, that societal treatment in the form of rejection and violence, was the largest predictor of distress and dysfunction. This is a strong indication that the unhappiness and distress is not inherent, but a function of society's treatment, including the stigma of the categorization you seem to recommending. If classifying these normal variations as illness is making people maladjusted, let's stop this self-fulfilling prophecy. ",

So if homosexuality is not in your lexicon, then perhaps it appears unreal to you, therefore you make false assumptions, or you drink the cool-aid of those who might brainwash you to suit their own political perspective i.e. the degrading of those thought to be different in order to justify hatred against them.

They can have anxiety from worrying about what could happen when they \u201ccome out\u201d to people they\u2019re comfortable with. However, being homosexual does not cause any dysfunction in itself. The problems are caused by other people not accepting it as well as making it a big deal in my opinion. That\u2019s just my take on it. Some people may agree and some may disagree, but that\u2019s okay. I just feel that it doesn\u2019t fit as a mental illness. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have it as one to me at least.

You are not sensitive to this because you have no gay friends, but it is important to realize that you may actually be facilitating discrimination.  Apart from that, what is mental illness? If you want to adopt an objective definition, you can only speak of mental illness when there is a clear malfunction in the brain. In the case of homosexuality that is a very poor scientific hypothesis because (a) no such malfunction has been observed (b) it is not correlated with any particular disabilities (c) it occurs in over 5% of the population in all times and all cultures, so it would have to be a ridiculously prevalent malfunction, and (d) homosexual behaviour is observed on a regular basis in animals.  I think it is more interesting to look for an answer to how homosexuality can be reconciled with the theory of evolution: how come it is not selected against? ",

Current scientific research points to a connection between homosexuality and testosterone levels of the mother during certain phases of pregnancy. Uncommon hormone levels can lead to your psychological gender being different from your biological gender, e.g. a biological male being \"female\" in so far as he is attracted to men. A mental disorder would imply an illness. And important part of an illness is that the patient suffers from it. Homosexuals don't suffer from homosexuality itself but from their environment's reaction to it. Therefore homosexuality does not qualify as an illness of any kind and was removed from the ICD catalogue in 1992. ",

A group of psychiatrists is chosen to represent the interests of the American association of mental health providers. They meet together and decide what to name different mental illnesses, as well as all the criteria to be used for diagnosis. The method is quite subjective and fluid in my view. Depending on the most recent data, current climate of society, and opinions held by the doctors who are selected to be on the panel, illnesses can be redefined, renamed, and added or dropped from the list. Homosexuality was dropped a number of years ago. ",

You can check with the experts. They publish a handbook of medically diagnosable things from illnesses to conditions. It is called the DSM-IV. Insomnia, premature ejaculation, fear of snakes, sexual disinterest, being homosexual or transgender are conditions. There is a disorder, not a mental illness, gender dysphoria. It is cured most effectively by gender transition. There is no disorder associated with the fact that someone is turned on by a same sex partner or a variety of partners. Depression can develop into a mental illness. It can be triggered by a lack of acceptance and this can be the experience of many LGBTQ+ people. It is depressing to see continuous questions driven by a negative stereotype that many refuse to drop. ",

When you say something is an illness, you are supposed to figure out a way to cure it. But when it is an abnormality, you can just let it be. Biologically speaking, any species on the Earth is supposed to reproduce itself. If not, it is going to die out. Unless human beings are immortal, it does not make much sense not to have sex with the opposite sex and have children. Being gay takes away from human's chance to reproduce, so I think it is abnormal. But just as it is acceptable for married couples not to have children, it is unfair to treat homosexuality as an illness. ",

Here is the truth, that any rational, intelligent person who has not been brainwashed would tell you. Homosexuals were born homosexual. They did not choose that.

However there is a mental difference. I want to be controversial here and say that firstly it lies outside a norm. Secondly, that we don\u2019t know what \u2018causes\u2019 it. It is not choice, is it genetic, environmental, is it even based on upbringing and more benign cases of neglect, even, and what about hormonal determination?. Can it be determined by the processes of which determine a mental illness, without being one, the answer is YES, because we can clearly determine factors like intelligence, preference of just about anything, it seems however to be tabboo to talk about the causes. But lets not also forget there is sometimes a higher statistical prevalence of comorbidity in homosexuals, we can point to the stigma mostly, but only mostly without a clear empirical distinction. ",

Being homosexual in a fundamentalist country is very dangerous and certainly impairs your ability to lead a normal life (even if it\u2019s because you\u2019ll be hanged), so they claim that homosexuality is an illness/sin. The thing is, it\u2019s THEIR behaviour that is causing the impairment. If a gay person can live freely, without having to hide to protect themselves, they can have just as much of a functional, happy, fulfilling life (and love life) as any heterosexual person. So in fundamentalist countries they are ill, and in progressive areas they are just people. This makes me think that what would define the illness is their environment, not their sexual orientation.

Putting aside mental ilness/disorder definition that can be quite murky, there is a growing body of evidence that homosexuality is a much more widespread natural phenomena than was previously thought and not a unique human condition. It is a bit hard to imagine that all those animals, including humans have a mental condition, more likely that homosexuality is a an evolutionary conserved phenomenon whose role in the nature still not quite clear. In addition recent studies have indicated genomic regions that may play important role in the determination of sexual preferences. Such findings clearly  show that preference to homosexuality may be a heritable trait, not a psychological condition. In addition, if there is indeed a genetic component to homosexuality, it is easy to imagine how it could be so widespread in the nature. ",

And neither is being homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, or anything else on the spectrum.  Heterosexuality and homosexuality aren't mental illnesses. They are normal human impulses. Mental illnesses are debilitating and harmful to the person that experiences them. Homosexuality is essentially the opposite of a mental illness actually, it can be very pleasurable and energizing. It's not inherently harmful in any way, shape, or form. The only downside is discrimination from ignorant folks.  I can't believe I still have to answer this question in 2015. Can't we all just get past this already? ",

How and why homosexuality has endured Darwinian natural selection for so long (I guess few doubt by now that it has genetic components), but actually it's not any more a mystery as why do we still have genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis which causes infertility in 97% of the affected people. A simplistic interpretation of Darwinian natural selection would suggest that such a genetic disorder should have been long eradicated from the gene pool but the reality is that it has not (in fact it is fairly common among Caucasians), and many other examples abound. Proof that nature can not be so simplistically interpreted (and to clarify, I'm not saying that homosexuality is a disease nor a mental disorder!). There are theories regarding a possible evolutionary advantage of communities with homosexual members: Evolution and Homosexuality ",

And that, to me, is a mental disorder. Firstly because it's been suggested, secondly because people believe it, accept, and act upon it, causing demonstrable harm to people they would otherwise have no contact with. ",
