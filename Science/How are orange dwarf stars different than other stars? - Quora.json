            "answer_text": "Red dwarfs are low-mass main-sequence stars. Yellow dwarfs are main-sequence (dwarf) stars with masses comparable to that of the Sun. Orange dwarfs are K-type main-sequence stars.  \"Orange Dwarf Star\" is a colloquialism for stellar objects that are, more properly, called \"K-type main-sequence stars\" and are designated K V. The first is a letter, the second a Roman numeral. These stars are a sort of intermediary between yellow and red dwarves, hence the colour reference. Their sizes are less than that of our Sun, ranging from just a little smaller to half its size. They tend to remain main-sequence stars much longer than, say, yellow dwarves (like our Sun). Whereas yellow dwarves' life spans may be around some 10 billion years, orange dwarf stars can remain main-sequence for up to three times as long. Because they're around for a lot longer, they outnumber yellow dwarves considerably. Also, their age makes them more likely to have a developed planetary system. Hertzsprung - Russell Diagram The Hertzsprung -Russell (H-R) Diagram is a graph that plots stars color (spectral type or surface temperature) vs. its luminosity (intrinsic brightness or absolute magnitude). On it, astronomers plot stars' color, temperature, luminosity, spectral type, and evolutionary stage.  This diagram shows that there are 3 very different types of stars: Most stars, including the sun, are \"main sequence stars,\" fueled by nuclear fusion converting hydrogen into helium. For these stars, the hotter they are, the brighter. These stars are in the most stable part of their existence; this stage generally lasts for about 5 billion years.As stars begin to die, they become giants and supergiants (above the main sequence). These stars have depleted their hydrogen supply and are very old. The core contracts as the outer layers expand. These stars will eventually explode (becoming a planetary nebula or supernova, depending on their mass) and then become white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes (again depending on their mass).Smaller stars (like our Sun) eventually become faint white dwarfs (hot, white, dim stars) that are below the main sequence. These hot, shrinking stars have depleted their nuclear fuels and will eventually become cold, dark, black dwarfs. ",

Let us be happy for the hope enabled by the existence of orange dwarfs (more technically known as K-type stars. ",
