            "answer_text": "The ozone layer is recreated every spring as the suns power increases to make ozone, and is at its least active in winter due losing solar power with ozone creating ultra violet being at its lowest. I suspect it was used by manufacturers of refrigerants( EG DUPONT) as an excuse to stop others using their patented gas whose patent was running out. Ozone is a very unstable gas and the hole may have been there all the time expanding and contracting with solar power as the seasons change. My opinion is shared by many. ",

Yet , it still remains to continue to flourish because of the greenhouse gases , i.e CO , carbon dioxide , methane etc. It CAN be stopped by reducing pollution and planting more trees . ",

This was and is BULLSHIT! The ozone barrier at the South pole vents garbage into the atmosphere beginning at Spring solstice while it does the same thing at the north pole beginning at Fall solstice. These vents close when the garbage has been \u201cflushed\u201d. Rather than admitting their error the \u201cscientists\u201d simply went silent. This really should piss everyone in the world off. It is the common \u201cscientific\u201d myth that ozone forms a barrier to harmful UV rays from the sun, but this is also BULLSHIT. The ozone barrier keeps earth\u2019s atmosphere from escaping into space. ",

Healing has done significant progress, but will still take maybe a century, due to the high persistence of the freon molecules (and the leaks still occurring from ancient equipments).
