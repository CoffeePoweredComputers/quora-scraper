            "answer_text": "If I have to be first to discover something, it would be the cure to Alzheimer's.  (Image Credit: Science Photo library. The right side of the brain has damage to neurons caused by Alzheimer\u2019s) Alzheimer\u2019s is a fantastically complex disease, with the cause still a matter of scientific debate. More than likely there are many causes or factors in a person getting Alzheimer\u2019s. Principally the cause is probably genetic. In late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s there has been a reasonable link made to the APOEe4 (apolipoprotein E (APOE)) gene[1]. It comes in different alleles, and I\u2019m not going to get into that here. Beyond that, lifestyle and health choices throughout life can have an impact. Viruses and now even bacteria[2] could affect the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. There is research that epigenetic factors, from everything mentioned and environment, could be a major factor[3]. I could go on, but this isn\u2019t a technical answer. There are two types: late-onset, with symptoms appearing in a suffer\u2019s 60\u2019s and early-onset with symptoms appearing in a sufferer between the ages of 30\u201360 years old. Early onset is much rarer. Finding a cure has been horribly difficult, with a 99% failure rate. It\u2019s also fantastically expensive, costing more than $10 million for just a Phase I trial. That\u2019s before even more in-depth Phase III trials that compare to existing Alzheimer\u2019s therapy. This cost, coupled with the failure rate, has discouraged many of the large pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical companies from continuing to pursue a cure. Research continues, but it\u2019s not a focus for many. The NIH spends more than $2.5 billion annually in Alzheimer\u2019s research[4]. There has been a foundation built by Bill Gates and Dr. Howard Fillit, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, that is built around discovering early medicines and funding scientist led research. Although Alzheimer\u2019s could be a larger area of giving, even spare-change (the spare-change model) because it is a disease that in one way or another, affects us all. That\u2019s because this is a massively expensive disease as well as being widespread, with care costs exceeding $290 billion annually for all types of dementia (including Alzheimer\u2019s). It could be $1.1 trillion by 2050, and between now and then, cumulatively it will cost $20.2 trillion to treat dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s. (see my #4 reference for information). So a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s would have an obvious financial and economic benefit, and would more than likely make me fantastically wealthy. Not to mention the recipient of just about every major medical aware in the world, starting with the Nobel Prize in Medicine and working its way down. Which generates a comparatively modest amount of prize money. It has been estimated that a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s could be worth upwards of $20 billion[5], and that was in 2016. As costs continue to rise, so does the potential revenue. Now it could be worth $30 billion, by 2050, $100 billion. Beyond the cost, which is daunting, you have the personal reality of Alzheimer\u2019s. The fact that this is one of the most dehumanizing diseases in the world. It literally steals your mind, your thoughts, and most precious memories. Alzheimer\u2019s changes your personality, turns you into a different person, a person that is frequently unpleasant and mean. It\u2019s is not the Alzheimer\u2019s sufferer who intends to be mean, or suspicious, or even violent, it is the way the disease affects the brain to cause damage to what directs behavior. When our minds are affected, that is the essence of what we are as individuals, we are no longer the individual we were. Other diseases can do this, no doubt, but not in quite the insidious way that Alzheimer\u2019s does. The way it steals a person\u2019s memory in reasons appears to be almost evil. It is heartbreaking for the family and friends involved, to see a loved one go through this, to no longer be the person you love. My grandmother (on my mother\u2019s side) suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s. It was very late onset, not coming on until her mid-80\u2019s. But what it did to her was brutal to go through, and because of her advanced age, it progressed quickly. I\u2019ve been personally affected by this disease because of my grandmother, and I suspect that many readers have as well. If I was the one somehow to find a miraculous cure to Alzheimer\u2019s I would see an income of more than $2 billion per year, after cost, if not more. It would make me quite wealthy, without a doubt. Although that\u2019s not the point, not at all. I would be able to save so much pain, pain from the sufferers, pain from their families, pain to the economy. I would be making a real impact on the human race for the better. That would be the real value in being first to finding a cure. But still, there would be wealth, what to do with that wealth? Several billion dollars a year would be enough to fund a powerful venture philanthropy group, if not my full medical research center. The cure for Alzheimer\u2019s in my hands would build the most well-funded medical venture philanthropy foundation in the world.  (Actually the University of Minnesota\u2019s Cancer and Cardiovascular research building) The Goldlight Group would fund promising new areas of medical research, especially in scientist led companies and non-profits. Using the income from an Alzheimer\u2019s cure to fund other areas of research in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s, MS and ALS, other genetic diseases, emerging and pandemic causing disease (like Ebola and other hemorrhagic diseases), antibiotic research, and cancer diagnostics and therapies. It would be my hope that a few investments and our profile of work would allow us to operate in total solvency within a reasonable amount of time. My personal enrichment would very much take a backseat to this, getting even richer on the back of disease isn\u2019t something I find palpable. So while I would live well, a good percentage of it would be poured into philanthropy. That\u2019s why I would like to be the one that discovers a cure, and what I would do if I did. Credit goes to Elke Weiss for me finding this question, and how thought-provoking it is. Thanks, Elke. Her answer is a bit more ambitious than my own, and far lighter in tone.

What is it?\u201d When I was studying, I was deeply thinking about how we could have communication with a paralyzed person through head gears and necessary equipment in between. I had based my thinking on the principle of real-time modulation of audio signals on telephone sets that we are able to send and receive. I examined many modes and working of transducers needed. Obviously it was not easy. Underlying signal processing (in time domain and frequency domain) mainly remained a hypothetical issue and conjectural models would not help. I AM SURE ONE DAY THAT WILL BE ACHIEVED. At least someone can say that I was one of the persons who ever thought about that and tried but fell too short. Thanks for reading my input here. ",
