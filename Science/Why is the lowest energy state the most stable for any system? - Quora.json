            "answer_text": "Instability is the tendency of a system to spontaneously change to a different state. Something must drive that state-change, such as energy released by the change. If a system is in its lowest-energy state, the only possible impetus to change would be an external disturbance. So a system in its lowest energy state is stable unless externally forced. That's basically how we define stability. Put another way, \"stable\" configurations are ones that represent higher entropy. Statistics dictates that a system is more likely to end up in a disordered state (low \"usable\" energy) than an ordered state, because there are way more disordered states than ordered states. So the universe progresses towards disorder. A low-energy system subjected to randomness (like a molecule being jiggled by other molecules) can and does spontaneously change to other states, but there are trillions of times more disordered states than ordered states, so it's vanishingly unlikely for a system to spontaneously increase to a high-energy state.
