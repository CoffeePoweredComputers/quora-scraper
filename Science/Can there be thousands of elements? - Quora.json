            "answer_text": "I would say, based on what we know right now, it's not likely that there are thousands of elements. The elements we have observed number less than 200 (as a high rounding up of 120 or so), so in the 1000's seems kind of out of the question. Many larger elements are unstable, not likely to be long lived and have not even been observed in nature. I don't personally think it's likely that there will be more elements discovered in the near future. However! That doesn't mean that what we know won't change. It may be the case that in very strange situations larger elements can be stable and may aggregate and fuse to form larger elements--quantum physics is a very peculiar thing, in particular. We may also discover different forms of elements and change our definition of the term--but I think this is even more unlikely. Chemistry isn't a very new science, so I don't foresee that kind of large revolution in knowledge. I also don't know of any evidence that would suggest such a remote possibility. It would be interesting to hear a response from someone with a strong background in physics, as you could think of chemistry as a subset of applied physics. ",
