            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Laboratory tools provide the bridge between theory and application. They are what makes science relatable to the common man. They are the tools of experimentalists, who seek to test the tall claims made by theorists. Okay, let me start from the beginning. This is how scientists operate: a theorist publishes some result, an experimentaist quickly takes it up and comes up with a setup to test that result. It is in this respect that lab tools prove to be indispensable. After the experiment is done and the result verified, it goes over to the engineer to come up with a robust, effective application out of this. Quite often, these three steps aren\u2019t exclusive but rather mingled with each other. A theorist often browses through experimental results to spot patterns. An experimentalist often comes up with anomalous results that he then tries to explain using new theory. An engineer often creates new experiments to test the theory directly. In the 21st century, physics has evolved so much that you now need apparatus like vacuum pumps, cryostats, high precision quantum sensors in order to test hypothesis, since much of the new physics that we are dealing with is either at the very low temperature scale or the very high end of it. Without lab tools, we would be lost. ",

            "answer_text": "Scientists have concluded that the ability to create and use tools is a characteristic of humans. The ability to think is an attribute or property of humans. As humans, we know how to use tools to satisfy our needs. We were able to create tools to gather food, to provide shelter, and to make our lives easier. Scientists use tools to help with their scientific investigations. The laboratory equipment that scientist use helps them to observe, measure, collect, and gather data as they investigate their problem or question, the tools that increase knowledge beyond our five senses.

            "answer_text": "There are various kinds of laboratory tools and lab apparatus which are required to do science experiments. Scientists try to develop new tests; methodology for mimicking living cell processes in the lab. They develop tests to analyze human samples or animal samples. Without these tools, scientists would not be able to get efficient results in their experiments. In a life science or chemistry research lab, basic tools include things like clamp, stand, column, racks, pipette, etc. There is a good list of these, which you may check here: https://www.biomall.in/category/general-lab-supplies ",
