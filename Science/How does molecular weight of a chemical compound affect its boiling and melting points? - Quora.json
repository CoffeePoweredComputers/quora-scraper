            "answer_text": "Heavier molecules means that there are more atoms that compose it or the atoms that compose it are heavier. Heavier atoms or more atoms in the molecule means more electrons. Boiling and melting points are determined by intermolecular forces. The intermolecular force affected by mass is Van Der Waals\u2019 forces or also known as instantaneous dipole forces and induced dipole forces. Via quantum mechanical effects, an electron\u2019s position in its orbital is uncertain. Hence, there will be times that more electrons are going to be at one side of a molecule than the other. This generates a dipole in the molecule where one side is more negative than the other. This is the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d part. When this happens, the negative charge will push electrons away from the side of another molecule closest to that molecule\u2019s negative pole. Now, the other molecule\u2019s side closest to it is electron deficient hence will have a slightly positive charge and opposite charges attract. This is the \u201cinduced\u201d part. This effect perpetuates throughout substance. The more electrons you have, the larger is the negative or positive charge generated when the instantaneous part is going to happen. Hence, attraction between molecules is going to be stronger. Thus, higher melting and boiling points. ",
