            "answer_text": "Density of a sbustance is defined as its Mass per unit volume. Mass according to Newtonian physics can be defined as the amount of matter present in a body . This matter is molecules or atom . So density of different material is different as density is the property of the material . And it would differ with the material . For example density of water is 1000 kg/ m^3 and that of Mercury is 13560 kg/m^3. ",
