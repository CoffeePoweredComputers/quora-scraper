            "answer_text": "Wow, that\u2019s quite an answer from Stacey. Covers just about every category of woo nonsense that\u2019s out there. Science has sought to find evidence of varieties of \u201cparanormal\u201d activities and abilities for a long time. Alas, none found. Only frauds, tricksters, the ravings of lunatics, and shoddy experimental protocols that were later cleared up. Nothing has ever been found. James Randi\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Prize\u201d has never been awarded. So, for a definition, most all the things that people lump under the category of \u201cparanormal\u201d (Literally\u2026\u201dbeyond\u201d the normal) would defy the laws of physics. Telekinesis would involve applying an acceleration to an object without any measurable force. We are capable of measuring very tiny forces indeed\u2026 So tiny that they only affect subatomic particles. Yet, no one has ever observed telekinesis that was not being caused by\u2026 Magnets, hidden compressed-air sources, or invisibly-fine monofilament threads. In other words, by cheating. How about \u201ctelepathy\u201d? Think about it. One person\u2019s brain would have to encode a thought in such manner that it could be transmitted over distance (by what\u2026Radio? WiFi?) to another brain which would be equipped with some sort of structure or organ to decode that information\u2026 Do any such structures exist? No. Is there any medium that would transmit this encoded thought? No. It\u2019s nonsense. Humans believe in nonsense for all sorts of reasons. They have experiences that reinforce their pre-conceived notions about the nonsense. They ignore information to the contrary. There are psychological conditions and states that people perceive as \u201cparanormal\u201d experiences\u2026 But they are not. All of those \u201cparapsychology\u201d departments that operated in universities and colleges all over the country in the 70s and 80s? Try to find one now. Gone with the wind. No results. Nothing observed. In fact, one of the very few remaining recently announced that they would no longer be trying to investigate \u201cphenomenon\u201d, as none had ever been found. Rather, they would bend their efforts to finding out why people invest belief in such things. ",
