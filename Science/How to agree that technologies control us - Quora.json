            "answer_text": "It\u2019s difficult to answer this question clearly. On one hand, we are at free will to connect onto our devices and social mediums as we please. We have no hard rules that force us to engage with technology. The lines blur a bit when we get into the nuances that follow. Technically, I don\u2019t have to be phone checking my Facebook, Instagram and texts multiple times a day. In fact, I don\u2019t want to - it takes away from being able to enjoy the everyday moments that I share with friends and family. However, if I don\u2019t keep up on different social channels, I risk being excluded and missing out from a plethora of things - knowledge of upcoming gatherings, milestones in friends\u2019 lives, facing general FOMO. In another light, you can argue that (here in the US at least) technology does control us. Take a look at what kind of information the government has about us. This is supplemented by information on us that is collected by Facebook, Google and the likes (think of how many apps you\u2019ve signed up for using your Facebook credentials). Companies use this behavioral data to determine what kinds of advertisements they feed to us, which in turn affects our behavior both online and offline. We are at a crossroads right now where technology doesn\u2019t explicitly have control on us\u2026 but it does have a pretty tight stronghold on our individual and collective social behavior.  If you want to take a look at what information the government has on you, feel free to utilize the Freedom of Information Act and submit a report request. ",
