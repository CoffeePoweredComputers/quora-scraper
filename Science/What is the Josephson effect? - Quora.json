            "answer_text": "The Josephson effect is one of the so called miracle phenomena discovered by quantum mechanics but is also a definitive proof of Gestalt Aether Theory. When two superconductors are separated by a thin piece of material it could be a conductor or an insulator, providing that in the case of insulators it has to be about 30 angstroms (nm thick and a few microns thick if it is a conductor. A superconductor is a material that has zero resistance. When a Josephson junction is introduced in between two superconductors strange effects begin to be seen. Firstly a spontaneous current arises in the superconductor that flows back and forth and lasts for as long as the superconductivity persists. This is the first anomaly, a current without a voltage but still stranger phenomena await.  If a DC voltage is applied across the Josephson junction, the current disappears and a high frequency radio wave is developed. This radio wave is very steady and has an approximate value of 500 GHz per millivolt across the junction. This means a Josephson junction can act as a perfect voltage-to-frequency converter. There are numerous other experiments that have been conducted with Josephson junctions, including a device called a squid that can be used in superconductors. So in the first instance there is a current without a voltage and in the second instance a voltage without a current! Either of these phenomena appear to be completely baffling.  The Gestalt Aether Theory of the Josephson junction is less complicated and explains all observed phenomena in a satisfactory manner. GAT claims that current is not conducted by electrons or electromagnetic waves but by photons. (In order to understand how this theory works it is necessary to read the book: \u201cA Gestalt Aether Theory on the nature of Light and related Phenomena.\u201davailable at Amazon) However even without this a simple argument can be made to explain the Josephson effect. The situation in the superconductor according to GAT is as follows. If no current is flowing, there is absolutely no movement within the conductor, all electrons are bound (due to the nature of the superconducting material) there are no free electrons, everything is still. The situation in the Josephson junction by contrast is chaotic, electrons are moving around at random, yes even to a certain extent in insulators, as the electrons move they emit \u2018conduction photons\u2019 that are immediately replaced from surrounding electrons, so no net flow of current. However when placed between two superconductors, even a single photon escaping into the Josephson junction will set up a polarity and the flow of current. Hence the motivating force for the current in a superconductor linked to a Josephson junction arises in the junction itself. Once this current takes shape it will flow sluggishly back and forth ( if the two superconductors are separate entities) across the Junction. When a DC voltage is applies across the junction the current will flow in first one direction and then when it reaches the end the polarities reverse and it doubles back. The frequency of the AC signal developed is then dependent to an extent on the dimensions of the superconductor less the resistivity of the junction. A far more acceptable explanation of the Josephson junction than to believe a current can flow spontaneously or that electrons can pair together as \u2018cooper pairs\u201d. ",
