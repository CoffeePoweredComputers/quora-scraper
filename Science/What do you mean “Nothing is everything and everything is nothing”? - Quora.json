            "answer_text": "It means God (the Everything) is your Reality but you the person does not really exist (Nothing). So you are everything in general and also nothing in particular. The lie of separation comes from the source of the Truth. The lie, when felt deeply as the lie of lies and co-mingled with much suffering, generates the search for the truth. When the search for the truth uncovers that that primordial lie comes from the source of Truth, Reality is seen as the Truth of all lies of separation. That is, That which they call God is felt and perhaps seen as the Reality of all apparently separate entitites. Then it is known that all of them have been the One, God, expressing itself in infinite ways. Then the lies become the Truth and are no longer seen or interpreted as bad, or stemming from evil egos. Even those are seen as God. ",

            "answer_text": "How about this: try splitting nothing into two words: no thing and ask how can one thing be everything? So, no thing is everything. Can one thing be everything if it is The One and Only Thing? One thing can be everything as well in this case. Now some simple math: if a=b then b=a so, if no thing is everything, then everything is no thing. Everything can also be split into two words which can explain how everything is every thing. How small is an infinite small particle and how large is an infinite large universe? These questions help us understand the word \u201cthing\u201d in a different way. Another good question to help with expanding on the word \u201cthing\u201d is the wave gone when it crashes onto the shore, or is the wave the ocean and the ocean the wave, making the wave and ocean all one? Then by expanding from these \u201ctwo things\u201d, \u201cwave and ocean\u201d, again to \u201cevery thing\u201d which like the wave and ocean can be one and the same, essentially, everything, which is back to where we started, also nothing.
