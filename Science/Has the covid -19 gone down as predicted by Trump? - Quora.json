            "answer_text": "No, and it won\u2019t truly go down, begin to go down (as far as case counts declining significantly and staying down) until there is a vaccine(s) in circulation in this country and it has been in circulation, being administered to the general population, for at least about a few months time or so. Until that time, it will continue to spread like wildfire, regardless of if you make Trump president (again), or Biden. It will make little real difference. It\u2019s just a matter of what leadership style you prefer, what kind of rhetoric, etc, as it\u2019s all happening around you. Neither of them can truly \u2018stop\u2019 it, by themselves. About the best and most effectual thing this admin did was putting into place the \u2018Operation Warp Speed\u2019 because that is the only way you\u2019re going to really begin to put a bullet into this thing, so to speak. You can wear all the cloth and paper surgical masks you want, at best you might help mitigate some seasonal flu spread with that (which is good\u2026), but Covid19 will still spread like wildfire without a vaccine; as it is doing now once again in western and southern Europe (France, and Italy) ~ where masks are much more highly enforced than here and their leaders all \u201cfollow the science\u201d. Because its viral particles, like its relative and predecessor Sars-CoV, can often make it through or around these commonly worn masks; particularly if or when they are expelled \u2018with force\u2019; i.e., via coughing, sneezing, and/or prolonged close \u2014 the CDC says 10-15 mins or more but it might be even less than that \u2014 contact with a contagious person. Therefore the cloth or paper, etc, repeatedly re-used, non-N95 style masks on everyone (with their eyes mostly uncovered), and these restaurant or bar closures or whatever else of that nature, will do little ultimately to truly stem the tide. At best they\u2019re stopgap measures that temporarily flatten \u2018curves\u2019, if even; because people mostly continue to do what they will in private or among close friends or family, as people always will do (in a free country at least; maybe not in China). So, short of literally keeping every single civilian person in the entire country locked inside their own homes or dwellings for perhaps a 2\u20133 month time span, with military force on the streets enforcing this true universal lockdown under extreme penalties (no contact even between close relatives, and so on) \u2014 these on-and-off spotty closures of bars, restaurants, other public places, all these masks on everyone (even all of the healthy regular people), are nearly pointless half-measures at best. (And oftentimes they are less than half-measures; as you can see, even doing all that, as in western Europe, it still continues to flare up and spread once again). It doesn\u2019t matter who is President. (Not to mention, as noted above, even people who wear the masks very regularly don\u2019t all have their eyes protected at all times; would you think a doctor at a hospital would walk into a Covid hot room and deal with a patient wearing only one of these commonly seen masks that people are wearing at the store?? If he did, he\u2019d probably have it a few days later himself). It has been scientifically demonstrated that particles 0.04 to 0.2 \u03bcm in size can or do penetrate or \u2018go around\u2019 the edges of surgical or (not properly fitted or worn, non-N95 respirator style) cloth face masks, particularly if or when the particles are expelled from the contagious person with force. The size of the SARS\u2013CoV particle from the 2003\u20132004 outbreak, for example, was estimated to be at only around 0.08 to 0.14 \u03bcm. This is extremely miniscule (hard for our minds to conceive how tiny, actually), and smaller even than influenza. Interim Recommendations for Facemask and Respirator Use to Reduce Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Transmission (\u2190\u2014Scroll down to where it says \u201cFacemasks\u201d; this was written well before any kind of \u201canti-mask\u201d talk was samizdat). From that link, \u201cFacemasks help stop droplets from being spread by the person wearing them. They also keep splashes or sprays from reaching the mouth and nose of the person wearing the facemask. They are not designed to protect against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses. Facemasks should be used once and then thrown away in the trash.\u201d Masks are actually probably more effective against influenza spread, most likely, than Sars-CoV. It needs a vaccine, either way you look at it. If you\u2019re anti-vax, fine, don\u2019t get a vaccine. But let about 25, 30, hopefully even 40-some % of the country get it at least, and then you will eventually be able to live more normally once again (and without \u201cmasking\u201d \u2014 even if the mask hardly matters, ultimately, for most people \u2014 everywhere you go, and without having to home-school your kids, close your businesses, and so forth). Otherwise, regardless of who you make president and what kind of science he says he follows, without prompt vaccine(s) it will go on like this for years. That\u2019s why, even if you hate vaccinations, the day that one is finally really FDA approved and begins to be administered to the public should be a day of celebration for all. It will mark a turning point, finally. ",

            "answer_text": "The virus is following a course that is fairly predictable now that we have a little data on its patterns. I am not sure what the original author is asking some data points have gone down some have gone up at different periods of time and different locations. It is likely the case count will go up in the areas of the country that get colder and people spend more time inside. In the summer in the southern state people are indoors more often because the weather outside is unpleasantly hot. In Arizona we had our peak in June-August.. Gradually going down as the weather was less hot. The people that have died have gone down consistently for several months as have the hospitalizations. It will not go away. President Trump and Former Vice President Biden do not always use the correct words for the message they are try to send. You really have to look at the actions along with the words. The problem with that is media and our search engines are filtering what we see. Really what you have to do is get creative in search queries in order to find people and news that balances out what is pushed to us on our devices. This task is not easy, but it can be done. Get out into the real world and talk to people the true heartbeat of the nation can be found. You really have to leave the major metro areas to find it. I encourage people to do that. The virus will be accepted into our society sometime after vaccines are released (if they are) or enough treatments are found that make this virus more manageable After all we have far more deaths each year from heart diseases than we do from this NOVEL VIRUS. The difference is we have treatments for heart disease that people accept as part of the norm so heart disease is not a never ending media push that the sky is falling (we are all going to die) mentality. I believe that kind of acceptance will begin to appear around May of 2021 ",
