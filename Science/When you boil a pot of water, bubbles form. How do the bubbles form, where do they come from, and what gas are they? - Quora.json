            "answer_text": "The gas is called damp, or water vapour. They come from the lowest parts of the water, those nearest to the flame. When they rise, being much less dense than water (a factor of 1853), they cool off to slightly under 100 degrees Celsius, so they implode to fluid water. The sound this makes is called singing. Many mistake it for boiling and spoil the tea. ",

            "answer_text": "When the bonds between water molecules are heated, they gain energy. At 100 degrees c, the bonds break and liquid water becomes a gas - water vapour - which is just water but as a gas. The bubbles are the water vapour molecules rising to the surface and leaving the liquid water. ",
