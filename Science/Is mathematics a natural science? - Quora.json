            "answer_text": "Mathematics is not simply natural science, nor is it science. Rather, think of it as a \u201cMeta-science\u201d. In that, the mathematics lays out the conceptual framework of the natural world, in which we then understand further using science. For example. Consider 2+2=4. Is 2 real? Is the answer 4 somehow natural? Well, if you had 2 apples, and then somehow acquired 2 more, you would have 4 apples. It would be difficult to claim otherwise. However, the expression 2+2=4 is not a description of fruit, or the definition of an apple. Science takes care of that. The mathematics in this case simply takes care of the aspect of quantity. Nothing more. Expanding a little further, it is well known how various mathematical constructs seem to re-appear all over nature. The Fibonacci sequence, the number pi, the number e, are pervasive across nature. They describe the pattern of petals on flowers, the spiral of a snail shell, or, the number of seeds in the apples above. As we continue to expand our understanding of mathematics, what we discover in nature (through the scientific method) remains contained within the mathematics. If one appears to contradict the other, it suggests a revision to account for the discovery. Mathematics and science move forward, hand-in-hand, perpetually expanding each other\u2019s scope and application. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is usually classified as a \"formal science\" rather than as a natural science. Here is the wikipedia entry about formal science: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science Back in the day (when scholars were much less specialized than they are now), many people who one would best classify as \"natural scientists\" contributed a great deal to mathematics as well. Mathematics is indeed linked intricately to the natural sciences even if it is seemingly better to classify it as something somewhat different. I have no comment to offer about alien worlds. ",
