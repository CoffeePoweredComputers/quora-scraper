            "answer_text": "No. The Bible has science. Statements Consistent With Paleontology Dinosaurs are referred to in several Bible books. The book of Job describes two dinosaurs. One is described in chapter 40 starting at verse 15, and the other in chapter 41 starting at verse 1. We think you will agree that 1\u00bd chapters about dinosaurs is a lot\u2014since most people do not even realize that they are mentioned in the Bible.Statements Consistent With AstronomyThe Bible frequently refers to the great number of stars in the heavens. Here are two examples.Genesis 22:17Blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies.Jeremiah 33:22\u201cAs the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.\u201dEven today, scientists admit that they do not know how many stars there are. Only about 3,000 can be seen with the naked eye. We have seen estimates of 1021 stars\u2014which is a lot of stars.[2] (The number of grains of sand on the earth\u2019s seashores is estimated to be 1025. As scientists discover more stars, wouldn\u2019t it be interesting to discover that these two numbers match?)The Bible also says that each star is unique.1 Corinthians 15:41There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.All stars look alike to the naked eye.* Even when seen through a telescope, they seem to be just points of light. However, analysis of their light spectra reveals that each is unique and different from all others.[1] (*Note: We understand that people can perceive some slight difference in color and apparent brightness when looking at stars with the naked eye, but we would not expect a person living in the first century A.D. to claim they differ from one another.)The Bible describes the precision of movement in the universe.Jeremiah 31:35,36Thus says the LORD,Who gives the sun for a light by day,The ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night,Who disturbs the sea,And its waves roar(The LORD of hosts is His name):\u201cIf those ordinances departFrom before Me, says the LORD,Then the seed of Israel shall also ceaseFrom being a nation before Me forever.\u201dThe Bible describes the suspension of the Earth in space.Job 26:7He stretches out the north over empty space;He hangs the earth on nothing.Statements Consistent With MeteorologyThe Bible describes the circulation of the atmosphere.Ecclesiastes 1:6The wind goes toward the south,And turns around to the north;The wind whirls about continually,And comes again on its circuit.The Bible includes some principles of fluid dynamics.Job 28:25To establish a weight for the wind,And apportion the waters by measure.The fact that air has weight was proven scientifically only about 300 years ago. The relative weights of air and water are needed for the efficient functioning of the world\u2019s hydrologic cycle, which in turn sustains life on the earth.[1] (If you are a physics enthusiast, please ignore our omission of the terms mass, gravity, and density from this comment.)",

            "answer_text": "The word theory, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty. It means \"a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena\" (Barnhart 1948). In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved. All are facts:Life appeared on earth more than two billion years ago;Life forms have changed and diversified over life's history;Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors;Natural selection is a significant factor affecting how species change.Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. It has useful applications in epidemiology, pest control, drug discovery, and other areas (Bull and Wichman 2001; Eisen and Wu 2002; Searls 2003).Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that life has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwin's theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.If \"only a theory\" were a real objection, creationists would also be issuing disclaimers complaining about the theory of gravity, atomic theory, the germ theory of disease, and the theory of limits (on which calculus is based). The theory of evolution is no less valid than any of these. Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges (Milgrom 2002). Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact.Creationism is neither theory nor fact; it is, at best, only an opinion. Since it explains nothing, it is scientifically useless.",
