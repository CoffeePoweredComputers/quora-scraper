            "answer_text": "Lets look at couple of points before I start with the actual answer. First, there is something called as Magnetic flux (B) which tells us the strength of magnetic field of a body. Magnetic flux is a conserved quantity, i.e., B\u00d7R[math]^2[/math] = constant This means that if the radius (R) of the body increases, the magnetic flux (B) would decrease and if the radius decreases, the magnetic flux would increase. Second, a celestial body\u2019s magnetic poles may be different from its geographic poles as the magnetic axis is different from the rotational axis. The two axis coinciding, and hence the magnetic poles coinciding with geographic poles, although possible, would be a special case. Even the Earth\u2019s magnetic poles are different from its geographic poles (see the below figure). Geographic north pole, or true north, is at 90 degree N. The magnetic south pole is somewhere near the northern Canadian coast. The magnetic compass needle points towards the magnetic south pole.   When the Nuclear fusion taking place in a star\u2019s core stops, there is no more energy being produced. There is no more Radiation pressure which opposes the inward acting gravity. As a result, the star undergoes a collapse and it is said to \u201cdie\u201d. A massive star undergoes an extremely violent collapse called as Supernova during its death. Depending upon the mass, M, of the core of the dying star, the remnant is a compact star which is a White dwarf (M < ~1.44 solar mass), a Neutron star (~1.44 < M < ~3 solar mass) or a Black hole (M > ~3 solar mass). Due to large mass and small radius, the gravity of a massive star\u2019s core is so strong that it pulls almost all the electrons inside the nuclei which combine with protons to form neutrons. The resulting object is almost fully made up of of neutrons, though on the surface some electrons and protons are still left. This compact object is called as neutron star. It\u2019s radius (R) is about 10\u201320 km. The escape velocity can be from 100,000 - 150,000 km/s, or from a third to half the speed of light. Compare that with the Earth\u2019s escape velocity of 11 km/s. The value of g for a neutron star is about 2\u00d710^11 or 200 billion times g on Earth. Due to the conservation of angular momentum from the origin star, the rotation of the neutron star is extremely high. The fastest rotating neutron star known at present rotates more than 700 times per second! When a star collapses, the magnetic flux of the original star is conserved and the resulting neutron star acquires a very strong magnetic field (see the first point). This produces a strong electric field between the poles and the equator. This electric field can even overcome the strong gravity and tear out the electrons from the equatorial region of the star and accelerate them along the magnetic field lines toward the magnetic poles. This and some other mechanisms cause emission of very intense electromagnetic radiation beams from the poles. This radiation is possible across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. However, radio emission is found to be the most common. The schematic of this can be seen below.  You can also see that the magnetic axis is different from the rotation axis in the above schematic. Due to this, when the neutron star rotates, its radiation beam sweeps across like a lighthouse beam. If the Earth\u2019s orbit happens to intersect this sweeping beam, we\u2019ll observe a \u201cflash\u201d of the radiation. This can be seen in the video below.  Assume that the point of view of video is the Earth. Whenever the beam passes the Earth, we see the flash or pulse of the radiation from the neutron star. Hence the name Pulsar (or pulsating source of radio emission). These pulses can range from few seconds to few microsecond depending on how fast the neutron star rotates. In short, Pulsars are the neutron stars whose, electromagnetic radiation (in the form of pulses) can be observed. ",

            "answer_text": " Although all pulsars are believed to be spinning neutron stars, not all neutron stars may be pulsars. When a star becomes a supernova and detonates, it can leave behind a rapidly spinning, dense cinder which is all that is left of its iron core. It spins rapidly for the same reason that an ice skater pulling in their arms spins faster. So, as the ejected gas from the supernova begins to clear out, what is left behind is a spinning neutron star about 20 miles across rotating up to 30 times per SECOND. This body is expected to have a powerful magnetic field, and so has all of the essential ingredients for becoming a powerful accelerator of matter, provided there is matter left over in its surroundings after the supernova. The Crab Nebula in Taurus is the remnant of a supernova that happened around 1054 AD. In the 1960's, radio pulses were detected from a pulsar in the heart of this remnant. Optical flashes were also detected from this pulsar in the late 1970's. If the star was a member of a binary star system, the companion star could provide the necessary matter, and so we end up with a pulsar in a binary system. The gas is accelerated by the spinning magnetic field of the neutron star, and the charged particles emit 'synchrotron radiation' as they are accelerated to nearly the speed of light. The surface of the neutron star itself can be a source of matter as the neutrons there decay into protons and electrons. These charged particles accelerate out along the magnetic poles of the neutron star and emit synchrotron radiation in pulses. Every time one of the poles of the neutron star crosses our line of sight, we see a pulse of radiation like a lighthouse beacon. Astronomers have long noted that there are more supernova remnants than their are pulsars, suggesting that not all supernova produce neutron stars and pulsars. There are also fewer pulsars that have been detected, than the expected number given the best estimates for how many stars are likely to be in the proper mass range to produce neutron stars as end products rather than black holes. So, there are still some things we do not understand about how pulsars are formed. Source:Archive of Astronomy Questions and Answers ",
