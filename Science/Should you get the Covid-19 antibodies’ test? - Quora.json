It may be able to provide information if you now have some immunity. However, make sure it is one of the good (98+% accurate) tests.

Experts hope antibody tests can give health officials a better idea of how common the virus is. Once scientists know who has had the virus, they can find out how sick it makes most people. And they can study what happens if people who've had it come into contact with it again. Along with other scientific information, this can help researchers understand who might be immune to the virus.\u201d Coronavirus Antibody Testing ",
