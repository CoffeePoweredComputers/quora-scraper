            "answer_text": "There are a few public health graduate programs in the US that confer the ScD as a doctoral research degree. I attended one of them, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, which is now known as the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The other program is the Harvard Chan School of Public Health eliminated the ScD option in Fall 2016. You can also get another doctorate in many US Public Health programs, known as a DrPH, or doctorate in public health. At Hopkins at least, not all departments conferred a DrPH option. The experience of PhD and ScD candidates at Hopkins is fundamentally the same. Thirty years ago, when I first started my graduate school life, the ScD has a somewhat higher ranking or cache in some Hopkins departments because it was the \u201coriginal\u201d degree, was connected to the British tradition, and there were many physician academic researchers from the UK who believed we ScD folks were the more disciplined scholars. By the early 90s, there was little difference. In the UK, where I have also studied (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) an ScD or DSc is considered a higher level doctorate to a PhD. That credential is not currently conferred at the London School of Hygiene, but it is at Oxford in some discplines. See: https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/2014-15/doladoctofscie/ ",

            "answer_text": "The meaning and level of training varied across countries and academic institutions. Some institutions only award PhD or ScD. Some award both. Both are doctoral degrees, and the relative training and level/importance is defined by the respective institutions. Both PhD and ScD are the highest academic degrees, while J.D., D.S.W., M.D. (Juris Doctor, Doctor of Social Work, Doctor of Medicine) are professional doctorate in the practice of a specific discipline. In general, the PhD degree is the highest research level degree with the implication of the highest level of learning including for some institutions proficiency in a foreign language at the reading and writing level so that the candidate could read publications or acquire knowledge in other languages. ScD degree is most relevant to the sciences, while PhD is awarded in all disciplines. Some institutions give honorary degrees as a ScD. Some award honorary degree as a Ph.D. Honoris Causa. Some institutions award their highest degree based on the body of work in one\u2019s life time, and some awards are based on a set of submitted work as worthy of the highest degree. ",
