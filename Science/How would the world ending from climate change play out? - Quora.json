            "answer_text": "Your question makes an assumption \u201cthe world ending\u201d which is ambivalent. So there\u2019s no non-ambivalent answer. So the replier like me has to interpret what your question means, and you\u2019re not around to ask. OK. The world will not end - we could have a nuclear holocaust, or raise the temperature of the planet by many degrees C. but the world will still revolve on its axis, it will still orbit the sun and it will still support life. We know that\u2019s the case, because at different times in the Earth\u2019s history it\u2019s been as cold as an ice block and totally frozen over, and other times much warmer than present. This information is available by Googling - The warmest period was probably the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which peaked about 55 million years ago. Global temperatures during this event may have warmed by 5\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C within a few thousand years, with the Arctic Ocean reaching a subtropical 23\u00b0C. Mass extinctions resulted. Climate myths: It's been far warmer in the past, what's the big deal? So however hot we make the planet, and we are heating the planet, there\u2019s no scientific doubt whatsoever, then the planet will survive, and \u201clife\u201d will continue. But note the comment above \u201cmass extinctions resulted\u201d. What needs understanding is the the great advance of the human species has occurred only in the last 10,000 years, during the geological period called the holocene (the name comes from Greek, meaning entirely (wholly) recent.) What particularly characterises the holocene is its constancy, the temperature of the Earth, the climate and the seasons has remained very stable throughout this time. Human beings have pretty well colonised every ecological niche on the planet, except Antarctica. In the last 100 years, population numbers have soared exponentially, and are now so high as to make it a reasoned concern as to how we\u2019ll even be able to continue to feed ourselves in our present climate. So it stands to logic that any significant temperature deviation from the holocene norm is going to affect us adversely. Even if other ecological niches open up to us, that not going to help those living in conditions no longer suitable for sustainable existence. So even at the most benign estimate of temperature rise, we\u2019re looking at sea level rises of several metres over the course of several centuries and the retreat from very hot tropical or desert regions from unbearable and unliveable heat. This would mean the forced migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people or their starvation. I believe this is now inevitable, even if we do cut our CO2 emissions drastically, and the temperature reaches \u201conly\u201d 1.5 deg C. A medium likely prediction of global warming is around 2 - 2.5 deg C, still with cutting our emissions but not urgently enough. Sea level rise would be higher and the refugee and existential crisis will be much worse. I doubt normal societal cohesion would survive this scenario. A worse prediction sees temperature rises of 3 deg C or greater. The likelihood of mass human die off and species loss would then be very high. We are already suffering the early effects of what is now called the anthropocene. Ice loss in the Arctic and around the planet, accelerating sea-level rise, drought, forest fires, flooding etc. India\u2019s national temperature has risen 2 deg C in the last couple of years, and millions are now affected by severe drought. What people blithely thought might affect their children or grandchildren is already affecting all of us. But global warming isn\u2019t the only problem - we are devastating the oceans, using up our water supplies, loosing our soils, poisoning ourselves with plastic, and perhaps most worryingly increasing our numbers to unprecedented levels. Overpopulation is both part of the cause of global warming and is also part of the severity of the effects of global warming on humanity, there are just a lot more people around to be harmed. Even at the most benign, humanity is facing several existential threats at the same time. Any one of these could cause massive human sorrow. Taken together, at their worst, we might see human populations culled by disease, drought and disaster to a billion or less over a period of a couple of centuries. Some humans will survive, but much of what it presently means to be human, our societies, our technology, our cities and our accomplishments might not. Nature is being assaulted. It doesn\u2019t fight back. It merely does, heedlessly, what nature always does. It owes no species a living and never has. That applies to us as much as it ever applied to any ammonite or dinosaur.

            "answer_text": "The \u201cworld ending\u201d is one of those expressions open to a lot of interpretation. Whatever happens with climate change the Earth, the planet, the space rock, will be fine. So the next most extreme interpretation of the \u201cworld ending\u201d is the extinction of all life on Earth. For the more anthropocentric the \u201cworld ending\u201d is the extinction of human life. For most of those concerned with climate change the \u201cworld ending\u201d concerns are not as extreme as this. The main ones are: The end of a \u201cmodern\u201d way of life.The end of human civilization.The mass extinction of the species. Loss of biodiversity.Here are some scenarios for how events could unfold (from an earlier answer), I think that there is a continuum of possible outcomes. The variation is: Best case: humans reduce emissions substantially 45% from 2010 levels before 2030, there will be a temperature anomaly of +1.5C this century. A lot of coral is bleached and some coral related ecosystems collapse. Other ecosystems continue under considerable pressure from human activity including the effect of the temperature anomaly.Current trajectory: by the end of the century the temperature anomaly is +3.3C. The Arctic has its first ice-free summer sometime mid-century. The coral is bleached and dead, multiple marine ecosystems are in collapse. Sea-level rises more than half a meter. Miami and similar locations flood with every high-tide storm. Frequent droughts and floods in other locations cause crop yields to drop. Mass migrations, caused by crop failures, raise geopolitical tensions. Numerous nation states experience societal collapse.Plausible scenario: multiple ecosystems collapse this causes widespread failure in the human food chain. Total global financial collapse leads rapidly to global societal collapse. Human population declines substantially, the remaining human population survives by returning to a largely agrarian society\u2014the Earth has a carrying capacity of about 1 billion for this type of society.Extreme scenario: multiple non-linear climate feedbacks (e.g. Clathrate gun hypothesis) come into play. Temperatures rise very rapidly. Rapid disintegration of the human food chain leads to starvation, civil unrest, and societal collapse. Mass extinction events across marine life, plants, insects, birds, and animals. Either extinction of humans or a near extinction event reduces the population to below a hundred million.For some reason, I am in favor of the best case and think all the other emission approaches are dumb. Anton Carver's answer to If climate change is real or not real and we choose to adapt or fail to adapt how many possible outcomes are there? ",
