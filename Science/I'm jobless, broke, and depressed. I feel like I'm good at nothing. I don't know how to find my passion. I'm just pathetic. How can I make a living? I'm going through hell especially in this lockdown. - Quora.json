            "answer_text": "Just so you know, feeling depressed about not knowing your passion and not knowing what you want to do for a career is very common and causes depression oftenly. In this day in age I\u2019d recommend going through an apprenticeship program for a trade. The trades are in really high demand and increasing in demand and will always be in high demand and the coronavirus does not stop them from working because they are essential. Electricians, plumbers, and hvac make the most money out of the trades especially electricians. What I love about apprenticeships is that you get a balance of on the job and classroom training and you get paid a good wage. And even better, you don\u2019t have to pay for your education!! So you can be broke and do this. You just need a reliable car because you need to drive to different work sites. You can go union or non union. Union is more likely gonna pay you higher wages, overtime, great benefits, and give you more job security. Non union contracters still give good pay and benefits as long as you find a good one. I\u2019m gonna talk about electricians now because I know more about them. So union is better but its harder to get in. You have to have had good grades in high school, a high school diploma, taken at least Algebra 1, can pass a drug test, and pass a math and reading comprehension test, and an interview. During the interview you have to show strong interest in the career because they are investing in you. You may also have to wait many months till you can actually start but that depends on the union. Some may hire you right away. You will be able to start right away at a non union contractor because you\u2019ll be an employee. And it sounds like you want to be able to start right away, but I\u2019d join ElectricianTalk forum and ask about your local union and see if they have you start right away. Another thing to consider is if you want to to do residential or commercial. Residential is lower pay, but easier and there\u2019s side jobs you can do to make up for less salary. But its still a lot of money you get and you won\u2019t have debt. Commercial work takes more skill and they pay you more and its a more well rounded experience. Being an electrician is a very interesting job because everyday is different, you get to work inside and outside, working in townhouses to mansions or resturaunts to manufacturing facilities, you get to see every part of the process of a building getting built, there\u2019s problem solving, and so much more. You\u2019re gonna get paid more than the average person and if you go union and commercial, you can make up to $80,000 a year and have great benefits and job security. This day in age college degrees are getting less valuable and ironically costs more. That\u2019s the reasons why I decided to be an electrician apprentice. But there\u2019s lots of different trades you can do apprenticeships for that you can make a good living too. There is no perfect job out there and you will adapt to what you do. And its not always about the job, its about the people you work with too. But don\u2019t give up and settle for something you hate. I got all depressed too because I didn\u2019t know what to do and how to find my passion. The only way to find out your passions is to do something. For example, when I was 18, I asked for a motorized bike kit for Christmas, to put on a bicycle I bought. My friend and I worked on that thing for many hours days and I found out that I loved learning about how these engines work and putting on performance mods and fixing wheels and stuff. My point is you just got to dive into something. It will feel really good to move forward. You feel depressed because you feel stuck, but that\u2019s just your emotional mind telling you you need change. Don\u2019t listen to anyone that says you are just being lazy. Depression is a real bitch. But once you resolve what\u2019s weighing on you, you will no longer feel the way you do. Take care friend. You\u2019ll do good, you\u2019re already taking a step forward by asking this question. ",

            "answer_text": "Depression ain\u2019t for sissies! I speak from experience! First, the problem with depression is that it sucks all the willpower and drive from your soul and so \u201cdoing something about it\u201d is not going to be a real answer, and yet for anything to get better you are going to have to do something. And since you can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d depression, there is a lot of guilt and shame associated with the disease \u2014 especially for men. Those around you, even your family and best friends will be at a loss for what to do and that is no more their fault than having the disease is yours. However, they are likely to offer absolutely worthless, brain-dead suggestions like \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just go down to the health clinic\u201d or an all time favorite of mine is forwarding you ads from some job site like Career Builder and believing they are \u201chelping\u201d somehow. I am a huge fan of the medication they have for depression today and doctors are fairly liberal about starting you out on whatever the drug reps are pushing these days and will usually have a month of free samples if you will ask. So you simply must, somehow, someway, get to a doctor and get some chemical help! Next, believe it or not a suntan can make all the difference. Since sleeping is your main pastime lately (I\u2019m just guessing), try taking a nap out in the sun. Of course, an alarm to make sure you don\u2019t fry is probably a wise move. Psalms 34:18 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Finally, if you will email me at subservboi (AT) gmail I will give you my phone number and you can call anytime to talk. There is a way through this but it is going to take some help. You did your part in reaching out here and now I am reaching back so take advantage of what God is already doing to help you walk through this dark, evil valley. ",
