            "answer_text": "Big bang theory has been described by the scientists and theologians in slightly different manner. However, both agree that before the formation of universe existed a consciousness. Then energy, matter, life and intelligence etc. were not created, but a program of creation was imbibed in this consciousness. We can term this consciousness as GOD. When this consciousness decided to create universe, it broke itself in smallest possible particles known as GOD PARTICLES. It was like the seed of a tree that contains the entire software for sprouting and growth of the tree. The seed sprouts when all ingredients for its life are present. This also depends on the software imbibed in the ever existing consciousness i.e. when the creation would start, and when PRALYA (total destruction) would take place. Thus, the universe came in existence due to presence of that consciousness that we term as GOD (Generator, Operator and Destroyer). When these God Particles joined, the creation of universe started. Scientists have named this event as big bang. Energy, matter, life and other ingredients were produced at this point and started joining; thus creating the universe. This process is still continuing, and universes are being continuously created. ",
