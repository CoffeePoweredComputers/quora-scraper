            "answer_text": "\u201cDo things fall to the ground because earth curves time around it?\u201d First a disclaimer: I am not a physicist, so there may be flaws in this explanation. Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity says that four-dimensional space-time (note, not just time) is curved by the presence of massive objects such as the Earth, and this causes masses to be attracted to each other. As I understand it, this is the cause of gravity. But as a chemical engineer, I\u2019ve never come across a situation where relativistic effects have been significant, so I always stick to Newtonian mechanics and gravity, because it works for me. ",
