            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of sensor. Some \u2018heat sensors\u2019 basically measure the local temperature, so they can\u2019t tell you much about the heat at a distance. But others, like infrared sensors, can detect the amount of IR radiation being emitted from a certain direction, which allows you to figure out how hot something is at a distance.
