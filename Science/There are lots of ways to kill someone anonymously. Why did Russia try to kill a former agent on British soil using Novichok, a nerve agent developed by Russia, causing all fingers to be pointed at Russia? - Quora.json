            "answer_text": "To send a message. To keep international tensions simmering. To distract Russian citizens from domestic problems that the head of state hasn\u2019t addressed in his eighteen-year reign. To maintain power.  There was no direct benefit in poisoning UK citizen Skripal, his Russian daughter, a British first responder, and two unlucky bystanders. Skripal was exchanged to the UK in 2010, and if he had had any valuable secrets to reveal, would have done so years ago, although he was working with Western intelligence. In any such operation, those who ordered it are prepared for a range of results. If Skripal had died alone and it was ruled a heart attack or unknown causes, well at least it is one of a string of such deaths, and looking like a possible Kremlin hit to anyone paying attention. But whether the target dies or not, if the chemical agent is identified, then everyone knows the Russian state was involved. If the assassins are identified or caught, all the more so. If innocent bystanders are harmed or murdered by a Russian weapon of mass destruction used indiscriminately in a foreign state, it will only improve the odds that the message is heard. The message is: To ordinary Russians: it\u2019s the Cold War all over again, the West slanders us as murderers, enemies, traitors, and fifth-columnists deserving to be murdered are everywhere, our murdering is justified, we are an important and powerful state, and we are sending our soldiers to fight the enemy on their own soil. Never mind about the flat economy that we weren\u2019t competent to manage and your rising retirement age, support your strongman president-for-life.To the rest of the world: make your statements of protest, expel our spies and diplomats, apply more of your pathetic sanctions that only help us to maintain a siege mentality, abuse human rights at home, and cluster around Dear Leader.To Russian state and security people: you\u2019re working for gangsters, we own you for life, don\u2019t betray us, we\u2019ll kill you, we\u2019ll use all of the state\u2019s resources, the law and our own promises mean nothing to us.This is what expert on international crime and Russian security Mark Galeotti calls dark power.  Not that the Russian state is playing three-dimensional chess, or anything like that. The agency that attempted the failed Skripal assassination, commonly known as the GRU, probably couldn\u2019t be trusted to keep a surprise party secret from a six-year-old. They have a record of public failures: Leonid Bershidsky, \u201cPutin\u2019s Swashbuckling Spies Are Hurting Him,\u201d in Bloomberg, 2018-09-05.In this light, they are open to ridicule: Seriously, the alleged Skripal poisoners might as well have been wearing big stickers on their backs that said \"RUSSIAN GOONS,\" smoking Belomorkanals and eating sunflower seeds pic.twitter.com/zELW70IQfI\u2014 max seddon (@maxseddon) September 5, 2018\n  On the other hand, as I mentioned, in planning such an operation, one anticipates a range of possible results. These are not super spies. Not KGB. They are military intelligence. A worrying + problematic new narrative is emerging that #Russia's #GRU are somehow a bunch of bunglers (incl Ben Wallace: \"more Johnny English than James Bond\")Inaccurate + miss point. GRU ethos about taking chances to not miss opportunities, even if won't always succeed\u2014 Mark Galeotti (@MarkGaleotti) September 6, 2018\n They are conducting operations against their enemy, going for possible results, and considering their risk assessment, as if in wartime. Being identified as an attack by the Russian Federation on UK soil was either an acceptable risk, or an objective. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the British authorities on March 4, 2018, the former GRU officer and English spy , 66-year-old Sergei Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia, were poisoned in the English city of Salisbury by poison agent A234 (\"Novichok\"). This provoked the largest international scandal, as London accused Russia. Against the Russian Federation, sanctions were imposed, including by the United States. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, commenting on Theresa May's statement, described what was happening in the British parliament as a \"circus show,\" noting that London had embarked on another information and political campaign based on provocation. Zakharova urged the British authorities to disclose the results of the investigation of the cases of Litvinenko, Boris Berezovsky, Alexander Perepelichny and many others who mysteriously died in Britain. On May 25, the Russian Embassy in London demanded that the UK apologize for accusations on the \"case of the Skripal \". On May 23, the daughter of defector Sergei Skripal Yulia stated that she very much hopes to return to Russia. And where is Yulia? - said her relatives, but the British authorities are silent.  Wedding of Sergey Skripal and Lyudmila. 1972 year. Lyudmila died in the UK (diagnosed with cancer) in 2012. This happened two years after his life in Britain. I want to ask why she died in Britain? She fell ill before cancer? Again poisoning?More than \u00a3 10 million ($ 12.9 million) of taxpayers were spent by law enforcement officers of Wiltshire county to investigate two crimes: poisoning with nerve agents of Russians Sergei and Julia Skripal in Salisbury and a couple of British in Amesbury.  Theresa May met Prince William with an unexpected gesture, which can be taken for a curtsey only with imagination.There are many ways to kill someone. Why did Russia try to kill the former agent on British soil, using the Newbie, the nervous agent developed by Russia? Let's just think about how intelligent and thinking people are at facts. Why should Russia kill an old and harmless British intelligence agent? What's the point? No one knows or remembers this agent. If Russia wanted to kill the old intelligence agent Skripal then why did not do it immediately and waited for him to become an old man? You wrote there are many ways to kill. It is likely that every special service has special means for killing, but why should the special services use something specific and what will help to calculate it? You write Russia tried to kill the former agent, but this is not proven and with such success you can say you tried to kill the former agent. Why are the relatives of Skripal not allowed to see the sick Skripal and talk to him? Why were the house and animals destroyed immediately after poisoning? Why could not just close this territory and investigate everything? Why did everything happen near the military buildings of Britain?  Yulia Skripal was preparing to become a mother before going to Salisbury, her sister said. Julia left the Salisbury hospital. Where is Yulia?Why did not Russian specialists get admitted to the facts of poisoning for study? Why, for example, the report on the poisonous substance of the Novichok has been published, but his country is not mentioned, but all the mass media are writing about Russia? Why, if they know the names of the two killers, they do not require Russia to extradite them? Why did they talk earlier about a guy and a girl as poisoners and now they are two men?  Yulia with a cat in the UK. The neighbors of Skripal told that the cat after the poisoning of the Skripals had disappeared and suspected that she had been killed by the British special services. Where is this charming cat?See the killing occurs. Instead of justified accusations and court immediately publication in the press and a demonstration on television. Excuse me, where is the truth? And the truth is that on the eve of the 2018 World Cup in Russia all this is happening. The old agent who betrayed his homeland and secretly worked for the exploration of another country meets with his daughter. It happens in Britain. Immediately blamed Russia. Immediately learn that it was Russian poison. Applause. Just look yourself - Gas-poison Novichok is in the US and other countries. He was even published in a book and sold Amazon. For example, you are a chemist. You buy a book on Amazon and have the formula Novichok. And for example create a poison Novichok. For example, you are a chemist and work for a serious organization. So why not?  Sergey Skripal. He was poisoned by the most deadly poison on the Earth from which peoples do not survive, and Sergei Skripal along with his daughter was discharged from the hospital in Salisbury in March 2018. And where is Sergei?The newcomer raced in the USSR laboratory in Uzbekistan in 1970-1980. After the collapse of the USSR, Uzbekistan closely worked with the US government to neutralize the areas where the \"Novichok\" was tested, that is, the Americans had access to chemical weapons. How dangerous is the Newbie? Poisoning with this poison leads to paralysis of all muscles and severe damage to the nervous system. Death comes from stopping the breath or heart. Vil Mirzayanov, one of the developers, the Beginner left for the United States. Now he lives in the city of Princeton (New Jersey). He wrote: \"Theresa May stated that the\" Novice \"was used for the attempt on Skripal. Its chemical formula is openly published in my book \"State secrets. An insider's Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapon's Program. \" And here is a fragment from the interview of Vila Mirzayanov's Voice of America: \"The British could synthesize it on the basis of the formulas that I published in my book published in 2008 (State Secrets: An Insider's Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapons Program Secrets Each country independently takes care of its own security, and in the study of possible threats it was possible to create a sample. \" So, from the words of this citizen. 10 years have been known about this substance. If the British authorities claim that it was this substance at the scene of the crime, it means, again from the words of this citizen, that they SHOULD have had a sample of this substance synthesized or received from someone. And they had to know what this substance is. But nevertheless, for ANY reason, this substance was never included in the list of substances prohibited by the OPCW.  Niece of Sergei Skripal - Victoria. She wanted to see her uncle, but she was not given it. Why is Sergey Skripal's niece not being given a British visa and not allowed to see his uncle? Where is Sergei?Niece Sergei Skripal suggested that his uncle is no longer alive Otherwise, how can you explain such a long silence and the refusal of the British authorities to show the live Sergei Skripal \"The media have published statements by British officials concerning suspects in the Salisbury and Amesbury incidents. Some links with Russia have been made. The names and photographs published in the media say nothing to us,\" Zakharova said. \"Once again we are calling upon the British side to drop public charges and information manipulations and to start practical interaction between law enforcement agencies. London has numerous requests from the Russian side.\" In principle, if everything is transparent and everything is clear then why not give specific data for Russia? Why are russian specialists and policemen not allowed to do? Why are russian relatives and friends of Sergei Skripal not given a meeting? \"If we are talking about Russian citizens who traveled to the UK from Russia, they must a priori have a British visa to receive it, you need to issue a huge number of papers, provide a huge number of documents and, most importantly, leave fingerprints in the embassy. asked for fingerprints, the British side refused to provide us, as well as all the materials we asked earlier, \"- said the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova. Are not there too many questions? I think if the special services would like to kill the former agent of the traitor, they would have done it much earlier. If, for example, murder is an act of intimidation of future traitors, why is everything so mysterious? He could have been killed openly. I confess strange for British justice which makes a statement even when the matter is not over. So where are the deadly poisoned and survivors Skripals? Where did they go after recovering from the hospital? I hardly believe in the involvement of Russian intelligence. How to explain everything? The former agent kept a secret for 20 years when he lived in Britain and suddenly decided to give it away? No. There were no statements from him. So why is it needed? Since Yulia Skripal is a Russian citizen, it seems reasonable to let me know where she is and what's wrong with her? At least her relatives who are genuinely worried? ",
