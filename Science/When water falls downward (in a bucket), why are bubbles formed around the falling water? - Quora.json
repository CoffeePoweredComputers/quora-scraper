Just in case you would be interested, this effect is used by industry and other people who would like to create compressed air. The process is called Trompe. It actually tries to increase the amount of air trapped in a falling stream, to save and compress it. This line has a brief introduction to the process Harness Hydro Power with a Trompe | MOTHER EARTH NEWS This is just one of many videos on Youtube that explain the process https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvf0lD5xzH0 ",

            "answer_text": "When something falls into water, the surface of the water is forced open to let the object pass. If it falls fast and plunges directly under the surface, the water will close above it, but not directly. Thereby enveloping an air-pocket which will move upwards fast. The surface tension of water is rather high, so the air pocket will stay closed for a (very short) time, showing as a bubble. Falling water in a bucket or pool acts the same, and as water always tends to fall apart in drops or splashes, a lot of bubbles are formed. ",
