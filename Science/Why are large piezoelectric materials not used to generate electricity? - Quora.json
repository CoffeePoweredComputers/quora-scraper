            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a good question when you consider copper is the carrier of most electricity. Bulk copper has NO electricity. Power must be applied, and the copper cannot be a bulk shape, the copper must be in very specific shapes - a coil, or a long thin strand we call copper wire. The reason it\u2019s interesting is, you can run a Mack truck or 10,000 Mack trucks over copper and you\u2019ll get nothing, no power will be forthcoming. But piezo materials are ready to go with just some initial poling. The answer might be, \u201cwe have not found the right manifestation/format/etc. for piezo yet\u201d because compared to piezo, copper is a DEADBEAT material. You cannot pole copper and get anything useful out of it. Copper does not give a rip if you try to impose an alignment of its internal structure - copper says \u201cwhatever, sorry, not interested.\u201d You have to force the issue with copper, yet it is the mainstay of most power systems on the planet. And the other thing is, since quartz - which is piezoelectric - is the SECOND MOST ABUNDANT NATURAL MATERIAL on this planet (see What is Quartz? for example) - many beaches are covered in piezo quartz sand, including beaches in Florida - Siesta Key beach (beautiful beach, btw, if you\u2019re ever in Sarasota) - we have so much piezo material on this planet, it makes no sense it is still an esoteric use. Quartz piezo is EVERYWHERE. Copper has to be mined. So piezo materials are not fully exploited. To further drive this home, consider the simple formula for the magnetic force of a copper coil: F = NI where F = magnetic force, I = electric current in the coil, and N = number of turns in the coil. You could take a 1-million ton block of copper and you\u2019d have F = 0, no magnetic field. But take a small chunk of the block, stretch-form it into a wire, then coil the wire, and with current flowing, BAM you have a strong, easily-detected magnetic field. It took human cleverness to transition from a useless block of copper to a magnetic field formula F = NI and a very specific format (wire, coil, etc.) of the copper. Such cleverness is not forthcoming yet for piezo, which is surprising, owing to the ease-of-access to the material, the cheap cost, and the fact that it produces power with just a small effort. If a proper format and deployment of piezo material could be found, a lot of new industry would rise up and replace old power industry. ",

            "answer_text": "One logical explanation would be, if it were bigger you would have to produce huge stress on the object for it to even produce charge of the order of micro coloumbs. This cannot be done without an external effort and hence the purpose gets defeated. ",
