            "answer_text": "Yes, same as the Earth. At any one time half the Earth or moon is lit by the sun, the other half is in shadow (ie: night). What\u2019s not correct is that there\u2019s a \u201cdark side\u201d to the moon. The same side of the moon always faces Earth, but the far side gets just as much sun as the near side.  Take a crescent moon like this, for example. The reason we only see a sliver of our side of moon lit up is because most of the sunlight is falling on the far side. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It merely spins around its own axis (a moon-day) in the same amount of time ( a month) it takes to complete an orbit around the earth, so that it presents always the same side to us on earth. However, all sides of the moon get illuminated by the sun, most clearly demonstrated by the moon\u2019s phases. When it is \u2018new\u2019 moon, (we see the \u2018dark side of the moon\u2019), the far side of the moon we never get to see from earth is fully illuminated, at full moon (the earth facing half of the moon is fully illumintaed by the sun, the far side is dark).
