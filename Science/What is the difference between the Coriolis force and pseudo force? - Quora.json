            "answer_text": "1 Well to start with coriolis is just an effect not a force. It is experienced by moving bodies in a spinning frame of reference.  While pseudo force can be experienced by a stationary body too. 2 Magnitude In coriolis force(effect) its magnitude is proportional to rate of rotation(not its square) Pseudo force is proportional to the square of rate of rotation. Also both have different frame of reference & vectors involved. Examples- Coriolis effect causes changes in pattern of winds. Pseudo force can be seen in merry go rounds  ",
