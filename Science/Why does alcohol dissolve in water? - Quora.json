            "answer_text": "Well, what functionality does an alcohol share with water? And the obvious answer is the hydroxyl group, i.e. [math]ROH[/math]. And we can point to methanol, and ethanol, the which are infinitely miscible with water, as opposed to propyl alcohol, which has limited water solubility. And that alcohols are MUCH more involatile than their parent alkanes due to the increase of intermolecular interaction is also significant. As the hydrocarbyl chain becomes LONGER, non-polar interaction between the chains becomes more effective, and significant. And thus the volatility of LONGER-CHAIN alkanes DECREASES. And the water-solubility of propyl alcohol, and higher alcohols, is LIMITED. ",

            "answer_text": "All sort of alcohols don't dissolve in water, only those alcohols are soluble which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water. Because of the strength of the attraction of the OH group, first three alcohols(methanol, ethanol and propanol) are completely miscible. They dissolve in water readily i.e in any amount. Starting with the four-carbon butanol the solubility of alcohols tends to decrease. Alcohols with a smaller hydrocarbon chain are very soluble. As the length of the hydrocarbon chain increases, the solubility in water decreases. ",
