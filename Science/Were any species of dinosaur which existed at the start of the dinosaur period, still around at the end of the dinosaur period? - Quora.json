            "answer_text": "No. This is easy to tell by looking at the dinosaurs shown from the Triassic and late Cretaceous. Triassic: prosauropods  small theropods   A few very early ornithopods  Cretaceous: I won\u2019t even bother with pictures, actually. I would estimate that at least 2/3 of all dinosaurs you are familiar with are from the Cretaceous. They are just more popular. You can tell that most dinosaurs look different form these. All five major dinosaur groups (theropods, ornithopods, sauropodomorphs, thyreophorans, marginocephelians) were present at the end of the age of dinosaurs. Only three were present in the Triassic (theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithopods) and the sauropodomorph group started with prosauropods and they went extinct in the Jurassic as true sauropods appeared. By the end of the age of dinosaurs, the species had changed dramatically. Species rarely live for more than a couple million years. The coelacanth is an exception, but it is one of only a select few. Dinosaurs existed for 230/250ish million years. The Earth itself changed too much in that time for most species to persist. However, I can show you a couple of different species form the cretaceous that look a lot like their Triassic ancestors. Lesothosaurus is the last picture I have above. This is Leaellynasaura. Some version depict it with feathers, and it wasn\u2019t quite at the end of the age of dinosaur, but it was an early Cretaceous species.  Minus the feathers, Velociraptor looks a lot like a Ceolophysis.  No species survived for the whole age, but the lineages persisted and some animals at the end of the era looked similar to some from the beginning. ",

            "answer_text": "You do realize, don\u2019t you, that the start of the age of the dinosaurs up to the time of the great extinction lasted longer than the time of the great extinction up to today? The Mesozoic era started over 250 million years ago and ended roughly 65/66 million years ago. Just look at how much has changed in the last 50 million years, or even 25 million years. Even things that haven\u2019t obviously outwardly changed in that time like crocodilians aren\u2019t the exact same thing they were. Take the coelacanth for example, we call it a living fossil but there are differences between it and the most recent fossil ones we have. Heck, we\u2019ve got two genetically distinct populations of them we know of and one of those populations is splitting further. Those two genetically distinct populations only split from each other about 200,000 years ago. That makes the split recent enough that early modern humans were already on the scene. Life only thrives when there\u2019s change, not stagnation. Sure, sometimes it only changes a little, just enough to keep up with things, but those little subtle changes add up too, and eventually a species isn\u2019t the same as it use to be because those little changes, even if not obvious, have made them something else.
