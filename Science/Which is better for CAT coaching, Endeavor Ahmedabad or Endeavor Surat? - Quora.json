            "answer_text": "I would prefer that you choose Endeavor Ahmedabad. As we all know that competitive exams are not something that one can prepare on their own. Similarly preparing for CAT is also more of peer learning and not only restricted to classroom learning. With Endeavor, Ahmedabad branch catering to a large number of students, it will be helpful for building a study group and with various sessions on how to prepare for different exams, it will be helpful for the student.
