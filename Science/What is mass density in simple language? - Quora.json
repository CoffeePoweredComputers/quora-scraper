To understand these concepts, you must learn three basic principles: Mass is the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d (matter) in a given object/area. It directly correlates to weight, so my mass is 90kg, which on Earth is 90kg/~200lbs. Volume is the amount of space a thing occupies. For example, my body takes up ~.1 m^3. The average person uses this with things like liters (metric) and ounces (though hopefully this archaic and confusing system will soon be used in 0/196 countries instead of 3/196). Density is how much mass is in a given volume. We get this number by dividing [mass of thing] by the [volume of thing]. Let\u2019s take water a an example\u2014we take an amount of water that has a volume of 1cm^3 (a cube with each side measuring 1cm\u2026for you poor imperial bastards there are ~2.54cm/inch) and see how much stuff is in there. If you did the experiment, you would find that the ma of the water is very nearly 1 gram. The density of water would therefore be [1 gram]/[1 cm^3]. We can take out the 1\u2019s and make the density of water be ~1g/cm^3 (taking into account natural impurities). Pure H2O would have a consistently verifiable density. You can perform this experiment in either direction (e.g. take a mass reading then find the volume) and it will work. Density is really important to know, a it affects how things float, how liquids interact, architecture, etc. Hopefully this rather flimsy tutorial will leave you marginally more suited to parsing out scientific jargon.
