            "answer_text": "Coherent Energy and Quantum Information can give rise to GR (Locality) because even when physical, atoms are just spheres of energy. It takes a specific number of Atoms to be the size of visible light waves. Atoms are absorbing part of the energy/frequency, but energy itself isn't visible. I get the unsettling feeling that everything is actually transparent because individual Atoms do not have an opacity. ",
