            "answer_text": "Actually its CONVENTIONAL CURRENT which has a path from positive to negative. Conventional Current or CC is a method for simplifying the basic Amperage concept. Also, CC is the thing which ammeters measure. Various conductor materials have different types of movable charge-carriers, and there are many types of conductors. In solid metals it's electron-flow of course, but for most other conductors it's ion flows. In battery-acid the electric current is mostly proton flow. In plasmas the current is mostly electron flow, but also there's some +ion flow in the opposite direction. Same for liquid metal: electron flow, but part of the electric current is the flow of positive metal ions. Take salt water for example. During electric currents, roughly half the current is +Na positive sodium ions flowing one way, and -Cl negative chloride ions flowing the other. It\u2019s two clouds of charges flowing through each other in opposite directions. No electrons. What then is the \"true\" direction of currents in salt water? Simple answer: an ammeter doesn't care about the charge polarities, so it just adds up the two currents. The negative charges flowing CW give the same effect as the positive charges flowing CCW. Ammeters just summ the two separate Na and Cl currents to give a total amperes reading. Ammeters ignore the variety of actual ion-flows. That's what Conventional Current is all about: pretending that a single charge-polarity is flowing, while also intentionally ignoring the real charge-carrier flows. Ions and protons and electrons (and Displacement) is too complicated, and the complication is useless and unnecessary. So, we get rid of the complexity, and just call it \"Current\" rather than \"electron flow, proton flow, sodium ion flow, etc.\" Another example: if we have a simple metal circuit with a direct current, what happens if we ROTATE THE WHOLE CIRCUIT? We can rotate it slowly backwards against the direction of electron flow, so the electrons stop moving. That way only the solid metal and its positive copper ions are creating an electric current. Yet an ammeter\u2019s reading won't change. This shows that electric current in a wire was always a relative flow: the difference between negative flow subtracted from positive. This may seem unusual, but it\u2019s because we usually pretend that the wire itself is still, and only the electrons are drifting. Wrong. Flashlights and tablets and headphones don\u2019t remain still, and their positive parts move around. Yet electric current is the difference between moving positives and negatives. The difference remains the same whenever the electrons stay still and only the positive metal atoms move along. Conventional Current measures the difference in flows of pos-versus-neg, and then it ignores the actual particle motions. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, there are a lot of answers here, most generally right in one way or another, with small errors in them. This is what I know: The first thing to answer is what current is; electrical current is the flow of electrons, not protons, not neutrons, not anything else. Electrons in an atom have valences or orbits; some are tightly bound and some are more distant and loosely bound. Electrons always have a negative charge which is always attracted to a positive charge. When there is enough of a positive charge outside of the atom, to overcome their attraction to the protons in the nucleus, they can leave the atom. If there is enough potential they can be emitted as a high energy photon or free electron; however, at lower energy levels they simply jump to another atom\u2019s valence. This is how semiconductors work. When an electron leaves an atom, it creates a vacancy or hole in the atom\u2019s valences. This hole is a free space which another electron can jump into. As one electron leaves, another one may jump in. As the electrons always move towards the positive attractor, the holes will tend to flow to the negative. You end up with two descriptions of current, one for electron flow and one for hole flow. Hole flow is usually called conventional current, and flows from positive to negative. Electron flow goes in the reverse direction, from negative to positive voltages. It is easy to remember by the fact that electrons are negative and are attracted to and flow towards the positive. For most practical purposes, it is more productive and less confusing to disregard the current direction and simply concentrate on the voltage as being a polarized potential and the current as being a continuous flow.
