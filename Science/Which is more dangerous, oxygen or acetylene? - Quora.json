            "answer_text": "Pure oxygen and acetylene are both gases used for a wide range of industrial welding and cutting applications. They are frequently stored at the same worksite, and both are extremely volatile and dangerously reactive Acetylene to my opinion is more dangerous\u2026. The triple bond which makes the oxy-acetylene flame the hottest of all gas flames is also responsible for two ratherexceptional properties of acetylene gas which you should always remember. The first is this: that free gaseousacetylene, depending on confinement conditions, is potentially unstable at pressures above 15 psig (103kPa). Ifsubject to severe shock, or a source of ignition, some of the triple bonds may break, releasing enough energy tocause all the other molecules in the enclosed volume to decompose into carbon and hydrogen with explosiveforce. The force of such an explosion is not so great as that released by the explosion of most mixtures ofacetylene and oxygen, or acetylene and air, but it is substantial, and can be withstood only by extra-heavy-wallsteel tubing. The maximum free acetylene pressure permitted by safety codes is 15 psig. All oxy-acetyleneequipment is designed and manufactured to permit the use of acetylene at less than 15 psig. How it is possible toship acetylene in cylinders at a pressure of 250 psi (1725 kPa) or more is something we\u2019ll get to a bit later in thischapter.The other property of acetylene which you must remember is this: that the flammability range of mixtures of air andacetylene is broader than that of any other fuel gas/air mixture. Let\u2019s explain that more fully: Acetylene/air mixturescan be ignited when they contain anywhere from 2.5 percent acetylene to 80 percent acetylene. Mixtures ofmethane (the principal component of natural gas) and air are flammable when they contain as little as 5 percentmethane and not more than 15 percent methane. The hazards resulting from acetylene leaks are thereforesomewhat greater than the hazards involved in leaks of other fuel gases. Any leak in a fuel gas system is a hazard;acetylene is noticeably more hazardous than other gases only at the upper end of the flammability range. Except inan acetylene generator, the chances of creating a mixture which contains more acetylene than air are relativelysmall. Treat ALL fuel gases with respect and you\u2019ll have no trouble. (In passing, we should note that flammabilityrange is sometimes called explosive range.\u2026\u2026. hope satisfied\u2026 pls follow me ",

            "answer_text": "None is!! But both too! But, you need to be very safe if you are carrying a mixture of both. But what I just is very theoritical. Practically both are far dangerous when carried as a mixture or even seperated. Acetylene: It is generally available in compressed state in cylinders. So if anyhow it leaks or diffuse, it has a high risk of catching fire even by a tiny spark. They are really almost as dangerous as lpg. Oxygen: You might have seen oxygen is carried in large containers as liquid oxygen. Now chemical oxygen doesn't burn. But it necessarily is the fuel to any fuel combustion. So if oxygen leaks from those containers, they can blow away the vehicle by initiating a rapid combustion (usually explosion from a very small fire). Remember, air is 20% oxygen, and that is almost 100%. There ought to be some difference. Overall, oxygen in pure form is far more dangerous than liquid acetylene. Tiny fires are everywhere, especially in vehicles, households or in industries\u2026\u2026where else do you carry it, though? Hope you got it. Tks for reading!!! ",
