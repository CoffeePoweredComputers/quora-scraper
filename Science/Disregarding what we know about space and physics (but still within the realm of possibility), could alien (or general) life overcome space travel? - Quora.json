            "answer_text": "As sure as we\u2019re living on our tiny little mudball, life exists elesewhere. And ever expanding known universe from the existing one, leads ut to believe that with such increasnig chances for succesfull development of life elsewhere, be neigh-on impossible not to have happened elsewhere. That said, yes, they may even be intelligent or even more intelligent than us. (Despite our grand opinion of ourselves, this is not impossible) In fact it could have happened like a million years ago, and they\u2019d have expanded to some far corners of their galaxy, which doesn\u2019t have to be the same as ours. Despite several limiting factors, not impossibly unmitigatable by technology, they may have even developed FTL travel, and maybe to a 1000 times the speed of light. That said, a million year old civilisation that would try and travel to another galaxy would need millions more, even at that speed, and even if they\u2019d do so, there\u2019d be a very slim chance for them ever meeting us, between the rise and fall of this great civilisation. So, the answer is yes, but nope, we\u2019ll never see them or find them, because the astronomical probility of life existent is also depent on number of planets within that known universe, which is dependant on distance of observation. The greater the chance of life, the further away it is. The further away it is, the less chance of detection by us. Our best perception is still only of light, and only now since a few years gravity. With light needing to travel said distance a billion LY away civilisation\u2019s emissions of any kind wouldn\u2019t reach us till a billion years would have passed from time till emission until it would reach us. Save gravity, which may actually be actually progressing at a gerater speed than c, although as of yet unproven either to be progressing at c or higher than c, despite some saying there\u2019s a little proof of ftl, we don\u2019t have the capability to detect anything beyond it\u2019s distance to us and the time we actually started observing. Before there was observation, anything that may have been picked up wasn\u2019t. After, even including old civilisations that used astronomy, it would be like 3000\u20134000 years of observation tops. That would put us at a max distance of 3000\u20134000 LY of active detection. We receive light from further away, but as that distance increase, so does the time from our current time back into time of emission. If we see something 5000LY away, it\u2019s information that is 5000 years old. And during said tie a lot can have changed. When we look at distant galaxies, it\u2019s millions if not billions if not trillions of years old information. The state of said galaxies is now far from where we observe them to be, as well as their life development. And nope, you can\u2019t go back in time on a ray of light, that kind of thinking is nonsense. ",
