If it has not happened yet they you should very quickly go to a doctor and check your urinary blockage. Actually, I suspect it has not killed you, but something has killed your brain for asking such a stupid question. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question - What happens when a base is mixed with water? It depends on the base. If it is a very strong base (like, say, hydride anion), water molecules will donate protons to the base, forming hydroxide (OH-), the strongest base that can exist permanently in water. If it is a weak base, then a dilute solution of the weak base results. ",
