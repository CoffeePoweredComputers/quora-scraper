            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is a precise statement that describes how one variable affects another. A theory is \u2026(Here\u2019s an answer I wrote to, more or less, the same question.) This is an example I made up based on psychological research, but the elements (theoretical/hypothetical constructs, empirical constructs, anchoring, data language, operational definitions) apply equally to any field where you are investigating variables that might not be directly observable which you believe (e.g., have a theory about) affect the phenomenon under study. A theory is an explanation of some empirical phenomenon that explains the phenomenon by way of reference to empirical constructs that are not directly observable. Johnny hits David in front of the police. My theory is that he did so because he was angry and that anger suppressed his cognitive thinking ability which would otherwise suppress his response. Now, lets analyze what makes that brief statement a theory. What makes it a theory is that you cannot directly see Anger- you can only infer it from other observable events. You cannot see \u201ccognitive thinking ability,\u201d you can only infer it from other observable events. That is what makes these two things \u201cHypothetical constructs\u201d. You have at least two hypothetical constructs and a rule that describes how they interact. Anger suppresses cognitive thinking. That rule that describes how the constructs interact is called your \u201csyntax\u201d. So, a theory is at least two hypothetical constructs joined together by syntax. It may not be a good theory- but it is a theory. Lets explore what it takes to make it good. Your constructs must be \u201canchored\u201d to reality. There must be two anchors, one on what we call the \u201cantecedent\u201d side, and one on the \u201cconsequent\u201d side. That is, more or less, a cause-effect anchoring. \u201cOffense\u201d causes anger. Anger causes \u201cScowling.\u201d Now you have the hypothetical Anger being anchored by two empirical constructs of Offense and Scowling. Why are they called constructs? because they can be operationally defined in many ways. David called Johnny a penis. That was taken by Johnny as an offense. So, we can operationally define \u201cOffense\u201d as \u201cbeing called a penis\u201d (there are many ways to operationalize \u201coffense\u201d). Offense makes johnny angry. Anger makes him scowl (among other things). Scowling can be defined as lowering of the eyebrows by at least 2 cm. What we have done is anchored the construct of \u201cAnger\u201d by defining at least one \u201cempirical construct\u201d that causes anger. Offense causes anger. Offense can be operationally defined as \u201cbeing called a penis\u201d. We have also defined a consequence of anger that we can observe. In this case it is \u201cscowling\u201d, which also is operationally defined. That breaks the circle of \u201cI know he was angry because he was offended and I know he was offended because he was angry... \u201c How do you know he was angry- he was scowling. Why was he scowling, he had previously been offended, making him angry. We have to do the same thing with \u201ccognitive thinking ability\u201d. What makes someone start thinking that you can manipulate? How about \u201ca question\u201d. Asking a question activates cognitive thinking ability. Cognitive thinking ability should produce \u201can answer.\u201d Now, what is \u201ca question\u201d- that is something you have to operationally define. What is \u201can answer\u201d that is something you have to operationally define. You now have a testable theory. Offense should produce anger- What else should happen? Anger should suppress cognitive thinking. So, if you ask a question at the same time the person is angry you should see a delay in answering. You manipulate your independent variable (calling someone a penis, or not) while measuring the dependent variables of eyebrow lowering and time required to answer a question. You should see that after being called a penis someone both lowers their eyebrows (indicating you produced anger) and it took them longer to respond to a question. Are there other ways to define \u201coffense?\u201d- absolutely. Are there other ways to define \u201ccognitive thinking?\u201d- absolutely. But, your theory should hold in those cases too. Are there other things that produce anger instead of offense? Yup. Are there other ways to induce \u201ccognitive thinking\u201d other than questions?- of course. But your theory should hold in those cases too. That is how a theory drives research. You take the high-level constructs, define them in other sensible ways, and test if the syntax still works. Thus you find boundaries of your theory and improve both your understanding of the relationship between the constructs involved (syntax and anchoring), and your understanding of the constructs themselves (anchoring and operational definitions). Now pick up your theory and apply it to other things. Are there other ways to produce anger? Are there other ways to induce and measure cognitive thinking? In those cases what should happen? The theory says anger should suppress the thinking. Go find other things that should produce anger, operationally define them, then go manipulate them and see their effects on other definitions of cognitive thinking. Explain why this is important for mental health, neuroscience, and other areas of psychology and get a grant to study anger\u2019s influences on cognition. Hypothetical Constructs are linked by syntax. Hypothetical constructs are defined by the empirical constructs that produce them (antecedent anchor) and the empirical constructs that are produced (consequent anchor) by those Hypothetical constructs. The empirical constructs are operationally defined by exact observable empirical events. All that is \u201ca theory. A model, on the other hand, imo, is a precise specification of the syntax of a theory. It is typically mathematical in form. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m with Barry on this one. I write and put together mathematical models - which I view as extensions of my perception on a problem, system, process ... I never called these constructs theories or laws, but called them models. The model I put on paper or into a computer as a form of software is a reflection on how I\u2019m thinking about issue at hand and possibly how the science community is thinking about it too. It\u2019s not a theory. It\u2019s a projection of my position and thought processes. It\u2019s an introspective test of my understanding and reality. It\u2019s a great way to test personal belief systems. As such, in a laboratory we test old theories and create new projections in the form of models. And it\u2019s very malleable. . After the model is fleshed out, and working for some time, some people might call the model a theory, theory in motion anyway. It\u2019s really not relevant to label the work as such. A hypothesis (intuition, insight, perception) is the idea we work with to generate a model (theory). So the hypothesis might be: Pi e and the integers are at the root of objective reality. theory developed: equations for the mass of a proton from Pi e and the integers \u2014 only!!!. ",
