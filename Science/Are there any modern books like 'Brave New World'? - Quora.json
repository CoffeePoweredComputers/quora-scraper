            "answer_text": "Of course it all depends on what your definition of \u201clike\u201d is. For me the most powerful theme of the Brave New World was that it was a dystopia. If we mean \u201clike\u201d as \u201care dystopian like Brave New World\u201d then my favourite modern dystopian novels are the 2 books of the Earthseed series, by Octavia E.
