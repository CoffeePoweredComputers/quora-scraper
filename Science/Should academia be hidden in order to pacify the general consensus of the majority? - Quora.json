            "answer_text": "When academia has been infiltrated by Marxists and other far-left ideologues, something must be done to save the nation. Remember that \u2018journalists\u2019 graduate from these same institutions and carry any misinformation they have been taught. Taxpayers dig deep to pay the salaries of professors and teachers, so it is only right they have some say in what is taught and how it is taught. The arrogance of professors calling hard-working people \u201cstupid\u201d does not cut it. The first step should be to defund colleges that do not allow a diversity of viewpoints on campus. \u201cDeplatforming\u201d should result in defunding. Secondly, colleges that advocate violence should also be defunded. Colleges must discipline their employees or be defunded. That would be an excellent first step. ",
