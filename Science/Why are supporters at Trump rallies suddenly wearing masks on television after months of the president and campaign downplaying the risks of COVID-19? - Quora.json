            "answer_text": "I live in FL where Trump just had a rally in Sanford [10/12/2020]. I did not attend. The evening news showed people camping out the night before the rally, I don\u2019t know if it is just the fake news media, but it seems every supporter of trump is a bit on the unusual side. I know there are a lot of very normal people that work in white collar jobs and are college educated who support trump, but every single interview of a supporter on TV news is a caricature of a hillbilly. A woman was wearing a \u201cWomen for Trump\u2019 T-Shirt, which makes sense considering all the respect he has shown to his three wives and the fair pay for the porn stars he slept with, but I do not think he paid much to Grab-em-by-the-p\u2026y girls. The masks worn by the people behind Trumps podium were all identical red or blue \u201cMAGA\u201d masks. I am guessing they were handed out before the rally and asked the people behind the podium to wear them. There was no social distancing anywhere and very few in the large primary audience were wearing masks. I think Dr Fauci would have called it a super spreader event, but not to worry he said he is going to give everyone the same experimental medicine he was given. I believe I have heard the artificial antibodies he was given were in extremely short supply and difficult to create. Sorry I have to go, I\u2019m listening to a tape of his speech and think I am going to be ill. I would vote for him if I did not know every word he says is a lie. ",

Of course, the president has a tremendous plan; no need to worry, everything\u2019s gonna be okay; free elite covid treatment for everyone, exactly like the kind used by the president himself; but, first, rush right out and do all the things you used to do, because herd immunity [or mentality] will save us, once it picks off a few hundred thousand more Americans, here and there...now and again\u2026and again\u2026 ",
