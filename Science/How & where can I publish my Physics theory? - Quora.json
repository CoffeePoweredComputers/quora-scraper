            "answer_text": "original question :  I think I found one theory that can  explains, dark matter, dark energy and entanglement. My lack in physics  knowledge helped me to think out of the box. No experience in paper  writing. How to publish, while making sure it remains mine?   Nowdays, you can patent anything, so making sure it remains yours should not be a problem. Since this is a very theorical study with few applications, I don't think it matters as much. Given that you claim lack of physic knowledge, the first reactions will more likely be attempt to discredit you rather than to stole your work, so by the time people think of it seriously, there would be no doubt it is yours. Now for visibillity, I would suggest you to submit your work to scientific instituitions. The best things to do would be to enter in touch with either David Dunning or Justin Kruger, two recognized specialists of the topic, but they may be hard to reach. Be aware that your work is most likely incomplete, will need rework, and will be attacked as such.  You should also be aware that scientists generally have a strong ego and will call you name for pretending doing science without speaking their language, namely : math. All the other answers that I have no doubts will come up saying they are very skeptical about your theory will prove me right. If you already are good at math, great! If not, then don't worry given time, passion and effort, anybody can have a PhD in math or theorical physic. But if you do not want to waste a decade to be understood by reluctant and ungratefull peers, you might turn to vulgarisation and public debate, so that everyone can understand your work, and congrat you as deserved. The language of physic, on the other hand is really easy to catch, as everything can be explained in layman's term. Any field of science has incorporate some math in it because it makes them look wittier, but it is a common misconception to think that science is actually hard. Science is attractive, but scientists want to keep their number low, so they use math to discriminate and choose their would-be colleagues. If you want to learn the language of physic by your own, in order to spread your theory, I think Deepak Chopra is a good start for you. By the way, I see you already learned the word \"entanglement\" and the expressions \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". You are a great self taught, keep going! ",

            "answer_text": "i actually have the same issue: my TOE says: ELECTRONS ARE GLOBULAR CLUSTERS think about it (still working on it): ... photons are stars (em waves ergo light are suns) ... atoms are galaxys ... the nucleus are the halo, the black hole and the jet \u2026 radioactiv atoms are radio galaxys .... cells (energy metabolism structure) are some configuration of superclusters and nebulars ... cancer and aids are too ;) ... dreaming, thinking, remembering is the movement of the universe one dimension below \u2026 the double slit experiment: a photon (single star) divides in its particles, interacts with itself and show the interference pattern if its going through two slices and its be observed, means its spectrum of size (em wave) interacts with our spectrum of size (particle), it behaves like a particleand so on\u2026 i think there will be a lot of doubt and critics in science first, but everybody can calculate it himself with the known formulas and principles of quantum physics, physics, astronomy and mathematics PROOF ME WRONG!!! this is a interdisciplinary work! i'm a nerd with a kind of an eidetic mind, specialized myself as a kid not to specialize on something! Today i'm travelling 6 month a year through whole asia, enjoying good people and food and building electric bikes, cars and boats with artificial intelligence. Also theres a social project of mine: please support BBQ CIRCUS, a mobile circus school like the PAI CIRCUS HOSTEL i worked in PAI (Thailand), on an electric cargobike with a mongolian grill popping up in parks for free (in the near future with a trimaran on beachs) ;) ",
