            "answer_text": "The Investigating officer or agency has to file the final report ( Charge sheet ) in the court as soon as the investigation is over. This is as per provision in the section 173(2) of CrPC. But if after filing the final report, if the Police finds more evidence in the same case, then they can investigate the collect that evidence and file the final report. This second investigation after filing the first final report is called the further investigation. In every first final report the Police invariably request the court for permission for further investigation if needed under section 173(8 )of CrPC so they need not again apply to the court for permission for further investigation.
