            "answer_text": "Iron metorites have fallen to Earth that are dated to over 4.5 billion years. They are not reduced to a metal lattice. They maintain their integrity. Recently Oumuamua, an asteroid-like object 600m long by 60m wide passed through the solar system. We don't know what it's made of, or really where it's from. It is quite old, and spinning. Is it an Alien Ship? I expect that an advanced Alien technology having the technical ability to place a \u201cship\u201d into deep space, would have the ability to design that ship to last substantially longer than 1 billion years. However, as I have noted in other posts, \u201ca billion years is a long time\u201d. So, what constitutes a \u201cShip\u201d? Must it contain an atmosphere? Must it contain functioning technology? Simple enough to design a sphere or cylinder with massive thick hulls. This may aid in protection from erosion from impacts, and radiation. It also helps retain an atmosphere. Still, this may not be enough to maintain integrity of the systems. Stuff happens over a billion years. What this ship needs is intelligence, autonomy, and the ability to maintain and repair itself. Essentially you must create an artificial life form. It must be able to obtain energy from it's environment. It must be able to seek out and gather \u201cfood\u201d. i.e. The material it needs to perform self repair and reproduction, as well as any other Mission objectives. Ideally, it should also have the ability to reproduce itself, should the original \u201cShip\u201d become compromised and unable to complete it's Mission. You might argue that the clone of the original is not the original. But if it is an exact design clone with identicle programming, then the argument is moot. I propose that an advanced civilization might create such \u201cseed\u201d ships with the mission to spread sentient life forms throughout the galaxy. The Ships would seek Star Systems with harvestable energy, and the resources required to reproduce themselves. The Ships would have the ability to identify and seed potentially habitable planets with compatible ecosystems. They would carry germ banks, and/or a database of information needed to reproduce any known life form, as well as the AI required to create novel forms suited to discovered environments. These artificial life forms that are \u201cShips\u201d have a mission. They will seed the Galaxy with Life in myriad forms, and they will reproduce themselves to extend and continue the Mission. In order to conserve energy, they have the ability to \u201csleep\u201d between the Stars. They gather tiny amounts of energy from the environment to maintain the most primitive sensor array. Once they get close enough to a Star, the light gathering cells respond, solar arrays are deployed, fuel rods are inserted into reactors, and slowly the Ship comes \u201calive\u201d. Once the Ship wakes, it begins its self test and repair functions. It opens sensors to survey the local system. It establishes an operational plan to acquire energy and materials for maintenance and reproduction. It surveys local planets and moons for establishing custom ecosystems. This Ship is an AI. It has a mission! It may, or may not contain copies or templates of its original designers. These designers have realized long ago that the external form is not important. Only the ever expanding sphere of Life, and Consciousness is important. The Mission is everything! You have found one of these Seed Ships. Unfortunately it seems to be dead! What should you do? Revive an Alien technology that might be a competitive threat to your own species and/or civilization? Attempt to study the Ship, and recover as much information as you can? Reverse engineer the technology, and try to extract and decrypt the database? Or do you try to wake it up? Note: Please, no comments about \u201cStargate Universe\u201d, or any other Sci-fi scenario. Let's discuss how we might respond to a similar discovery. Or, even how such a Ship might be built with known, or reasonably expected technology. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a good question *and *I\u2019ll tell you why. This is deep sci-fi stuff because a billion years is a long time. First up, we need some rules. The first set of rules are alien civilisation rules, that have made a ship capable of lurking in space for a billion years. The second set is, from the perspective of earth technology as it stands now. First up, is earth tech. Our spacecraft leak. Not much, but they definitely leak. We have to replenish the atmosphere quite regularily. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110012997.pdf A billion years at the rate that the ISS leaks would both empty it, and quite possibly the entire atmosphere of the earth if it was being used to replenish the billion year old station each time. I haven't done the maths, you do it. The next problem is material. Metal decays in space. Wow! There's no air in space! It's a vacuum! Nope, not quite. Space is a pretty dangerous place if you want to leave earth tech lying, sorry lurking around for a billion years. Aluminium gets brittle, copper does something else wierd that I can't remember, (look it up) and all sorts of other effects happen to metal that is maintained at pressure on one side and fluctuating temperatures on the outside. Even if your ship is in deep, reasonably empty space. There are stresses in the metal that will slowly but surely free off, making the leaks worse again. There have been tests of metal samples done on orbital craft and nothing stays shiny for long. If you leave the thing running, using solar panels, assuming that you have enough local light, then you have constantly changing temperature gradients, that make the ship flex, maybe tiny little bits, but enough over a billion years to literally shake it to bits, it would get metal fatigue, even with microscopic movements. Earth technology wears out really fast. Now, what about alien tech? You have to assume that they either know how to make living self reparing ships, capable of living to a billion, or have technology that can resist anything that space can throw at it. You absolutely cannot keep helium in anything for long, I've worked in high vacuum appliances used by micro-chip manafacturers, that are tested with helium that just always leaks out. So, no helium on the ship of the earthers, but the aliens would have to have technology that was entirely helium tight. The alien ship would need to be able to pressurise its gasses to almost metalic form and stabilise them. The alien ship would have to be able to resist the evaporation of its surfaces, by slow sublimation, one atom at a time. It would be covered in a material that is super dense and has massive atomic bonding. Now, what could we use? No idea. Back to the question. The ship, if it was current earth tech would be almost unrecogniseable, as it would slowly decay over a billion years and form a ball of micro elements and particles. The alien ship, would be a dark body, that radiates as much energy as it absorbs and be ready to fire up and kill you if you approach. It isn't lurking out there for anything other than a naughty reason. It's a sentinel. How could it observe you as you approach if it was dormant and not using any energy over a billion years? no idea. Long answer done, now the short answer. A ship in deep space over a billion years would slowly and terminally decay into a lattice of lightly connected metal lace. ",
