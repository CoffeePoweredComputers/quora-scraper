            "answer_text": "Stabilty and thermodynamic properties(m.p and b.p) are two different things.for example \u201cflorine\u201dis highly stable in halogen but it is a gas at room temprature.also benzene is stable but its m.p and b.p are low . so,we should have to clear the concepts of these two things. If you are facing more problem then you can contact me on phone no or fb Fb:mohammad abubakar irshad Contact no:03338015155 ",

Water also is stable - everyone knows at which temperatures it melts and boils. Silicon dioxide is another very stable compound: it melts at about 1700\u00b0C - don\u2019t know if someone has ever measured its boiling point. ",
