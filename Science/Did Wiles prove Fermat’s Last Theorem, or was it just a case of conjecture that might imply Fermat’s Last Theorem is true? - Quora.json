            "answer_text": "The FLT proof is a clear cut proof, checked over and again by the experts and part of the community, so there is no \u201cmight\u201d or \u201ccould\u201d involved. Wiles\u2019 work did actually close the last gap; he was building on other people\u2019s previous work, that has been equally checked and verified: Gerhard Frey constructed a mathematical object, called an Elliptic curve, out of an assumed \u201cFermat Triple\u201d (a,b,c). Kenneth Ribet, following suggestions by the great Jean-Pierre Serre, was able to show that the Frey curve, if it really existed (so if FLT was false) was a non-modular curve. The \u201cgap\u201d mentioned above was the proof of the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture, which asserts that every elliptic curve is modular. Wiles was able to prove (jointly with his graduate student Richard Taylor) a special case (so-called semi-stable curves) that covers the Frey-curve. I am explaining this is this detail, because you have to understand, that in today\u2019s mathematics deep results are practically never an achievement of a single mathematician working in isolation. There is a wealth of partial results, of reductions to special cases, or a link to an equivalent problem. Working mathematicians will have to learn and understand all this. I want to give you another example: the proof of the Poincare conjecture by Grigori Perelman (who solved one of the Clay Millennium Problems with his result). Originally formulated as a conjecture on the 3-dimensional sphere in 4-space (the lower dimensions being well-known already at that time), it was generalized to all higher dimensions pretty quickly. Stephen Smale established Poincare for dimensions greater than or equal to 5 in 1962 with a then novel tool called Morse Theory (which is until today a valuable tool for topologists). He received the Fields Medal for his achievement in 1966. In 1982 Michael Freedman proved the case n=4 with a completely different set of techniques. So the original case n=3 was open. Bill Thurston generalized again \u2014 this time by introducing geometrical structures on 3-dimensional manifolds in general, and conjecturing, that each 3-manifold would carry such a geometric structure (very roughly; apologies to topologists \u2026). Poincare would follow as a consequence of a proof of Thurston\u2019s conjecture. Again the \u201ccomplex case\u201d, for manifolds with rich topology, was established quickly. To tackle the remaining cases, Richard Hamilton introduced a new analytic tool, the so-called Ricci-Flow, which \u201cpulls\u201d a curved space at each point into the direction and with the speed of the local curvature. The application to Thurston and Poincare conjectures failed eventually, because nobody was able to handle the singularities, that could appear in Hamilton\u2019s Ricci flow. Enter Perelman: he introduced new analytic tools, and was able to show that the Ricci flow could be regularized, and that the singularities could be handled in a satisfactory manner. So you see: there is another famous case, where the mathematician who delivers the final proof, did not go the whole way, but built on many, partially brilliant previous results and ideas. ",

In maths you string together a bunch of statements like: \u201cIf A is true then B cannot be true\u201d or \u201cif A is true then B must be true\u201d. They\u2019re conditional but not an implication. This was how the world around fermats last theorem was until the proof. Enough of these were strung together to logically get from a known proven starting point to the conclusion that it must be true, if only all the conditionals were true. You can read quite a few good (e.g. SIMON SINGH) books on this journey and some of the key pieces that were proven along the way to the complete proof. I will never be able to understand the complete proof, I\u2019m sure there are very few who can but I can understand how the pieces could be put together and from that understand that they have been there it together in a way that proves the theory. Hope this helps. ",

In the simplest form possible how Wiles proved it: He assumed that there was a counterexample. And he showed that any counterexample will hold contradictory properties. What I mean by contradictory properties is that it provably has two properties that don't go together. For example if I were to prove that a number were simultaneously even and odd, that would be problematic. The exact details of the proof are extensive and complicated, and I am unfortunately not equipped to understand most of it. But this is a simpler version of what my number theory professor explained to me. ",
