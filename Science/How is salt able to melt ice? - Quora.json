            "answer_text": "Answers to this usually address the chemistry, namely the equilibrium condition of a solution of salt in water. A saturated solution of salt in water, just over 23% will freeze/melt at -21.1 deg C. This tells us one important thing. If the temperature is below this, salt cannot have any effect. However, the question really asks how does salt melt ice? That is, how do you go from one condition (solid ice and salt) to another liquid solution? That is chemical engineering: a \u201cmass transfer process\u201d to get the salt into the water. The first step is the difficult one. The solid will not dissolve in solid. What you need is a tiny film of water to dissolve some crystals. This may come in two ways. Firstly, it is common that the sun melts a little of the ice (just the top surface). If you have an icy drive, this is the time to add the salt. Otherwise there may be some impurities in the water which is freezing. As the ice crystallizes, these impurities stay in the liquid state and get concentrated. Thus there can be a tiny layer of dirty water which has a lower freezing point than ice. However, once the process starts, it gets easier. The salt dissolves in the water to give something close to saturated. Then the ice dissolves in this liquid, diluting it, which allows more salt to dissolve, which then allows more ice to dissolve, and so on. What adds to this is that there is some more mass transfer as the water evaporates (especially in the sunshine on a tarmac drive) which concentrates the salt, lowering the freezing point so that it does not re-freeze overnight. Note that salt does not raise the temperature of the liquid or ice so it is not really fair to call it melting. It is really dissolving. However calcium chloride is also commonly used as a deicer, and this does actually generate heat when it dissolves in water. ",

            "answer_text": "The complete answer to your question is based on the two premises: 1. The kinetic-molecular theory of matter 2. Equilibrium. Re #1. The particles of matter are in constant, random motion. The energies of particles are subjected to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. https://sites.lps.org/sputnam/chem_notes/Unit6_States/Maxwell_Boltzmann.htm or Maxwell-Boltzmann Distributions  (In this diagram the velocity of the particles, rather than the kinetic energy is shown KE = \u00bdmv2) This applies to all three states of matter. In an ice cube there are molecules of water vibrating with energies high enough to break out from the crystal. Normally, when there is enough water (vapour) in the environment, the equilibrium is established - ice/snow lasts forever. However, in some extreme conditions - in a freezer, or the US/Canadian prairies - when the humidity is extremely low, snow, or ice simply disappear. Very much the same, when you leave a glass of water on a table. Week later it\u2019s empty. Re#2 \u201cNormally\u201d there is an equilibrium: High energy molecules leaving ice \u21c4 low energy molecules from the environment coming back (to the ice). Ice does not melt. What does salt have to do with this process? Molecules of water are highly polar. Salt (NaCl) is an ionic crystal, with the Na+ and Cl\u2212 centres. High energy molecules of water are leaving the ice crystal. However, the molecules of water, with low energies, which \u201cnormally\u201d would stick to the ice cube, are intercepted by salt, which, in turn, dissolves to form a salt solution. The equilibrium - molecules leaving the ice cube and coming back - is shifted to the side of the leaving molecules of water (more molecules are leaving, than coming back). So the ice appears to melt, because of a brine formed around it, but in reality salty water is formed from the water vapour around the salt. The interesting aspect of this process is, that if you place the ice-salt mixture into an insulated container, the temperature of the mixture will significantly drop. Ice melting is an endothermic process; in the closed system the internal energy of the system is used up, what results in the temperature decrease. ",
