            "answer_text": "Normally a birthmark is completely benign, but if it has changed or you\u2019re in doubt, ask a dermatologist. We are random people on Quora, most of us without any medical background, so we are not qualified to tell you whether your particular birthmark is fine or if it is a skin cancer risk. There are some online guides showing what normal moles look like vs. potentially cancerous ones, but birthmarks and moles are two different things. Bottom line: if you have a medical question, ask your doctor. ",
