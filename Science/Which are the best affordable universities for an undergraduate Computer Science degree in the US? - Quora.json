            "answer_text": "In almost every state, the best option will be your major state school in state. I grew up in Washington, so UW was mine. Someone from California would do best at Berkeley, a person in Texas at UTA, and so on. Even \u201cbackups\u201d are often better in state. If a Texan got their degree from University of Houston, they\u2019ll still get a great education. Maybe it won\u2019t be as good as if they spent a fortune for another school, but it\u2019ll be good enough at a fraction of the price. The exceptions to me is that if a person can\u2019t get into a really decent in-state school, but they can get into a great school out of state (e.g. UTA rejects a candidate but MIT accepts them for some reason) then it\u2019s not super affordable, but it\u2019s worth the money.

            "answer_text": "If you are in state, Berkeley, SUNY stony brook, or GATech happen to give fantastic educations at ridiculously low costs. If you are applying out of state or as a foreigner, I doubt the 1\u20135k differences in cost per semester will make too much of a dent on the 200k of debt you can wrack up. You\u2019ll likely want a scholarship. I\u2019ve heard that Harvard is very good about giving scholarships. Otherwise, 79 Colleges with Full Ride Scholarships is a list of schools that have scholarships you can win, and you\u2019re likely best off picking the ones you have the best shot at. ",
