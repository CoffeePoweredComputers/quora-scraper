            "answer_text": "If a neutral atom loses an electron, an ion forms! \u2026 Take for example a neutral oxygen atom, \u00b9\u2076\u2088O. By the loss of electrons this atom becomes a positive oxygen ion, \u00b9\u2076\u2088O\u00b9\u207a. We can display this using the so-called Soddy's number*. The neutral oxygen atom is described by the following Soddy's number S: S = 8.0008 0008 0000 B. After electron loss, this atom is described in the following Soddy's number: S = 8.0008 0007 0000 B. -------------------------------------- *If we accept that the elements are denoted by Soddy's number, S, expressed in the unit boscovich**, B, where B = 1 / (2s\u2080\u00b2) = 1 / 137.07347948 = 0.0072953572332, with the structural constant of the atom s\u2080 = 8.78691910. ** DOI: 10.9734/AJOPACS/2017/37863 NOTE: The type of substance can thus be included in the international SI unit system (SI by the French name Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s).

            "answer_text": "If a neutral atom loses an electron it becomes a cation and becomes positively charged because the no. of positively charged protons becomes greater than the no. of negatively charged electrons. It can also be called a uni positive ion because it loses only one electron and has a charge +1. Hope I was helpful!!! ",
