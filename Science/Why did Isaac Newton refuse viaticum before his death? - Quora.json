            "answer_text": "Throughout his life, Isaac Newton was nominally a member of the Church of England, which is Protestant but also accommodates some of the traditional practices of Catholicism, such as rule by bishops and sacraments like the anointing of the sick, that other Protestant denominations reject. Newton\u2019s private religious beliefs were a mixture of hyper-Protestantism and what most Protestants consider grave heresy (especifically, he rejected the dogma of the Trinity, since he believed that only God the Father was actually God, and that Jesus was subordinate to God). Newton didn\u2019t advertise his heresy, since being in communion with the Church of England was a legal requirement for him to attain his position at University of Cambridge, and also to be eligible to his public offices as Member of Parliament, and as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint. Morevoer, rejecting the Trinity was also, in principle, a crime punishable by death (before 1698) or by prison (after 1698), though by the time that Newton was an adult those penalties were, for the most part, no longer being enforced in practice. Some historians have written as if Newton pretending to being a faithful Anglican were a sign of hypocrisy. But I think that the point is just that Newton was not a fanatic and therefore could see no need to ruin his career by advertising his heretical views. (He did refuse to be ordained as an Anglican clergyman, which at one point nearly cost him his professorship.) My opinion is that Newton rejected the Anglican last rites because of his ultra-Protestantism: he probably regarded them as superstitious practices, a load of mumbo-jumbo with no bearing on his relationship with God. As an anti-Trinitarian he probably also didn\u2019t really consider the Church of England to be a vehicle to salvation. Being on his deathbed, he no longer had to pretend to being a faithful Anglican. See also my answer to What were Isaac Newton's religious views? ",
