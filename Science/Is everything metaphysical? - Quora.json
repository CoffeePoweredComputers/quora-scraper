            "answer_text": "Metaphysics is concerned with ultimate reality, what really exists. Metaphysics is often contrasted with physics: roughly, something is usually considered physical if it exists within the context of a physical theory that has been confirmed through empirical testing, while all else is metaphysical. Modern physics, however, grew out of metaphysics, and it is instructive to see the extent to which it has actually succeeded in separating itself from metaphysics. Historically, natural philosophy was originally a branch of metaphysics concerned with the reality of the natural world. Due to the Kantian critique of metaphysics and the development of empirical methods, natural philosophy evolved into modern empirical science, which is focused on developing hypotheses than can be subjected to experimental testing. Strictly speaking, scientific knowledge is properly limited to claims about the congruence of its theories with empirical measurements. To avoid making unfalsifiable metaphysical claims, science must refrain from asserting that its theories describe reality. In other words, physical realism is metaphysics, not physics. Insofar as modern science nevertheless adheres (explicitly or implicitly) to physical realism, it still retains unscientific metaphysical claims. So, if the scientific description of the universe is regarded as being a description of reality, all these physical things in the universe are metaphysical. As for subjective awareness or consciousness, this is of course metaphysical in nature since it is not objective and, as a result, can not be empirically measured. Now, the key question is whether a given metaphysics is true or false, and if we can ever know the difference. As Kant rigorously demonstrated in his Critique of Pure Reason, if our faculties of knowledge are limited to perception and conception, then we can never know the thing in itself (i.e., the true nature of reality). This Kantian critique of metaphysics is commonly regarded as unequivocally demonstrating the impossibility of true metaphysical knowledge. But that conclusion would be premature, because it presupposes that there is no faculty of knowledge in addition to perception and conception. However, there are in fact some people who have attested to the existence of such a faculty. Such a claim, however, clearly can not be properly evaluated through scientific or logical methods, which are limited to perception and conception alone. It is necessary to attempt to awaken such a faculty oneself. Then, it may be possible to verify the existence of such a faculty of knowledge, and finally resolve the great metaphysical questions. ",

            "answer_text": "'Is everything metaphysical?' My answer is a resounding Yes!, despite the widely accepted, prevailing, physicalist theory: everything is reducible to matter/energy. This position is being insistently questioned ever since the rise of the new physics (the role of the observer, uncertainty principle, etc.). Nobody knows what matter is intrinsically, and why an atom is an atom - its nature is a mystery; scientifically we can only talk about mechanism, 'behavior' or function, in relation to physical processes. Thus, everything is metaphysical - including tables and chairs or, rather, the material they are made of, wood (hilos) - which means non-reducible to the physical. Psychology, mind, selfhood are equally non reducible to the physical, nor are they purely mental or purely conceptual, thus they are metaphysical, however psychologists may protest. \u2018Man\u2019, \u2018personhood\u2019 are metaphysical or philosophical notions. Metaphysical doctrines are couched in LANGUAGE (concepts, plus logic and reasoning -tarka), which de facto is dualistic, but that is a springboard and a conditio sine qua non for realization or uniting with the TRUTH or REALITY which is indivisible, non-relational, and inexpressible by the mind (anubhava).

            "answer_text": "That everything is metaphysical is a given and yet suprising. That quantum logical systems are universal means anything conceivable can be constructed and what world is constructed may evolve over time.  The physical depends only on unconstrained metaphysical possibility.  Nothing is constrained by what is presently physical.    The physical, in the state of becoming exhibits intelligence in surviving in a changing information ecology.  It's nature is not determined yet, it is being discovered, it is not yet physical and yet it is in a possible future world that will exist in the future.  It has a nature that is metaphysical, not physical.  What will be exhibited has a conditional on being persisted or not.  It is considered to have existed if it is persisted.  Physicality is determined in retrospect by perception of some possible (imaginable) being.  Thus metaphysical being is fundamental and physical being is secondary. The metaphysical picture we draw collectively becomes the physical. It can grow into becoming a picture of any world imaginable.  ",
