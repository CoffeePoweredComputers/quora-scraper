            "answer_text": "Can science help religion - Ancient religions do not primarily promote science, such as Abrahamic faiths, Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism etc and especially Christianity. Christianity goes way back in the Renaissance and before it, many false scientific theories and the church backed it. They also backed Galen who was a key historical figure, they backed his facts as long as it was compatible with the bible. If it was they agreed upon it and it was to be believed. Although many theories were proven wrong eventually, this led to questioning of the bible, thus questioning the existence of God in Christianity. Furthermore, there came atheism, and disbelief in God, and a rise in humanism during and after the Renaissance. I mentioned humanism which is believed to be a religion, the belief in science, moral ethics, atheism and democracy over God, so this is evidence of where science is helping other religions, particularly modern ones. Science can and cannot help science in several ways, in regards to what I stated with Christianity, science did not really back religion as it diminished the power of the church almost completely, many Christians had committed apostasy as well, and today it definitely did due to science. However, science can also help religion in ways that it can lead to conversions in religion, debates and conclusions, however I say science cannot help religion as religion is not mainly about science (old faiths), but it can with modern faiths, as it led to the growth of humanism, and some other faiths which reject God, however, science reduced the power of the church say science did not help religion. So I\u2019d say it is 50/50 yes and no. Can religion help science - Although most theories that Galen stated were wrong, some were actually correct. This is a slight contribution of where religion helped science. In an Islamic perspective, the Qur\u2019an has many scientific facts. It contains more than any other Abrahmic faiths and none of which are incorrect, some are taken out of it\u2019s context but ancient and modern scholars have cleared it up. It depends what measures you take to remove this ignorant view you might have, not to view a verse and make a final summary. Differing to Christianity, the Qur\u2019an believes in the earths orbit. \u201cIt is not for the sun to catch up with the moon, nor does the night surpass the day; and each one of them floats in its orbit.\u201d - Qur'an 36:40 The church ignited scientists for saying this as it went against the bible and church, they arrested some key figures in history, such as Galileo for making these claims. The Qur\u2019an backs it however. There are more verses proving this such as 21:33, 71:15\u201316. However, I won\u2019t go into that. Evidence where religion helped science was a clip taken out of a documentary of where scientists were saying that the Qur\u2019an continues to reveal scientific facts in shorter words, which are indeed true. Indeed, I have relied upon Allah , my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but that He holds its forelock. Indeed, my Lord is on a path [that is] straight. (55:41). The word used is \u201cforelock\u201d, this discovery was found in the late 20th century, however it was in the Qur\u2019an 1,400+ years ago. Evidence showing Islam\u2019s contribution to science, and it is taken as evidence by scientists and scholars. According to sources; \u201cScientists have recently discovered that a significant activity occurs in the upper front part of the brain (forelock) when the man lies or make specific errors.\u201d Therefore, this is responsible for sin and found in the Qur\u2019an before it was even a theory nor discussed, some scientists have even converted and some have discussed more facts about science found in the Qur\u2019an. So religion has helped with true scientific discoveries,. ",

            "answer_text": "Since there are Nobel prize religious scientists, that should stop this boneheaded arguing about science and religion they are compatible, for God\u2019s sake. YES they can help in some fashion. though science would not directly use it, however the scientist can be inspired by God which leads to an intuition that is applied in the scientific method.. \"In general, we look for a new law by the following process. First, we guess it (audience laughter), no, don\u2019t laugh, that\u2019s really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess, to see what, if this is right, if this law we guess is right, to see what it would imply and then we compare the computation results to nature, or we say compare to experiment or experience, compare it directly with observations to see if it works. \u2028\u2028If it disagrees with experiment, it\u2019s wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn\u2019t make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn\u2019t matter how smart you are who made the guess, or what his name is\u2026 If it disagrees with experiment, it\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d (emphasis added) Richard P. Feynman See? The scientist is after all a human.. he guesses.. and God can possibly inspire a \u201cgood guess\u201d! My sense of it is: the scientist has to follow the same methodology as a non believer scientist. He has to work very hard\u2026 Just because he is a believer doesn\u2019t mean he does not have to work very hard\u2026 it is a matter of grace, if an inspiration comes to a scientist. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cCan science help religion, and can religion help science?\u201d They help each other as cohesively as mist and fire. Science helps dispel religious assertions, and religion helps people remain ignorant of reality. So religion keeps the scientifically inept out of science, and the intellectually inquisitive out of religious fundamentalism. There is no point of convergence between the two. Science is the pursuit of knowledge, wherever that may lead, and whatever the answers may be. Religion is the assertion of bronze age superstitions, regardless of knowledge or where that knowledge actually leads and the answers it actually provides. ",

            "answer_text": "Science could help religion. Apply rational fact-based reasoning to religion would drive out unreliable ideas. Of course that would probably help religion into the grave. But it would be good for religion. Religion can\u2019t help science. It requires people to believe mystical things with no basis in fact. That\u2019s the anti-thesis of rational fact-based reasoning and would debase the value of science to engage with religion in anything but a one-sided flow of ideas. ",
