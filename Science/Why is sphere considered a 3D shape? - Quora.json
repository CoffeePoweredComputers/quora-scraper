            "answer_text": "Consider a circle. If you consider the origin as an arbitrary point on the circle and name it as [math]0^\\circ[/math], then we can identify all points on the circle by one co-ordinate - [math]\\theta[/math]. Let\u2019s move to a disc. For this, along with [math]\\theta[/math], we will need something to measure the distance of a point under consideration from the centre of the disc, with the centre of the disc as the origin. So, we can identify all points on the disc using two co-ordinates - [math]\\theta[/math] and [math]r[/math]. Now, the sphere. For this, along with [math]r[/math] and [math]\\theta[/math], we will need a third co-ordinate to define the location of a point in the sphere. So, we have [math]r[/math], [math]\\theta[/math] and [math]\\phi[/math]. The dimensionality of an object is the minimum number of co-ordinates required to express all the elements in that object. So, that answers your question. ",
