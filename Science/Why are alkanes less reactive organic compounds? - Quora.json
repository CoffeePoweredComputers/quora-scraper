            "answer_text": "Because the alkane molecules do not have unshared pairs of electrons on them.C-C bonds are completely nonpolar .C-H bonds are slightly polarized because of very low electronegativity difference that does not provide any reaction site. So,C-C and C-H have strong bonds. That is why alkanes do not react with acid,alkalis, oxidizing and reducing agents at room temperature. Subsitution reactions and thermal catalytic reactions at high temperatures or absorbtion of light energy however help alkanes to undergo a chemical reaction. ",

            "answer_text": "Less reactive than what? Im assuming youre comparing them to alkenes and alcohols etc, the answer is alkanes are less reactive than alkenes because because alkenes have a carbon-carbon double bond, those two bonds being the sigma and the pi bond, the pi bond is weak and easy to break making alkenes more reactive. Alkanes have a carbon-carbon single bond with a relatively strong sigma bond, making them less reactive to other hydrocarbons relativley speaking. ",
