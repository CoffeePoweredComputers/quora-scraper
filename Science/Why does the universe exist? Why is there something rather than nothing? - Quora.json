            "answer_text": "Possibly the most important \u2018why\u2019 question of all, and as such it should receive more attention. Some things are better reasoned through from first principles, and I think the universe is definitely one of those things. Here\u2019s my view. We can fairly safely rephrase the question into \u201cWhy, and how, did the universe come to exist from nothing?\u201d But how can we say it probably came from nothing? Well, the Big Bang played backwards suggests that it began as a dimensionless state. Also, the universe is spatially \u2018flat\u2019, which suggests that the positive energy of the universe balances the negative (gravity). In other words, the net energy sum of the universe is zero. In reference to this feature, physicist Alan Guth once said that the universe is \u201cthe ultimate free lunch\u201d. Some have suggested that the universe may have come from a black hole, or a quantum fluctuation in a preexisting universe. Two problems here - the universe is almost inconceivably big (possibly infinite), so how could it have come from such a state. Also, if we posit some kind of preexisting universe (or black hole) then we come up against the question of where THAT came from, so the question of something from nothing never completely goes away. For something that is potentially infinite in extent, nothingness is an excellent candidate for a preexisting state. That is because nothingness, by its very nature, should have no limit or extent, or else it would be something rather than nothing. So if we ask \u201cWhy, and how, did the universe come to exist from nothing?\u201d, we can apply a couple of other fairly logical caveats. Firstly, that there is nothing else to create the universe but itself (because it came from nothing). Secondly, that the universe EXISTS. Existence, as we know it in this universe, consists of a what, a where and a when. i.e. space, time and complexity. So the universe should be capable of making its own space, time and complexity. I would go so far as to say that these THREE elements should be considered fundamental dimensions but the complexity dimension isn't recognised because it isn't directly measurable, and probably requires some input from a universal consciousness. Both these features (but particularly the latter) cut against the grain of standard scientific reasoning. For more on this see Gavin Rowland's answer to Can we explain the fine-tuned universe without religion or parallel universes? But why would nothingness come into existence, rather than just staying as nothingness? This may be a special case of what is known in physics as symmetry breaking. Basically if something is symmetrical it is seen as being unstable, and prone to breaking symmetrically into something more ordered. As physicist Frank Wilczek has pointed out, nothing is more symmetrical than nothingness, so if symmetry breaking applies in this situation then nothingness would inevitably break into something. It is interesting that, while the universe appears to have created spatial separation and the forward movement of time, it has also created a force, namely gravity, which contracts things spatially and slows time towards a dimensionless point - the spacetime singularity. This is another way of looking at the \u201cfree lunch\u201d idea and food for thought for those who seek some kind of mathematical union between gravity and the other forces of nature. Quantum gravity may ultimately be a fool\u2019s errand because the universe created gravity out of symmetry breaking and conservation of energy considerations. And physics may be floundering for solutions because it isn't thinking simply and fundamentally enough. ",

            "answer_text": "I posted an answer to the similar question (Why is there something instead of nothing? What is the purpose of life? ), it goes something like this: Based on on what physics tells us, the answer lies in quantum mechanics. More specifically, in quantum information theory. Before I return to that, let\u2019s imagine an event with random result - flipping a coin. When you flip a coin, the coin is expected to have 0.5 chance to hit head (H) and 0.5 chance to hit tail (T). So, after many throws, there should be approximately equal amount of H results, as well as of T results. BUT, this event isn\u2019t truly random. Hypothetically, if we knew the initial speed, position and mass of each side of the coin, we could (after many Newtonian mechanics) determine which side will fall - H or T. Now, you could say that applies for every single atom, every single particle in the Universe - if we knew all the initial conditions, all characteristics of the particle and how it interacts with everything else, we could exactly predict it\u2019s behavior. But it is not the case. In quantum mechanics, it is shown that behavior of the single particle is not deterministic in nature. Which means, fundamental properties of our reality are random! No matter if you know everything about the particle, it\u2019s just random in nature. Here\u2019s a link to the experiment that explains this. Interesting subject of quantum mechanics is quantum information theory. I have to recommend this book (Decoding reality) to anyone who is interested in deep questions, or just wants to find out more about fundamental properties of the Universe. And this is about author himself (Vlatko Vedral). So, if you take random behavior of particles waaaay back to the beginning of the\u2026 well, anything at all, you come to the point when first \u201csomething\u201d just happened - randomly. Because that\u2019s what nature is like in its most fundamental part. Instead of matter or energy, in the above-mentioned book it is discussed that the most fundamental part of our nature is information. Yes, information are physical (if they weren\u2019t, your telephone wouldn\u2019t work). Here\u2019s the paper published by Claude Shannon, genius who introduced the information theory to the world. One handy property of information, which matter and energy lack, is that information can \u201chappen from nothing\u201d. Let\u2019s do a thought experiment, based on something John von Neumann suggested: imagine you have a set that contains no elements - empty set. But you can also think of that set as of the set that in itself contains another set with no elements. So, you just came from \u201cnothing\u201d to the concept of \u201cone\u201d (1). If you again imagine that this subset contains another subset with no elements, you come to the concept of \u201ctwo\u201d (2) etc. See how we can come to the set of all natural numbers from nothing? So this suggests that the first \u201csomething\u201d could just happen and that\u2019s all! But does anything really exist or is it just the way we classify things? We ourselves are information and our consciousness is very good information processor. Imagine a computer, with all the folders, files etc. Those folders and files don\u2019t really exist in the computer, it\u2019s just an interface. All that exists in the computer are 0s and 1s and processor that processes those 0s and 1s. Similarly, our minds created an interface for us - everything we see and classify (tree, chair, food\u2026). It\u2019s all just information flowing (which doesn\u2019t make it any less real!). I would like to add that in the quantum world, there aren\u2019t only 0s and 1s, but all the possible states of their combinations. They are not called bits anymore, but qubits. It is also explained in the book I recommended above. One more thing I would like to look at from this point of view - evolution. Both in the thermodynamics and in information theory, we have this concept of entropy, which is just quantified \u201cmessiness\u201d of the system, or how much the system isn\u2019t arranged. The 2nd law of thermodynamics tells us that in the closed system, entropy can only rise. In information theory, entropy tells us how much information is something worth and that in the closed systems, the number of information can only grow. So, if you look at evolution as gene mutations - you come to the rising number of information with every new mutation! Hence, the entropy grows, although we seem to be one \u201carranged\u201d phenomenon. Of course, religion and philosophy have their visions of reality, but I think that the truth is one - it is just a matter of perspective how someone likes to explain things. I hope it was interesting :) ",
