            "answer_text": "As an author, I can tell you that, in general, human beings don't sit down and write volumes unless they are inspired to do so. The people -- and I do mean people, not one person, not Moses and not some Near East tribal god -- who wrote the Hebrew Bible were most certainly inspired, but they were not inspired by the spirit of scientific inquiry. Wherever the Bible happens to not disagree with evolution -- which is very different than agreeing, since agreeing would imply they purposely jotted down stories that reflected their understanding of the subject -- it is almost certainly from either coincidence or something akin to chance. For example, the Bible speaks of God's six days of creation, wherein God created the world and life. Life in the Bible starts in the ocean, and that's true scientifically. It's for this reason that scaled fish are automatically kosher. It then ends with the creation of man. Obviously, we are a very recent emergence in the history of life on this planet. But already the Bible, in its very language, is at odds with science, since creating life and it suddenly appearing, and it evolving over millions of years, are two very different processes. One we understand through evolutionary theory and the other is described by the phrase, \"Um, God did it.\" And if you believe that a \"day\" for God might actually have been millions of billions of years in length, have fun with that, because you're basically believing that the people who wrote the Bible, and wrote about a lot of very mundane and irrelevant tibal history, didn't have enough space on their parchment to qualify their \"day\" or just say, \"over a hundred million years,\" Meanwhile, science can tell you very precisely the eons it took for one creature to evolve after the other. So if you're looking for miracles, stand in awe of the human mind, the creator of gods and bibles and, more vitally, science. ",

            "answer_text": "Evolution says death is what create improvements and better species.Bible says death is an anomaly on a initial perfect creation.It's a fundamental distinction between them. Many expect scientists to confirm Bible. But they are not paid for that and  no human had any interest ever to believe the Bible. Even if it will be ever proved true by all scientists it will not be followed by many. From begining to the end it deals with sin and the struggle of humans to make their way in life engaged by obscure addictions. There are sincere people who apreciate the values of Bible but they are uncomfortable that science contradicts it and can't believe all the facts written. If you realy want to live righteousness you will find the faith. If not you will find reasons to disapprove the Bible. Some will ask: so I can't be righteousness without your book? Yes you can just hope your neighbour have the same standard. God doesn't need you. So many people believe that God needs them. If you believe you need God, you have a way, the Bible. Follow it. Bible says God gave a way. Man should test it to see if it is good for him and humankind. There are a lot of human laws that are obsolete after a while or a law is good in a country is bad for other. If you don't need God, live your life. Bible has nothing for you. But if you need the way of righteousness and need help in your life, you have Jesus.\"Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, \u201cLet anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.\" John 7:37 \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\"Matthew 11:28 ",
