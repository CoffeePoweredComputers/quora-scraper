            "answer_text": "According to Richard Feynman, it does not get absorbed. You might want to read his papers on reflection (and refraction) and watch the video clips of him teaching those topics to his physics students at CalTech. Feynman relates optical behavior to the timing of the oscillations of the bound EM field surrounding the atomic nuclei of the mirroring surface, with the oscillations of the unbound quantum excitations of the EM field - photons. Since you are trying to visualize what is happening with this particular energetic transaction at quantum scale - reflection - bear in mind that a microscopic inspection of the surface of the reflecting material is not absolutely flat at all, so, how do the photons rebound in such a manner that they will form coherent images of reflection? The size of the wavelength of the photon must be greater than the spacing of the hills and valleys of that imperfect surface. Liquid water undisturbed is very flat; glass that has cooled from a molten mass is still pretty flat but not perfectly flat like liquid, molten glass. Polished metal? Lots of bumpy terrain once your viewing resolution lets you see it up close. Still makes a coherent image. It\u2019s about wavelengths. Here\u2019s the thing: a wave on water (classical wave) has an amplitude (height and volume) and a forward velocity, but it does not have a wavelength or a frequency; it takes at least two waves to derive those values. Not with photons, they can be assigned a wavelength and a frequency to only one photon. How? Because, it is not a classical wave. Nothing is wiggling like they illustrate in the textbooks; the \u201cwave\u201d aspect of a quantum excitation is statistical, not geometric. The \u201cwave\u201d is a statistical distribution of probabilities which, when plotted on a graph, appears wave-like. This does not answer your question, however it may prepare you to read and watch Feynman on this fascinating topic. ",

The coherent re-radiation has constructive interference in the direction you know from the law of reflection. Note that mirrors only act you describe if they are very large compared to the wavelength of the light (e.g., at least centimeters, compared to less than a micrometer). If you make a small mirror, there will be noticeable Fraunhofer diffraction. ",
