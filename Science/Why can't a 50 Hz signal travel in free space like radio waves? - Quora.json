            "answer_text": "A 50 Hz signal CAN travel in free space as a radio signal. In fact, there have been transmitters for slightly higher frequencies (70 to 90 Hz range) used by stations on land to communicate with submarines at sea. One problem is that very long antennas (I believe lengths are/were around 10 miles) are needed to transmit useful amounts of power. 50 Hz would be a lousy choice in any case because it is a standard power line frequency so the noise from power lines and equipment would be serious competition to the desired signals. However, 50 Hz is a dumb choice as are such low frequencies in general because the rate of transmission of data is very slow. For radio to work well it is most satisfactory for ordinary purposes to have the data rate per second small relative to the carrier frequency (which would be 50 Hz is the case you have in mind). Voice would be nearly hopeless and data at a couple bits or less per second is a choice you make only if you have few better alternatives. In the case of submarines the frequency is small to allow adequate penetration into seawater, which is electrically conductive and thus limits deep penetration, an effect getting worse with increasing frequency.

            "answer_text": "A 50 Hz signal does travel in free space just like higher-frequency waves. The problem is that it isn\u2019t very useful to us. It doesn\u2019t have much bandwidth, so isn\u2019t useful for any communications more advanced than a telegraph.Although a fairly simple receiver can be built, the transmitter requires an impractically-large antenna, and a similarly large amount of power to drive that antenna.Such Super low frequency signals actually have been used for communications through the ground or the oceans, where the higher frequencies that we use in free space or atmosphere cannot easily penetrate.
