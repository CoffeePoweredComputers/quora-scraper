            "answer_text": "hmmm\u2026 a combination of hard work and competition. I got several 1st places and not just at the school fair, city and regionals, so let's go through them. 8th grade (middle school): The project was on lasers. I had a hand-written backboard on those cheap project boards (handmade, not store bought), no paper at the school/city fair - just an abstract\u2026. And\u2026 a passionate knowledge of the topic. Every question from the judge I could answer with detailed knowledge. 1st in school, city, and regionals. That was in the junior division group projects so that was as far as I was allowed to compete.9th grade (first year in high school): Hovercrafts. Now I was finally competing in the senior division, but I had to compete against two DeSoto girls in the engineering division. One was a senior in high school and one was my age. Both had extremely detailed projects on advancing the techniques for building stronger concrete (the older project), and blacktop (the younger). Their father was a civil engineer with the state, in charge of improving concrete and blacktop within cities. So I was competing against him as well as them. I took 2nd place, which surprised everyone. However, I didn\u2019t want that rough competition holding me back. I researched and found that math and computers was rarely entered\u2026.10th grade: The Fourth dimension: researching the mathematical properties of space-time. I was an alternate to International through regionals, 1st in the city, and regional (stopped competing in the school and went straight to city competition). Again, I blew the judges away with the depth of knowledge and passion for the topic.11th grade: The Universe, Warped Spacetime, and Pure Fourth Dimensional Properties. Yes, my title was that long. 2nd year on 4th dimension topics, I calculated the elasticity of the universe assuming that gravity was caused by 4th-dimensional warping (like putting a ball on a sheet of rubber, it indents a well that operates like gravity). The judges liked my knowledge, but not my direction. I took 1st place in the city and regional.12th grade: I switched to 3D graphics and actually created a stereo viewer and drew my own 3D objects on the computer. 1st in city, and regional. The passion for the topic was even higher, but the competition had stepped up for the whole of the school and region. No more international. State, I had a judge walk out on me and give me a zero, \u201cto save me from wasting time on the \u2018fad\u2019 of 3D graphics\u201d which he said would end within a year or two. The other judges loved my enthusiasm. I chose a career in 3D graphics and so far the \u2018fad\u2019 hasn\u2019t died.I took a lot of firsts, not just at school, but into the regional competition. I never got a 1st at State and never competed at the International Science and Engineering Fair. Still, I did quite well and even eventually set myself up for a career. It\u2019s that passionate knowledge behind every project. I might have been able to compete against the younger DeSoto girl, still\u2026 I am glad I switched to math and computers because I ended up setting myself up for career directions. ",

            "answer_text": "Kids these days are doing ever more complicated projects - I see that there are plans available on the internet to build a device that demonstrates nuclear fusion. While that certainly sounds like a perfect science fair winner, I believe that it is exactly the kind of project that is ruining science fairs. When I go to science fairs, I look for real projects presented by real students that try to solve real problems by demonstrating a real understanding of the scientific method. What I don't like to see is some slick presentation that was cut and pasted directly from a \u201cguaranteed science fair winning projects\u201d website. I want to see a project that has relavance in the world of a high school student, using tools of science that are typically found in a high school lab. Nobody expects a high school student to cure cancer or solve world hunger - those are problems that high school students don't even have the capacity to really understand. Accomplishing some huge outcome is not even the purpose of the science fair. Instead, show me that you have a curious mind, and that you understand how to use science (especially the tools and the methods) to advance knowledge. I know this answer doesn't really answer your question, so I will at least give you some ideas to consider from the world of Energy Conservation - Is it cheaper to replace a working incandescent light bulb with an LED bulb, or should you wait until it burns out? Which should you run your air conditioning fan on - \u201cauto\u201d or \u201con\u201d? How much energy does a 100 watt PV cell generate in your city? Should you bother to put a PV panel on a North-facing roof, or on a roof partially shaded by a tree or another building? How much carbon dioxide does a tree absorb? How about an entire forest? I think that if you think about it, you can take any commonly accepted beliefs that are popular right now and do some data gathering and see for yourself what is actually true (which, by the way, is exactly what science is supposed to do).
