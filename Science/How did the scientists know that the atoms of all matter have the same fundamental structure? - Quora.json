Scientists don\u2019t know that all atoms have the same fundamental structure. They do know that if they assume that all atoms have the same fundamental structure they can do a lot of useful things with that theory, and they have never found an atom with a different fundamental structure. How did the scientists know that the atoms of all matter have the same fundamental structure? ",
