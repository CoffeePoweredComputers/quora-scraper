            "answer_text": " Easily. Great whites can reach about 20 feet long but the giant said can reach 43 feet or more. Giant Squid Giant squid have two long arms full of hooks and are extremely agile where a great white can touch its nose to its tail but can\u2019t even catch a 3 foot seal in broad daylight. I watched a California sea lion swim circles, literally, around 3 adult great white sharks roughly 15 feet each.  This day at Isla Guadalupe was an eye opener! Everyone was expecting that poor little seal (not in my pic but these are the 3 sharks) to get ripped to shreds but he just swam around them like a fighter jet flying around hot air balloons. They had no chance during the day but darkness would change those odds. Sharks do have armor like skin but squid beaks are strong enough to crack the thickest shells known like conchs, cowry and nautilus shells. Their weaker cousin, the pacific octopus, has even been caught killing sharks in aquariums.   If we\u2019re matching up superpowers, great whites do have all of our 5 senses plus two more. Lateral lines down their sides detect {{{vibration}}} in the water and ampullae di Lorenzini which detect (magnetic fields) heartbeats. However, squid and octopodes (proper plural of octopus, not octopii) have 3 hearts\u2026 I wonder how this affects the interaction between the two animals\u2026 Cephalopods, squid & octopodes have 9 brains\u2026 one main brain in the head and one for each arm also. On top of that, they can ink multiple times leaving a murky mess to grasp at prey through and squid can easily dart and change direction with lightning speed. Both species have chromatophores which are cells that change color. Sharks will darken their skin near the surface of the water (recorded) and we think this may be to absorb more sunlight for warmth. Great whites are technically warm blooded creatures but absorbing sunlight does ease the function of sharks metabolism, digestion, swim speed and so on. But, due to the 9 brains in ceohalapods, they are able to change color dramatically and rapidly. Even pulsating, different patterns and solid colors to boot. Counter shading and counter illuminating to help stealth when being hunted as well as hunting. And lastly, the real killer would be the suction cups on the tentacles and the arms can squeeze like a boa constrictor. I\u2019ve played with 100 or so octopodes while diving and even the little ones can pull your mask off, regulator out of tour mouth or even hang on for dear life when you try to remove them. Sharks have no chance. Especially a 9 foot great white, that\u2019s a very young shark. Why you gotta pick on the little guy? Here\u2019s my credential. All my pics and video.     How about this one too (by hand)  ",

If it\u2019s not the case and if the biggest squids are the size of the squids we already observed, it\u2019s possible but really I\u2019m unsure about this. What I can tell you is this: one of the biggest specimens we know was a giant squid who was captured alive in the waters of New Zealand. The beast was 4,5 meters long (15 feet) and was eating its prey. The prey was an antarctic toothfish. Those fishes are 5 to 7 feet long. So, if a 15 feet squid can eat a 7 feet fish, is it unbelievable to imagine a slightly bigger squid could eat a 9 feet great white ? I don\u2019t think so. But maybe something should kill the great white first. 9 feet great whites will defend themselves far more efficiently than antarctic toothfishes, believe me ! ",

The only really ferocious point on a giant squid is its beak, and it would have to find the exact place on the shark to bite. I suppose if the beak landed exactly on the shark\u2019s head during their initial struggle, then maybe. But sharks attack from the rear and he could take those tentacles off pretty quick. So, again, I think unlikely. ",
