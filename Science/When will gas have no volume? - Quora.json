            "answer_text": "A gas is the state of matter which is known to occupy the volume of the container. A gas will however cease to occupy volume when all the molecules will condense to a liquid state for an ideal gas this happens at absolute zero, i.e., 0K. the common misnomer that gases do not have volume at absolute zero is a misunderstanding or a sort of misinterpretation. Gases do not have volume at absolute zero because they are not gases anymore. However, they are still very much a state of matter and so they will always occupy some volume or as we know from the postulates of matter, space. We cannot destroy matter, we can just transform it and hence we cannot have a gas with no volume as it would imply that we somehow erased its existence which is not possible by the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MATTER.

            "answer_text": "A gas never has a defined volume. Any gas will just fill whatever volume is available to it. The same amount of gas that fills a small container can also fill a large container. At the same temperature, this will just result in a smaller pressure, following the ideal gas law pV=nRT. The only cases where this will not work is when you offer so little volume that the same compound as a liquid would significantly fill it (or worse: if the liquid would not even fit). ",
