            "answer_text": "According to the given problem,(i) There are two mixtures of milk and water, the quantity of milk in them being 20% and 80% of the mixture.(ii) If 2 liters of the first are mixed with 3 liters of the second, what will be the ratio of milk to water in the new mixture?(iii) Let (M1, W1) & (M2, W2) denote (milk, water) of the 1st & 2nd mixtures respectively.From (i), (ii) & (iii) we get following relations,M1 = 20% of 2 liters = (20/100)*2 = 0.40 (L)W1 = 80% of 2 liters = (80/100)*2 = 1.60 (L)M2 = 80% of 3 liters = (80/100)*3 = 2.40 (L)W2 = 20% of 3 liters = (20/100)*3 = 0.60 (L)Therefore in the final mixture we get as follows,(M1 + M2)/(W1 + W2) = (0.40 + 2.40)/(1.60 + 0.60)or (M1 + M2)/(W1 + W2) = 2.8/2.2 = 14/11 \u2026. (1a)Therefore from (1a) it is evident thatthe ratio of milk to water in the final mixture is 14:11 [Ans]",
