            "answer_text": "Discovery happens in many ways, including (often) by accident, but the way I will point out that I like the best is by people looking at something and wondering whether it can be improved.  The problem of shipping containers. What could we do to turn this problem into an opportunity - would a solution involve discovery of some kind? Most of us look at the world around us and accept it as it is. The government? It\u2019s a massive institution as firmly fixed as the mountains, we can\u2019t do anything about it, move on. Mining? Automobile design? Retail sales? Telephones? Rockets? Food preservation? Fishing? Staircases? Roller skates? Most people never think twice about such things. We don\u2019t change them because it doesn\u2019t even occur to us that they CAN be changed.  Catherine de Medici, with her lovely ruffed collar. She should get a little more sun. Maybe we could attach little mirrors all around the collar? This lady desperately needs more vitamin D. We could just feed her a codfish now and then, that would help. I just know something here has to change. The person who discovers things is very often the rare person who questions things as they are, and wonders whether there could be a better way to achieve the same goal. If it weren\u2019t for people like this, we would still be living in caves.  Remember we were discussing poor Catherine de Medici the other day? Well, since you are looking for something to wear to the Prom besides a visually stale traditional suit, maybe you could try this instead! We borrow a more modest version of Catherine\u2019s ruffed collar, get you a well-ventilated shirt so you can dance the night away - sexy leather pants - vampire haircut - voila! Greased lightning! Speaking of living in caves, consider the modern problem of what to do with shipping containers. Goods are shipped from source countries to destination countries in large metal boxes, but then it\u2019s not economical to ship the empty containers back. What could we do with them?    What about turning used shipping containers into housing? An individual family home (top), temporary housing using many containers stacked three levels high (middle), and another three-level temporary housing that provides the same living space using only half as many shipping containers (bottom) by arranging them in a checkerboard pattern. One final thought on discovery. The basic laws of nature have probably been pretty well all discovered by now, pending a new genius to throw open the barn doors to entirely new principles. But until that happens, there are still countless ways to apply existing discoveries in new ways. An example could the the discovery of the semiconductor, which led to the Light-Emitting Diode (LED) and to a whole new, low-energy way of providing lighting.  Scientists constructing semiconductors for electronics discovered that certain semiconductor materials and design caused these tiny devices to give off light. Minute changes in the \u201crecipe\u201d to fabricate them causes the colour of the emitted light to change. Useful discovery, or useless? What can you do with these things? Since LEDs last 10 years or longer, far longer than older lighting systems, the cost savings in the labour required for bulb replacement alone justifies the costs of replacing older lighting systems with LEDs at places such as airports as well as in traffic signals and vehicle running lights and signals. And then, there is the use of LEDs for applying nighttime colour to buildings. Some guy didn\u2019t want to pay for paint, and a whole new industry was born.   LED \u201cwall washing\u201d was a clever application of the fact that some semiconductors emit colour. The low energy cost of operating LED lighting opens the door to providing new looks to old buildings (top) as well as to more contemporary structures (below.) Colours and patterns can set the facilities in motion and change with the weather or season. ",
