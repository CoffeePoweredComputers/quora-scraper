            "answer_text": "FULL QUESTION: \u201cSome definitions say that electrical current is a flow of electrons. Some definitions say that electrical current can be a flow of charge particles such as electrons, protons, ions, holes etc. Is the latter definition right as well?\u201d The books claiming that all electric currents are electron flows, those are for kids, and also for repair-techs. They\u2019re wrong. Their simplified statements are called \u201clies to children,\u201d such as teaching that atoms are just like tiny solar systems, or that Christopher Columbus was a heroic saint who was the first to discover America. Adults later learn the uncomfortable truths! Textbooks intended for scientists and engineers won\u2019t try to teach the childhood concepts, such as: veinous blood is bright blue, or your tongue has flavor-detecting areas, or that atoms look like tiny six-petal flowers seen in those 1950s films about atomic power. Instead they\u2019ll tell you about +H hydrogen ion currents in biochemistry and in battery acid. The +H hydrogen ion has another name: it\u2019s called a proton. Proton electric currents are +H ion flows. Inside car batteries, down in the acid, the hundreds of amperes are a flow of protons. Inside human bodies (with medical electrodes attached?) the currents are flows of non-electron charges: positive sodiums and potassiums and +H ions, negative chlorides and -OH ions. No electrons. What then is the full, correct meaning of \u201celectric current?\u201d Better not listen to books aimed at the non-scientist! ",

            "answer_text": "You are right except for the fact that the definition (as made by man) of current flow is defined as one coulomb of charge per second. One coulomb is 6.242\u00d710 to the 18 (1.036\u00d710\u22125 mol) protons, and \u22121 C is equivalent to the charge of approximately 6.242\u00d710to the 18th. That is to say an amp is so many electrons or protons per second. So how can one measure ions or anything else you mentioned. Holes are a historical anomaly. We have two definitions of current and they are direct conflict and it will be confusing forever. There is electron flow and it is well shown in any vacuum tube and especially in old CRT TVs. A filament heats up the cathode and it gives off electrons which are accelerated to a positive charged plate . Electron current is minus to plus What we commonly call current in electronics and in semiconductor theory is cited as current flowing from plus to minus. Thats where \u201choles \u201c came in holes are the vacant places a electron should be in a stable atoms shell. Holes are said as flowing but its really he wave front of electrons going the other way. Kind of like the ebbing tide. This probably came from early experiment in electoplating where the metal in solution deposited on the negative terminal - so it was thought the current goes plus to minus. We are stuck with holes and electrons but one is the inverse of the other. Just to add more madness to this holes (the absence of electrons) travel slower than electrons  ",

            "answer_text": "Electric current is the flow of charge. That is it. Electrical circuit theory does not concern itself with what carries the charge. Different kinds of charged particles have different parameters in the context of current like mobility and relaxation time, but their effects are modeled by equations like[math] E=j\u03c1[/math], and the only thing the symbol \u201ci\u201d stands for is the flow of charge [math]dq/dt[/math]. Current arises due to different charge carriers, but the current itself is the same. For example, in a transistor (the bipolar ones), we have to add the current due to electrons and the current due to the holes to get the total current. I[math] [/math][math]= Ie + Ih[/math] Also, this current will flow as lithium ions or sulphate ions if we connect it to a battery. Even in an antimatter universe, our curcuit theory will remain the same, because current due to positrons is still current. ",

            "answer_text": "In that the concept of electrical current is a man-made definition, it can be whatever we want it to be, so long as we agree on the same definition. However, I would agree that any net flow of charge constitutes an electrical current. As long as charges, positive or negative, are streaming from one place to another, that, in my opinion, constitutes an current. However, for a huge number of purposes such as electrical power or computers, the only kind of current that matters is the flow of electrons. People working in such areas will not bother considering all the other forms of current, because they don\u2019t matter to them in their everyday life. ",

The direction of electrical current is defined by direction positively charged particles which is opposite of actual movement of electrons through wires. Normally electrons can freely move while atoms can move only in gas and air, but are slower. Example of possible charged or neutral particles:   Most commonly known examples of electrical current are: - Electrons through wire - Anions and cations in acid (inside battery) - Lighting (about 10% of lightning strikes are called positive the rest are standard or negative) Theoretically if one should charge an object and move it through space it would be considered as electrical current.

In fact, in chemical batteries, or electrolytic solutions the current in the electrolyte is a result of movement of ions from the positive terminal to the negative terminal for positive radicals and vice versa for negative radicals and is carried in fact, because electrolytes are easily ionised in certain solutions. Of course, if you find free protons somewhere, you could use them to set up an electrical circuit. ",
