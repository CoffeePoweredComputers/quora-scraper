            "answer_text": "In fact, you answered your own question? Yes, indeed nearly everything is empty space including space between the electrons of an atom to its nucleus. 99.9999999% of Your Body Is Empty Space. Some days, you might feel like a pretty substantial person. Questions and Answers If atoms are 99.999999999999% empty space then why don't things pass right through them? Things don't fall through other things because they are levitating on an electrostatic field! I am not kidding! When you sit on a chair, you are not really touching it. You see, every atom is surrounded by a shell of electrons. This electron cloud presents a rather negative face to the world. Remember that like charges repel each other. When two atoms approach each other, their electron shells push back at each other, despite the fact that each atom's net charge is 0. This is a very useful feature of nature. It makes our lives a lot easier. Now the question you should be asking is if atoms push away from each other, why doesn't the entire universe just blow away from itself? The answer is that some, actually most atoms' electron shells are not full. When two atoms come together and have empty spaces in their electron shells, they will share electrons to fill in the spaces in both of their shells. Yes, the electrons really do go back and forth between atoms and they do so pretty fast. Electrons tend to be kind of mobile, which is also a very nice feature of nature since without it your mps player would not work. Once both atoms' outer shells are full due to this electron sharing, they go back to their usual repulsive behaviour. This, by the way, is how we get molecules and the secret to understanding Chemistry. It's all about the electrons! ",

            "answer_text": "99.99% space but not 99.99% empty In microcosmos, you can\u2019t just fit any object in any space. It has to obey some laws. So, if some case doesn\u2019t obey those laws, the space is not usable space. Example: Electron can not be contained in the space between nucleus and orbit shell. There is a minimum radius of this. After that radius, it can jump from one level to another but it won\u2019t get squeezed into any closer range than the lowest level. It would cause a physical reaction and produce xrays. You can even try to stuff electron inside a nucleus(each proton-neutron consists of only 3 quarks that are much smaller than proton and neutron) but it will revert any effect with decaying into a stable state. For example, a lone neutron will decay into proton and electron (separated) with a mean half life around 10 minutes. Stuffing things inside nucleus or trying to get something out of there also results in more energetic radiation than just xrays. Alpha, beta and gamma rays. Particles at relativistic speeds or just highly energetic waves(gamma). Hydrogen\u2019s electron is traveling 2200 kilometers per second on its orbit. You can\u2019t get it closer to hydrogen, the more you try the more relativistic moment it gains. The more moment it has the more uncertainity its position has. The more uncertainity of position, the more impossibility to say \u201cit is inside\u201d. Look at it like a blackbox not being able to see whats inside. You are trying to stuff things but they can\u2019t be contained inside. You can only say its not empty. Even if its space. To create real empty vacuum, you need a lot of energy and that is not normal for atoms. ",
