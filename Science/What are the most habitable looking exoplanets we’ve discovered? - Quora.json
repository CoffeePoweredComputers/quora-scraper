            "answer_text": "Yesterday, NASA and Belgian-led research team came with this amazing news that they have spotted seven earth-size planets around a star, some 40 light years far from earth, some or all of which could harbour water and possibly life.  They circle around the dimly lit star TREPPIST-1, with orbits ranging from one and a half to 20 days. If Trappist-1 were our sun, all these planets would fit inside the orbit of Mercury. That's how close they are to their star and why their orbits are so short. The planets have no real names. They're only known by letters, \"b\" through \"h.\" The letter \"A\" refers to the star itself.  Can this newly discovered solar system support life? -Six of TRAPPIST-1's \"exoplanets\" lie in a temperate zone where surface temperatures range from zero to 100C. -Of these, at least three are thought to be capable of having watery oceans, greatly increasing the likelihood of life. -No other star system known contains such a large number of Earth-sized and probably rocky planets. -All are about the same size as Earth or Venus, or slightly smaller. Because the parent star is so dim, the planets are warmed gently despite having orbits much smaller than that of Mercury, the planet closest to the sun. -Scientists said they need to study the atmospheres before determining whether these rocky, terrestrial planets could support some sort of life. -From the viewpoint of someone standing on the surface of one of the planets, some of the other worlds would appear larger than the moon in the Earth's sky. -Gazing up, it would be possible to see the geological features, oceans and clouds of your planetary neighbours. -The ultracool star at the heart of this system would shine 200 times dimmer than our sun, a perpetual twilight as we know it. And the star would glow red - maybe salmon-colored, the researchers speculate.  Though thousands of exoplanets have been known since 1992, this one certainly gives a lot of hopes about existence of our unseen neighbours. We see plants make their own food with sun and water. So no wonder if some day in future any bluish or greenish guy around us said \u201cDHOOP!\u201d Source: NASA Telescope Reveals Record-Breaking Exoplanet Discovery Exoplanet discovery: What does Nasa's announcement mean - and should we be excited about TRAPPIST-1?

            "answer_text": "With the help of User-11947834129243635495\u2019 post What is the most habitable planet as of 2017?, I have updated and compiled a list of more than 50 of the most habitable exoplanets, and made a mapping of their locations (two-dimensional projection), and infographics of the distances, host stars, and equilibrium temperatures of the planets. The most likely to be habitable exoplanet found so far according to a recent paper is Kepler-186 f[1], though it has an equilibrium temperature of only 188 K (Earth is 255 K[2], and Mars is 210 K[3]). As such, Kepler-1229 b (216 K), Kepler-442 b (233 K), or Kepler-62 f (244 K) may be more likely habitable exoplanet candidates.
