            "answer_text": "Cell theory was originally given by German botanist Matthias Schleiden & German physiologist Theodor Schwann together based on their researches in 1838 & 1839 respectively. This theory proposed the hypothesis that all living bodies are composed of 1 or many cells. However, this theory didn't explain how new cells were formed. So, in 1855, Rudolf Virchow came forward & explained \u201cOmnis cellula-e cellula\u201d, meaning \u2018all cells arise from pre-existing cells\u2019. So, the postulates of the modern cell theory are as follows: Cell is the basic functional & structural unit of life(all living organisms).All living organisms are composed of cells & the products of cells.All cells arise from the division of pre-existing cells.Note : \u2018Viruses\u2019 are exception to the cell theory as they lack cellular organisation.

            "answer_text": "The three classical postulates of cell theory are: All known life is composed of one or more cells. (Note that since viruses are not made out of cells, according to cell theory viruses and other things that replicate autonomously such as prions are not alive. This is controversial, since viruses in particular exhibit other characteristics of living things.)Cells are the building blocks of organisms. Anything simpler than a cell cannot survive and replicate to produce more cells on its own. Therefore, cells are the fundamental unit of life, even though the inner workings of cells are very complex.Cells come from other cells. This means that a cell cannot arise spontaneously but has to be copied from a preexisting cell.Modern biologists added additional postulates, but the original three have endured. ",
