            "answer_text": "Why should the equation E=mc^2 be more complex? Because that isn't even the full equation, and you keep ascribing meaning to it that it doesn't have. The full equation is [math]E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 -\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}[/math] And this gives the kinetic energy and mass energy of a body. It is not all the energy, and wasn't intended to be, as you could simply see by adding potential energy and obtaining something like [math]E_{tot} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + E_{potential}[/math] But rather than try to understand what all of this means - you will continue posting questions related to the thoughts you don't tell us, and miss so many basic points that it's untrue.

            "answer_text": "It would not matter how complex you made it, the equation would always be a closed circuit that is only good to be weaponized. Mathematical equations are used by scientifically minded people to describe \u201creality\u201d as if it is finite and real. They postulate hypothesis and then theories that the darker minded scientists find ways to weaponize. When a human being follows the dark path of light, their honor defines their duty. If they gain honours by finding techniques that will make better weapons, then they tend to think in that direction. The Nobel prize was created precisely for that outcome. The only reason the equation should be more complex is if a better weapon could be developed from it. ",
