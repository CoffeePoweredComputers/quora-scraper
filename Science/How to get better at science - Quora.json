            "answer_text": "For every chapter, you first need to build your sense of direction on your studies. That means you need to be constantly aware what are the topics within the chapter you already know and what are the topics still require you to spend more time to study. In order to build your sense of direction in your studies, you need to study to understand, which provides for solid memories, rather than studying to remember/memorizing. This is what I will suggest you do Allocate a 2 or 3 hour study session, with a 15 minutes break in between, on each full day for a study session (perhaps on a particular chapter). The most ideal time to do this is in the morning when you just had your breakfast. You add another 3 hour session before bedtime if you have more time. In the last 15 minutes of each study session, you also do a reflection on what you have learned and what you still need to improve on. This will give you a sense of direction on what you still need to revise/study exactly in your next study session. If you repeat this for every chapter and you will realize you are studying more efficiently by constantly focus on improvement. Hence, you will be more informed about your progress in every chapter. All this allows you to study efficiently, still have time to have fun and have a good night sleep. If you want a more detail answer on how to study in general, read this.

            "answer_text": "Get on YouTube, and start following some of the many, many wonderful science shows. Crash course, Smarter Every Day, and Discovery News are some of my favorites. When you see a topic you don't understand or want to know more about, check the description or comments for links to other resources, and go check those out.  Also, when you see something in the news you don't understand or want to know more about - go look it up! Quora and wikipedia are great places to start. Click on links, read further, and keep going.  You've already got the biggest party down - being curious. Really, that's the heart of all scientific inquiry.  (Also, Mythbusters is a great, fun example of the scientific process in action. Are there things to nit-pick? Sure. But explosions are a lot of fun). ",
