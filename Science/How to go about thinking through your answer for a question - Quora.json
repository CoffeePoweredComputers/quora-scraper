My process is: Research and make sure I am correct in what I think the answer is.Think about how much background information will be required to understand it.Find some sources to support both the background and conclusion.Start writing. Insert sources and relevant images along the way.Submit answer.Reread and try to edit out typos or grammatical mistakes.Read comments and update / revise if relevant concerns come up.If a major concern is brought up that totally invalidates the answer, delete it. This has only happened once, but nobody\u2019s perfect - and I\u2019m glad it was pointed out in the comments.",

Even if I have to do some research, I already know how to locate the research I\u2019m thinking about and it\u2019s just a matter of getting the citation. If the question is on a sensitive subject, I will read it carefully before I submit the answer to try to be sure it is unoffensive while making my point. ",
