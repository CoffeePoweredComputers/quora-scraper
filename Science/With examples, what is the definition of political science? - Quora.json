            "answer_text": "Q. With examples, what is the definition of political science? (1) Short answer: It describes actual political societies or institutions. As such, it does not prescribe. It\u2019s the study of politics. It\u2019s a study of the way in which nations and empires have have developed and spread globally, the study of Political geography. (2) There\u2019s alot of uncertainty, if not confusion, on what constitutes Political philosophyPolitical sciencePoliticsThis answer explains the three. It starts with Political Philosophy because that\u2019s the starting point, from ideas through practice. (3) Political Philosophy (PP) It attempts to answer these questions. How does politics contribute to the well-being or otherwise of people?What is \u2018The Good Life\u2019? How is it achieved?What principles and values should be used to shape and judge political institutions?What sort of society will best allow its citizens to flourish?What do we really mean by equality, justice and freedom?Is it ever right to go to war? (Sam Qwato's answer to What are the principles of the Just War Theory?)Is it ever right to rebel against a government?What responsibility should government have for dealing with the global issues of terroism or the environment?PP is about good government. What does it involve? How is it to be regulated? How it is brought about? It\u2019s about the principles that help people decide whether any particular government is to be judged good or bad. It requires an examination of the fundamental principles of government. Why we need government?What its goals should be?How is it to be regulated?If it goes wrong, how to repair or replace it?PP may be seen as a branch of Ethics, or Moral Philosophy. Ethics looks at all issues of right and wrong in the way people treat one another, while PP limits itself to the specific issues related to our collective or political life. The ethics of social organization, applied across society. PP is Normative - this is what people should do.As opposed to \u2018descriptive\u2019 - this is what people actually do.(4) Political Science (PS) PS is \u2018descriptive\u2019, as opposed to \u2018normative\u2019. PS describes actual political societies or institutions.It\u2019s the study of politics.It\u2019s a study of the way in which nations and empires have have developed and spread globally, the study of Political geography.It\u2019s the study of how economics (finance, trade and the markets) shape society.(5) Politics Politics itself can be a practical, mechanical business. Sorting out how best to deliver agreed benefits, and so on. If it were only that, there would be few political issues to discuss. Every form of government would be judged simply on the basis of its delivery track record. But, life is not so straightforward. Our daily news feed is full of colorful, dramatic political animations that keep us hopeful, entertained, amused, flabbergasted, shocked, disgusted in equal measures. People disagree, ad nauseam, on the principles upon which society should be run. This perpetual tension brings us full circle back to PP! (6) PP, Politics and Economics Ultimately, PP is about ends. What we seek to achieve through Politics.Once the ends are agreed on, Politics and Economics are the delivery arms.But, political and economic systems tend to generate their own ends. So, these too are scrutinized within PP. (7) Piqued? Immerse here: Sam Qwato's answer to What are the classics of political philosophy?

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. In the third century BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle was perhaps the first scholar to think systematically about how different forms of government led to different political outcomes: such as stability or rebellion in the city states in Ancient Greece. In fact, if science is the systematic building and organisation of knowledge with the aim of understanding and explaining how the world works, then Aristotle was probably the first \u2018political scientist\u2019. The term 'Political Science' consists of two words, viz, political and science. The word 'politics' is derived from the Greek word 'Polis' which means the city-state. In ancient Greece, the basic unit of political organization was the city-state. It was the Greeks who first embarked upon the study of state as distinct from the church. The foundations of political thinking were laid by the great Greek philosophers, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Plato was the author of the book \u201cThe Republic\u201d. Aristotle the father of political science firstly used the term 'politics' and converted the subject into an academic discipline. He published his book 'Politics' as a first systematic study of politics.  Science: is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation, evidence and experiment. So political science is the branch of knowledge that deals with systematic study of the structure and behavior of the state and political institutions through scientific analysis. Politics refers to the subject matter of our study; science denotes the methodology or the way of studying the process of politics. The first term seeks to answer the question \u201cwhat is studied\" and the second term refers to \u201chow is it studied\". Therefore, the political phenomenon which should be studied in accordance with a definite plan or system is called political science. Definitions of Political Science: It is difficult to give a precise definition to political science, because of its varying scope in different situations. Let us examine some of those definitions. Paul Janet - \u201cPolitical science is that part of science which treats of the foundations of state and the principles of government\u201d.H.J Laski- \u201cThe study of politics concerns itself with the life of man in relation to organized states\u201d.Lasswell- \u201cpolitical science is the study of shaping and sharing of power\u201d.David Easton-\u201cPolitical science is the study of the authoritative allocation of values for a society\u201d. Garner - \u201cPolitical Science begins and ends with the state\" Leacock - \u201cPolitical Science deals with government only\u201d Aristotle \u2013 \u201cScience of polis\u201dGettle \u2013 \u201cScience of state\u201d In the words of the French scholar, Paul Janet, political science is that part of social science which treats the foundations of the state and principles of government. From the above definitions we may conclude that the \u2018state\u2019 is the central theme of Political Science. It is the study about the state, its origin, its nature, its structure, and its functions and so on.  Modern political scientists have also emphasized the element of power in the study of the subject. Abraham Kaplan, Harold. D. Lasswell defined politics as the \u201cstudy of shaping and sharing of power\u201d. It suggests that struggle for power is the subject matter of the study of politics. Since this struggle takes place at all levels-domestic, local, regional, national and international \u2013 politics becomes universal activity.Robert A Dahl uses the term \u2018political system\u2019 instead of \u2018politics\u2019 and he defined it as any persistent pattern of human relationships that involves to a significant extent, control, influence power or authority. So the study of political science or politics include not only state and government but also an enquiry into the struggles for power that takes place at all levels beginning from the household to the world at large. Hence a comprehensive view of the subject of political science involves everything connected with the life of man in the process of making himself.
