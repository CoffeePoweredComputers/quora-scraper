            "answer_text": "He wants to stop it. He will very painfully realize that not supporting it will convert US to a third world country. If he (or anyone else for that matter) thinks he can replace all the fossil fuels with renewables, he is fooling himself. Renewables are a little boutique concept that politicians and celebrities like playing with (while they still drive their V10 cars and private jets), and will never meet the demands of the REAL world.. Consider all the winter heating, aviation, heavy equipment, trucks, transportation and heavy industry when politicians make their calculations. Do they know how to calculate \u201ckilowatt hours\u201d ? They will be lucky if renewables can support even 10% of the total energy needed when everything is humming at full capacity. And that is even BEFORE all the electric cars are taken into account. Imagine even half the US population having such a car and all those 30 - 60kw batteries plugging into the grid around 6pm at night. Just to put it into perspective, a typical full house air conditioner is anywhere between 10 - 30 kwatts. A typical car battery STARTS from 30kw. So charging a typical electric car on average is like running THREE of those full house air conditioners at the same time. We have seen what happened in CA in the heat wave. When that happens, even 100s of additional nuclear reactors will not be enough to supply the power. Where do they think the power will come from ? Even if you had hurricane harnessing wind farms, it would not be enough. The green new dream is just that\u2026 a dream. And instead of dreaming, politicians should consider REAL alternatives, like nuclear power which is the only solution to this dilemma. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s take him at his word when he spoke. In December, former Vice President Joe Biden, the leader in an aggregation of national polls in the Democratic race, told activists in Iowa that \u201cyou can\u2019t ban fracking right now\u201d That my friend is code for I can\u2019t become president if people know I want to ban fracking so I am going to say I\u2019m opposed to any NEW fracking until I get in. Now mind you he has not come out and said he would. But his promised energy advisor AOC has Promised to end fracking so I can see him saying \u201cI\u201dm leaving it up to my best advisors and taking their advise. Yup when I hear him say \u201cI will never ban fracking\u201d I will believe him as much as I did the man who said. \u201cread my lips no new taxes\u201d Oh and speaking of taxes. Last week, Biden proposed $700 billion in plans to support American manufacturing and innovation. That includes $400 billion in new spending over four years on the federal government\u2019s procurement of American-made products such as clean vehicles. He also proposed adding $300 billion over four years on innovation, including for clean energy and automobile research and development. Those plans alone would create an estimated 5 million new jobs, the Biden campaign said. The campaign said last week that it was delaying announcing any new taxes to pay for his proposals until it sees the state of the economy in January and whether more stimulus spending is necessary. Announcing an array of new taxes before the election would also give the Trump campaign an easy way to reprise its theme that Biden will raise everyone\u2019s taxes not just the rich. So here it is in his own words friends. ",
