            "answer_text": "I am not a nuclear scientist. I don't know quantum math. I have done a fair amount of reading about how it works. That said.  Atoms are made of stuff that's small enough that it doesn't really behave the way things do on a larger scale.  We're used to thinking of planets with moons and things as an example.  They move in predictable ways, and don't change their behaviors abruptly.  But when you start examining how smaller things interact, once you get to about the size of a cell (a bit too small to see without a microscope) you get into interactions that don't quite work the same way. Particles stop acting like particles all the time and sometimes seem to be waves or ripples, and the processes that apply to them work best as integer multipliers of a magic constant number (Planck's constant.) The pieces of atoms are all small enough that they're described as both particles and waves, at the same time, depending on what you're trying to examine.  (Some math describes the particles as little spinning twists of force.) One example of how weirdly these tiny things behave, is that on the sub-atomic scale, you can tell where something is, or how (and how fast) it's moving, but the better you know the one thing, the less you know the other thing. So we refer to \"orbits\" but what we actually have is a nucleus, which is made out of protons and sometimes neutrons.  Protons have the same electrical charge and thus push against and repel other protons, but when they're pushed close enough to a neutron (which has a neutral electric charge) there's a different kind of force (called the 'strong' force because it's stronger at this tiny distance) that is more powerfully attractive than the electrical charge is repulsive, so it holds the pieces of the nucleus together.  (The math for how this works is really complex.) Electrons \"orbit\" the nucleus because they're attracted to the protons, but repelled by other electrons, so they sort themselves out into \"shells\" where any electron MIGHT be present at a given time.  There are five of these, with different numbers of electrons possible in each shell.  But they don't orbit in a flat plane. They might blur around in a cloud on one side, or the other side, or they might be packed into zones, or they might just dodge around to wherever the other electrons aren't at the moment.  We don't really know.  (I suspect that there's a sort of 'zones' thing going on myself.)  We do know that they will tend to fill in the inner shells with the outer shells being filled in later. So an atom is kind of a fuzzy, blurry thing that has fuzzy, blurry things in the middle, with the fuzzy blurry smears on the outside being electrons.  You can have one or two \"missing\" electrons which create an atom with a strong charge (we call that an ion.)  You can also have two atoms that end up sharing electrons because their shells have an open \"hole\" where an electron can go, and then you have a molecule. We've sorted out atoms by \"element\" where \"element\" means \"How many protons are in the middle\".  This is because you can have slightly varying numbers of neutrons in the nucleus.  (Different counts of neutrons with a given single count of protons are called isotopes.)  So heavier elements add protons, and some number of neutrons.  (Helium is two protons, two neutrons, and a cloud of two electrons in the inner-most shell.) And this doesn't necessarily help, does it? ",
