            "answer_text": "Oh Boy, there are many. The problem is finding one that is age-appropriate and doable, with interesting and quantifiable results. Chemistry:Making aspirin, where you could then quantify how much final product you obtained (but DO NOT use the aspirin, because it isn't drug-grade pure): Make Your Own Aspirin in This Chemistry Experiment Physics:Measuring the viscosity of liquids. WHat you can do to bring this a level up is to try adding components to fluids or heating/cooling the fluids and create a table that shows how the viscosity varies with temperature or additives. Try using cornstarch, in varying quantities, and seeing if the cornstarch alters the viscosity more if the liquid has been heated and then cooled. Or gelatin. Or a mix of glue, borax and water (make a polymer).Viscosity of Liquids | Physics Experiments | PlanetSEED Biology: Measure lung capacity: http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/lungcapacity.html Make your own electrophoresis gel:http://dwb.unl.edu/chemistry/smallscale/SS080c.html DNA extraction, which can be stepped up by trying to make a chart that estimates how much DNA is in each gram of material by extracting DNA from different quantities of the same material, or by altering the the amount of each of the components you use.Ingredients: salt, liquid soap, meat tenderizer, SOURCE OF DNA (frozen peas or strawberries, spit vs. hair vs. fingernails vs. skin, juice, an egg) and ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (>70%). Blend: 1/2 cup of split peas (100ml), 1/8 teaspoon table salt (less than 1ml), 1 cup cold water (200ml).  Break up membranes: Strain your pea-mixture.  Add 2 tablespoons liquid detergent (about 30ml) and swirl to mix. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes.  Enzymes: Add a pinch of meat enderizer to the soup-mix and gently invert or swirl to mix. Alcohol: Slowly pour rubbing alcohol into soup mix, down the side so that it forms a layer on top of the pea mixture. Pour until you have about the same           amount of alcohol in the tube as pea mixture. Alcohol is less dense than water, so it floats on top. Look for  clumps of white stringy stuff where the water and alcohol layers meet. This is your DNA. See if you can carefully extract the DNA from the mix with a small rod, like a pipette tip, metal wire, or glass stir rod. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I don't know the limitations of the school but Sodium is sure to catch students attention. I remember one time in intermediate school a teacher did an experiment during bus dismissal which was a Sodium experiment. They took a beaker of water and placed a small brick of Na in it. This took place under ventilation and a blast sheild. Of course the teacher used about seven times the safe amount of Na. It was cool to see it catch fire and dance on the top and then the whole beaker blew up. In smaller quantities the Na will ball up and skid across the water sometimes igniting the Hydrogen coming off of that which the students im sure would like to see. There are plenti of videos on the Internet that will show this that can give a much better quantity of Na to use without risk to students. ",
