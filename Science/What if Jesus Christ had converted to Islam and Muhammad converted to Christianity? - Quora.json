            "answer_text": "Jesus May Peace be upon him said in John 14:27 \u201cI leave you peace, I give you my peace.\u201d Literal meaning of Islam is to enter into peace. Islam means peace. All Prophets of God preached one religion that is religion of Peace. Prophet Jesus MPUH, had the same religion as Prophet Muhammad MPUH. So need to convert from one to another never arose as they both belonged to the same religion. All true Muslims believe this and respect Prophet Jesus as much as Prophet Muhammad. They are expressly prohibited from discriminating between Prophets. Muslims have same respect for All other Prophet Moses, Prophet Noah, Prophet Job (Ayub), Prophet Abraham, Prophet Isaac, Prophet Ishmael, Prophet Jacob (Israel), Prophet Joseph (May Peace Be Upon Them). Some prophets came long before Christianity and Judaism. They all followed the same religion. That is why Prophet Jesus said in Mathew 5:17 \u201cDo not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came not to destroy but to fulfill.\u201d All prophets came not to destroy but to fulfill the Law of Peace given to Humanity through all prophets by one Almighty God. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus would not convert to Islam as Jesus is God. Muhammad would not convert to Christianity, as from the Qur\u2019an, you can tell that he has something against Christianity. He rejects Jesus\u2019s divinity, and has the polar opposite definition to the Christian anti-Christ. I cannot understand the full depth of it. But so far, I have the feeling that Muhammad did not actually fear Jesus. I think Muhammad was actually athiest, who wanted to use Christianity and Judaism to make himself a king? I say this because Muhammad goes against Deuteronomy 17:17, which explicitly tells that kings must marry once. And Muhammad married 13 times? There are many laws he has broken, including the non-violence one. And he re introduced the no-pork law, when it was abolished. I do not understand why. Muhammad also made a serious threat against a Christian tribe. I personally believe Muhammad did this because Muhammad was actually atheist. But it is up to you to decide. ",
