            "answer_text": "The main difference can be derived from their own name.  Intramolecular forces appear inside the molecule, they are the ones that bind atoms together to form a molecule. Covalent bonds are an example of intramolecular force. They are really energetic (that\u00b4s the reason why molecules are stable). Dissociation energy for covalent bonds can get up to 260 kcal/mol. Intermolecular forces are responsible for repulsion or attraction between close molecules. They act in many ways, depending on the kind of molecules involved. An example could by hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are formed between hydrogen atoms in a molecule and high electronegative atoms from other molecules (such as O, F or N). They grant compounds certain properties. In the particular case of water, hydrogen bonds are responsible for its (relatively) high melting point. In general, intermolecular forces are weaker than intermolecular ones (its strength can vary from a few cal/mol up to 35 kcal/mol).  ",

            "answer_text": "Intermolecular forces are those forces which are in between the molecules like for ex. if we consider Ethyl Alcohol . In that every -OH part make hydrogen bond to another E.A\u2019s molecule\u2019s -OH part this is Intermolecular. Intramolecular forces are those forces which are in same molecule mean if two parts of a single molecule make a force to each other then we call it Intramolecular force for ex ortho amino phinol. In that amino(-NH2) part and -OH part has an attraction(hydrogen bond) this is called Intramolecular force. ",
