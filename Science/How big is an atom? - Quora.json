            "answer_text": "Instead of traditional methods of visualizing the concept of size, I will start from the small end of the scale and work up.  This may seem confusing at first, considering that these sizes are too small to conceptualize immediately, but bear with me. First, we will equate an atom with a penny, the smallest denomination of currency in the U.S., worth merely 1/100th of a U.S. dollar.   Assuming we live in the U.S., we cannot buy much with this one penny.  Perhaps on eBay we can order an item for 0.01$, but we will still have to pay a hefty sum for shipping.   To spend our penny, we will fly across the world to India and take a trip to a poor suburb named the Dharvi Slum in Mumbai.  Consider a bag of cherries,which is on sale on the street of this suburb.  We see the price reads 65 rupees and we notice that the bag contains approximately 100 Cherries.  We run a quick conversion and notice that 65 rupees ~ 0.995 USD, around a dollar. Completing the calculation, we note that  (1 dollar/ 100 cherries)*(100 cents/ 1 dollar) = 1 cent/cherry Thus, we can get a cherry for our penny if we can figure out a means to travel to India to spend it.  A cherry probably won't satisfy your hunger for very long, but will give you 3-4 calories which you can use to perform a push-up or stay awake for 10 minutes without losing weight. Now, we will take our hydrogen atom and duplicate it.  Then, we spot a nearby atom.  However, this atom is attached to a duplicate of itself and is enormous compared to ours.  In fact, the new atom we spot is 16 times more massive than ours.  The atom we spot is an oxygen atom, with 8 protons instead of our single proton.  We share our electrons with one of these atoms and form a polar covalent molecule H2O, which we call water.    Our new molecule is 18 times more valuable than our penny, having a value of 0.18$.  This time, when we visit India we head over to a restaurant in New Dehli.  This time we spot a samosa on sale for 12 rupees and decide to take up the offer with our 0.18$. The samosa satisfies our hunger during lunchtime and can provide us with enough energy to run a mile or swim a 400m race.   To the avid chemistry student reading this, maybe you have already done a conversion to grams from our penny and noticed that the amount of money required to make a mole of hydrogen is still quite challenging to conceptualize.  Considering this, I will make some substitutions very soon. Picking up the pace, we will take many atoms of different sizes and properties in a sea of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and many more.  We will let biology take its course forming bonds to make proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.   While we are flying by the different sizes and values that we are achieving, we note some values that we surpass.  At this point, imagine our $0.18 is in a booming stock that is growing exponentially.  We notice that when we have a phospholipid it is worth $1.80, which could buy us a burger or a soda in even an urban area of the U.S..  Our stock continues to grow until we have a Mimivirus worth of money, around $288.  With $288, we could afford maybe a used XBOX, or a new pair of Lebron XI shoes. ",

An atom is the basic building block of all matter. They join to form molecules which in turn form most all of the objects around you. The scientific name for water is H2O. This molecule is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Inside an atom are protons (with a positive electrical charge) and electrons (with a negative electrical charges) and neurons (with no electrical charge at all). The protons and neurons cluster close to the nucleus (the center of the atom). The electrons orbit (for lack of a better word) around the nucleus. ",

However, with more Atomic Number (more protons), the outermost electron subshell important for #2b, 2c, 2d, obviously gets build over more layers, so the outermost radius gets bigger (even if the average stays the same) until it reaches about 1.4\u00d710^\u221210 meters (2.8x Bohr) where the shell seems big enough that even the outermost have same radius. 4 Bonding which is what determines density varies by the electron configuration, but you can think 1.6\u00d710^\u221210 to 2.2x10^-10 meters (3 to 4x Bohr).

            "answer_text": "Let us begin by saying anything we know about the atom today might be changed tomorrow. Science is constantly learning new things about the atom as more atom-smashing machines are built. Oddly enough, the word \u201catom\u201d comes from the Greek and means \u201cnot divisible.\u201d The ancient Greeks thought an atom to be the smallest possible particle of any substance.  Yet today we have found more than 20 different particles in the core of the atom! We know the atom is made of electrons, protons, neutrons, positrons, muons, neutrinos, mesons, and hyperons. Electrons are particles that carry a tiny negative charge of electricity. The proton, about 1,836 times as heavy as the electron, carries a positive charge of electricity. The neutron, still heavier, carries no electric charge at all. The positron, about the size of the electron, carries a positive charge. The neutrino, about one two thousandth the size of the electron, has no charge. Mesons may be either positively or negatively charged. Hyperons are larger than protons. How all these particles or charges are held together to make up the atom is still not known to us. But these atoms make up the elements and they differ from each other. One way they differ is by weight, and thus elements are classified according to atomic weights. For example, hydrogen is \"1\" on this table and iron is \"55.\" This means that an atom of iron is 55 times as heavy as an atom of hydrogen. But these weights are very small. A single atom of hydrogen only weighs about one million-million-million-millionth of a gram! To give you another idea of how small atoms are, let's see how many atoms there would be in one gram of hydrogen. The answer is about 6 followed by 23 zeros. If you started to count them and counted one atom per second, it would take you ten thousand million million years to count all the atoms in just one gram of hydrogen! Theoreticals ",

The radii of atoms are therefore determined by the bonds they form. An atom will have different radii depending on the bond it forms; so there is no fixed radius of an atom.
