            "answer_text": "We currently do not yet know if neutrinos are Majorana (the anti-neutrino is the same as the neutrino) or Dirac (the anti-neutrino is different than a neutrino). Both possibilities are allowed by current particle physics theories, however I believe the prejudice in the particle physics community is for Majorana, but there is no firm evidence yet either way.  The only feasible experiment that could determine which kind of neutrino we have is the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay for a radioactive nucleus. If neutrinoless double-beta decay is ever detected it will prove neutrinos are Majorana. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay#Neutrinoless_double-beta_decay for more details.  Experiments looking for neutrinoless double beta decay are under way at higher and higher levels of sensitivity.  It will be a relatively rare event and the difficulty is distinguishing it from competing backgrounds where very low energy neutrinos are also emitted in the decay ",
