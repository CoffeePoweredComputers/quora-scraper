            "answer_text": "It can be shown that benzene is 36-38kcal more stable than the hypothetical molecule 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene on the basis of the differences between experimental heats of combustion, or hydrogenation, and heats calculated from bond energies. We call this energy difference the stabilization energy (SE) of benzene. We have associated most of this energy difference with \u03c0-electron delocalization, which is the delocalization energy (DE). The difference between SE and DE will be small only if our bond-energy tables are reliable and steric and strain effects are small. The problem with bond energies is that we use bond energies that neglect changes in bond strength caused by the environment. Primary, secondary, tertiary, alkenic, and alkynic CH bonds are assumed to have equal energies; C\u2212C single bonds are assumed to be equal, regardless of whether the other bonds to the carbon atoms in question are single or multiple; and differences in energy between double bonds that are mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra-substituted are neglected, as are changes in bond energies associated with steric strain. Bond energies are strictly applicable to molecules in which the bonds are of the normal lengths. In the case of benzene, which has C\u2212C bonds with lengths intermediate between normal single and double bonds, there seems to be no clear agreement as to how to take the bond distances into account in computing the delocalization energy. In spite of these uncertainties, the stabilization energies seem to give a good qualitative idea of the importance of electron delocalization in organic molecules. see details in- ref.-https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Basic_Principles_of_Organic_Chemistry_(Roberts_and_Caserio)/21%3A_Resonance_and_Molecular_Orbital_Methods/21.07%3A_More_on_Stabilization_Energies ",

            "answer_text": "Bond stabilization energy can be defined as the difference between real value of energy required and the interpolated value of energy. Whenever a bond is formed, it either releases or absorbs energy to stabilise the compound. This energy is most commonly in the form of heat energy. Thus we say that the chemical bond has \u201cconsumed\u201d the energy difference to stabilise the molecule as a whole. Lower the overall energy of the molecule, higher the stability. It is mostly used for organic compounds and most importantly for electron delocalization in them. CHEERS! ",
