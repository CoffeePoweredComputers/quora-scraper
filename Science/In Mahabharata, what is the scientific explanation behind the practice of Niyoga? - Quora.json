            "answer_text": "Niyoga was an ancient Hindu tradition, in which a woman would request and appoint a man for helping her bear a child. According to this Hindu tradition, the man who was appointed must be or would most likely be a revered person.The child born so cannot claim to be the successor of that man. Two methods followed in Mahabharata. Adhana was used by Ved vyasa. Mahabharata contains the first reported documentation of this endocrine phenomenon generated by Pheromones/the Gonado-Cerebral Axis Pandu remained mentally upset, as he could not procreate.The Mahabharata and reproductive endocrinology Assisted Reproductive technology stands for encourage a literary \u201cforensic endocrine\u201d analysis of events relevant to our specialty. Curse of Sage on Pandu could be seen as a Subarachnoid hemorrhage, a ruptured cerebral aneurysm or a ruptured aortic aneurysm come to mind immediately. The epic describes Gandhari as having a prolonged gestation, is comparable with Pseudocyesis. Gandhari's gestation is a scientific feat that future researchers may be able to achieve. In vitro fertilization (IVF)encourage a literary \u201cforensic endocrine\u201d analysis of events relevant to our specialty. is followed in the modern world that avoids a natural intercourse. Sage Durvava initiated her into a unique mantra to initiate parthogenesis, leaves a discripancy that the child can clone the mother only, to have and a male progeny is a scientific impossibility and unless succeed in converting one of the pairs of X chromosome by genetic manipulation cannot be established. Whereas, Jarasandha born as a result of eating a divine mango (suggesting the administration of an oral agent for induction of ovulation) shared by two queens gave birth to two still born half child that was discarded in garbage. (Why the three queens of Dasaratha who shared by cutting into 4 portions did not have 4 quarter children is another paradox, perhaps seeds are many, but none of Jarasandha's mother's ate any mango seed). Demoness Jara joined them that the body fused together and the child cried. Frightened Jara ran away without eating the child. The child got named as Jarasandha ( joined by Jara) grew up to be strong, but harsh, king, who remained undefeated until Bhima tore his body into two halves and threw them in opposing directions. Concept of DNA mapping was unknown even in the 20th century. Paternity was rejected on the basis of mismatch of blood group. Stories that the couple's were A+, and O negative.whereas the child having AB+ was the only objectionable and not affermative condition of claim as heir. Parthogenesis is reproduction without either meosis or fertilization, somewhat like cloning. That means the baby is genotypically a girl (Even the authors are confused). The difference that apoptosis of life stops in cloning at lifespan of the mother. Each telophase fragments a bit of DNA, and a stage reaches it no more can divide. Some of the stem cells converted to vegetative cells (like we keep concentrated solution and working solution, (denaturation being linear, the stock solution undergoes degraduation of 1% when working solution lose 50% activity) Whereas, Repeated sequences (also known as repetitive elements, repeating units or repeats) are patterns of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome. Genome is protected from telomerase fragmentation similar to a Quantum processor (2-3 errors does not exhibit the genotypical abbrations. If you have MS Microsoft Office FrontPage you select html and find grey typed and gray. Green becomes deeper when you type Greeeen, like goooooogle). ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of lies spread around by twisting the meaning of Niyoga by Anti-Hindus. Niyoga is rarely practiced these days and is only a thing of the past but it is important to know the correct meaning of the term regardless. Niyoga used to be an ancient tradition, in which a woman (whose husband is either incapable of fatherhood or has died without having a child) would request and appoint a man for helping her bear a child. That person should be a revered person. The Mahabharata actually describes only one instance of niyoga. Queen Satyavati compels her son, sage Vyasa to perform niyoga with both the widows of her son Vichitravirya. The widows, Ambika and Ambalika and one of their maids, bear Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, respectively. Right at the beginning of the Creation, Ishwar had given the Vedas to the Rishis for the guidance of human beings to lead a life of righteousness. Along with the understanding of life and desire to have children was the knowledge of providing stability of social order. Human beings stabilized process of procreation by formalizing the social institution of Vivah or marriage to bring in order and discipline through sublimation of sex. The Vedic injunction against sex for pleasure by allowing copulation between lawfully wedded husband and wife at an appropriate time only to beget children continues to hold in check humans running amuck for wild sex. Many a time varied reasons like death and disease cause separation between the husband and wife at a young age when they are childless, so what is the way out to enable the separated man or woman to fulfill the religious duty of leaving behind a son or a daughter, so that the human race not only survives but prospers. When a widow wishes to have children after the demise of her husband, she lets the social order know of her desire and selection of a male member for copulation as per Vedic Vidhan to beget a child, it is termed as Niyog. In the case of Niyog \u201c the widowed woman remains in the house of the deceased husband\u2026..children born of Niyog are not called children of the begetter, nor belong to his family, nor has he any claim over the children.\u201d This excerpt is from the Satyarth Prakash chapter four written by Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati in Hindi and translated into English. In this context it is important to make clear the claim of the child born of Niyog on the property of the man who begot him or her. A child begotten in Niyog will continue the lineage of the deceased husband of the widow and get a share in the property of the deceased husband of the widow concerned and live in her marital home. Thus one may say that a child begotten in Niyog has no legal share in the property of the man whose sperm fertilized the egg of his mother to bring him into this world. Similarly, the begetter of the baby in Niyog will never ever lay a claim of any kind at birth or thereafter. In the eye of law, no relationship moral, spiritual or financial will exist between the begetter and the baby. It is important to remember that.. Niyog is not a sin nor an adulterous act. Niyog is willful and consensual act of sex between a man and a woman with the sole intent of begetting a baby and it is done within the knowledge of the social order that the two belong to. It is not a hush-hush affair done for fun at night under the cover of darkness. The common point between a lawful marriage and a Niyog is : Both are made known to the social order that the man and the woman belong to. You may ask, what happens if the first attempt to impregnate a woman fails? Well, there is no embargo on making a second or a third attempt. One should remember that the declared desired intention of the man and the woman concerned is to have a baby and everyone in the neighbourhood knows about it. So, Niyog is consensual and moral at the same time, because it is not done under the cover of darkness or in secrecy. On the other hand, adultery is a nocturnal affair where sex is performed for fun away from the prying eyes of the social or moral police. ",
