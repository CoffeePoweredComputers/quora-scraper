            "answer_text": "Chlorine is more stronger oxidizing agent as compared to iodide. Hence, it oxidizes iodide ions to iodine. During the reaction, colorless potassium iodide solution turns to black due to the presence of black iodine solid. Chemical reaction that takes place is as shown below: 2KI(aq) + Cl2(g)\u2014\u2014\u2014-]I2(s)(black solid) + 2KCl(aq) ",

            "answer_text": "The chlorine is more reactive than the iodine in potassium iodide. This causes the iodine to be displaced from the compound and chloride ions take its place instead. This has to do with the electrostatoc forces of attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons. These forces are stronger in chlorine because it has lesser electronic shells as compared to iodine which can be observed in the periodic table. Therefore, chlorine being the more reactive halogen will displace the iodine and form a solution of potassium chloride and iodine which turns the solution from colourless to dark purple(iodine's color) Hope this helped!
