            "answer_text": "Thanks to the magic of quora merges and question edits, this is now a completely different question worthy of a completely different answer\u2026 There are several interesting things we have to consider about this question. First off, there is no model called the Big Bang. The model is the Standard Cosmological Model. \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d was a term invented to ridicule the model. If you are thinking of something like a stick of dynamite, or even an atomic bomb, you completely mis-understand the model. The reason why \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d is an absurd name, is explosions destroy, they don\u2019t create. You don\u2019t don\u2019t take a pile of debris, set off an atomic bomb, and see a city form up out of the explosion. I bring this up, because fundamental to this is understanding the arrow of time. How things change in time. That is essential if you want to describe cause and effect. Now relativity considers the relationship between two events, one of two ways. Space-like and Time-like. Time-like, means essentially they are sequential. Say I have two events A, and B. If it is possible to for light or some other particle to have traveled from A to B to carry information, then we say A & B have a time like situation. This does not mean that A caused B, but it does mean than A could have caused B. If on the other hand, two events are very far apart and there is not enough time for light to travel from one event to another, then we say those events have a space-like separation. There is no way for A to cause B, or B to cause A. But they could both share a common cause\u2026 Now given that start of the universe the distance between everything was 0 or as close to 0 as quantum mechanics allows. And the time between all events was also 0, or as close to 0 as quantum mechanics allows, we have to separate events. The start of the universe can be considered just one event, and your question is what caused that. To look for he cause of an event, I need to look for a time-like separated event that light had time to reach it from. But our Standard Cosmological Model provides no \u201cbefore\u201d. All time-like events happen after. So the model completely fails in answering your question. That does not mean I can\u2019t answer your question anyway, but it means I have to speculate. (In other words guess.) For my speculation, I will look at something very similar to our universe, a black hole. There are two types of singularities described by general relativity. A black hole, and a white hole. A black hole destroys, and a white hole creates. Remember that atomic bomb I mention in the beginning. Boom, there is no city just ashes after the explosion. Before the explosion there was a city. So an atomic bomb destroys cities and turns cities into ashes. However, imagine I play he film backwards. In that case I would see a mushroom cloud come into a collection of ashes into a huge blast, that leaves behind a city. Likewise, if I play the film of a black hole forming in reverse, it creates a star from a spectacular implosion. A time reversed black hole, is a white hole. Now, do we know the direction of time flow in a black hole? Not really. As matter crosses the event horizon time briefly stops. The laws of thermal dynamics could continue on the other-side in reverse and still have a smooth continuous transition. No DRAMA\u2026 If time was reversed inside a black hole, can I still say what caused a black hole? Well for anything created from the singularity, no. Time began at that singularity. The residents inside that black hole would be just as clueless as we are. But from outside the black hole, I can confidently say the cause of the black hole was the collapse of a star. So it seems like from outside the universe, we could describe the universe as being caused by the collapse of a stellar object\u2026 Here is the problem though with this speculation. In order for the concept of outside the universe to make sense with this model, the universe needs to be finite. All evidence indicates the universe is probably infinite\u2026 There are ways around that infinite/finite problem. But they are all even more speculative than a time reversal. So all I can say is this speculation on cause is a guess, and not a fully self-consistent model. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean the question in the sense of, \"what prior events could have triggered it\", then as far as I know we have no idea and it's very possibly not a sensible question in the first place. The trouble is that the foundation of the Big Bang theory is Einstein's General Relativity and according to that theory, a stable, nonempty universe just isn't a viable solution to the equations. If you start with a universe with mass in it, it will tend to collapse in on itself. Trying to offset the effect of mass with pressure doesn't work because, counterintuitively, pressure contributes positively to the collapse. Trying to offset the effect of mass with a Cosmological constant that gives an overall expansionary tendency helps a bit but not enough \u2013 parts of the universe that are ever so slightly denser than allowed for by the cosmological constant will very quickly start to collapse and other areas will start to expand. The upshot is that since the universe seems to be expanding today it must always have been expanding, back to a singularity at a finite time some 13.82 billion years in the past, where, is extrapolating backwards, things like pressure, temperature, density etc were all infinite. Now that's a bit of an embarrassment \u2013 we\u2019re fully prepared to believe that they were extremely high, much more than a temperature of 10^12 kelvin say \u2013 but we don't literally believe that they were infinite. One possible interpretation is that time is simply finite in the past and that's all there is to it. Whenever there has been time, the Big Bang has been underway, and there has never been a different, non-expanding regime out of which it suddenly sprang. Asking what happened at moment zero is as misguided a question as asking what happened at the moment minus infinity in a steady-state universe. Of course, when we find an infinity in a set of equations it usually means that there\u2019s some physics we\u2019ve left out that averts the infinity by some very narrow margin. In this case we strongly suspect on general principles that we've left out important quantum effects. General relativity is non-quantum theory as far as time, space and gravity are concerned. Quantum effects are welcome to happen on the stage provided by general relativity but they don't apply to the stage itself. If quantum effects start to apply, then on general principles we\u2019d expect that to be around the Planck time after the notional beginning. However we have absolutely no idea what a quantum theory of time would look like. One guess is it might take the form of a Quantum foam , where instead of spacetime being most smooth, with only the occasional black hole or other topological defect, it was like a Swiss cheese, with more defects than substance. And \"before\" and \u201ccause\u201d probably don't have much meaning in such a context, so again the question is very possibly unanswerable. ",
