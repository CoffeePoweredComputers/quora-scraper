            "answer_text": "The others haven't actually answered your real question -- what primary properties of a material give it an index of refraction. I'm going to answer this from a more interesting perspective, hopefully the perspective you intended. I'm going to start by describing the polarization vector.  This applies to both electric fields and magnetic fields, but keep in mind that as of yet there are no magnetic charges, but there are magnetic dipoles that are magnetic equivalents to electric dipoles. Take a point-object that is charge neutral and not charge separated (that is, it doesn't have any electric fields coming from it at all).  Now place an electric field on it and if is polarizable then it will have an induced dipole moment when you apply an electric field to it -- that is, if it is composed of charges (and everything is), then the applied electric field will pull the charges apart.  This induced dipole may not look exactly like 2 charges being pulled apart, but the fields generated by the charge separation will appear the same as if it were truly two charges being pulled apart. Mathematically, we can define a dipole moment, which is the charge times the separation, or p = q*d a vector in the direction of the separation. Furthermore, for relatively small applied electric fields, the induced dipole moment will be nearly directly proportional to the strength of the applied electric field, so we have p = \u03b1*E, where \u03b1 is the polarizability of the particle.  The greater the polarizability, the stronger the induced dipole for a given electric field. On a macro level, what happens if we have a whole bunch of electric dipoles through a material?? Then we define a macro-quantity of polarizability called susceptibility, often denoted as \u1d61 (greek letter chi).  In small densities (that is, the dipoles are far enough apart that the local fields from the dipoles don't interact with other dipoles), the susceptibility increases exactly with the density, or  \u1d61 = N\u03b1. We define a macro polarization vector P = \u1d61E, which is the sum of all the micro polarization vectors p.  Next, we define the electric displacement vector D = \u03b50*E + P, where \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space.  To make matters simpler, we define D = \u03b5E, where \u03b5 is the permittivity of the substance, found from the electric susceptibility, combining the previous two formulas to get \u03b5 = \u03b50 * (1 + \u1d61) But when they get close enough to start interacting, it becomes dependent on the arrangement of the dipoles. To get it into a macro factor susceptibility, one must take the response of induced electric fields and average them over the material.  In a crystal arranged periodically, the average is taken over the unit cell.  Since each induced dipole has its own electric field pattern, if another dipole is close enough then the induced field will add more field to induce a stronger dipole moment in the nearby dipoles, making the total susceptibility more than just the polarizability and the density.  This depends on how the dipoles are arranged. For a cubic lattice, it is fairly easy to solve, and the result is the classic Clausius-Mossotti homogenization formula:   where N is the density of the dipoles,, d is the the density, epsilon_ro is the macro electric permittivity, and alpha is the polarizability of the molecule.  The equation is meant to be solved for epsilon_ro, which can be done in closed form, but this form is much easier to write it in.  This formula is valid for a material with cubic order, but not for non-cubic materials. There is a similar formulation for magnetic permeability, using \u03bc instead of \u03b5 and some other small differences but with the same concept. There is a time response of polarizability, which leads to dispersion (having a different index of refraction at different frequencies, or having an RF permittivity different from an optical permittivity).  In addition, larger particles significantly smaller than the wavelength of an incoming electromagnetic wave can also be characterized as dipoles and can be used in the Clausius-Mossotti formula to create a synthetic permittivity and permeability, which is where metamaterials come from. As for refractive index, the others have covered it quite well -- the refractive index is   (I won't derive the wave equation for the explanation of that formula). ",

            "answer_text": "The refractive index is measured as the change of velocity of light through water and the sample, the electrical permitivity of the material and the magnetical permeability of the material define this differences. When photons go through a media they will interact with its particles doing electromagnetic energy exchange, when the source of light is white, (with the complete spectra) the interaction will appear in several ways, infrared will make molecules stretch and spin (especially if high angular momentum is present), ultraviolet frequencies will promote electrons to travel up to higher orbits (absorption of radiation) and then return (emission), other frequencies in the middle will interact giving extra kinetic energy in a randomly form of intermolecular action (coming and going equivalent to Brownian movement). It is the net result of all these interactions that establishes \u201chow much is light slowed down\u201d, but polarity of the material, its net dipolar moment, the orbital delocalization of electrons into possible orbits of high energy (non and anti-bonding) will guarantee absorption of radiation and its emission, at those higher orbits electrons can interact with orbitals of neighboring molecules causing interconversion and this is particularly delays the return of electrons and retards even more the passage of light. But all these are only ways to understand and explain with detail the electrical permitivity and magnetic permeability, one thing must be put to clear and that is that although the index of refraction has proven to be a linear combination (colligative property) of all the above phenomena, more information has been gathered when each of these are studied individually and tested independently.
