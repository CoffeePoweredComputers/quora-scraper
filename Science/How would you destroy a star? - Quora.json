            "answer_text": "Four ways. Runs out of fuel that sustains the nuclear fusion in its core, causing it to explode as a Type II supernova if the star has more than 8 solar masses, leaving behind either a neutron star or a black hole.If less than 8 solar masses, the star becomes a white dwarf which will continue to shine but not burn for billions of years more until it cools down and becomes a black dwarf.If the star becomes a white dwarf in a close binary system, i.e., orbiting closely with another star around a common center of gravity and the second star becomes a red giant later, the white dwarf will draw away the gas from the second star and it will build up on the white dwarf\u2019s surface. Once the accumulated gas causes the white dwarf\u2019s mass to reach 1.44 solar mass, aka the Chandrasekhar limit, the white dwarf will explode as a Type 1a supernova, destroying it completely.The star gets too close to a neutron star or a black hole, causing it to break apart and fall into it.",

            "answer_text": "It would be impossible to destroy a star. Stars are pretty much one of the most powerful (and most invincible) objects in the universe. Things don\u2019t destroy a star. A star destroys itself, that\u2019s how hardcore they are. They\u2019re born, they live and they die all on their terms. There is only one thing that can destroy a star and that\u2019s a black hole. Black holes themselves are the only objects more powerful than a star, both in terms of gravitational pull and ability to withstand punishment from other objects. To a human, both of these things are invincible. The star destroys you, not the other way around. ",
