            "answer_text": "Monatomic helium gas is closer to an ideal gas than either of the others, for two reasons. 1. It has the smallest particles, so the volume of the particles are the smallest compared to the volume of the gas. 2. It has the smallest forces between particles, because the electrons in the atoms are all in very stable orbitals. It only has 2 electrons, tightly bound in the spherically symmetric 1s orbital, with opposite spin. A lot of energy would be needed to disturb these electrons. H gas is also nearly ideal, but it has larger particles, and they do exert small attractive Van der Waal\u2019s forces on each other, as do all molecules. This occurs when one molecule becomes slightly polarised, due to the random behaviour of the electrons in its bonding orbital, which can then induce the polarization of nearby molecules, producing small forces of electrostatic attraction. Both of these effects make hydrogen gas depart from ideal gas behaviour, but only to a small extent. Methane gas has relatively large molecules, and the intermolecular forces are much larger than in hydrogen gas. This is because the C - H bonds have some ionic character, because carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the C atoms will carry small negative charge, and this is balanced by the smaller positive charge on each H atom. This produces quite large electrostatic forces of attraction and repulsion between molecules, depending on their distance apart and upon their relative orientation. Methane, at room temperature, is also closer to its boiling point, than He or H2, and gases, generally, approach ideal gas behaviour as their temperature becomes further and further away from their boiling points. Ethane is very far from being an ideal gas. It suffers from the same adverse properties as methane, only more so. It's very close to its boiling point, it has very large molecules, and the intermolecular forces are also large. This is why it will condense so easily, with only a small drop in temperature or a small increase in pressure, compared with the other three. ",

            "answer_text": "A measure of how well a real gas approximates ideal behaviour is given by its critical temperature: the lowest that temperature, the closer the gas to ideal behaviour. An ideal gas, could it exist, would never condense, however low the temperature may be. Actually, the critical temperature gives an account of how difficult is to condense a given gas to liquid, or how weak are the bonds among the molecules in the corresponding liquid, and how easy it is for the thermal agitation to overcome and break those bonds. So, helium is the gas that best approaches the ideal behaviour, its critical temperature (about 5 K, that is -268 \u00b0C) being the lowest, not only among the four gases in the list, but among all the substances.
