            "answer_text": "According to me, the most amazing fact about black holes is the possibility of existence of such objects. Even Einstein who developed the theory of relativity whose equations resulted in strange objects which can bend space on itself, possess infinite gravity and affect the fabric of time itself refused to believe it could exist in reality. Here is an interesting story about the origin and evolution of the concept of black holes: The term black hole was coined in 1967 by the American physicist John Wheeler. Dr. Stephen Hawking, a genius and a greatest theoretical physicist of the present time calls this naming as a stroke of genius which stimulated scientific research by providing a definite name for something that previously had not had a satisfactory title. He says not to underestimate the importance of a good name in science. The first person to discuss black holes was a Cambridge man, John Michell who wrote a paper about them in 1783. His idea was: \u201cSuppose you fire a cannon-ball vertically upwards from the surface of the earth. As it goes up, it will be slowed down by the effect of gravity. Eventually, it will stop going up and will fall back to earth. If it started with more than a certain critical speed, however, it would never stop rising and fall back but would continue to move away. This critical speed is called the escape velocity. It is about 7 miles a second for the earth, and about 100 miles a second for the sun. Both of these velocities are greater than the speed of a real cannon-ball, but they are much smaller than the velocity of light, which is 186,000 miles a second. This means that gravity doesn\u2019t have much effect on light; light can escape without difficulty from the earth or the sun. However, Michell reasoned that it would be possible to have a star that was sufficiently massive and sufficiently small in size that its escape velocity would be greater than the velocity of light. We would not be able to see such a star because light from its surface would not reach us; it would be dragged back by the star\u2019s gravitational field. However, we might be able to detect the presence of the star by the effect that its gravitational field would have on nearby matter\u201d. Hawking who has spent most of his life working on black holes remembers this incident at one of his lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in April 1988: \u201cIn 1967, Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish at Cambridge discovered objects called pulsars that were emitting regular pulses of radio waves. At first, they wondered whether they had made contact with an alien civilization; indeed, I remember that the seminar room in which they announced their discovery was decorated with figures of \u2018little green men\u2019. In the end, however, they and everyone else came to the less romantic conclusion that these objects were rotating neutron stars. This was bad news for writers of space westerns but good news for the small number of us who believed in black holes at that time. If stars could shrink to as small as 10 or 20 miles across to become neutron stars, one might expect that other stars could shrink even further to become black holes\u201d. If you\u2019re looking for a beautiful picture of a black hole like the one shown in Interstellar like this:  Let me show you some original pictures of a black hole as captured by today\u2019s technological capabilities:   To date, galactic centers observed to have bulges, appear to host supermassive black holes which are of the order of up to billions of solar masses.  This Hubble Space Telescope image zooms into the galaxy center to reveal what appears to be a doughnut-shaped cloud around a bright core (an active black hole).

            "answer_text": "We and Black holes miss you Stephen Hawking.   Black Holes are the only objects in the Universe that can trap light by sheer gravitational force. Scientists believe they are formed when the corpse of a massive star collapses in on itself, becoming so dense that it warps the fabric of space and time. And any matter that crosses their event horizons, also known as the point of no return, spirals helplessly toward an unknown fate. Despite decades of research, these monstrous cosmological phenomena remain shrouded in mystery. They're still blowing the minds of scientists who study them. Here are 10 reasons why: 1  Black holes do not suck.  Some think that black holes are like cosmic vacuums that suck in the space around them when, in fact, black holes are like any other object in space, albeit with a very strong gravitational field. If you replaced the Sun with a Black holes of equal mass, Earth would not get sucked in \u2013 it would continue orbiting the black hole as it orbits the Sun, today. Black holes look like they're sucking in matter from all around, but that's a common misconception. Companion stars shed some of their mass in the form of stellar wind, and the material in that wind then falls into the grip of its hungry neighbour, a black hole. 2 Einstein didn't discover black holes.  Carl Schwarzschild was the first to use Einstein's theory of general relativity to predict the point of no return for a black hole. Einstein didn't discover the existence of black holes \u2013 though his theory of relativity does predict their formation. Instead, Karl Schwarzschild was the first to use Einstein's revolutionary equations and show that black holes could indeed form. He accomplished this the same year that Einstein released his theory of Genral Relativity in 1915. From Schwarzschild's work came a term called the Schwarzschild radius, a measurement of how small you'd have to compress any object to create a black hole. Long before this, British polymath John Michell predicted the existence of 'dark stars' so massive or so compressed that they could possess gravitational pulls so strong not even light could escape; black holes didn't get their universal name until 1967. 3 Black holes will spaghettify you and everything else.  Black holes stretch anything that dares to come too close. Black holes have this incredible ability to literally stretch you into a long spaghetti-like strand. Appropriately, this phenomenon is called 'spaghettification'. The way it works has to do with how gravity behaves over distance. Right now, your feet are closer to the centre of Earth and are therefore more strongly attracted than your head. Under extreme gravity, say, near a black hole, that difference in attraction will actually start working against you. As your feet begin to get stretched by gravity's pull, they will become increasingly more attracted as they inch closer to the centre of the black hole. The closer they get, the faster they move. But the top half of your body is farther away and so is not moving toward the centre as fast. The result: spaghettification! 4 Black holes could spawn new universes.  We could be just one Universe in a vast multiverse. It might sound crazy that Black Holes could spawn new universe \u2013 especially since we're not sure other universes exist \u2013 but the theory behind this is an active field of research today. A very simplified version of how this works is that our Universe today, when you look at the numbers, has some extremely convenient conditions that came together to create life. If you tweaked these conditions by even a miniscule amount, then we wouldn't be here. The singularity at the centre of black holes breaks down the law of physics and could, in theory, change these conditions and spawn a new, slightly altered universe. 5 Black holes literally pull the space around them.  A type of embedding diagram that depicts general relativity's curvature of space. Picture space as a stretched rubber sheet with criss-crossing grid lines. When you place an object on the sheet, it sinks a little. The more massive an object you put on the sheet the deeper it sinks. This sinking effect distorts the grid lines so they are no longer straight, but curved. The deeper the well you make in space, the more space distorts and curves. And the deepest of wells are made by black holes. Black holes create such a deep well in space that nothing has enough energy to climb back out, not even light. 6 Black holes are the ultimate energy factories.  Black holes are highly efficient at generating energy. Black holes can generate energy more efficiently than our Sun. The way this works has to do with the disk of material that orbits around a black hole. The material that is nearest to the fringe of the event horizon on the inner edge of the disk will orbit much more quickly than material at the very outer edge of the disk. This is because the gravitational pull is stronger near the event horizon. Because the material is orbiting and moving so rapidly, it heats up to billions of degrees Fahrenheit, which has the ability to transform mass from the material into energy in a form called Black Body Radiation. To compare, nuclear fusion converts about 0.7 percent of mass into energy. The condition around a black hole converts 10 percent of mass into energy. That's a big difference! Scientists have even proposed that this kind of energy could be used to power Black Holes Starships of the future. 7 There is a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy.  Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, is more than four million times more massive than our Sun. Scientists believe there is be a supermassive black hole at the centre of nearly every galaxy \u2013 including our own. These black holes actually anchor galaxies, holding them together in the space. The black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A, is more than four million times more massive then our sun. Although the black hole, which is almost 30,000 light years away, is pretty dormant at the moment, scientists believe that 2 Million Years Ago it eruptedin an explosion that may have even been visible from Earth. 8  Black holes slow down time.  Time Slows Down as you reach the event horizon \u2013 the point of no return. To understand why, think back on the twin experiment that is often used to explain how time and space work together in Einstein's theory of general relativity: One twin stays on Earth while the other one zooms out into space at the speed of light, turns around, and returns home. The twin that travelled through space is significantly younger because the faster you move, the slower time passes for you. As you reach the event horizon, you are moving at such high speeds due to the strong gravitational force from the black hole, that time will slow down. 9 Black holes evaporate over time.  Black holes might not be bottomless pits after all. Some energy might be able to escape them. This surprising discovery was first predicted by Stephen Hawking in 1974. The phenomenon is called Hawking radiation, after the famous physicist. Hawking radiation disperses a black hole's mass into space and over time, and will actually do this until there is nothing left, essentially Killing the black hole. This is why Hawking radiation is also known as black hole evaporation. 10 Anything can become a black hole, in theory.  The only difference between a Black Hole and our Sun is that the centre of a black hole is made of extremely dense material, which gives the black hole a strong gravitational field. It's that gravitational field that can trap everything, including light, which is why we can't see black holes. You could theoretically turn anything into a black hole. If you shrunk our Sun down to a size of only 3.7 miles (6 km) across, for example, then you would have compressed all of the mass in our sun down to an incredibly small space, making it extremely dense and also making a black hole. You could apply the same theory to Earth or to your own body. But in reality, we only know of one way that can produce a black hole: the gravitational collapse of an extremely massive star that's 20 to 30 times more massive than our Sun. ",
