            "answer_text": "Firstly to find the pressure, begin by finding the Mr of methane and oxygen Mr is the relative molecular mass Mr of methane: The formula is - CH4 Mr = 12\u00d71 + 1\u00d74 = 12 + 4 = 16 Mr of oxygen: The formula is O2 ( 2 is in the subscript) Mr = 16\u00d72 = 32 So the ratio of the masses of methane : oxygen = 16 : 32 = 1 : 2 To calculate the force, we will need to multiply the mass with the gravitational field strength that is approximately 9.8N/kg but here both the molecules will experience the same field strength so we can ignore it. So the ratio of mass is CH4 : O2 = 1 : 2 Now as given in the question that the number of molecules are in the ratio methane : oxygen = 2 : 1 Then multiply the mass and number of molecules ratio For methane: = mass \u00d7 molecules = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2 For oxygen: = mass \u00d7 molecules = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2 Thus the pressure is in the ratio = methane : oxygen = 2 : 2 = 1 : 1 So as an extension to this thought, the pressure exerted by oxygen and methane will be equal. Therefore, oxygen exerts 1\u00f72 or 50% pressure ",

            "answer_text": "Using the ideal gas law, we assume that the pressure contributed by each gas is in the ratio to the number of moles of each gas constituent. Assuming also that you mean a 2:1 mass ratio rather than a molar ratio, we need to look at the respective molecular weights. Methane has MW of 16 (12 for the Carbon plus four at 1 each for the four Hydrogens). Oxygen has a molecular weight of 2 x 16 = 32. For convenience then, lets assume we have 64 grams of Methane (4 moles) and 32 grams of Oxygen (1 mole) for that 2:1 mass ratio. The total number of moles of all kinds in your vessel is 5. The oxygen is contributing only one of those five moles, ie 20% or one fifth. Consequently oxygen contributes one fifth of the total pressure. ",
