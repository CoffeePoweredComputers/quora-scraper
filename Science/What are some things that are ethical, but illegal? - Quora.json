            "answer_text": "I think this question substantially ignores the elephant in the room. Ethics are something which are imposed on an individual by the larger society of which they are a member. Morals are imposed by an individual upon themselves. Thus something can be ethical, but immoral; society imposing the death penalty on someone is often viewed as immoral by some individuals. Likewise, something can be unethical, but moral, such as shoplifting in order to feed a hungry child in immediate need. However. Laws represent a codification of the ethical system by society. It\u2019s the enforcement mechanism for maintaining ethical behaviour \u2014 according to the ethics of the larger society. The only time something is ethical, but illegal, is when you hold yourself to be a member of a subset of society whose ideas of ethical behavior differ from those of the larger society. And when you do that: you are in the wrong, ethically, according to the larger society. An extreme example of this includes the environmental zealots who spike trees, injuring or killing lumber workers in the process, in order to prevent logging. Another extreme example of this are the religious zealots who believe it\u2019s ethical, within their small society, to bomb abortion clinics. Neither of these things is ethical in the context of the larger society \u2014 the level at which laws are made and enforced \u2014 and therefore also illegal.  It is therefore perhaps more correct to state the opposite case: that there are things which are legal, but unethical. Or in other words, there are things for which \u201cthere ought to be a law\u201d.  The point is that laws tend to intrinsically come into line with ethics, and if you consider the question in that context, then you find that the only things which are ethical but illegal are those things for which the laws are now outdated, and should be removed. Typically such laws, such as sodomy or adultery laws \u2014 to give two examples \u2014 are not removed from the books, they are simply never enforced. ",

            "answer_text": "Euthanasia or Mercy killing, is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. It is used when the patient is seeing a living hell and it would be better to rest in peace than living such pains and conditions. Even it's name has two words, Mercy and Killing ,which defines the question in itself.. When we think about Euthanasia, many people can have many different opinions about it. It can be ethical, merciful as well as cruel and inhumane at the same time. Most of the people you'll ask about it will reply with dual opinions because that's one thing where we all hold dual opinions. For.eg: Let's assume you get into a life-threatening accident, and somehow survived. You didn't die but you are standing at the door of life and death. You can't do anything except breathing or feel unbearable pain,24\u00d77. And the doctor gave you the statement,\u201d Sorry!! we can't make your condition better than this\u201d. If I'll be at that place, I too will hold a dual opinion. On one hand, I'll want peace from this unbearable pain and suffering and go to sleep, and on the other hand, I'll want to live because no one wants to die. And that's the reason Euthanasia is ethical but illegal. Some countries give value to its ethical part and some countries recognise it's cruel part. Euthanasia isn't illegal in all countries. You can perform Mercy killing in certain countries but under certain conditions: Passive euthanasia (known as \"pulling the plug\") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia, however, is legal or de facto legal in only a handful of countries (for example Belgium, Canada, and Switzerland), which limit it to specific circumstances and require the approval of counselors and doctors or other specialists. In some countries - such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan - support for active euthanasia is almost non-existent. Even now I hold dual opinions about Euthanasia. How do you feel about it? Tell me in the comments. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. :) ",
