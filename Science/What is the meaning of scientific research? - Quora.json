            "answer_text": "I do. And so does each one of the million or so people who do active research in the hard sciences in their day jobs. One tangible guideline is a rather general one. That\u2019s the criteria for the organization of a scientific publication proposed by Roger Bacon. That proposal emphasizes the importance of the EXPERIMENTAL SECTION, which describes in detail the procedures for duplicating the work. Bacon\u2019s thesis is that anyone who performs these experiments successfully will immediately be convinced of conclusions made by the authors. Another high concept description of scientific research may involve the following considerations : investigating an area that has received very little scrutiny ; working on a problem that has been studied with only partial success ; figuring out what to do next when you don\u2019t know what to do next ; gathering fundamental information about a phenomenon ( or disease, or chemical, or a mineral, maybe a star, a physical effect , a strange experiment , or in fact anything else you need to know more about ) ; screening many different approaches to a problem ; discovering or inventing new analytical methods needed in the studies ; verifying the veracity of everything published about the phenomena ; getting input from others who have worked on these problems ; thinking, talking about, doing, reading literature related to the work ; defining the nature of what you really want to find ; designing reproducible experiments that illustrate a critical feature of the object of study ; and representing the phenomenon in graphic terms \u2014 detailed diagrams showing the mechanism of the phenomena. Low concept guidelines for scientific research are held by every sub-specialty you can name. These include the concrete considerations that are linked to the dogma of that sub-specialty, and the governing theorems. ",

If it does, publish paper. 5.) If it doesn\u2019t, modify theory., and repeat 3.) 6.) Still no success after umpteenth try? 7.) If you have any sense, you give up flogging a dead horse. ",
