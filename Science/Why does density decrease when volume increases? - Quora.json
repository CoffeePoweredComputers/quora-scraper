            "answer_text": "Well, look at the defining quotient for [math]\u03c1_{\\text{the density}}=\\dfrac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}}[/math] And thus when [math]\\text{volume}[/math] increases, the denominator becomes LARGER, and the quotient, which represents the density, is correspondingly REDUCED\u2026. We note that CONDENSED phases, i.e. solids, and liquids, have more or less constant densities, because these materials are largely incompressible. On the other hand, gases can have variable density, and a given volume of gas at a particular pressure contains a definite number of molecules, and thus a definite mass. And so if the volume to which the gas is confined is increased, necessarily, the density DECREASED proportionally\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "The formula for density is: p=m/V If mass (the amount of atoms in a substance) stays the same and volume (the space something occupies) increases, then density has to decrease. The opposite is if volume decreases while the mass stays the same, then the density has to increase. The best way to look at it is this: if you have a 1 meter cube filled with gas, it has a certain mass and volume. If you freeze the gas and it turns into a small amount of liquid or solid, it will occupy a smaller space in the cube, but the atoms in the gas are still the same. So, it has become denser. If you heat it up, it expands into the space of the cube and is less dense than being a liquid or solid. ",
