            "answer_text": "It's a good question, and I suspect you're asking it because you've been asked to write an essay on that question ;) But hey, it's still worth asking. I went down into town to see you, but when I got to your place, you had already left for work. Is that literature? You'd probably argue that it's not; it's just a fairly bland sentence. What if I do this though: I went down into townTo see youbut When I got toYour placeYou had already leftFor work Now you could easily call it poetry, just because its form has changed. So perhaps literature is about form/presentation, and form/presentation is what forces us to perceive the difference between literature and 'non-literature' (i.e. a novel compared to a newspaper, a poem compared to a note left on the kitchen counter, etc). Or you could argue that presenting something as a poem, a story or an essay puts the reader in a frame of mind which prompts them to interpret it and search for non-liminal message and meaning. You could say that literature is writing which is 'doing something' with the actual words themselves, rather than simply being used to convey information.  BUT who is to say that form is the only decider? If a newspaper article is an account of true facts, most people wouldn't call it literature; if it turned out that that newspaper article was entirely fictional, what would it be then? Would it count as a story? If it counts as a story, does that make it literature? And if that's our yard stick, does that make trashy novels or pornographic fanfic literature? Look at the journals of the 18th Century, the Tatler and the Spectator etc. Most of the writing in those journals was written to tell stories to the populace about how to navigate society; at the time, they were just magazines, but now they are treated as literature because of their social and writerly significance. And Robinson Crusoe was based on other true-life accounts of people lost at sea, most of which turned out to be fictional; does that make them literature in the same sense that RC is? Then you come to the question of whether there is a difference between 'literature' in the sense of any kind of text as according to the ideas above and 'literature' in the sense of texts which are canon, such as Shakespeare or Jonathan Swift. That's the kind of 'literature' which is studied as such in universities and colleges; generally not popular fiction or amateur poetry. So does that mean that what is perceived as 'literature' is to a degree dictated by the community which studies and curates it?  Essentially your question is not a question with an answer. It's a question which raises a lot of other really interesting questions about the nature of writing and reading in general and in different contexts. If you are writing an essay about it, get yourself a couple of literary theory samplers and read the foundational writing on the subject (Derrida, Sonntag & co); if you're just curious, why not read some of the texts which put the whole question at the forefront? Tristram Shandy, the old articles of The Spectator, The Wasteland, William Carlos Williams, et al. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "The question of What is literature? is one I constantly put to my students, because the answer is at the foundation of why we read. Make no mistake, reading anything is beneficial, and popular fiction is a step on the right ladder. And since I teach film as a University Instructor in the English Department of a major state university, please accept that the visual medium is no less capable of ascending to the rank of literature than the ink on paper medium. Literature is not a canon of approved texts. It is narrative art of sufficient texture, power, and complexity to lend itself to multiple readings and critical commentary by others. Years ago a student got me into a discussion on graphic novels. I was skeptical. He brought me a copy of Watchmen and said, \u201cYou're going to tell me this is the best comic book you ever read.\u201d A week later, I did. He smiled and said it was mine to keep, and we laughed because he was handing me back my constant insistence that literature must be read again and again. I have. It is actually easy to identify literature when you see it, if you truly look at it. Stand in front of an Edward Hopper or Winslow Homer painting and explore the world of its motion, color, tone, mood, and mystery. Read Hemingway's \u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" three times and realize the author\u2019s hero is the lion. Literature surprises readers with epiphanies and insights, like finding hidden figures in Dali's Persistence of Memory. Literature is found. Like Kate Chopin, a rather obscure Cajun author writing in 1890\u2032s New Orleans. When she died, whatever reputation she had died with her. But in the 1960s a literature professor wrote about The Awakening and The Story of an Hour and readers discovered the depth and nuance of her work. So: literature is stories whose meanings unfold as you live with them. You don't always know literature until you get into it. Literature isn't always obvious. But literature is the story that you keep coming back to; it is us, the us we see with a second look. Everything else is wallpaper. ",

            "answer_text": "Since Literary Theory relates to literature, how can I define literature? One might be forgiven for thinking that this is a straightforward question. Unfortunately, one would be wrong. Consider professors of literature. What would they give as a definition? After a lot of hemming and hawing, they would likely present such a wide variety of definitions, sub-definitions, arguments, counter-arguments and arcane phrases that the neophyte would surely be befuddled. I am no better than they are. In my defense I suggest that to define anything is always a lot more complex than one might think. And to define literature is especially cumbersome. I will begin by asking questions that may lead you to look at what you think is or is not literature in a new light. Can one equate a definition of literature with a function of literature? Does literature have a function, and if so what is it? Is literature meant to please? Or is it meant to instruct? Does literature need a reader to be literature? Most readers think of literature as words on a textual medium usually paper. Can literature exist without a physical medium? How can one distinguish between words taken at random from a phone book or a horse racing tout sheet from \"traditional\" literature? Could one justify using such words taken at random as a poem for example? Is an article from an encyclopedia literature? How about the lead article from a newspaper? Would that be literature? Despite the surface lack of seriousness of the preceding questions, they are not nitpicking issues. They are in fact quite serious. They collectively bring us back to a very basic pair of questions. What is literature? What is the function of literature? The reality is that these questions are interlocked. To look at one is to look at the other. One might begin by noting that literature often reflects life as the author sees it. This is called the mimetic view. Think of the author holding up literature as a mirror reflecting his vision of the intricacies of life. \"Mimetic\" means copy or duplicate. Another view is to think of literature's purpose. One purpose might be to teach or instruct the reader. This view is called didactic. A second purpose might be to delight or entertain. This view is called aesthetic. This debate over the mimetic, the didactic, and the aesthetic points of view has been ongoing for millennia and has not been definitively settled nor is it likely to be so. Complicating matters, theorists today have added a new wrinkle--the language of literature. By \"language\" such theorists eschew the mimetic, the didactic, and the aesthetic in favor of what they call the \"literariness\" of language. Their argument centers on the differences between the straightforward no-nonsense language of an encyclopedia article and the poetical language of metaphor, simile, personification, and the like. In their opinion, it is this \"poetic\" use of language that stamps literature as literature. Of course, one could argue (and one often does) that even an article from an encyclopedia might have touches of literariness; would these \"touches\" elevate a didactic article to the exalted status of literature? Take a note stuck on a refrigerator, for example: \"I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me. They were delicious, so sweet and so cold.\" Is this note literature? Now look at it with a few minor modifications in punctuation and line spacing: I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast Forgive me they were delicious so sweet and so cold This is a real poem by William Carlos Williams. Now it looks like a poem. The difference between the two is not the literariness of language but the appearance of poetic language. Literature seems to be some sort of melding of mimetic, didactic, aesthetic, and the literary use of language with physical appearance thrown in for good measure. Most readers have no problem with recognizing long texts as literature such as novels or plays. It is the shorter ones that prove troublesome. ",

You may get some differing answers.  I'm going to briefly unpack the nebulous usage \u201cthat better class of stuff people read.\u201d The basic idea is that it has to be better than that stuff the masses/children/stunted adults read, and is at least somewhat good for you in that eat-your-vegetables, I'm-reading-this-for-school way.  Class-ism and defining the world by your own level of understanding aside, is there a way to reduce this to a standard?  I've usually thought of this in terms of Malow's hierarchy of needs, as in,  what needs is the work fulfilling?  This is my chart of \u201cMaslow's hierarchy of 'Quality'\u201d  (note inner single quotemarks).    In my estimation, literature is fiction that somehow reaches upper middle brow, with additional up down \u201cstatus\u201d factors influencing the base level, such as: are there wizards (downvote), are there ray guns (downvote), is there no discernible genre (upvote), is it ostensibly written for kids (downvote if less than 50 years old), are the themes leftist (upvote), etc. Cynicism aside, real insight can bump stuff up the pyramid, but you kind of need to get to level 4 to play up to lit (but that may be my bar).

            "answer_text": "Merriam-Webster gives the following: \u201cWritings in prose or verse especially : writings having excellence of form or expression and expressing ideas of permanent or universal interest.\u201d The Encyclopedia Britannica gives a similar definition: \u201cLiterature, a body of written works. The name has traditionally been applied to those imaginative works of poetry and prose distinguished by the intentions of their authors and the perceived aesthetic excellence of their execution.\u201d I think the constant in the definition is usually going to be \u201cwritten,\u201d and it\u2019s usually going to try to get at some indeterminate level of seriousness or aesthetic importance. Personally, I use kind of a weird, etymologically-incorrect definition for literature as a subset of my definition of art. I\u2019d define literature as being the narrative side of a narrative-to-abstract spectrum of classification for art. Let\u2019s use a simple operational definition of art as a general category of forms in which purely aesthetic considerations are among the most important. Following from these two definitions, literature, in my understanding, is going to be any art which leans more to the narrative, representational side of the narrative-to-abstract spectrum, meaning (generally) written books and stories, plays, even film. Something like poetry would fall under this definition, but closer to the midpoint of that spectrum\u2014a word caries more literal, representational, one-to-one associations than would, say, a daub of paint or a music note, but formally poetry often tends to obfuscate or at least try to avoid literal, narrative meanings, so it falls more toward the midpoint. The more strongly and literally an art object uses words, then, the farther it falls toward the literary side of that spectrum. ",

Texts reflecting on wealth may qualify; invoices and contracts created in the pursuit of wealth, probably not. Texts dealing with relationships, philosophy, dreams, imagination, religion, all may qualify. Technical manuals, math textbooks, sales brochures, and product labels probably do not.Of all these, narrow the focus to any which have \"passed the test of time,\" that is, which have survived to the present day and have won the attention of their creator's fellow human beings, to whatever extent we wish to cast the net. A million others? A hundred? Both granularities are possible. Edgar Allen Poe's first book TAMERLANE AND OTHER POEMS, published in 1827, sold only a handful of copies before the rest were destroyed for taking up space. Only 12 of the first edition are known to exist today. But it was unquestionably literature from the first day it was published.What remains in our field of view is, broadly, literature. If you don't like it, go out and make some of your own! ",

During the period of Classical Antiquity, in the Greek and Roman literature reference works were created that would mark the subsequent literary production. Literature is divided into what are known as literary genres that are the classifications of literary works according to their content. The traditional classification of literary genres establishes three major types, which are Lyric, which includes the elegy, the hymn, the ode, the eclogue, the satire. It is characterized by being written in short verses. Epic or narrative that includes, among others, the epic, the songs of a deed, the story and the novel. Its content is narrated in long verses or prose. Dramatic are the plays, tragedy, comedy, farce. Sometimes other genres are included, such as oratory and didactics. ",

            "answer_text": "Beyond entertainment, literature is about human experience. It provides deeper glimpses into what often remains unseen in our daily lives. Many times I have had people recommend a book like Steppenwolf (Herman Hesse) to me. It reflects a deep reality that only few people will understand: hunter-gatherer minds living in a farmer society. Here is some a famous example from the literature that reflect the experience of hunter-gatherer minds: The Ugly Duckling: Hans Christian Anderson The ugly duckling represents the feeling of so many children with ADHD, ASD or gifted children who don\u2019t fit in. They often have feelings of inferiority or even worthlessness. Once grown up, these ugly ducklings often turn into beautiful swans: the kid with dyslexia and ADHD who becomes the founder of a multimillion business (Richard Branson), the nerdy Asperger\u2019s kid who comes up with the Theory of Relativity (Einstein) or Hans Christian Anderson himself. When the critic Georg Brandes questioned Andersen about whether he would write his autobiography, the poet claimed that it had already been written \u2014 \"The Ugly Duckling\". The very author who gave name to the Ugly Duckling Syndrome suffered from it himself. read more on my blog: Literature: The Human Experience ",

That is, to clarify, literature is that beautiful substance which arises from problems. Only, this wasn't my last conclusion. My next conclusion was that literature is bad poetry. That is, what literature can do, poetry can eventually do much better, and all good literature is eventually classified as poetry or discarded. Efficiency alone might save this thesis, since the average poem is shorter than the average novel. But I did not stop there. I decided, if literature is bad philosophy and the literature can be saved becomes good poems, then maybe literature is evidence of God! In this case, what we find in an average university's graduate school English program is not literature at all --- but something very interesting. So, I decided, literature has something to do with being very interesting (on a profound level, like raising censor vapors). If that was the case, then what could I do to find a decent, ideal theory of what literature means? I decided finally that literature is meaningful writing. That's all that it is.

It is the prideful Ahab on the Pequod seeking vengeance on the albino sperm whale, Moby Dick. It is Mister Darcy capturing the heart of Elizabeth Bennet. It is Stevens recalling Miss Kenton with a hint of nostalgia. It is Juliet on her balcony. Literature moves the world, or at least those who it reaches. It is clever, sometimes brutally honest, dramatic, existential, and sometimes playful. Above all, it has a lasting value that reaches readers many decades (and sometimes hundreds of years) after it is written. It seeps into the culture in many forms, whether it's a film adaptation of the book, or a graphic novel heavily influenced by the work itself. Literature lasts. ",

Literature with its genres though not definitely classified tells about human behaviour. It the ocean which has expression of experiences ( gone under or a detached one i.e. Factual or Fictitious). Literature is a realm where men learn the world. It gives a path to live. Either in aesthetic or moralistic manner. It has been argued that the literature in not viewed as a significant part of living this scientific world. But the succour and sustainance comes from the amount of reading one has done. Ability to argue and to upgrade it with instances is where literature helps. Not diverting literature is play of words weaved in with emotions and thought.

            "answer_text": "The exact definition of Literature varies according to its usage. I. When we refer to Literature, we are referring to the group of written artistic works made up of words. Most are written, but some are passed on by word of mouth. Literature usually means works of poetry and prose that are especially well written. There are five main forms of Literature: Poetry, Prose, Drama, Non-Fiction, and Media. They can also be put into groups through their language (English, Tamil), historical period (Sangam, Post Victorian, Colonial), origin (British, American), genre (Crime, Romance), and subject (Physics, Chemistry). The word literature comes from the Latin word \"learning, writing, grammar\". Most of the earliest works were epic poems. Epic poems are long stories or myths about adventures. Ramayana and Mahabharta, two Indian epics, are still read today. Odyssey and Iliad are two famous Greek poems by Homer. They were passed down through speaking and written down around the 8th century BC. Literature can also mean imaginative or creative writing, which is looked at for its artistic value. II. Commercial Literature refers to leaflets and other printed matter used to advertise products or give advice. ",

            "answer_text": "The beauty of Literature is in its depth which can not have a single meaning. From time to time its meaning has changed. A word related to literacy skill, knowledge of texts to the world words which is connected to every discipline form Philosophy to Sciences. It is not like universal laws which have one explanation . Its meaning can be - Literary texts \u2018represents the world\u2019.If this is the meaning then what about the surreal poems, novels and other texts which do not represent the real world. Literature tells a story which is not always trueWhat about essays and biographies ! Literature can move or entertain and convey messagesIf one does not get involve with the text will that become a bad literary text or a non literary text. When we try to explore meaning of the word, we can not find an exact meaning of the term as one layer of meaning can contradict other. When we see literature as a name of discipline (noun) we try to find its meaning objectively. But its true meaning can be found when we see it as a skill (literary skill). It is not a thing or subject; it is rather a skill which one acquire through reading texts. This skill can help one to develop the key life skills. Reference- Eaglestone, Robert.

            "answer_text": "In a broad sense, literature refers to a written work. As a course of study, the literature in English Literature is understood to mean works, novels, poetry, and plays of lasting, artistic merit originating in the English language. Those things are subjective and sometimes arguments ensue. Literary work also is considered to be character driven rather than plot driven so that mystery or suspense novels, for example, are considered genre fiction rather than literary. Even with those guidelines, a novel like \u201cRebecca\u201d by Daphne du Maurier is considered by many to be both a mystery and a literary work. In my own undergraduate studies, we went from Beowulf to Chaucer to Shakespeare to Steinbeck and on to modern works to follow the development of English literature, \u201cEnglish\u201d in this case referring to the language and not the country of origin. American works fall under the English Literature category in most cases although I had specific courses in American novels and plays as well. To sum up: literary work is character driven, has lasting artistic merit, and includes what I would call an elevation of language and concepts. Does that answer your question? ",

Anyone with the know-how of a language works, can wrtie something which brings about a change, in the society, a group of people, or a tradition. This writ piece is called a write-up or an article. When this article is given a particular form of rhyming, recursion, flow, and an expresion, it becomes poetry. Otherwise, if there is none of the above, but there is still some expression, like romanticism, socialism, philosophy, it becomes prose. When such contemporary pieces of poetry and prose are compiled into one, it called a literature. For example, there is the Mughal literature, Maurya literature, Chola literature, and many more in India. Or, there is the Victorian literature or Hellenic literature in Britain. To put it more in context, my answer here, is an article. The compilation of answers that you will see on your question's page will be your own little literature.

Even films count as literature in a way. But keep in mind that there is no one single definition of literature, everyone will have their own ideas and thought as to what classifies as literature. Poetry can also be viewed as a form of literature. There are many kinds of literature as well. I think this is a good question. Literature is thought to be a art. ",
