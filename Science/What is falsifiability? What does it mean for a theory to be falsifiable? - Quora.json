            "answer_text": "Falsifiability means that there\u2019s a way to prove it wrong. Falsifiability is a prerequisite for a theory to be a scientific theory. Without falsifiability, whatever it is you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t science.  Falsifiability, in the modern sense, was made popular in the 20th century by the philosopher Karl Popper. (And this is the last time I\u2019ll say something nice about a philosopher). Before Popper scientists tried to prove their theories right. But he pointed out the obvious problem. If you\u2019re trying to prove yourself right, you\u2019ll probably succeed. Much better to try and prove yourself wrong. You get better results that way. The popularity of Popper\u2019s philosophy means that every modern scientific theory has an out. Some way to prove that it is wrong. A scientific theory doesn\u2019t just predict what will happen, it predicts what won\u2019t happen.  For example our current understanding of how temperature works, says that 0 Kelvin is the lowest temperature possible. Temperature is a measure of how much kinetic energy matter has. At 0 Kelvin matter would have no kinetic energy at all. And you can\u2019t go below that. We\u2019ve never reached 0 Kelvin either. And not for lack of trying. But if you somehow produced a substance with a temperature of -1K, then something about our theory of temperature is wrong. The theory is falsifiable, and would then be falsified.  Now, you\u2019ve included \u201catheism\u201d in your tags, so let\u2019s talk about a theory that ISN\u2019T falsifiable. This lovely teapot. I propose, that somewhere between the Earth and the Moon there exists a teapot, floating peacefully in a Lagrange point. Prove me wrong. And the trick is you can\u2019t. You might point a telescope at the Lagrange point, but I\u2019d simply say that the teapot was translucent. You could try and bounce a radio wave off it, but the teapot doesn\u2019t interact with those either. Perhaps you could fly up in a ship, but there are actually 5 Lagrange points between the Earth and the Moon and the teapot moves at random between all 5. And so on. There\u2019s no way to prove that this teapot doesn\u2019t exist. But it\u2019s clearly not a scientific theory. I just made it up. (Or rather Bertrand Russell did, to prove a point). And because the teapot isn\u2019t falsifiable, it\u2019s also entirely useless as a scientific theory. A universe with the teapot and a universe without it are completely identical from the point of view of a human. So what\u2019s the point? ",

            "answer_text": "Falsifiability is a possibility to prove statement wrong. Together with verifiability, this makes the statement to exist in a context where it can be judged true or false. Nothing more, nothing less. While the notion of falsifiability was brought forward in order to distinguish science from non-science, it has little to do with this. There are non-falsifiable statements within absolutely legal scientific context: \u201can electron has an elementary charge\u201d (one may say that this is how we identify a particle as an electron). And, another way around, there are falsifiable statements that have little to do with science: \u201cin view of Fourth of July, black folders sell faster than red folders\u201d. People often invite religious notions to demonstrate how falsifiability works, but it\u2019s rarely convincing. Example #1. \u201cGod made the sky blue\u201d. I may live a strange life but when at night I look up, the sky is black. So, obviously, this is a falsifiable statement and it\u2019s false. Hint: in the vast majority of such statements, \u201cGod\u201d can be replaced by \u201cNature\u201d or just excluded altogether: \u201cThe sky is blue\u201d. This works for some more complex questions as well. Example #2: \u201cGod exists\u201d turns into \u201cNature exists\u201d. Half-baked arguments based on premises that something must exist within something else, are not really impressive. For one, why not to call that something else \u201cGod\u201d (we\u2019ll get to that in a second). Of course, this doesn\u2019t show that God is equivalent to Nature but only demonstrates that by simple referring to something religious we do not move into non-scientific realm. The transition is made earlier when the existence of the reason of all reasons was assumed to be self-evident. Finally, Example #3. \u201cOn the third day, God created Adam\u201d. It\u2019s an unclear statement from the perspective of falsifiability and verifiability. What about this \u201cOn the third day, God created Muhammad\u201d. A bit too many people, including atheists, will say that something is not right here. The reason is obvious: we live in a cultural environment, which is full of religious references. These references create a context for judging (some) statements about God as true or false. We can actually make a science out of this. So, here we have it: falsifiability is a context for positive statements. An attempt to make more of it leads to recognizing interesting problems but they are far from making a demarcation between science and non-science. ",
