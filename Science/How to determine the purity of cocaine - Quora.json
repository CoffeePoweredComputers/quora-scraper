            "answer_text": "Test tube,reagent grade ammonia ,be nice not necessary . Household ammonia drop by weight,bust that big ass chunk. By the way thats what it should be couple smaller chunks get dead on 1000 grams. Get about .5 grams right from midddle of what should look like a wet fishes scales . Scrape .5 from the surface of chunkcrush to dust . Into test tube shake shit out of it . Pour it through a strainer,let it dry aminute weight it . Thats the free base of Cocaine. The difference in weight now is the ratio of the kilo . Purchasing that amount the loss should be negligible, one tenth . ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the non-lab method is by tested using simple chemistry techniques such as melting point. Then compare it to the MSDS data. Each substance has a specific melting point. The closer it is to its recorded data, the more pure it is. Any substance that contains impurities would affect its melting point, lowering it. ",
