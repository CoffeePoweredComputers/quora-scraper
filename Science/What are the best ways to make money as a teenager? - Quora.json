            "answer_text": "I. Work for myself Think of this as a show or a business. You can work on your own, or you can start a small company by partnering with friends. Yes, teamwork means the profits will have to be split, but also means a lot of work can be done quickly and more importantly, safety, which means you can be more flexible. When working with friends, divide work fairly and fairly (rotate work if possible to make people happy), gather in groups after class or on weekends around the neighborhood. , then get hired for a variety of jobs that can be completed quickly at a fixed price. A lot of people will turn their backs on a teenager when they see him knocking on their door for fear that he looks suspicious. But if they see you working in a group, they'll trust you to get in and out of their house quickly without disturbing your neighbors. If you are making money for a specific purpose (for example, buying an instrument, going on a field trip), tell everyone that; they will often buy from someone with a specific purpose of making money and maybe even pay you a little extra. 2. Consider doing common tasks. Babysitting, taking a dog for a walk, washing a car, or even videotaping and posting online with a genuine partnership, then you can make a lot of money from this job. Or you can mow the lawn for neighbors' houses. You can make a lot of money, but it takes hard work and a lot of weekend time. If you are distracted or depressed, remind yourself that hard work will produce real results. Set up groups for new jobs such as landscape decoration: a lawn mower, a water gutter cleaner, a hedge trimmer, and a pile of bricks and tiles. Ask your parents or parents of friends to lend 4. Doing chores in the house Talk to your parents about assigning chores to you. Try to choose things that parents may have to hire workers to do, like cleaning the toilet and only taking parents for half the price. Ask your parents if you can move every week. Wash your own clothes and wash dishes. Make sure you do a good job doing chores in the home or your parents will think you are not doing well for the money your parents pay you. If you don't have a lot of work to do, you can find other ways to make money (for example, \"If your child is really trying to save water and electricity, parents can pay for the amount of money their family saves compared to chemicals). last month? \"). Sometimes parents will be willing to help you if they know your plan, so share details with your parents. 5. Running errands for the elderly. Go for groceries, lift heavy things, repair computers or do whatever they are having trouble with. Try to make a good relationship with those people; Remember that they may feel very lonely and may enjoy spending time with young people as friends (Make them feel younger). The happier they are with you, the more they will pay you for the services you provide. 6. Bring trash to the curb. The day before the garbage truck arrives, go to all the families in the neighborhood you live in and ask to be paid VND 10,000 for you to take all the garbage to the curb to help them. (Don't ask for more; this is a simple job, so you have to maintain a reasonable price proportional to idle to get people more excited.) If you can collect garbage for twenty families, you have earned up to 200,000 VND with almost nothing to do. You may be even more fortunate if you work in the community of the elderly or the area you know may have many elderly people living. Do not do this in drainage areas or in the homes of any strangers for any reason. It is better to have an ally working in some situations 7. Start with the car wash job. Car wash and car care is a great money-making idea. With just a few people all the work can be done easily: one person wash and scrub the car, one takes care of the windows, the other two are in charge of the interior. Remember to vacuum thoroughly inside the car, scrub the wheel with a wax wheel, scrub the inside with a plastic brush (if the surface is plastic), and do it very carefully. Remember, if people don't like the results of your work, they can rely on professionals and can get it done for less. Always remember who you are competing with. 8. Disposal of old furniture. If you have a yard, consider selling second hand goods. You will be surprised to see how quickly they sell. Clean out your closet, attic, basement, and collect whatever else in your home is no longer needed and post ads for sale in the yard. Everything can give you some money. \"Promotion\" added by inviting shoppers for light, inexpensive drinks and beverages. It could be lemonade or popcorn if the weather is nice; or hot cup of tea if it's cold. You can sell for \"super\" cheap prices (because they sell second hand goods), almost for free, or for free, but accept donations (some people may be more generous than you think). If you have time, you can also make your own for sale. Just make sure you're still profitable! You have to consider the cost of raw materials. If you're serious about selling something, learn more about bargaining. 9. Advertise its services. Order a low-cost newspaper or online advertising such as babysitting, babysitting, pet care, etc. You can also hand out leaflets and business cards to people who need help advertising. Craigslist is a great website for you to provide your services, but consider having a parent or guardian for you when you plan to do business; Business is not the ideal job, but there are still many people out there trying to take advantage of you, and you need to prepare yourself well. You don't need to worry, but there are still many things to be aware of. I use update part II. We look forward to the support of the people You can contribute comments here ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer-Not sure what your gender is because you didn't specifically mention it so I'm just going to write this answer from a boys point of view. There are five main ways to earn money as a teen that I know of Mow lawns. I know, I know, typical answer, one you've probably gotten from countless others already, but it truly is a great first job. It requires little experience or skill, you pretty much have an infinite supply of lawns to mow (I garuntee if you ask around enough and offer a reasonable (or less than reasonable, you're not a professional after all) price, you\u2019ll find plenty of jobs), and you don't need too many expensive tools (either you or this person likely already has a lawn mower). It does have a few cons though, which I will put in bullet form after each example.Physical laborNot always the best payCan get boring and requires a vehicle (unless you\u2019re mowing your neighbors lawns)Garage sale. This is mainly if you need some quick cash for something and not a permanent job. Surely you have some old toys or clothes that you don't use any more laying around your room. My friend in middle school sold off all his Pok\u00e9mon card collection along with his baby clothes once and pulled in nearly $200. Cons:Could be tough to convince your parents to let you do thisYou need semi-valuabmale stuff to sell, people won't just buy junkNeed to live in a house; appartment won't doOne-offAsk your parents to set up an allowance for you. This one is probably the simplest. Just ask your parents if they\u2019d be willing to give you a weekly or monthly allowance. Tell them that it would teach you fiscal responsibility and offer to do more chores around the house to compensate. If they still won't budge, ask them to start off with something small, maybe $1\u20133 a week, and just save it all until you have enough for whatever you want (dont forget to put some in the bank, too). Just remember, your parents might not be able to afford this, so don't push it too hard, and be understanding if they say no. Cons:Small amount of money over long period of timeMight take some convincing to get your parents to pay you anythingNot affordable for some familiesSell stuff at school. This is probably the most lucrative of all the methods listed here. You can sell pretty much anything at school, be it food, supplies, shoes, or even homework answers (not recommended but hey, don't shoot the messenger). Simply buy stuff at a super cheap conscience store, or other people, as is the case with shoes, and then resell it for a higher price. Easy profit, especially selling to kids with parents who wouldn't let them buy that kind of stuff normally. Cons:99.99% chance it's not allowed at your school (but hey, that doesn't mean it's impossible to get away with it. Just be smart about it)You\u2019ll need an older sibling, really chill parent, or other trusted older friend to buy the stuff in the first place, then give it to you to sell at school (remember to kick them a few dollars if you have one of the 3)Selling shoes and answers are both pretty riskyGet a traditional job. This is going to be the most difficult, if not downright impossible, depdending on where you live, thing to do. First, you\u2019ll need a work permit from your school\u2019s principal (depending on your age, it varies by state). You\u2019ll need to set up an appointment with him/her and tell them where you plan on working, how long you plan on working a week, and how it will effect your grades (you\u2019ll need to maintain decent to good grades (B- to A+ ish) if you even want your principle to consider it. On top of that, you'll need to find a teen friendly job, like busing tables, limited cooking, limited cleaning, theme park ride attendant, or parking attendant. Cons:Lots of convincing both your parents and schools admins that you are mature and responsible enough to get a jobFinding a place that will hire a teen. (Just ask around at your favorite restaurants if they are hiring and during your interview try to act as mature and as grown up as you can.)Realizimg that this is a real-life commitment, and that you won't have as much time to hang out with your friends or do other social/fun like that if you take this job.Keeping your grades upThat's really all that I could think of. If you\u2019re a girl, I'm so sorry! I couldn't think of anything other than baby-sitting (in addition to the boys list) that you could do, and I don't know enough about babysitting to say anythign about it with any level of authority. Hope this helped! Edit 1: spelling and grammar ",

Sometimes, it\u2019s not even about the money.

Then another after that. See where I\u2019m going? This is source to true riches. In today\u2019s world, opportunity presents itself more and more to those who look for it.

Through advertising and subscription fees, he\u2019s current net-worth is now $3.2 million.   (Source: Millionaires Under 20 | New Rich - Alux.com) Here is Sean Belnick. Many of you may already know this man as the founder of Bizchair, an online retailer which sells office furniture. Before I go on, I want you to think about the last time you had $500, and what you did with that money. Did you spend it all alcohol for the streak of summer parties ahead? Did you buy the new PlayStation? Not this kid. With $500 he started his enterprise. According to Young Entrepreneurs, he locked himself in his room for three days at the age of 14 and built his website. Skip forward a few years (eight years to be precise), and this kid is now worth the best part of $59 million.  What this goes to prove is that none of these young entrepreneurs, and many more like them around the world, where handed the opportunity to start their own business. Instead, through perseverance and entrepreneurial passion, they found it themselves.  When I was kid, at around the age of 11, just settling in at my new school in a sleepy town called Henley on Thames, I found my opportunity. In my school, there was a rule disallowing the purchase of sweets and chocolates in the canteen, and so it wasn't stocked. I decided to stock it. I started buying sweets at chocolate at discount from Costco and started selling them at double the cost. For example, I would buy a pack of four Mars bars for \u00a31 and sell each one for 50 pence. I made a 100% return on my investment. But, I had a problem. I couldn\u2019t feed 1,000 chocolate hungry mouths on my own during the hour I had for lunch, and so I started to employ my first ever employees. Coming to the end of the year, I was pocketing around \u00a340 a day after expenses in just the one hour I had for lunch. That\u2019s \u00a3200 a week and \u00a3800 a month. I was making more money than some of the staff working at my school. This brings me to my first point I mentioned earlier, because although I was making a fair amount of money for an 11 year old at the time, it wasn't enough to change my life. Instead, I gained priceless knowledge and experience to help me with my future ventures. For example, I learnt how to manage my employees, I learnt to appreciate basic use of accounting. In effect, I learnt business. This is something I carry with me today, and will build on in the future. Have a look on my Quora Profile for a summary of my business life starting at the age 7: Mo Amini  (Source: Emirates247) My point in writing this answer goes out to all the young and aspiring entrepreneurs of our future. To find a way to make money, you have to \u2018look\u2019. That\u2019s the key. In every nook and cranny there is a potential for a business, and if you look harder, life changing potentials will stare back at you and make you think to yourself \u201cwhy hasn't anyone done this before\u201d. Truth is, others probably have, but they\u2019re not the entrepreneur, if you want to, you can be the one to exploit that. You can choose to be the entrepreneur.  Have you heard about the law of averages? It\u2019s a principle that states: an event is more likely to occur if there is enough frequency of trials made for it. My advice for you is to apply the law of averages. Start as many businesses as you can when you\u2019re young, because even if you fail, the knowledge and skills you acquire in the process are priceless for you, and your future. This will lead you to your riches. The famous Footballer Lionel Messi, in a way, applied the law of averages because he practiced more and more until he made it. He said (Lionel Messi - Twitter): \u201cIt took me 17 years and 114 days to become an overnight success.\u201d Let that sink in for a little bit. Give it a go. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a variety of jobs while I was in High School. I started out at 15 years old working as a Cashier at a McDonald's that was within walking distance of my Parents house. I made $6.75 as a starting minimum wage and absolutely hated the job. I worked mostly weekends but I found the smell of french fries following me well into the school week. I knew it was only temporary and that once I turned 16 many more options would open up for me to move onto something new. After 6 months working as a Cashier I quit my job at McDonald's. I was done making french fries, taking orders, and cleaning bathrooms. I was ready to level up. After turning 16, I dressed up in a nice business outfit and hit the mall with an updated resume in my hand. I was determined to find a job and wouldn\u2019t come home until an interview had been scheduled. I submitted an application and spoke to the Hiring Managers of just about every single retail store in the whole mall. After lining up a few interviews I was hired as a Sales Associate at Finish Line making $7.50 per hour. I had always had an interest in sales and wanted to develop my skills so I figured what better way then sell something I already love. I became an up-selling master ($1 added to each paycheck for selling cleaner or waterproof), implemented a variety of mind-hacks to use on my end customers and began to make an extra dollar here and there as the sales incentives began to kicked in. I was loving my new job and finally started to feel like I was doing things right. Only problem was the hours were limited and I still had free time to devote to working and making more money. I decided to take a second job as a Bus Boy cleaning and clearing tables at the Texas Roadhouse. I really liked this job from the start mainly due to the fact I was surrounded by a continuous stream of the hottest girls in my area. The wait staff were typically chicks and the majority were all a few years older than me. Great second job and I loved the cash tips. Problem is soon I started to realize I wasn\u2019t really making that much money and the job was keeping me at the restaurant late at night so by the time I\u2019d get off work it would be too late to do anything with my friends. So I began looking for a new source of income. What did I find? The best job I EVER had while I was in High School was delivering PIZZA at a local town sub shop right next to the original McDonald's I had worked in back when I was 15. It was the best job for a variety of reasons. I got paid straight cash a base salary of $8 per hour plus tips. Little did I know I had just landed the dream job for any high school kid. I live in a Suburb where most houses would give anywhere from a $3\u20137 tip so I was now going home with what would come out to about $16\u201318 per hour after each shift. To be honest out of all of my friends or acquaintances I was making more money simply driving pizzas around literally doing no work besides driving because my boss was a control freak and wouldn\u2019t even allow me to help with anything in the restaurant. He would give me the remote to the TV when there were no deliveries and even let me nap when I was hungover from partying with friends all night. If I have any advice to give. Find the opportunity that either pays you a bunch without doing any real \u201cwork\u201d or one that pays you little but teaches you a lot so you can add value down the road and make 10x the money when the timing is right! And if you find one that pays you a lot and teaches you a lot..Now you are really on to something big! ",

            "answer_text": "Despite the difficult economy, there are many ways for a teenager to make money. All you need is a good idea and some free time. Read these money-making ideas for inspiration. 1. Work for yourself. Treat it like a program or business. You can work by yourself, or you can start a mini-company by joining together with your friends. Yes, group work means splitting up the funds, but it also means you can get a lot of jobs done quickly and, more importantly, safely, which means you will also be able to go more places. When working with your friends, divide the tasks fairly and equally (rotating if it keeps everyone happy), take your group around the neighborhood after school or on weekends, and offer to get various tasks done quickly for a set price. A lot of people will turn away a lone teenager knocking at their door for fear that it will look suspicious. If they see that you\u2019re working as a team, however, they\u2019ll know you can get in and out quickly without concerning the neighbors. If you are raising money toward a specific goal (ex. buying an instrument, being able to go on a school trip), let people know; they\u2019ll be much more likely to buy stuff from someone with a purpose and may even give you extra. 2. Consider the basics. Babysit, walk dogs, wash cars, or even record videos and put them online, with the right partnership company, there is a lot of money in it. Or mow lawns for your neighbors. You can make a lot of money, but it's hard work and could take up much of the weekend. If you get distracted or depressed, remind yourself that your hard work will lead to very real results. Team up to do odd jobs like landscaping: One person mows, one cleans the gutters, one clips the hedges, one rakes up all the debris. Ask your parents and your friends' parents for all the necessary tools, or rent them from a supply store. 3. Shovel snow. Go to every house in a good sized neighborhood charging 10-20 dollars per driveway, or 30 dollars a week for shoveling the snow. (Charge extra when shoveling snow that has been driven on, which is packed down and very hard to remove.) Do this every time it snows. Someone may pay you in advance for a month if they know you, or if they like your work! 4. Do work around the house. Negotiate fees with your parents for extra chores around the house. Try to pick things they might hire a professional to do, like cleaning the toilets, and charge them half price. Ask your parents if you can clean the house each week. Do your laundry and the dishes. Be sure to do the chores properly or your parents might not think it's worth their money. If there isn\u2019t much work to be done, you might even be able to work out some other kind of arrangement (ex. \"If I work really hard to save water and electricity, will you pay me the amount of money we saved on the bill since last month?\"). Parents are sometimes more willing to help out if they know what your plan is, so share all the details with them. 5. Run errands for an elderly person. Get groceries, do heavy lifting, troubleshoot the computer, or do any other tasks they might have trouble with. Try to have a good relationship with the person; remember that they might be lonely and probably enjoy spending time around younger people such as friends. (It makes them feel younger.) The better they feel around you, the more they'll be likely to give you for your services. 6. Take trash to the curb. On the day before trash pickup, hit up all the houses on your street and ask for a dollar from each house to take all the bins out to the curb. (Don\u2019t ask for any more than this; it\u2019s a super simple job, so you have to maintain a reasonable cost-to-laziness ratio to get anyone interested.) If it works on even twenty houses, that\u2019s twenty bucks for almost no work. You might have even better luck in a retirement community or an area where you know a lot of elderly people happen to live. Don\u2019t do this in sketchy areas or go into anyone\u2019s house for any reason. You might be better off working with a partner in some situations. 7. Start a car wash. Car washing and detailing is another great money-making idea. This is done most easily with several people: one person rinses and scrubs, one does windows, two detail the inside. Remember to thoroughly vacuum the inside, hit the wheels with wheel wax, rub the inside with vinyl scrub (if the surface is vinyl), and do a thorough job. Remember, if people don't like your work, they can probably go to a professional and get the job done cheaper. Keep in mind who you're competing against. 8. Sell items at a yard sale. Even if you don\u2019t think you have anything lying around that anyone will want, you\u2019d be surprised by how quickly a lot of little sales can add up. Empty out your closet, attic, or basement and gather together everything you don\u2019t want. Put all the small-ticket items into a group to be sold at a yard sale, which you can advertise with street signs and Craigslist. (Often, clothes in nice condition will sell at a yard sale. Worthless clothes, especially simple tees, can be cleaned and sold in bundles as shop rags.) Make a little extra at a yard sale by offering simple, cheap beverages or snacks. If it\u2019s nice weather, offer lemonade, individual baggies of popcorn (stove-popped, not microwave-popped, which is way more expensive), or other sunny day refreshments; if it\u2019s cold or blustery, offer hot tea or cider. You can either sell these at a very low rate (it\u2019s a yard sale, after all), give them away (making people more likely to buy out of niceness and good will), or offer them for free but accept donations (some people will blow you out of the water with their generosity). If you have the time, you can also make or build things to sell. Just make sure that there\u2019s room for profit! You have to keep in mind things like materials cost. If you're serious about selling things, learn how to haggle. 9. Advertise your services. Place a cheap ad in the newspaper or online for something like babysitting, house-sitting, pet-sitting, etc. You can also pass out flyers and business cards for people who need help advertising. Craigslist is a great place to offer your services, but plan on having a parent or guardian accompany you when you scope for work; it's probably not ideal, but there are people out there who could try to take advantage of you, and you want to be prepared. It's nothing to worry about, but it's something to be aware of. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a slew of things you can do. As stated in previous answers walking dogs (I did this, it is intimidating going up to neighbors and asking, but,  you would be amazed at how many are more than willing since they are gone during most the day.) Selling water bottles at events.  This is also great.  Good margins, and people are thirsty. Another thing that might be of more interest to you is trying to do \"grown up things\" I say that in quotes since I feel we are all still kids as adults. Such as, trying to build a website for local small businesses.  Or running their social media campaign. Starting a cleaning business. Putting up a small gumball machine in a card shop, or any small business that has high foot traffic. (Here you offer the owner a cut of your profits for renting his floor space, buy gumballs online or at costco etc). Offering tutoring lessons in classes you excel in.  Or tutoring to younger students. Playing video games that you are great at and live streaming on twitch.tv. Making youtube or vine videos daily (you will fail A LOT before you make any money but when you do will make money for years) Making art, or neat things such as a cool watch, cool tshirt, cool sneakers etc, and selling it on etsy. Finding items on amazon or walmart that are cheaper than on ebay and selling them on ebay by gifting it to them. (Yes this exists think about how you out of habbit only go to certain websites even though alternatives exist) Going on alibaba and finding a product that you can buy bulk and sell on amazon, ebay, or etsy for more. Delivering news papers via bike. Seatching craigslist for odd jobbs (example I need this trash taken to dumpster, or my lawn mowed). Going on task rabbit and finding things people need done. Trading your way up, or bartering with items.  Back to craigs list here and find a item in the \"free\" section and then finding if you can sell it, fix it, and resell it. You should note that as a teenager you have a few key advantages over most adults.  Time, you are trained to learn right now due to the number of years you have been going to school.  So you can throw a dart to a dartboard of ideas and learn how via trial and error and research (I suggest trial and error first then research as I feel your learning curve is quicker once you have already failed but learned). Freeedom, the only laws you live by are those set by your parents, and like any good teenager im sure you break those often ;) Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "All I see is \"value, value, value\". It's the same people copy and pasting there long, pointless essay's all over Quora. No one cares about your vague content. Regardless of how many upvotes you get, it's not the answer people are looking for.  Second, why do people ask these instead of searching??? There are thousands of unique answers!   Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's take a look.  It all boils down to time and motivation. At 15, you have more time than you'll ever have.  Ask yourself, do you need someone to push you to do things OR do you handle everything better on your own?  I ask this because you need to decide if you want to take on the traditional teenager jobs or start from scratch and invent your own way of making money. If you need someone to tell you what to do, find a local job for $10 an hour.  But, your on Quora. I'm going to assume your motivated and know a nice deal about the Internet. Use this \"Internet\". Here are some other options.   Instead of the $10 an hour, let's make that $50..every hour...24 hours, 7 days a week. How? Instead of all the other answers, I'm going to give you options. Here's the deal. Choose one, and paste it into Quora. But choose wisely; after you do, you must stick with it. No coming back (If you find your niche and ever comeback, you'll know why I said this). The best way these days is to learn a skill (assuming you don't already have one) and then teach it. It could be doing make-up or it could be astrophysics.   The Options:  -YouTube! Make videos and grow a channel! This one doesn't need an explanation these days. -Start up a blog on ANYTHING! Monetize music on SoundCloud (random but maybe you love music)Amazon Affilite - If someone clicks your link to an Amazon item, you get  a percent. Teach a course on a subscription education service like Lynda (Tough but some of these guys make 100K...a month).Drop Shipping: To in depth to be summed up into one sentenceMoney on Twitter (if you get like 1.0m followers) by giving smaller accounts shout outs. Monetize a Facebook page that posts funny contentRedesign local web sites. Take pictures and sell them on Fotolia/istockphotos!Think of an app idea and use Quora to find someone who can make it happen.Famous on social media? Use link shortener to get paid when people click your link.Order things from china and sell on EbayKnow how to  do everything, become a virtual assistant for some CEO...Domain Flipping! If your rich already and doing this for kicks, buy a bunch of .com's and sell them like, 40 years for now for...A LOT. You can turn any of these into a small business and then automate it. If you start thinking at 15, start it at 16, and generated income by 17. Imagine where you'll be by 18. The idea isn't to get rich. It's to start now so later on...you set! But, the deadly part is the money. If you focus on it, you motivation will dwindle and die. Instead, focus on the bigger picture.  \"The best way to make money is to not think about making money\" - Not Enough People Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest and most profitable thing to do would be to get a job in retail or fast food. Other than that, babysitting and tutoring. Mowing lawns. Cleaning pools. That kind of stuff. But you probably know all of that that. Perhaps you want something more exciting. When I was growing up quite a few of us poor benighted inner city kids had some sort of money-making idea or practice. Whether or not they were super profitable, they were (usually) fun and often a learning experience. I will list them for you here, and you may take from it what you will. Candy/Snack Selling One kid in my high school did this and made a killing. He got everything in bulk and sold candy and sodas for $1 each. The teachers tended to look the other way (as far as I recall) so long as he didn\u2019t disrupt classes. I have heard that some schools frown on this though, and schools with vending machines in particular crack down hard on this -so much for capitalism, am I right? Also, the barrier to entry is very low, so expect competition. Gambling There will almost always be opportunities to bet money on something. In my day Yu-Gi-Oh was the big game (yes, really), and there were always opportunities to gamble for money or cards (which could later be sold for money). New York City -my home- had an unusually vast and extremely sketchy Yu-Gi-Oh community at the time, which again meant lots of opportunity to gamble. But you can bet on literally anything if you want. Needless to say, while you can make money, you could just as easily lose money gambling. And then there\u2019s the matter of collecting your winnings, which isn\u2019t always easy. If you beat someone in a bet, and he refuses to pay up, well, what are you gonna do about it? If you don\u2019t have an answer, you shouldn\u2019t be gambling. Or at least, not with people you don\u2019t trust. And then of course, sometimes the game is just straight-up rigged against you. I once had two friends invite me into a rigged game: the idea was that they would play Yu-Gi-Oh during the lunch period and stir up interest to get people to bet on the game. The idea was to get a lot of people to bet on \u201cFriend A\u201d to win; Friend A would then throw the game to Friend B, who would take the pot. They would then divide the earnings between themselves later. My job was to help stoke interest in the game. I turned them down, but let them know I wouldn\u2019t get involved either way -meaning I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. So the next day they\u2019re doing their thing and they get a nice pool of money going from a few surrounding suckers. So far so good for their side hustle. Unfortunately they left said pool of money in the open, in the middle of the lunch table. A scary upper-classman walked by, saw what was going on, reached down and stole the money, and walked away. Whoops. Loan Sharking This was something I dabbled in. I was a finance nerd growing up, and was obsessed with the idea of having my money make money. I only had a few dollars to my name so opportunity was limited. That was until a friend asked to borrow like, $2.50 from me. At that moment, inspiration came. I loaned him the money, but at $0.25 interest a day until it was paid back (pulled the number out of thin air). He was trustworthy so I knew he\u2019d pay and pay quickly. He agreed to the terms and said he\u2019d probably pay me back later that day -before my interest kicked in. This worried me. I was happy to be paid back, but I wanted to make money. So I had another stroke of genius -what if I sold his debt to someone else? The debtor was trustworthy, and I reckoned I could convince someone to buy the debt for $3.00 once I explained that the interest rate on the debt would push the amount owned passed that in just a few days. Yes, it was genius. I was a genius. I would turn $2.50 into $3.00 in just a few hours.  So I spent a few periods trying to hawk this $2.50 (w/ $0.25 interest) debt around to people. No one knew what the fuck I was talking about. \u201cYou, Ke\u2019Aun, want me to\u2026 buy a debt? What?\u201d And it\u2019s not like I was a good salesman -I didn\u2019t understand how to sell a product beyond just reiterating the same words over and over. Later that day my friend gave me back my $2.50. No profit for me. =\u2019( Another time I loaned out $15 to a less trustworthy person at a gigantic $5 a day interest rate. Boy was I excited for this payday; I was imaging all night that night what I would do with the money. Of course he never paid me back. And I had no method of making him pay me back -what was I going to do, break his legs? I mean, had I been more\u2026 gangsta, let\u2019s say, I guess I could\u2019ve done something, but I wasn\u2019t and still aren\u2019t. Like gambling, don\u2019t bet what you can\u2019t collect on.  You will note that all of these opportunities are either 1) not very profitable, 2) risky, or 3) both. If you really want (safe) money as a teen, get a job. Your employer can later be used as a reference on your resume or college applications, which alone is probably going to be worth more than the pennies you earn doing something more \u201ccool.\u201d The only other thing I can think of is to create something to sell, like a work of art, a book, an invention, etc. That can work, if you have the skill and tenacity for it.

            "answer_text": "There are tons of ideas out there to start a business. What you really need is a good idea and a great execution to make it a successful business. Since execution is more important that the actual business idea, it is important for you to understand the process to start a business, sustain and thrive. The Process: Step 1: Come up with the idea For ideas, you just need to keep your windows open (ears and eyes). Most of the time, a new business idea is just around the corner. Identify the problems you face (or others face) in general and then figure out ways to solve them in a better way. On the other hand, if there\u2019s something that you love to do and would like to focus all your energy on it, convert it into a process and start a business. One of the way is to look at the new business trends and upcoming technologies and how you can use them to come up with something that would touch the lives of others. Step 2: Validate your idea Once you come up with the idea, you will need to validate it in the market. Talk to people who matter to you and get their feedback. Run an ad on Google/ Facebook and build your first email list of people who would like to purchase your product/service upon launch. Step 3: Build your MVP One of the mistake that many entrepreneurs make is to spend the whole time and effort to build a fully blown product. Start small and make iterations. MVP is like a working prototype of your whole idea. Create a minimum viable product and validate it in the market. Use a crowdsource funding/ ideas to create your MVP and find your first users. Step 4: Launch Let everyone know that you\u2019ve built something that is useful to them. Spend the time to market you product, since it takes most of the effort. Catch hold of your first users and see if they refer to others and help with word of mouth. The Idea: Per the latest trend, the on-demand economy is booming. It\u2019s exciting that you get what you want, with just a click. This business model has seen an exponential rise in the past year or so, indicating that speed and convenience are highly valued among consumers. Thinking on these lines, come up with an idea to provide a service or deliver a product at the convenience of the consumer. The competition is tough and pretty much crowded by now, but if you can capture the local market and provide value, you can slowly expand to other areas and grow your business. ",

            "answer_text": "Forget doing e-commerce! I was a drop-shipper for a year and while I did make money, but the money was indifferent.  In my limited business experiences( software as a service, ebay dropshipping, Gift card reselling, and Airbnb Rental Arbitrage), I\u2019d say the answer is Airbnb Rental Arbitrage. Let\u2019s explore all of them. Software as a service I have worked for 3 different software companies in San Francisco. The startup costs are high as tech workers cost a lot of money. Once you built a successful product, you not only have to think about product maintenance, but marketing, and customer support. These costs are fixed costs. Not only that, you will have to figure out a product that people will want. Is your product going to be B2C or B2B? The next phase is the market research. Well, you get the idea. Lots of work go into research\u2026 This article summarizes profit margins for software companies pretty good. Most software companies have margin less than 20%. And most businesses would consider a 20% margin a great business. Ebay Dropshipping I started an Ebay dropshipping store in 2017. I\u2019ve made probably $5000 in sales. Not a lot, but enough for me to understand my thruput. Throughput = (time invested in researching for product ideas/niches + time running the dropshipping store) / the profit (revenue minus item costs) So for example, I\u2019d spend time researching for a niche product to sell on ebay, let\u2019s say, snow gloves, and then I\u2019d create an ad on ebay to dropship the snow gloves that I found from Alibaba. Let\u2019s assume the gloves go for $15 on Alibaba and I would charge 1.4x of the original cost, so 15 * 1.4 = 21 dollars. 21 dollars minus ebay and paypal fees = 19 dollars. So my net profit would be 4 dollars. So, I\u2019d earn 4 dollars for every 21 dollars. That means my profit margin would be roughly 19%. Well, 19% is still not a bad profit margin. Just to give you a reference point, Apple\u2019s products are around 38%. Gift Card Reselling I gave up on the business idea after 2 weeks. Too many scammers tried to hustle me. My time ROI was negative. Airbnb Rental Arbitrage I\u2019ve been doing this for over a year now. My profit margin varies from month to month, but it averages from 42% to 58%. This all depends on occupancy rate and the time of the year. What is Airbnb Arbitrage? In this case, you are renting a property out at a lower price and subleasing it out via Airbnb at a higher price. For example, you lease a 1-bedroom apartment at $1,000 dollars a month and rent out the same 1-bedroom for $2,000 dollars a month on Airbnb. Your net profit is $1k a month. In the month August in 2017, my net income was $12,345. After my business expenses, my profit was 7089. That is 58% profit margin! Best part about this business model is that you lease homes and not own them. Once the business is up and running, I spend only a few hours each week managing the business. Hope this helps! P.S.

Get a retail job.Sales clerk, stockboy, or you can be like me and work at a fast food chain (mine's was KFC).  Pros: get work experience, easy to get the job, feel awesome you're earning moneyCons: crap pay, crap work, and anything you do will likely not be useful on a resume in the future. 2. Provide neighborhood services.Lawn mowing, weed whacking, car washing, car waxing, dog walking, babysitting, dog washing, gutter cleaning, dog poop scooping, recycling, grocery delivery... and on and on. Just ask around your neighborhood and see what types of need there are. This is basic entrepreneurship/business dealing and it's great because all of the above are things that need to be done over and over (recurring revenue, my friend).  Pros: fun to think of ideas, fun to execute, get referrals from within the community, and people will be so glad that you do the shit they don't want to do :)Cons: your ideas might be bad, you might mess up people's stuff, you're inexperienced, and you will have to market yourself  3. Sell things at strategic locations.This is one thing that I saw a lot of in South Korea when I worked there, where there was a lot of public solicitation on the sidewalks and subways (although it's illegal). Is it raining outside? Find a busy place with a lot of foot traffic and sell umbrellas. At a football tailgate? Sell home team jerseys. Fourth of July parade? Sell American flags. Sunny day at the touristy beach? Sell a visor or sunscreen.  Pros: you can make a killing if you sell the right thing in the right locationCons: solicitation laws vary. also, it's up to you to buy the items for cheap beforehand and choose the price to mark it up to **** Read this post by Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks and serial entrepreneur): Making Money as a Student ",

            "answer_text": "When I started re-skinning apps, I was 18. Over the past two year, I\u2019ve found that re-skinning apps is one of the best ways to make money online. Last year I was able to make over $15,000 working just 1 hour per week. The best part is that you don\u2019t need to know how to code! Re-skinning apps is a pretty simple process. Basically, you purchase/create a template, change the graphics of the template, and then sell the app. The entire process will take between 1 and 3 hours depending on your experience. After having re-skinned apps for over a year now, I\u2019ve found that the typical re-skinned app sells for between $100 and $300. However, I\u2019ve had single re-skins that have sold for over $2,000! If re-skinning sounds like something you want to try, I would first recommend looking at Chupamobile. Chupamobile is a marketplace to buy app templates. They usually cost between $50 and $250. However, once you buy a template once, you can re-skin it an unlimited amount of times! After you decided on your first template, you\u2019re going to need to re-skin the app. I\u2019ve found that simplicity is the best when re-skinning apps. I typically just change the icon, colors, screenshots, text, and backgrounds of the app. I wouldn\u2019t try to add features because this is time consuming and the return isn\u2019t usually that great. After completing the re-skin, you\u2019re almost finished with your first app! Now you just have to sell it on Flippa, a marketplace for buying and selling apps and websites. If this sounds like a good way to make money for you, you should definitely check out my YouTube Channel to see in-depth videos on how to re-skin apps efficiently. Also, join my Facebook Group so you can talk with other beginner re-skinners and learn from the experts too! I think re-skinning apps is a great way for teenagers to make money because there\u2019s really not much of a time commitment and there aren\u2019t any age restrictions either. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Are you interested in business? Be the Boss! Start a small business. Start a lawn mowing business. Don\u2019t mow the lawns yourself. Hire kids from your school to cut the yards. Your job as the company owner is to line up the work. Find yards to cut. Set it up so that you cut them every other week. You may pay your friends $15 to $20 to cut a yard, but you charge the homeowner $25 to $30 for the job. If you have just five kids cutting three yards a week, you make around $150 per week profit for yourself without ever breaking a sweat. It you get ten kids cutting five yards a week, you bank $500 a week. It should be really easy to grow it from there. When I was a kid I was cutting between 16 and 21 yards each Saturday, but I wasn\u2019t smart enough to be the boss. I did it all by myself. It was so ling ago that I charged my clients $1 per yard. If you\u2019re in an area with a lot of large trees in the yards, offer your clients leaf raking. If you\u2019re in a snowy area, offer your clients shoveling or snow blowing. Go get some commercial building jobs like nursing homes, car lots, or small other businesses, You will be able to charge those businesses more for smaller areas. They are all busy making money and don\u2019t have time to mow their grass. You can do the same thing with babysitting. If you are the babysitter you can only charge for your time. If you are scheduling baby sitters, you make a piece of each of their pay for the job that you set up and you are free to go have a date night instead of babysitting all night. You earn money while others are doing the labor. Have the funds automatically drafted to your bank account, or Venmo account. That way you only have to meet with the homeowners one time to make the sale. You just have to make sure the work is done correctly each time it\u2019s scheduled. Get creative, find a need and fill it with students that work for you. Pay them a lot, take a little for yourself for finding them the work and you may be able to create a business that has enough clients that you can sell your small business for enough to pay your own way through college.

            "answer_text": "Sell your bathwater.  Thanks for this wonderful idea, Belle Delphine! Okay, for real, there are TONS of ways, and all it depends on what you like, your age, your background / where you live, and what you\u2019re willing to commit to. Online ways: Instagram accounts - typically fan accounts or accounts where you regularly post a skill / talent of yours (e.g doing flips). Your posts need to be high quality, you have to be very active, this will take a lot of consistency and some luck, but after 2 - 6+ months you can start making money from sponsorships and deals.Sell things online on Etsy or other sites - particularly if you are artsy and good at making cheap crafts or useful objects.There are some online sites that pay you for surveys and things - be careful and make sure you are not sucked into scams though.I\u2019ve heard about the app Sweatcoin which pays you for walking, I\u2019m not sure whether it actually works but check out stuff like that.If you have good computer skills, websites such as Fiverr and Upwork let you do small graphic design, social media and voiceover gigsOld-school ways: Babysit - YES IT\u2019S CLICHE but, hey, you get $$ - recommended if you like kidsPetsit - like babysitting but better. Walking dogs, taking care of pets while owners are on holiday is great, especially if you enjoy spending time with animals.Wash cars - if you live somewhere where everyone drives, start by asking your neighbours.Tutor - if there\u2019s a subject or skill you\u2019re proficient in, tutor little kids! The best is a language, because that is something parents often cannot provide themselves - for example, I tutor mandarin to 7\u201310 year old kids. Since you likely won\u2019t have a degree you probably can\u2019t charge more than $20 an hour, but that\u2019s not bad for a teen.Get a job at a fast-food chain, restaurant or drink stall (depends on your age and location) - yup another teen cliche but again $$ and you may learn some useful skills.Hey, if all else fails - bathwater\u2019s always there ;) Stay scandalous!

            "answer_text": "When I was between the ages of 11 and 14 years old, I made over $5000 walking dogs and bought my first car before I could even drive.  It may not sound like a lot, but for a young kid it definitely was and back then I think I charged $2 to walk a dog and $8 per day to pet sit (this was ~1990).  I'm not saying dog walking or pet sitting is exactly the thing that you should do, but it worked for me. I had more money than any of my friends. It could have been mowing lawns or washing cars, but both of those require more equipment (lawnmower, etc). First of all, you are your own boss in a situation like this. So you keep 100% of whatever money you make. There is nothing you have to buy or spend money on to get started, as long as you have a pair of shoes and can walk. The other nice thing, assuming you're doing this in your neighborhood is that you don't need any transportation to get to and from work. You mentioned \"teenager\" in the question but that's a big range and you didn't specify if you have a drivers license or not.  The dog sitting part was where I made the most money because the dog would stay at it's own house and I'd come over twice or three times a day (depending on what the owner asked for) to feed the dog and take it for a walk. It didn't take much time and I could be dog sitting 3-7 dogs at a time, all at their own homes. When you figure that most people go on vacation for 10-14 days at a time typically, it adds up. People often tipped me too. I'd bring in their mail and newspaper for them or whatever they needed. With a business like this, you also get to set your own schedule more or less. Yes, dogs need walked in the morning and evening, but there is a lot of flexibility. Plus you get some exercise, get to enjoy the outdoors and you'll meet a lot of your neighbors. Do a good job for them and they'll refer you to other friends too. There is little to no overhead. Print out some fliers on your computer and walk around your neighborhood leaving them on people's doorsteps.  I continued this little business probably until I was about 18, though I got other more traditional jobs as well. It was a nice source of income and taught me a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "As a Teenager I supplemented My Job at an Old Fashion Service/Gas Station while in High School by buying Broken Down Cars for $100 from Friends, and from My Customers at the Service Station. I fixed up the Cars with Discounted Parts I received as a Job Perk. After fixing the Cars for next to nothing, I detailed & Buffed the Cars making Them look as good as possible. Then listed The Cars in the Classifieds between $1,000-$3,000. Not too bad of a return for $100 for the Car, $50-$250 for Cheapo parts, a little wax, labor, and $12 for the Newspaper Ad, especially for a 16-18 Year Old High Schooler. It was great until the Damn DMV started to notice that I was literally Running an Auto Dealership out of My Parent's Home. They wrote a Cease and Desist Letter to Me saying that (last year) We have documented that You sold 19 Cars in the previous Year illegally, because I didn't have, nor was old enough to even qualify for a Dealer's License. They also said I wasn't recording the $1000s in earnings to the IRS, plus My Parent's Home was zoned Residential vs Commercial. I had at any given time 3-5 Cars for Sale Parked in front of My Parent's Home, money coming out of My ***, and the only Kid in High School driving BRAND NEW Vehicles. I'm not a Criminal, so I did Retire from that Gig at the Ripe old Age of 18 or so while still in High School... Let's sum it up like this, I fought the Law and the Law Kinda Won. LOL I also wasn't old enough to \"Legally\" drive a Tow Truck either, but The Cops, Traffic, and The People of Madison, WI. were just glad that I cleared the Roads after Accidents, and Jumpstarted 100s of Cars during the WISCONSIN Winters, plus I made BUKU BUCKS for Myself and The Owner of this Amoco Station without ANY complaints... The 80s were Grand (Literally).., I guess looking back at it all now at 44, I STILL Relish those Days, regardless of the DMV, I can honestly say, I got the Last Laugh... This was the way I Earned Money as a Teenager... ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of ways you can make money, you just have to get creative. In this day and age, especially with the power and easy access of the internet, you can never be too young to start making money for yourself. There are many unique ways to make money as. Here are some few tips that might help. Buying and re-selling. You can find things to buy and resell anywhere, you just have to keep your eyes open. Check out local garage sales and thrift stores. Even check with your neighbors or friends to see if they have anything they want to sell, but don\u2019t have the time to list themselves. Once you find a product you think you can sell for more than you bought, make sure to validate this by looking to see how much other people are selling your product for. There are marketplaces you can list your item on including eBay, Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, and many more. Seasonal assistant. People's lives are always busy, especially around the holidays. Simply provide a service that will give busy people some of their time back and it becomes a purchase that requires little convincing. Whether it is getting pumpkins ready to carve for Halloween, eggs ready to dye for Easter, or running to the mall to pick up that last Christmas gift there aren\u2019t traditional services for these type of things. Get the word out in your community about how you can help, provide a good experience, and again word of mouth will take over. Bundle and sell. Imagine someone is buying a new phone and they need a case, a screen protector, and a pair of headphones. Buying all of these can be time-consuming if purchased individually. Do the hard work for them. Make sure all of them are compatible and put them together at one easy price point. Whether you are selling a bundle online or to people in your local community, selling \u201cconvenience\u201d can be easy, fun and lucrative. Content creation. Social media is now a bigger factor than ever in the buying process, especially to teens. Brands recognize this and are doing anything they can to jump on the latest trend, while helping to promote their company. As a teen you are surrounded by the culture these brands want to be a part of 24/7. You know what your friends are talking about, what\u2019s hot, and what\u2019s not. This type of insight and access is extremely valuable to brands. Think about how a company could become cool in your friends\u2019 eyes and help portray this vision to the brand, whether it is a social media post, or even a new product. Reaching out to a brand may sound intimidating but all it takes is a simple DM or email explaining your idea(s). I just hope this helps. ",

It\u2019s for this reason that, although I begged and pleaded with them, they refused to let me get a service job. But I still wanted money, so I found other ways to get around their rule. Tutoring. I did it through a local company who would pair me up with students, but I could theoretically have just put up flyers in the local library and set my own rates.Selling old clothes. I did this through an app called Poshmark and also just talking to people around my school.Selling handmade jewelry. I used to make bracelets and earrings in middle school and sell them for a *little* bit more than they were worth.Doing people\u2019s makeup. Once I got fairly good at it I could charge people anywhere from $15-$40 to do their makeup for events.Other ways teenagers I know make money: Photography. If you are good, you can charge kids from your school or neighborhood to take photos of them, either just fun shoots or for actual events like prom and graduation.A traditional service job. Fast food, milk tea or coffee places are the most common because most restaurants don\u2019t hire teenage servers.Instagram. Having a public account with anything over a few thousand followers (meme/niche meme, pictures of you, photography, text posts, etc) will make your account an attractive host for sponsors, who will either give you discount codes or just pay you to promote them.YouTube. \u201cBrand influencer\u201d is becoming a more and more viable career option, and there are a lot of teenagers who have found fame and a job online and on YouTube.",

            "answer_text": "Our kids discovered they were entrepreneurs when they were successful selling chocolate bars door to door for a school project. After 1st snowfall they knocked on doors and left info sheets offering to shovel snow from sidewalks and driveways for modest cost. They were confronted for trespassing by a different neighbour when looking after a senior's flower garden in their absence. That resulted in their names being handed out for helping with 'landscaping,' cutting grass and watering yards for vacationeers. Movie theatres here offer Saturday matinees for kids. Our kids got themselves hired on to clean a theatre, initially for free tickets, later for an hourly rate [lower than minimum because they were under 16 y/o]. In high school DS #1 proudly announced he'd been hired [Fri.& Sat. 5-8 pm] as dishwasher at a nearby, family steak house. I was really upset with the idea but it was a terrific 'real life' experience. Initially DS was given every dirty job the kitchen crew could think of! They made it clear he could end up working in a kitchen for life if he didn't 'ace - it' in school. By the holidays he was 'busing' tables, by late summer he was waiting tables for 1st seating. [He taught me how to work efficiently in the kitchen]. Best of all my 'meh' student concluded he'd better up his game and graduated in the top quarter of his group. Every 10 y/o can teach elderly 'Baby Boomers and Gen 'X,' how to use all the features of their cell phone, banking on-line and best apps. 15 y/o are problem solvers. They can find the cheapest flight and best arrival times faster than a travel agent! They could take photos and write ads for e-selling for all the stuff Kon Marie followers want to clear out for a percentage of take. Any college age student can make school year support money by learning how to operate a spray paint machine correctly. They need to be detail orientated but tape, spray and clean up is an easy business to operate. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to think of it in terms of your strengths. No matter what your status in life, male, female, old, young, rich, poor, black, white, you have some strengths and you have some weaknesses. Let\u2019s look at them closely and make some assumptions: Strengths: There are lots of people willing to help you out (Much more than they will when you\u2019re a grown adult)You don\u2019t have a ton of responsibility or commitments just yet. That means you can risk everything you have without much repercussion.Your friends are likely in the same boat and may be willing to jump on board with you easier than when you\u2019re an adultYour social network is stronger than most adults and your circle of influence is easier to manipulateTime - You have way more time now than you will when you\u2019re 30. Take my word for that.Weaknesses:Credibility - Since you haven\u2019t done a lot in your umteen years, you won\u2019t have a lot to show, so whatever you do shouldn\u2019t require a ton of background or experienceWealth/Starting Capital - Honestly this is over-rated. You shouldn\u2019t need any money to make some money. But not having any cash up front can be psychologically disabling. Always keep in mind, Walt Disney didn\u2019t have the money to build Disneyland, he still got it done.So let\u2019s see. You need to do something that: Doesn\u2019t require a lot of startup capital (less than $1000)Doesn\u2019t require you to have a lot of testimonials or historyLeverages your social circle, friends and family heavilyTakes advantages of your free time effectivelyTakes advantages of your position to take bigger risksThese days there is no shortage of things that fit the above criteria. But using the above litmus test can help you determine if you\u2019re on the right track. Some ideas that come to mind: Buying products at local auctions and selling them online (on amazon or ebay). Your $1000 investment can potentially turn into $2000-$3000 this way if you have done your research well. You have to do a lot of research to find an item category that yields high margins but it\u2019s definitely possible.Running an etsy business. You can buy a 3-d printer, or fancy printer, or alike and produce high quality crafts for people on etsy. I know this is very possible because my mother-in-law is doing it in her late 60s.Learning web-design and creating lead generation sites for industries that are currently paying high commissions for such leads (Solar, Mortgage, Lending, \u2026). This is more time consuming at the beginning but can definitely pay off.Producing YouTube content relevant to content ad-buyers are willing to pay good money for. This is something people don\u2019t pay too much attention to but if you\u2019re in it to make money, your content should be relevant to what advertiser are paying for. I like this one because it also teaches you how to produce content which is becoming more and more important.Anyway, I can go on, but that\u2019s a start. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve reviewed some of the previous responses, and they are helpful. However, I think there is a need to provide much more detail, and shed some light on other opportunities available out there. If you are teenager today, chances are that you have 1. Access to the internet, 2. mobile device, and 3. Have awareness to social media. These are all the tool you need to start reselling sneakers online. I acknowledge you might not have tons of capital, but this business model can help you acquire it in a short amount of time (if you play your cards right). Reselling sneakers has changed my life. Although I did not start as a teenager, it has brought a significant amount of extra income, knowledge in how to start a business, and how to apply stock investment techniques on other markets. This is a business opportunity that anyone can start, however, it does require work and research upfront (at least until you understand the market). If you understand trends in the sneaker market, you are a step ahead of me when I started. If you have no idea about sneakers, don\u2019t worry, I will guide you on how to understand this culture, to be an effective reseller. I will summarize the three things you need to do to make thousands of dollars reselling sneakers. I cover this topic extensively on my blog post, where I provide a step by step walk-through on how to resell sneakers, however, I will keep it high level here. These are the 3 things that you need to follow to become a profitable sneaker reseller: Educate Yourself On the Sneaker Market first, Then Buy Merchandise:Understand which shoes give you the best resell profit. This will help you save time, and money. Familiarize yourself with selling platforms such as StockX and GOAT.Understand the sneaker market, and make sure you know what are people buying today. This TED talk on youtube from StockX founder helped me understand how big the Sneaker Market is.Understand l Demand For The Sneakers That You Are Looking to ResellEvaluate sales history, and price paid by buyers.Review social media to understand what potential buyers are saying about upcoming sneaker releases.Define Your Desired Profit Margin, And Stick To it. Do Not Sell Your Self Short To Make A ProfitIf you have a good sneaker for resell, do not resell for a quick price. This will only make you work harder to make a significant profit.Ask yourself: \u201cAre You The Winner or The Loser In The Transaction?\u201d This question will help you think of pros and cons to understand if the trade makes sense.Let me know guys if this helps. I have much more information, and would be happy to get into more discussions/questions on this topic. ",

            "answer_text": "If your criterion is lucrativeness, there\u2019s a general way to make money that\u2019s custom-made for minors: any illegal business. The reason is that if you get caught, the law goes much easier on minors, which is why so much of the business is farmed out to them. This is not the best way by other criteria you may have, however, because it has limited opportunity to carry over to adult life. If you want to get into a \u201clegitimate\u201d (i.e. legal) ine of work later on, it provides no useful job or character references. A friend has a great story about someone he met in addiction rehab. That person was not an addict, but was treated as one for purposes of getting out of legal trouble stemming from the narcotics business. Counselors were in a terrible position to have to explain to this person, a minor, that his future was dismal compared to his past, whether he tried to go legit or not. For you see, up to that point he was fabulously successful, had a great consumption-oriented lifestyle, and had great influence over powerful people for certain purposes \u2014 that is, on his say-so, he could have had his counselor killed! He was used to being treated with a type of respect that was the opposite of what those his age usually received. Yet he was totally unprepared for a \u201clegitimate\u201d life, which would be relatively dull, unremunerative, and in which he would be of low status. He didn\u2019t even have much in the way of conventional education or skills \u2014 although at his age, he wouldn\u2019t be expected to yet. Still, he would have to be receptive to gaining those skills, and making up some lost ground to do so. He\u2019d have to leave the relationships that made him so powerful. If he instead tried to return to that world, he\u2019d be marked by both law enforcement and gangsters as a person to watch out for, so he didn\u2019t really have a future there. But since he wasn\u2019t really an addict, even the possibility of continuing as an institutionalized, disabled individual was not a realistic one. He was of normal intelligence \u2014 not brilliant, not retarded. He would have a horrible and probably short life in prison were he to go that route, and his circumstances were such that he had no great information to trade that would earn him a setup in a new identity in witness protection.

So start here to get a good foundation. 10 books about money that should be taught in school but arent: www.cashflowlifestyle.net/books These books are amazing, and will get your brain juices flowing. It might not seem like it for you today, but making money is really not that difficult. Your first business is the toughest, and your 10th one is much easier, and your 25th one is basically automatic.  Also remember THERE IS NO FAILURE.  If you start a business that builds websites for people and it fails, so what! You now know how to make websites, have some experience with sales, plus all the other lessons you learned will all be helpful in your NEXT business.  Being a teenager with access to a computer and the internet means your options are limitless.  Your next step should be to check out Udemy.com (go there right now! they are having a huge sale) This site is amazing. You can learn anything you want on any topic. What are you interested in? Learn everything you can about it.  Basic needs for starting and growing a successful business: - public speaking skills - sales skills- networking skills (connecting others) Other than this, you can create a business doing anything! Remember, focus on trying to generate $100 a month, then $1000. You dont need to build the next Facebook or Google. But if you can create a couple streams of income at about $1000/month each then you will be living an amazing life!

            "answer_text": "The quickest, easiest and free way to make money (or rather points that you can later exchange on PayPal) is Swagbucks. Basically, you do what you already do online, search for stuff, watch movies/trailers, shop online etc. It doesn\u2019t really require much energy or time on your part. It ACTUALLY doesn\u2019t require any $ from you, in fact you will be getting paid using this search system, moreover you should receive a $5 bonus just for signing up (at least the bonus still existed in 2016). However, SB works only in the following countries: USA, UK, Canada, Australia and Ireland. Possibly India and Germany too (still yet to confirm). Here is an article for further details. BUT if you are looking for making consistent income in the long run, I suggest building your own profitable website. The BASIC process of making money online with a blog/website (most people tend to over-complicate it):  (Image may be copyrighted, so don\u2019t use it for your blogs). An example from the article \u201cTo Build Or To Not Build? How To Create A Website For Free, From Scratch\u201d on how this works: \u201cFirst thing that you should understand is that there are 3.75 billion people online who always search stuff on the Internet and are ready to buy things. Before they enter the \u201cbuying\u201d phase, first, they need to find out what exactly is it that they want, where they can get it and why should they get it. Basically, they are doing their research and this is where your website comes in to HELP them make a decision. Let me give you an example. Let\u2019s say I want to search for \u201cwhat are the best blenders\u201d. I type this question in Google and what I see is your website, which provides a list of top 5 blenders that you recommend with the reasons why you recommend them. Within your list, you include your affiliate link (for example, from Amazon or ClickBank in your case) and if I found your review helpful and made an informed decision, I may as well go ahead to Amazon (Clickbank product) and buy one of the blenders you recommended. This way everybody is happy. I am happy that I finally found a helpful review and bought a blender that I am going to use; Amazon is happy because they had a sale (thanks to you); you are happy because you got an Amazon commission for the product that I just bought. By the way, if I bought not just a blender but anything else within 24 hours after following your link, then you will get even more commissions. Win-win situation. The best part of having an online business is that you will genuinely be helping people by offering them proper information and earning money in the process. So, this is the very basic process of making money online.\u201d I hope this gives you a clear understanding of how affiliate marketing (promoting Amazon products to your visitors) with your own website works. Please understand that even though this way of making money takes time and is a PROCESS really, it is a legit and absolutely legal way to make money online. The article \u201cTo Build Or To Not Build? How To Create A Website For Free, From Scratch.\u201d touches on 4 topics that not all newbies online may have knowledge of: understanding how to make money online,why having a website is the foundation for a successful online business,how to create a website for free, from scratch in the easiest way possible (and have access to a 10-lesson course for free),and how and where to receive proper education and guidance if you TRULY want to succeed online.If this is something that interests you to learn about, further details are here. Online success varies from one person to another, but I do know a few people who achieved success in the 3\u20136 months range. They worked their butts of to get to where they are now. Recently I re-shared a post on GooglePlus about Top 5 Successful Stories from Wealthy Affiliates, who make money online (sometimes even more than $5,000). Actually, their websites are their full-time income now. Don\u2019t get me wrong though - what they do is a PROCESS, they all started with nothing and it took them time, patience, proper guidance and hard work to build a profitable online business. Read their stories, they might inspire you. Some people don\u2019t like the idea of having a website and it taking some time to make money with. One of the programs I\u2019ve tried is OSP and I know people who promote it ONLY on Instagram and Facebook and make lots of money with it - personally I had more success with other programs, but click here for further details on how OSP works - maybe it will be your favorite option. I hope I could help and please do ask if you have any questions! ",

            "answer_text": "HOW TO MAKE MONEY AS A TEENAGER Well for as long as I\u2019m concerned, you can argue but I think teenagers often have a very strong desire to spend from their pockets. So here are five ways you can start making money as a teenager. Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest ways to make money online. It is simply the model where you partner with businesses or companies ,get a unique link or code , and receive commissions when someone clicks through your link to make a purchase of the product or service. What\u2019s even crazier is that some businesses have what we call \u201crecurring commission\u201d. These occurs when the service or product you promote are subscription based. This means that the person you linked to the business will be rebilled each time the subscription for the product or service expires. The rebilling therefore means that you also as the affiliate will get paid each time the subscriber is rebilled for the product or service. This is one way to start making passive income. refer one time, get paid as long as the user keeps using the service or product. Personally, this are the type of programs I go for. check out 78 Best Affiliate Programs For Making Recurring Revenue Online (2020). How then do you make the sales, Are you going to text everyone you have in your phone contact to click the link and make the sales, chances are none of them will buy. So the next thing is getting your link out to people who actually may be interested in the product you promote. One way to do this is to create content that relate with the product you\u2019re promoting. By creating content I mean you could start something like blogging, or vlogging(video creation) that relate with the product or service you promote. For example , if you\u2019re promoting fitness products , you can write blog posts that advice people on hot they can stay fit or tips to stay fit. You can get ideas for topics to blog about from Quora . Also you can get topics on this cool site which I\u2019ve actually used: Search listening tool for market, customer & content research. When you get traffic to your blog, you could either send them directly to your offers or use the traffic to build a list or even do both. I strongly recommend you do both especially building a list because this means you can retarget this people later. This is called lead generation. read more about it here: Lead generation . Another place you can get your links out is on youtube, you don\u2019t even need to create videos yourself, here\u2019s how to get already made made videos to build your content. Go to youtubeSearch for videos about your nichefilter the videos for creative commons(Free to use for commercial without youtube penalizing you)Download the videos and reupload on you channel and add a description which should include your affiliate link.There\u2019s nothing wrong with uploading 5\u201310 videos on your youtube channel before even ranking or looking for traffic. Read here how you can rank your youtube videos fast: 6 Hacks: How to Rank YouTube Videos Fast. Another hack is to use Quora to get traffic to either you blog or youtube videos, search for good questions that have a good following that are related to your niche answer questions and also drop links to your blog and also you can embed your videos which means that your video would have direct traffic and views from Quora. Quora would also push your answers up because it values visuals like videos and images now. Some affiliate marketing programs you could sign up for are : Amazon.com Associates Central, ClickBank , JVZoo etc. Print on demand business  Print on demand business is one the easiest models of business out there, given the fact that you basically don\u2019t have to spend. All you need to do is make a design of a t-shirt and you could display it on your site or even social media profile. once there\u2019s demand for it, you send the design for a company who\u2019d print the designed t-shirt out and ship it out to the customer. Then you get paid as the designer. mostly the pay is at 50% depending on the company you\u2019re dealing with. It is as easy as that and a risk free business model out there. It is also the easy way to start and e-commerce business. You can boost your sales by using influencers on your social media platform, who\u2019re dealing with your niche. the ideal influencer for this would be ones dealing with fashion and clothing. pay them the little fee and the promote your brand to their followers which I\u2019m sure won\u2019t be an easy task for you to build. For this kind of business I recommend using Instagram as it is thriving on stuffs like this. Here are platforms to find influencers ready to work with you :Top Influencer Marketing Platforms to Boost your Campaigns (Updated 2020). This is one way to start a real business , I recommend you have a landing page or a blog at least where you can build your list (Lead generation) to retarget people who visit your blog or landing page. Why should you build list for retargeting? This is because research has it that 90% of those who visit a flat website don\u2019t visit again. So it\u2019s important to find a way to trap your visitors and keep in touch as well as market to them later. Read everything there is to know about lead generation: Lead generation. Dropservicing business  Dropservicing is similar to the famous dropshipping as a business model. But as the name implies , you are rendering servicing. personally I am a champion if this business model because it is a business I started with literally nothing. Here is how it works, for example you parade yourself as an agency that designs graphics for clients, you get a project, outsource it to freelancers who often charge way cheaper than the agreement between you and the client. pay of the freelancers and keep the big profit for doing nothing. Like dropshipping where you don\u2019t own the product, In dropservicing too, you don\u2019t actually render the service. Read Dropservicing. This business will literally give you passive income and you can start as small as you want to scaling up to becoming 6\u20137 figure earner. You could even get to a point where you run ads and getting clients through a sales funnel on autopilot without tweaking or touching anything. First you are adviced to start off with just one service so you can easily become an authority in that. You don\u2019t need to be Jack of all trade ,pick a particular service to render for clients. You can specifically deal with facebook ads service for clients. In fact you could deal with a particular kind of business. Like running facebook ads for dentists. Sounds crazy but it one way to become the go-to for businesses like this. Freelancing  Freelancer is one of the ways you can use to make money online. Whatever skill you have, chances are there\u2019s someone on the net looking for services from you. From easier to render services like graphic designing and logo making to web/app development. To start , you want to sign up as a freelancer in one of these : Hire Freelancers Online & Find Freelance Work , Your Access To This Website Has Been Blocked, In-demand talent on demand.\u2122 Upwork is how.\u2122 . Start taking easier jobs that may not actually pay as high as your dream job first in order to get some reviews and build your profile stronger. With time , you\u2019ll be able to land those high paying jobs that would make you feel more relaxed and fulfilled. I know At least 5 freelancers who have earned $100k in a single year. So you want to go out there and build an image for yourself first, then go for the high ticket jobs. The big clients who actually spend more usually want someone with some proof of work or portfolio. Read how How To Become A Successful Freelancer: A 5-Step Guide. Dropshipping Business  Dropshipping has been around for years and has produced millionaires over the years of it\u2019s existence. It is the business model where you set up a store and List products from a supplier and fulfill the orders when someone buys and the supplier handles the shipping while you keep the sales profit. For example you list a mug sold by a supplier for $5 as $10\u2013$15 , when an order is made, you redirect the order to the supplier and the supplier ships the product to the buyer. The most common platforms for dropshippers to build their stores are Shopify and Wordpress. while the most common supplier of dropshipping products is aliexpress. Though most people claim the business model is long dead and replaced by the new dropservicing, it is still very much alive and people are still making thousands of dollars every month. Know what products are trending , you can do some product research and build your store based on your research. Driving traffic through the same method as dropservicing, if you have a small capital to run ads on facebook , that would help because paid ads is always a quicker way to generate sales. Conclusion These are my favorite ways anyone can jump in and start making money, notice I haven\u2019t included stuffs like online survey. I only write about stuffs I know, I heard it easy but never tried it, not once . Besides you can not earn a living with that, perhaps good if you want pocket money. Abasiama Nyong. ",

I am Italian so the market could be a little different, but I saw American people did the same thing, so I suppose it will work for you as well. Start searching for some items on Facebook marketplace or other free marketplaces online. Here comes the big part: On eBay, you can immediately see if is worth buying an item to sell it. For example, search for \u201cPlaystation 2\u201d and then (in the filters) click on \u201cSell items\u201d eBay will show you: How many of those products were been soldThe frequency they have been soldHow much money people are paying for those itemsThat\u2019s all you have to see for understanding if is worth it. You don\u2019t need to buy those items, just make a listing on eBay At the moment you sell it contact the seller and tell him that the courier will get the package. N\u00b02 I repeat the process until I have some listings so I can start investing 20% of my time in testing products in dropshipping. It means I make some listing of new products I don\u2019t have but that I saw from other suppliers online. It\u2019s complicated to find a product to sell in dropshipping, but once you did it, you make more profit then flipping. N\u00b03 I would start making 3 easy listings and waiting 24 hours to see how they perform. At the same time, I continue flipping items. N\u00b04 If one product has more than 30 visits I can keep it. If it doesn\u2019t, I delete it and I try another item. While I\u2019m doing this I start to understand which market niche is more interesting. N\u00b05 At the moment I find the product that works with dropshipping I will spend \u20ac5 in Facebook ADS to make traffic on my listing. I don\u2019t want that people buy my item, I just want a lot of people landing on my listing so my ranking on eBay will improve. The more I sell the more I spend. N\u00b06 Repeat the process until you are good with it :) ",

            "answer_text": "Probably by starting a simple service-oriented business like housecleaning or lawn maintenance, taking it very seriously, and establishing a reputation for quality and reliability. It may not be a lot of money at first, but if the business is expertly managed, it will grow and can lead to what is, for most teenagers, a lot of money. 50K to 200K is easily possible within 3\u20135 years. The keys to success will be maintaining focus (especially as the bank account swells) and learning as much as possible about business and investment. For instance, it will be necessary to learn how to track and manage expenses; hire and schedule employees, market to obtain new business as the workforce grows, and much else besides. Understand that as a young person, you actually have a tremendous competitive advantage in that you should have more energy and a greater store of good health than someone older. That means that getting up early and working hard all day is not going to impact you all that much. You will also find that there is nothing the world loves more than seeing a young, ambitious person on their way up, and people will reward you for your success by using and recommending your services. But no matter what happens, don\u2019t get distracted if you really want to maximize your success. This will be hard to do because as a young person, you are still at the stage where new experiences of all kind are irresistible. Expect temptation in many guises to come your way, and it is your job to avoid them if at all possible. Stay away from drugs and alcohol. Avoid people who want to go out partying all the time. Avoid people who want to borrow money. Just get up early every day, work hard and save your money, and eventually, you\u2019ll have plenty of it. ",

But, for the sake of writing down more options, I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re at least sixteen. End goal? Do you just want to make money? Stockpile it? Are you saving up for something? Learn how to budget. Instead of going to the mall with your entire credit card, pull off only a hundred and give yourself a limit. Don\u2019t spend on impulse. Before you buy something, ask yourself how often you\u2019ll actually use it and if you\u2019ll need it. Get a job. This one is pretty basic and obvious, but that\u2019s only because it\u2019s the best answer. Since you\u2019re a minor, you won\u2019t get so many hours that you get overwhelmed, and you\u2019ll have quite a few days off in comparison to your adult counterparts. But you\u2019ll still get some good moo-lah. I\u2019m earning at least 200$ a week. Make money off of your passions. Do you like to draw? Do commissions. I draw, and the most I\u2019ve earned in one week is 60$. Which doesn\u2019t seem like much, but it all adds up. Plus, with sixty bucks, you can six several DVD\u2019s of Shrek the Third, so\u2026 Or, do you play music? Play at a party or something. Sports? Help out a couch. Side hustles can be fun and encouraging anyway for whatever you want to do in life. Even a ten year old could do it. Still not satisfied with both your job and your side hustle? Mow the lawn. Put up a drink stand. Sell weed (jk, jk, only if it\u2019s legal in your area\u2026). Sell homemade cookies. Remake! You can get charms from Hobby Lobby for 5$ and multiple ribbons from Dollar Tree for 1$ a piece. Make chokers and sell them all for 10$ or so. Or, just remake anything. Sometimes, you gotta spend money to make money, and there are a number of crafts and things you can invest in to get back what you spent plus some. Local thrift stores. Sometimes, certain stores will pay you for donations. Not all of them, so be sure to ask before you go in toting all the books you don\u2019t read and demanding money for it. Internet. You can also always make and sell/sell products. Old shoes? Sell em. You made a bracelet? Sell it? It\u2019s what etsy and ebay are for, dude. Ask the school! You could peer tutor.

            "answer_text": "There are several ways of making money using internet, the very powerful medium created by the wonder of programming the web.  Building websites and providing SEO services, as other's have mentioned, is one of the sure shot ways of making a good income online. If you are not built for the learning curve and wish to earn money online without having to learn the skills and technology, there are opportunities which you can take advantage of and build a phenomenal business for yourself. Incomes are of two types, linear and leverage. Linear income: Working for yourself and by yourself and if your income is based on your efforts alone, that is linear income. If you work, you generate income. If you stop working for whatever reason, you could be on vacation or down with sickness or busy attending an emergency situation or any other emergency, the income stops and the client base that you build may tend to fade away.   Leverage income: All corporations are leverage based systems. They incorporate and appoint CEO, CFO, Managers and team leaders and the entire team is monitored by board of directors. This is like an auto-pilot system where the founder's involvement is limited but will earn the dividends from the business. But the investment might be in millions of dollars and not many have that kind of money for investment. There is a less risky way of doing business and taking advantage of the same kind of auto-pilot business system. Network Marketing (also known as Multi - level marketing) is the name. On YouTube you will see several motivational leaders of very high repute and extraordinarily successful. Some of those leader's are: Les Brown, Jim Rohn, Mike Dillard and Eric Worre to name a few. These people have built very huge businesses which generated the kind of income which gave them opportunities not only to become financially successful but also gave them the opportunity to follow their passions. If we study the economic history, we have seen the industrial revolution in the past. People would join an manufacturing industry and work there for 35 years and retire from work. In the present scenario, this kind of job security no longer exists. People never know when they might be shows the exit door. No industry of jobs have a secure cover. People constantly work in fear and uncomfortable mindset scared of losing their job. We as human beings have a higher purpose in life. If a job is not what you are made for, look around and there might be other opportunities that might interest you. Selling of digital products is BIG now. With the momentum created by companies like Amazon, eBay and similar successful companies, brick and motor stores and not running as successful like in the past. People are buying almost anything on the internet. Imagine, groceries are also being delivered to people's doorsteps which options of return as well. Follow your passions and live your dreams. ",

So, why not put some of your knowledge to good use and teach others? Working as a tutor is a great way for college students to make money by educating others in the field they feel comfortable in.

Choose from the million products available on Amazon and post links on your site, if someone clicks through and makes a purchase you\u2019ll be given up to 10% of the price.Write and publish a kindle book: Students are a creative and interesting bunch and nearly all of you will have a story to tell . Everyone has an idea for a novel - so why not get yours out there? It takes less than five minutes to get your book published on amazon (although it takes a bit longer to write) and you could keep up to 70% off the profits.Babysitting: Well, it is only suitable for the girls but there are so many chances to make the money. It has been noticed that babysitting jobs are very attractive for the girls who don\u2019t want to go outside to earn money. In this field there is a great fun and excitement for the girls. Try it in order to see what is really attractive.",

            "answer_text": "It is great when teen\u2019s take an active interest in learning how to make money. However, it should be noted that what has worked for one individual may not work for another as everyone is unique and everyone\u2019s situation is equally unique. I think that it is great when individuals share their experiences from the standpoint of offering ideas to provide direction and perspective. However, there is always a lot of important information that is left out of such shared suggestions. This is a major reason why it is important to work with mentorship. Of course that requires one to find the right mentorship to help them successfully achieve their objectives and goals. This is important because the majority of mentors available to teens have their own agendas, ideas, and objectives. Parents what what they want what they believe is best for their teens. Schools, are trying to steer students towards, and help them find careers. And pastors, are focused on the spiritual well being of their teens. This is not bad, however, it may not be what the teen is looking for after all teens are still trying to figure themselves out at this time of life. Teens are also not always open to listening to adults much less mentors, and are not likely to be able to afford the mentorship needed to achieve their objectives and goals. Much less to help them develop the mindset and skillsets necessary to achieve a sustainable secure lifestyle, career and wealth they desire and dream about achieving. That is one of the reasons why I started Strategic Life, Entrepreneurship, & Wealth Consulting, (SLEW-C) to provide mentorship and consulting services to those who want and need it but cannot afford it. Teens can sign up at slew-c.com and receive free mentoring online. There are a lot of variables that go into suggesting applicable opportunities to teens, this is why you will not see me making suggestions to people as to what the best way to make money is. The best way for anyone to make money regardless of age and gender is to monetize your passions, interests and skills. ",

            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s world opens up lots of opportunities for teenagers. The list of young successful entrepreneurs is long. There are many names like Chris Phillips, the founder of Dot5Hosting, who had made his first million by the age of 18, and, of course, Mark Zukerberg, who came into money while studying at college. The point is, all of their achievements have become possible due to the opportunities the Internet has brought about. Here are some ways you could use to make money online as a teenager: 1. Online surveys One of the easiest ways to make some extra money for teenagers is taking part in online surveys. This is the most precious thing for companies. It\u2019s necessary to know it for improving their products and working out marketing strategies. The good news for teens is that companies need this information so much that they\u2019re ready to pay money to find it out. Websites like Swagbucks, MyPoints and CashCrate allow you to take part in different surveys, play online games and watch videos, etc. For this, you get some points which you may trade in for cash or gift cards later. This way of making money online is the least demanding, it won\u2019t bring you much money, though. 2. Freelance platforms Do you have a talent for writing or drawing? Enjoy doing it? Before the Internet broke the mold, your relatives could have told you off for spending your time on these tasks. Now, you could turn your passion into your bread and butter. If you can draw, write or know how to code, online platforms for freelancers open up great opportunities for you. Websites like Fiverr and Upwork give you a hand in the search of people who need your talents and knowledge. There, you may find plenty of orders including design, copywriting, web development and so on. The registration there is free. Yet, you must pay some fees from each order for using these platforms. 3. E-commerce platforms If writing and drawing aren\u2019t your cup of tea but you\u2019re good at creating things, then you could also make money online. You may simply sell your crafts or artworks by using online e-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon or Etsy. The beauty of these websites is that you don\u2019t need to look for buyers. They\u2019re already there \u2013 these e-commerce platforms are well-known and have loads of visitors every day. However, the level of competition there is really high. And probably, at this point of your life, you don\u2019t have efficient tools to stand out from your rivals. Anyway, if you\u2019re sure that your products are special, you could give it a try. 4. Tutorial websites If you\u2019re young, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t teach people something. Many websites are ready to hire teenagers as tutors. So, if you\u2019ve got good knowledge of a subject, you\u2019re welcome. You could register on the platforms like Tutor and Chegg and help people in their learning. So, if you think that teaching people is your calling, this way of making money is fit for you. 5. Dropshipping business For dropshipping, you don\u2019t need to buy goods in advance and store them. The things you need are your website to promote the products and reliable business partner who takes care of the rest of the tasks. Not bad, right? As you\u2019ve said you are interested in starting a dropshipping store. I firstly recommend you read this guide: How to Start Your SuccessfulDropshipping Business. Dropshipping model is profitable, easily scalable and, most importantly, affordable. Thus, even teenagers could take a stab at it. So, if you\u2019re a teen dreaming of getting to the list of young successful entrepreneurs, dropshipping is a way to pull it off. ",

            "answer_text": "At the risk of sounding old fashioned, nothing wrong with earning a little sweat equity. If you live in a place where grass grows whether people want it to or not, mow yards. Not glamorous or necessarily fun, (though I certainly preferred it to any of the min wage style \u201cteenager friendly\u201d jobs I ever had), but that\u2019s the good part, people will pay you well, really well, if you\u2019re willing to do the job for them and do quality job in a reliable and trustworthy fashion. The older couple who lived across the street from me growing up paid me on several occasions to mow their yard, it was a pretty good sized yard, probably took me 2 hours of pushing a beat up old push mower around, but you know what? $60 seemed more than worth it! I could spend my entire saturday doing mind-numbing work at min wage and not make that much, plus I did it on my schedule, I got to be outside, earbuds in my ears listening to a ball game or music or whatever, and not one person interrupted me the whole time. If I had it to do over again I would have drug that old mower and a can of gasoline up and down my neighborhood making $25/hr mowing yards every weekend instead of working the lousy jobs I did. I had a buddy a year or two younger than me who did just this starting when we were in high school. Started off just looking to make some gas money, built up a decent client base over a summer through word of mouth, a year or two later had bought some pro-grade equipment and a trailer and was hiring friends of his to work for him because he had more work than he could possibly manage. By the time he was in college his lawn care business was doing well enough that I believe he was seriously tempted to quit the whole college charade and just become one of the major local businesses of this sort in our town of ~100,000 people. He ended up graduating and moving on to better things, but there are many worse ways to make some bucks as a teen than finding 3 or 4 people in your neighborhood who will pay you $40-$100 weekly to spend a few hours keeping their yards looking good. Plus you get a tan, get some exercise, and get to know the satisfaction and good night\u2019s sleep that comes with a day spent doing physical labor. ",

            "answer_text": " There are many ways to make money as a teenager. Of course you could work for someone else but where\u2019s the fun in that? Building your own business is something you should consider instead. I mean, think about it. If you start a business when you\u2019re 15, 16 or 19 and do the right things, it\u2019s absolutely possible for you to retire at 30, 35. Sure, you\u2019ll have to make some sacrifices (fewer parties, wake up early during week-ends, less holidays\u2026) but always keep this in mind : \u201cEntrepreneurship is living a few years of your life like most people won\u2019t, so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people can\u2019t.\u201d The earlier you start the better off you\u2019ll be. So let\u2019s see what businesses you can start when you are a teenager. Build a profitable blog  Building a profitable blog is a great way for teenagers to make money because you almost don\u2019t need any money to start. You just need 3 things to create a profitable blog: A domain nameA hostAn email service provider (Mailchimp, Aweber, ConvertKit\u2026)(total cost= around $40/month) Building a profitable blog is easy. All you have to do is to choose a profitable niche, build a highly engaged email list and sell your subscribers products and services they need and want. If you do that, it\u2019s impossible to fail, trust me. Your email list is the key part of this process. It must always be your priority when building your blog. No matter what you do (create content, guest post, podcast\u2026) you must always focus on the growth of your email list. Because with a highly engaged email list, you can make thousands of dollar every month. If you want to build a profitable blog, I recommend you to join my newsletter (it\u2019s free). Every month you\u2019ll learn how to create a blog, drive traffic, build an email list and more. I\u2019d be more than happy to help you :) Build something and sell it  If you are a creative teenager and like to build stuff, you can create your own physical products and sell them on Etsy. How do you promote your stuff? Instagram. If you sell jewellery for example, go to Instagram, find influencers that love fashion and that have many followers. Reach out to these influencers and offer them your jewellery for free. In exchange, ask them to post one or two pictures of themselves with your jewellery to promote your product. Don\u2019t forget to add the link of your Etsy shop in the description of your Instagram profile. That should make you a few thousands dollar a month. Want more? This article will inspire you. Flee market flipping Flee market flipping is also a great way for teenagers to make money quickly. The process is simple: Step 1: You go to flee markets, thrift stores or auctionStep 2: Find items that look expensive or weirdStep 3: You check the price of these items on eBay, AmazonStep 4: You negotiate the price with the vendor (that\u2019s an important step if you overspend to get the item you\u2019ll lose moneyStep 5: Buy the items if you are in the same ballparkStep 6: Sell the item on eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, FacebookThis guy follows these exact step and make $42,000/year working 5\u201310 hours a week. Hope it helps! ",

Boxes, beds, bureaus, you name it, I\u2019ve moved it during high school. People are always moving, and once you get a reputation as someone who can move stuff, you\u2019ll get referred to others.Yard work- This one is pretty straightforward, and depending on your geography is more or less available.Random tasks. I answered a question recently where I told the story about how I dug up and replaced a drainage system in a driveway. Stuff like that always needs to get done. I started getting those jobs after I sent out a few emails letting people know I could do things for them.It\u2019s really not that hard to make money as a teenager, you just need to make it a priority. To have a job I had to give up hours of hanging around aimlessly. I had to give up the social time of every school day. I got some calluses on my hands, dirt on my shoes, and sore backs on many Monday mornings after a weekend of various jobs. I also had to just get over my fear of \u201ccold-emailing\u201d. A lot of people think, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have those opportunities.\u201d Well if you make it a priority, and you figure out what exactly is preventing you from that (Are you afraid of reaching out for people? Do you need to get a work slip signed? Do you want more time with your friends?). Best of luck to all, hope that helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Here I discuss The 12 Best Ways to Make Extra Money in 2017 Online surveysAn increasingly popular way for students to make money is to fill out online surveys in their spare time. Research companies are always recruiting new members to answer surveys and test new products.  For a few minutes of form filling, you can make a couple of quid which is paid as cash or rewards. You can bag up to \u00a33 ($5) for some surveys! Paid for searching the webInterested in earning cash for doing what you already do online? This has to be one of the easiest methods of making money online without really any effort or change in your behavior. Online market trading The historically hard-to-break world of investing in stock markets and currencies has been cracked wide open. Today there is no need to be a fat cat or fund the yachts of Wolf of Wall Street style stock brokers. You can do it all yourself with the help of online market trading platforms. Start your own websiteInterested in generating passive income? You need a website. It\u2019s THE way to make money while you sleep. Starting a website takes less than 20 minutes, costs hardly anything and can be done by an 82 year-old . It only takes a bit of plugging on social media to get your first visitors, and there are plenty of ways to monetise your site. Review websites & apps for cashWell it seems like you\u2019re pretty nifty with a web browser, so perhaps it\u2019s time to turn pro and browse websites as a paid and fun job! The \u2018Disney Vault\u2019 secretTo keep demand high across generations, Disney Studios carefully restrict the supply of some home release classics. They are locked away in the \u2018vault\u2019 for 8-10 years before being released for a short unspecified time. Buy them in this window at normal retail price and you can turn a nice profit when they go off sale for another decade or so. Get Paid To\u2019 sitesSimilar to making money from online surveys, GPT sites reward you in cash and vouchers for completing various offers or activities online. Write and publish a Kindle eBookIf students are good at anything, it\u2019s researching and writing. With the Amazon Kindle store , anyone can publish an eBook and make money. And the Kindle app is now available on almost any device (laptops, iPads, smartphones and yes, Kindles) so your global market is huge! List your book for \u00a31.49 \u2013 \u00a36.99 and you earn 70% of the sale. Considering Amazon is the ultimate selling machine (and remember people are looking to spend), that is a fantastic deal. Affiliate marketingIf you\u2019ve got a good presence on social media or perhaps you even have a blog or website, you can start bringing in money immediately by promoting all sorts of companies, products, services and offers online. Become a \u2018Clickworker\u2019The clickworker concept is based on \u2018internet crowd-sourcing\u2019 where businesses advertise specific, scalable tasks they need completing quickly. And for us, it\u2019s an easy way to make fast cash from our couch. A part-time jobA part-time job is the obvious first choice, opted for by most students looking to supplement their student loan. It provides a pretty steady flow of income and can enable you to gain valuable work experience. Gigs on FiverrFiverr is now the world\u2019s largest marketplace for people to make money selling small services (known as \u2018gigs\u2019). What you offer could be absolutely anything, from writing and translating, playing pranks and teaching to voiceovers and short video clips for people all around the world! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, making money is a destination that has numerous routes, and one may come up with a lot of options ahead of the existing usual suspects.  Image Courtesy: How To Mint Money Teenager or not, making money is the same for everyone. All you need is an undying passion with a clear goal, and the ability to work hard, irrespective of the countless obstacles you may face. Coming to the point, as I said before, there are plenty of ways for one to make money, and in a legal and transparent way. I\u2019ll list down a few easy ones that won't take any investment to begin with. A Blog : Starting a blog is the easiest way to start generating revenue. A blog can be about multiple topics (Buzzfeed) or about a particular niche (Codename Apple). Either way, the content you create would help you build a massive user base in time, with which you would be able to generate revenue. The most successful ones make six digit revenues a month.Internships : Interning is one of the easiest way to earn some money, and it could open up a whole new world of endless possibilities and opportunities. You may earn some stipend to begin with, and eventually you stand a great chance to get employed in the same company, full time. You could also be exposed to brilliant minds within the company, and you may find yourself in a pool of new opportunities or as a co-founder of your own new company with one of them.Affiliate Marketing : This is an area which is very well connected to a blog, and your expertise in a niche could help you earn money by selling products in that niche. For example, Codename Apple generates its revenue with Amazon Affiliates, and is doing really well. Once you have a decent user base, you need not worry much about generating revenue; for the visitors would be doing the job themselves. This is far better than advertising, and even blogs with low visitor count do extremely well in this area.Write a Book : This one may take up quite a bit of time, but if you have the writer in you with an imaginative mind, start penning your thoughts immediately. Make up a wonderful story, or write about something that you are knowledgable and passionate about. It can be about relationships, technology, a war thriller, a \u2018how to make money\u2019 guide or anything. Next, get it to a publisher, get it published and cross your fingers. If it becomes a best seller, you might find yourself become a millionaire!Freelance : I cannot stress this point enough. This is not just for teenagers, but for anyone who wishes to make money. If you have a skill, advertise it, work, and make money. The best way to start would be to have a word of mouth publicity. Also, you could sign up for freelancing websites like Freelancer, Upwork and Fiverr and start making money quickly. This can be done from the comfort of your home and elsewhere, and you could make a lot of money with this. You might as well freelance full time!YouTube : Become a YouTuber! All you need is a video camera, and the ability to speak in front of it. Pick up a niche, and start right away. Once you have a significant number of views and subscribers, monetise the channel. It would take time, but it would boost in case you went viral!Surveys : Websites like Valued Opinions pay you to take part in their surveys, which is an easy way to make money online.You also have other ways to make money, which might take a bit more expertise and capital to begin with. They are: The Next Big Thing : An idea, which might change or disrupt an entire industry. Probably the next Facebook, or the next Dropbox. Or a completely new animal in itself. There is no limit to this, just an idea. Develop and evolve, and make it the next unicorn!Consultancy : Consultancy has been a dark horse in this world, and this is a tremendous way to generate a lot of money. The only things you need to succeed in this is incredible knowledge coupled with skills and the right contacts. It is difficult at the beginning, because you won\u2019t be trusted because of your age. But gradually, this will improve, and you may be making tons of money.I hope this solves your query. My best wishes. Thank you for the A2A, Rohit Dixit Cheers! ",

They are really great about bonuses and raises so I highly recommend working for them. HAVE A GREAT WORK ETHIC. there are so many hidden raises for those who have great work ethics (not at every company, some people are hellllllaaa cheap). Like I seriously cannot recommend five guys more. I got $0.50 raise for starting with the store+$100 bonus. This was 30shift bonus when I worked only weekends so I got it in 3.5 months You have 2\u20133 chances at a on shift bonus each week (that varies on store size but minimum of $250 between everyone on the shift). I got another $0.50 raise with the first because of my work ethic withing 5 months. Got another for my work ethic after 8 months ($11 total. min wage was 9.50 in mn in 2016). Made 11.50 at about the 1 year mark and had that until i left after 1.5 years. 11.50 for an 18 year old in high school was not too shabby. I would work for them again if I had too (I have a better paying job now). Sorry to make this about 5g but as a teen it was the greatest. PLUS FREE ON SHIFT MEALS (most locations). Met my boyfriend of almost 2 years there and its a tiny menu so not bad. ",

Nothing complicated, just your basic web dev. It\u2019ll take you a week to get to a good enough level to start making money. With simple code, you can build a website which is currently valued at Millions of Dollars the website is called y2mate. This is not a quick money scheme, but it is a way to generate multiple streams of income, in a way which ALSO TEACHES YOU A MARKETABLE SKILL  At the bottom of this answer, I have attached a video to help anyone get started. It goes through step by step the thought process behind how to select a potential app, the business side, and how to actually make it, the technical side. From there it\u2019s up to you to find an opportunity. Let me give some potential insights as to what opportunities exist. Let me make it clear, the indicators behind these opportunity spaces are high potential traffic, a low barrier to entry, and simple functionality required. To give some concrete examples, think about what free online tools you\u2019ve personally used in the last month online. These are things like an alarm clock, a digital timer, a tool to convert file formats, etc. These are all examples of tools that attract tons of organic traffic and therefore free money by imploying Google Adsense.

            "answer_text": "Set up shop in school. Most of the schools beyond elementary that i have seen are nearby a convenience store of some type. Schools also generally have a policy that once you are on campus, you must remain there (at least at lower grade levels) and so students who are bussed in are not allowed to cross the street to spend that sweet sweet pocket cash. You, a student who either arrives by foot (on a path of their own choice) or via parent (with a drop off spot arranged off campus) can be the link that people need to get their fix of Pringles, or Gummi Bears, or Dip Stix, or whatever ridiculous thing that your friends are into throwing money at. Hey a year ago, the market across from my school couldt keep fidget spinners in stock. Every morning someone would come in and but 10 or more. They would sell them for a buck more at school, and repeat the process. Even if you are a kiddo trapped on campus, it doesnt mean you can\u2019t serve the demand. Trips to your local market at night can get you the stock of goods that your less forward thinking classmates might really want after that 3rd period math class. You might even find a wholesale supplier is available, and then come real profit margins! Short answer, it doesnt matter how old you are. Buying low and selling high will always be a good business, as long as you can either create, or at least serve the demand. Note: Check your school policies before starting this full force, while it is unlikely that it is against the rules to sell items, it may be against the rules for you to have them in certain locations, and your choice of items could come under scrutiny. Keep it school safe! ",

This answer can be a resource for anyone and everyone looking to make a few hundred extra bucks on the weekend. As opposed to teaching you how to turn $100 into $1,000 or even $10 into $1,000, I\u2019m going to teach you how to turn $0 into $1,000. It\u2019s called the Craigslist \u201cfree\u201d section. Step 1: Go to Craigslist  Step 2: Under the \u201cfor sale\u201d tab, there\u2019s a section called \u201cfree\u201d. Click that.  Step 3: The \u201cfree\u201d section is where people list stuff that they want to get rid of; anything from an old couch or desk to an extra TV or set of dishes. Find someone with something that they don\u2019t want and that you think you could sell.  Step 4: Drive to the spot where they want you to pick it up (or take the bus if you don\u2019t have a car).  Step 5: Take their thing.  Step 6: Go back home.  Step 7: Take a picture of it.  Step 8: List it on Facebook Marketplace.  Step 9: When someone buys it, give it to them.  Step 10: Rinse, Repeat and start making money on the weekends: I\u2019m already anticipating someone to comment and say \u201cwell, it\u2019s going to take you 40 minutes to go pick it up, 40 minutes to get back home, and then 7 minutes to list it on Facebook Marketplace,\u201d but here\u2019s the thing, what are you doing with your time anyways? You\u2019re watching the fucking Spurs game. So, sure, it may take you 87 minutes to make that extra $20, but trust me, that\u2019s a whole lot better than doing whatever it is that you\u2019re doing otherwise. I really think that you can make an extra $300 a week. If you\u2019re taking you 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Monday and Tuesday to go pick stuff up, then listing it online throughout the week, and having people come to your house on Saturday to buy whatever you have listed, it honestly could end up being more than $300 a week. Don\u2019t believe me? Here is a video of me going through the same process I\u2019m telling you to do:  Hope this helps!!

            "answer_text": "There are lots of options for a lot of different people. It widely varies based on your goals.Level 1: Commodity There's the requisite lawnmowing and babysitting that's really common for teenagers. You can tutor people, which I enjoyed. You can get the part-time retail job or restaurant job that so many people get as young adults.  What I'd actually recommend is starting your own business. While you're a teenager, you don't have to worry about subsisting on Ramen while your startup gets off the ground. Depending on which state you are in, it can be as simple as filing a few forms online to start a business; when I was in high school, it took me less than 30 minutes to go from nothing to a full-fledged business in the state of Indiana. Level 2: Jason Fried and Audiofile I decided to figure out how to make my own. I got FileMaker Pro (I paid for it with the stash I'd saved up selling stuff to my friends) and started messing around. After a few months, I had solved the problems I had with organizing my music. I knew what music I had, where it was, whom I had loaned it to, how much I paid for it. The solution was elegant and easy to use. I called it Audiofile. Most of the music-collection products on AOL's file section were freeware. Download them, install them, and you don't owe the author a dime. There were a few shareware options (you pay if you use them, but it's mostly an honor system), but most were free. I'd already learned that I really enjoyed making money. And I thought that Audiofile was good. And even then, I thought that if something was good, then it was worth paying for. So before making it available to other AOL users, I added a limit in the program\u2014people could file 25 CDs for free; after that, it would cost $20 to unlock Audiofile and remove the limit. I remember my first customer. One day my parents gave me an envelope. It came from Germany and had those airmail stripes at the top. I opened it up, found a screenshot of Audiofile printed on a piece of paper\u2014and a crisp $20 bill. More envelopes rolled in. Over the next few years, Audiofile probably generated $50,000\u2014not bad for a kid in college in the early '90s. The lesson: People are happy to pay for things that work well. Never be afraid to put a price on something. If you pour your heart into something and make it great, sell it. For real money. Even if there are free options, even if the market is flooded with free. People will pay for things they love. From How to Get Good at Making Money Solve a problem that should be solved. Level 3: 4Snaps How a Florida kid's \"stupid app\u201d saved his family\u2019s home and landed him on the main stage at Facebook Michael Sayman is an interesting case. It's worth thinking about what he's done thus far if you are a teenager who would also like to be making money. ",

            "answer_text": "So here is how you earn money as a teenager.  CREATE VALUE.  Creating value at a small level isn't hard. When I was ten I stared cutting my grandmas lawn. It took me 30 minutes. It would have taken her 3 hours to do the same amount of work. Therefore, I got $25, about three hours pay instead of 30 minutes.  Why? Because I created three hours of value!  Fast forward to my teens, at 12 I taught myself HTML and CSS. I began responding to wanted ads on Craigslist for a web designer. The first site I did for someone I charged $80. It took me nearly two weeks to complete, but it was well worth it. A year later I ended up giving the guy all his money back and thanking him for a great learning experience.  Within about six months, I controlled 40% of all web design gigs on the NYC computer gigs craigslist and my name was starting to get referrals. I remember when I was employed by a big time Manhattan psychologist. When I looked at his rates, he charged nearly $500 an hour. My rates at the time were only $35. He told me that he would give me $300 an hour if I made his site a priority.  Why did he give me $300 an hour? Because it would have cost him nearly $1,000 to just setup a simple Godaddy website (2 billable hours).  So in the end, CREATE VALUE FOR SOMEONE WHOSE TIME IS WORTH MORE THAN YOURS.  ",

The easiest option would be to approach business owners who want to use it to grow their businesses.You can offer to manage social media for businesses. In other words rather than teaching them how, you can do it for them, which you can charge even more money for.I guess the next question will be, are you qualified to teach someone social media marketing or to actually do it? You dont have to be an expert to teach someone how to do something. You just need to know more than they do and be able to get them a result they are looking for. You can easily learn how by watching YouTube videos about social media marketing and doing a google search and reading blogs about it. Obviously there is too much content out there about it which you can go through which may become a problem in itself as it creates information overload. The next best thing would be to take a short course or training that can show you exactly how to do it. i actually have a free course that can show you how step by step if you are interested FREE COURSE-How to start a Successful Social Media Agency Here is the thing: anyone can learn how to do social media and manage it for businesses even these older people because the information is out there and a lot of it is for free. The reason they will pay you is because they dont have the time to read all those articles and watch videos online because they are busy with their businesses or whatever. You have more time and are more flexible which means you can take advantage of this opportunity. Like i said the shortcut would be to do a short training that shows you exactly how. Yo can get one here FREE COURSE-How to start a Successful Social Media Agency hope this is helpful ",

            "answer_text": "1) START A BLOG: Blogging is a popular and very versatile way of earning money while having fun. Many people may think of blogging to be hobby, but there are plenty of ways to monetize it. You can blog about almost anything and everything. It may be something you specialize in or are interested in, it is also a great way to share your passion. There are multiple online courses and books to help you get started.  2) BECOME A FREELANCE WRITER: If you have a flair for writing, you can start your own service online or in the neighborhood. You can write for startups or small companies near you. Alternatively, you could make a resume online so that companies and startups can contact you for your talent.  3) TUTOR: This is a very popular and effective way of helping others as well as having fun yourself(and of course earning). You can teach a subject that you are interested or good in. You can tutor younger students in math, reading and science or you can teach an older age group other skills such as a foreign language, coding, painting, anything you like and are good at!  4) HAVE A BAKE AND SELL: This one is quite self explanatory, all you have to do is mix up your ingredients and create your favorite delicacies. You can call over friends or family to help or even hold a baking competition in the neighborhood! This is good to raise money for a cause too.  5) START A YOUTUBE CHANNEL: This is a great idea if you have a lot of ideas to showcase and are good in front of a camera. However, it is not necessary that you be in front of the camera, you can make animated videos or have slide shows. YouTube is the easiest way to earn money, all you need is a total of 10,000 views or 1000 subscribers on your channel.  SELL HANDMADE DIYS: You can make anything you think will be useful to others, and sell it! It can be anything; jewelry, greeting cards, purses, notebooks, bookmarks, anything you made yourself. You can check out sites likeEtsy to sell your creations.  7) USE YOUR TALENT: Everybody has a special skill whether you've mastered it or it's still waiting to be discovered. Either way you can use your talent or skills to make money, you can sell the products you make, teach that skill to someone else or provide services using your talent. It can be anything; painting, coding, linguistics, sewing, making music, you can even do voice overs or podcasting if you have a good voice! Now that you're filled with ideas, there is nothing left to do but start! ",

            "answer_text": "I wish I knew more details, such as your age and education. First, get real. You are not going to be a millionaire by the end of next week.  The only way you are going to make any money is to get a job. You will not make big money. More in the order of spending money, which should be just perfect for a teenager. Think about how many hours per week you are able to work. What kind of work are you willing to accept? All of your life you have been surrounded by people who work. Everywhere you go, you are in the midst of people who are doing jobs. But you probably didn't think of it that way. Every time you walk into a store, restaurant, theater, school, mall, parking lot, and web site you are surrounded by people at work. What have you seen out there in the world that you think you could do? Are you talking about a summer job? A great summer job is to be a camp counselor. The pay sucks, but you can have a fun summer, make a small bit of money, and learn a lot about responcibility. Do you want a \"permanent job\" that you can do weekends or evenings while you finish high school? Fast food delivery might be good, and you might make extra money on tips. I assume you are in school. Many high schools have a job board. If yours does, (usually in the counseling office) see if there is anything there that interests you. If your school does not have a job board, talk to the head counselor about starting one. Let local newspapers to know about it, and ask them to post articles about the student job board. Do you or your family know someone who owns a business? If so, approach that person and see if they have a job that you could do. Personally, I have had many kinds of jobs during my career. I have been working ever since I turned 16. My first job was in a local pharmacy delivering and stocking shelves. My parents knew the owner. My next job, still during high school was doing the same kind thing, at a local liquor store.  Some of the other jobs I had during college were working on a loading dock, (hard physical work, too hard for me), waterbed salesman, janitor - (another aweful job, I quit after 2 weeks), medical insurance billing clerk, phone solicitor, assistant to an electrician, and bill collector jobs. Some jobs I liked, some I hated. Some I did well at. Some I didn't, and got fired a few times. Here's what I learned from all those different jobs. All work is dignified. I also learned that nobody ever pays you more than the value of what you do. I also learned that I didn't want to be a minimum wage nobody for the rest of my life. I learned to have ambition. But I also knew I was going to remain \"a minimum wage nobody\" until I could make get an EDUCATION.  So work hard, and stay in school. And have respect for everyone who works hard and does a good job, no matter what they do. ",

            "answer_text": "Earn money with yout skill. As a sophomore, I am alway tight with money. I know where my money runs. It is Taobao, a online shopping platform, swallowing my money as a monster since I started to use it. Studying in Chinese public college, my tuition is not very expensive. But in private ones, it is another story. I pay about 6700 yuan per year for tuition and accommodation. It is 950 dollars or so that I can get into the college. More fortunately, my parents as most of Chinese parents send money to support their children. But I still lack money. Once month, I even had no money to eat lunch. I felt shamed to ask money from my parents, because it was just half of the month. I told myself, \"look the bright side, it is the perfect time to lose some weight.\" I was trying to hide my financial embarrassment, but what failed me was my phone out of credit. At that moment my dad topped up for me and called me why. So I decided to earn money myself. I had had many part-time jobs. But I was so sick of the time-consuming and tedious jobs which there was nothing to learn from. One day my friend who was my savor got a job for me. It was to help foreign models and Chinese photographers communicate. Because my major is English, and my speaking is good. When asked the salary I expect, I didn't really mind. I considered it as memorable experience I would really enjoy. But it quite surprised me that they offered 300 yuan per day. My lord, It was a good money for a college student. I could sustain with it until the next month\u2019s money given day. That night when I got my work done and came back. I called my parents saying, \"it is my first time to realize that earning money is that easy.\" I laughed and thanked myself for how hard I worked on English speaking. I spent my whole freshman year practicing speaking. Every single day, I woke up and I practiced. Many of my classmates turned their noses up with it. Because speaking is always subordinate to other skills such as reading and writing. 300 yuan changed my situation in the mouth. I was transformed from being in the slum to in the city center. Moreover, I proved myself. So your skill is the best way to earn money. I mean easy and good money. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, you need the understand the simple concept below: People want value, therefore people will pay for value. But only for good value. Hence, money can be made from supplying this good value to the demand that exists for it. Therefore, provoking the question: \"Are you both willing and able to provide the good value that people are willing to pay for?\" I believe you are already willing if you have asked this question, but are you able? This refers to if you have the skills or the ability to provide the value that people are looking for. For example, everybody may want to be the best stockbroker on Wall Street, so they are all willing, but they may not have the necessary skills to be a top stockbroker, thus they are not able.  In order to make money, you absolutely must have both the willingness and the ability to provide this value. Now, you have two choices: (a): You can give value (b): You can create value   Choice (a): Giving value. This is effectively doing a job for someone else. You are giving value to your boss by doing that job because you are helping to keep the company running, making life easier for him and allowing him to focus on other things without having to juggle so many things at once. The boss rewards this value that you are providing him with a pay check. That's the basic idea behind giving value to others.  As a 15 year old, there are two aspects of how you can give value to others in terms of jobs. I have split it up into two subheadings which I call \"Homework jobs\" and \"No Homework jobs\". A \"No Homework\" job is something that usually does not require a specific skill set or past experience that you need to learn or pick up beforehand, you don't have to do any prior \"Homework\". \"No homework\" jobs would include stuff like flyer distribution, washing dishes, waiting tables, lawn mowing, car washing etc...As you should be able to notice, almost anybody should be able to walk into these type of jobs. These are the kind of jobs you'd do if you need a quick buck, but not necessarily providing a long term job with constant pay. A \"Homework\" job is something that needs a specific skill set that brings value to the company, you need to have done your \"Homework\" beforehand to be able to get into these jobs, so not anyone can get into these ones. Examples of jobs in this category that could be viable for someone like you would be something like Web or App Development and Graphic Design. I personally prefer jobs like these, as you need to self learn these skills but they will stay with you, give you great experience especially working in a company and benefit you for the rest of your life and will also be in demand for the foreseeable future (Many people are lazy to learn something like computer programming so they hire). Also, if your objective is money-making, these jobs pay rather well as the value you provide here is absolutely vital. Obviously there are other ways of giving value such as helpful YouTube videos or writing good content blogs which will also generate you some money however I won't digress to that. If you are really willing enough to make some money this way, you will read up about it, though if you have any further questions you are more than welcome to message me. Choice (b): Creating value. This is effectively starting your own business. You are creating value because you are making something that is of value to people who will want to buy it. Zucks for example, created value by starting Facebook which therefore has allowed people around the world to connect, all of this value he has provided is reflected in his $35b + net valuation.  As User-10093830047695287416 brilliantly mentioned in this thread, starting your own business gives you great experience and respect, and I'd second that any day.  Thanks Tyler and make sure you follow him too, great content and value coming from his answers. Tyler Marx's answer to I'm 16 years old and have around $850 saved that I want to spend on making an online business, what is the best approach? Tyler Marx's answer to What are some good entrepreneurial businesses ideas to get experience at the age of 14? If you are someone who likes to solve problems for the world or consider yourself a creative person, choice (b) would be perfect for you. The journey and things you learn along the way are priceless and if you are successful it can also be extremely financially rewarding. In terms of starting a business, people like to say how it is very hard and there are a million and one things you need to know. I personally disagree. All you need to get a business going is an idea first. How do you think of ideas? Look around you, think of the problems in this world, how could you solve them? How could you make people's lives easier? How could you create some good value? Try and get into the habit of writing down 10 ideas a day, it doesn't need to be great, just list it down, you can decide later. Thanks James Altucher for that lovely advice. Once you have gotten an idea in mind, you need to execute. Sales and Marketing, extremely important, read up and learn some of that stuff. You need people to know about your business and you also need people to buy from you after they know about what you offer, because that's how you make money.  How you will market and how you will sell, that's something you'll have to figure out yourself and what works for you because one of the lovely things about entrepreneurship is that there are no rules or textbooks, there are an infinite ways to for you to do business. You'll have to be innovative and find a way that is both effective and works for you and the company I have written similar answers below on this question before so check them out if you wish as they cover different aspects and angles and go into detail including some businesses you can start, my own experiences and reflections on what I did.

Ethan So also has a couple interesting answers so do check those out as well if you like. This is one of his great ones to give you a little peek: Ethan So's answer to I'm 15, what can I do now to set myself apart and be successful as an adult? Finally: As a starting point to mention a couple of resources in addition to reading Q&A on Quora, you can read articles on Medium , plenty of fantastic content here that should help you tremendously. You could also have a read of Entrepreneur - Start, run and grow your business. This website does have some interesting articles and tips as well.  Read books. Rich Dad, Poor Dad, The $100 Startup, Think and Grow rich, Zero to One, The Lean Startup are all great and are pretty interesting. Best of luck in making some money and gaining some invaluable experience!

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of ways to make money as a teenager. You an do odd jobs to earn cash in your spare time. Some ideas on how you could do this are:- Washing carsCutting grassBaby sittingDog walkingYou could also get a Saturday job, for example waiting on tables. You could also sell some of your old bits and pieces on Ebay or Amazon marketplace to bring in some cash. Alternatively you could earn money online. This is the best way and as a teenager you will no doubt find this easy to do. It can fit around school and there is the potential to earn far more money online than you could get doing the above tasks. The best way to earn money online (and many teenage are doing this very successfully) is through affiliate marketing. The way that affiliate marketing works is that you promote products online and when sales are made, you earn commission. The sellers give you unique links to use, so that they know you have driven the sale. There are many great companies who offer affiliate programmes such as Amazon. It is very easy to make Amazon sales because many people already know and trust Amazon and so would not hesitate to buy from them. There are many items that you can promote on Amazon and if you want to, you can promote higher ticket items such as BBQ grills, premium watches and handbags, which will earn you good levels of commission for the same amount of work. The more work you do, the more your online presence builds and your income also builds with it. The key skill to master with affiliate marketing is getting enough good quality (i.e. interested and ready to buy) traffic to your offer. However with so many communities, groups and forums online it is easy to go to where interested traffic is, and send good volumes of it to your affiliate offers. In fact, due to the massive volume of traffic on the internet affiliate marketing has never been easier to do. That being said, you will need some guidance in order to choose profitable niches and learn how to make good levels of sales. Driving traffic is also an area where I recommend you will need a bit of training to get you going effectively. Otherwise you may find that you struggle to make money at first and give up. There are some links to the very best training in my bio. One link will take you to entirely free training and information resources (Freebies) and the other (Learn from Experts) will take you to immediately downloadable video courses that cost a few dollars (around $11 ish) but are more comprehensive. If you start affiliate marketing now you will easily be able to continue with your earnings as you travel the world after college and you may also find that you don't ever need to get a 9\u20135 job as affiliate marketing, if done well, can bring in far more money. It also allows you to keep your freedom and does not require you to work for anyone else. I wish you all the best in your endeavours to earn money - if you have any questions at all that I can help you with please leave a comment and `I will respond. Lydia ",

It will require some upfront work, but if you put in the work 6-12 months down the road you will be happy you did. This strategy requires: Little to no technical knowledgeNo coding or SEO knowledgeNo experience with running a website beforeAround $100 in start up cash (you could invest more or less)In short, the idea will be to create a website that promotes/reviews products that have an affiliate program, rank in Google for keywords related to these products and then sell the website for a million (or close to it). The steps are pretty simple: Pick an evergreen nicheThis means a niche that will always be around and is not going anywhereYou want to work in niches that will always have demandGo to Amazon and find as many products within this niche as possiblePut all of the products into an excel spreadsheet w/ a link to the product pageTry to group the products together by product type. For example, in the food niche you would put all of the blenders together and all of the coffee makers togetherTry to find at least 100 products. The more the betterSnag a domain name that fits with your niche and create a wordpress blogWrite product reviews for each product in your spreadsheetTry to have each review be 1000+ words eachTry to write at least product review per week. The faster the better!Once you finish writing all of the product reviews you can expand into broader topicsFor example, write a review article based on your product topics that formed earlierThis is where you would write \u201cThe Best Smoothie Blenders in 2016\u201d type of articlesDo this for all of the different product types that you haveDo this for 6\u201312 monthsIf you can consistently write a new article at least once a week you will see nice growth over a 6\u201312 month periodThe most important part is to consistently write new contentAfter 12 months you should be making a good chunk of money each monthAt this point you should try to find more products that you missed the first time and keep trying to add new content as much as possible.This money will be passive as you would have already done all of the hard work of writing all of the content and you can now just rake it in.You can continue to make passive income each month OR sell the site for 20\u201330x monthly profitThe amount of time you can spend on this can vary. If you want to spend as little time as possible, then I would suggest outsourcing your content articles. If you have any questions about this strategy let me know, I would be happy to help! ",

            "answer_text": "The best answer I can give is the one that most ppl you have talked to probably give you. Get a part time job. I think you may actually be asking for suggestions on what type to get. Look at your hobbies and interests. Do you take dance lessons? Ask at dance schools about teaching preschool and you g children\u2019s classes. In to soccer? Apply for jobs with the soccer summer camps. Look at what you think you might want to do as a career. Are you good at creative writing and thought of being a journalist or writer? Get an entry level part time job at a newspaper or magazine. Whatever field you think of, there are part time jobs and paid internships all over that field. Now, what if you don\u2019t really have any hobbies or interests, you just want to make money. Enter the McJob. It\u2019s not as bad as ppl let on. Their pay is good with regular wage increases. The time is very flexible ( which is really helpful for high school and University students) and if you start now, you could be a manager by your first year University. ( like 2 of my students) they also have scholarships you can apply for and if you don\u2019t go to uni but become a asst. manager and up, I believe they will pay for courses for further education classes if those skill can be applied to your position. Some Other fast food places and large national retail businesses do that too. Ask your school counsellor or look online for help writing your resume. There are sooo many options. The world is your oyster! ",

            "answer_text": "Of course there is! Now, you could aim to make thousands without putting any real effort in. I would recommend a side hustle/job that builds your skills. Whether it is social skills, marketing skills, physical skills or even positive mindset skills, make sure you\u2019re taking something away from this rather than just money!  CAR WASHING AND LAWN MOWING. This is a perfect option for those looking for a bit of hard graft that is rewarding in the process. The best bit? You decide your working hours! Some people are also willing to pay up to $30-$40 for one job; so do 2 jobs a day (with an average pay of $10) and that\u2019s a monthly pay of $600! That\u2019s summer sorted. Most people will be okay to supply their lawnmowers too so you don\u2019t need to worry about buying one yourself (unless you\u2019re making this a part-time job).SQUADHELP. Now its time for a more lucrative strategy. Squadhelp is a website where companies give money away for business name ideas, logos and other designs. This is in the form of a competition and the winning applicant with the best idea gets the prize pot (which can be up to $250). If you have a knack for creativity and imagination, then this is the one for you! Think this one is going to be too hard to do? Have a look at the best winners for the month: The top member made almost $50,000 in over 1 year of being on Squadhelp. A lot of her money comes from selling domains and logos which you can view via the link Earn Online By Brand, Business Name , Tagline Ideas Suggestions. The domain/logo part is mainly for budding graphic designers but the name idea competition is available to everyone. You will have to go through a selection process where you will be asked to give your own ideas to some tester businesses. For example, one draft might be a \u2018tech business for 16\u201318 year olds\u2019. I then submit my own idea with a reason why its so good. Let\u2019s take a look at something I made myself: Name idea: FuzeWyre Submission Explanation: FuzeWyre is the perfect name for a company like yours. With techy synonyms like \u2018Fuse\u2019 which has been stylised as \u2018Fuze\u2019 and \u2018Wire\u2019 which has also been stylised as \u2018Wyre\u2019. Both words have connotations of connection and link-building which is what the online technological world is all about. The stylisations on both words appeal to the target audience too as it has been proven adolescents prefer business names with misspellings. It is also under 10 letters long and is therefore much easier to remember. Submit about 5 of these to the best of your ability and you have much a better chance of being accepted to apply in future competitions. All you need to do is win 2 big competitions a month and you have netted yourself $400. Perfect. 3. SURVEY. This option is a little less effort than the other two options. Entering data for surveys can earn you quite a little bit of cash although you\u2019ll need to do quite a few surveys in order to get up to the cash flow of other side hustles. This one can be a bit boring and low value-for-money but it requires very little effort and time so if you\u2019re looking for only an extra $50/month with very little legwork, this is the dream hustle. Survey Junkie is probably the best site to indulge your survey-answering needs. There are, however, far more profitable money-making ways out there. Affiliate marketing, matched betting and domain flipping are some to name a few. These are ALL covered in the blog post 15 Easy Ways To Make Money As A Teen. Not only does it mention quite a few unheard of methods but they go into extreme detail too (especially with their 101 affiliate marketing guide!). Be sure to check it out! Hope this helped Cam ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, write up a resume, it doesn't matter if you don't have any experience in an actual job before, you can easily just waffle on about what sports/activities you participate in, your personal skills and abilities or whatever. It really does not matter: Employers who are looking for teenager workers are more interested in how cheap you are, and if you are available to work the hours they need. It also helps when you happen to hand in your resume at a convenient time when they are desperately looking for workers. Of course, its pretty difficult to tell when that time is, it all comes down to luck. So yeah, start from there, it doesn\u2019t matter if you haven't found your passion quite yet, its just never a bad idea to gain some experience and skills and earn a bit of dosh on the side while still searching for your true passion. Even when you have found what you are really interested in, an employer in that field would be looking to see if you have had experience in a working environment before or not, regardless of how relevant that type of work is. However, if you really are that dedicated and willing to put in a lot of hard work, the best way to earn millions of dollars without working for somebody else is by starting your own business, developing a new idea (an app or a new kind of technology or something), or inventing something. Its a bit of a gamble, as you are putting so much effort into something which may or may not be a complete failure. Anyway, good luck. Hope you find something well-suited for you and in the meantime can find a decent part-time to earn a little bit of money. Some is better than none hey? ",

            "answer_text": "Talk to people. All you have to do is get involved and find a creative way to make money off every situation. I made close 750 dollars in the last 2 months at my highschool from making deals. For example, I heard someone talking about air soft guns in class. They said they wanted one but no one will take them to get one. I told him I will get him the air soft gun he wants for 100$. He was excited with my offer. I bought the gun on Amazon for 65$. With a 2 minute conversation and 3 clicks, I made 35$. I bought stun guns wholesale on the Internet and sold them to people at my highschool. I made 15$ profit off each one I sold. I bought mason jars for 1$ each and turned them into redneck wineglasses with candle stick holders an epoxy. I sold them online for 15$ each. I profited over 200$. I bought my friend a list full of things on Amazon and he payed me 115$ for what costed me 80$. All you have to do is communicate with people. See what people want and buy it wholesale, sell it retail. There is no \"magic system\". Just be smart about it. All you have to do is think outside of the box. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are mechanically inclined offer to replace lights on vehicles. Just about every light on cars are easy to get to and easy to swap out. Stay focused on the cheaper vehicles as I have come across a Cadillac that takes probably 30-60 minutes to remove the entire front facia to spend a minute to replace the headlights.  Headlights for most cars can range from 15 and up. Most blinkers, brake lights, tail lights, license plate lights can all be bought for 5 bucks for a two pack.  Charge 10 bucks for the labor of installing the bulbs. If you install 2 or more just ask for 20 bucks labor.  Remember to look for cars like Toyotas, Scion, Honda, Kia, Chevys and Fords and the likes.  Heck with the non headlights you can even charge a flat rate of 20 bucks. Then even if you replace one blinker, you've made 15 bucks. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to replace. Confirm at your local auto parts store that the prices for the majority of the bulbs will be 5 bucks. Also let the customers know that these prices can vary, but are the typical cost. So if you can get to where swapping out a light is done in 5 minutes or less and getting paid 15 bucks for it. That is really good money. I mean very good, cause if you assume that you had cars backed up waiting for a bulb change for an hour than you can make 180 bucks per hour. So even if you only change a few a day or hour it's still pretty good money, for easy work that hasn't taken much of your time. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "My son wanted a new dirt bike one summer and I don't just arbitrarily spend thousands of dollars on whims of my children, so I told him he would have to earn part of the money in order to have it. This insured he would maintain his interest in it and not move on to other wants, and if he did all the better. Also, it would teach him the value of money as I often did, and I know he treated things he worked for better as well. So to get to the point I told him to go with me to Home Depot where we purchased some spray paint and number stencils. From there we went to a few of my rental properties and applied the addresses on the curb. I paid him $10 per rental home and after he and his friend drove to all the rentals they proceeded to knock on doors and charge homeowners for the service where they earned between $10 and $15 per home and would earn around $200 to $300 per day. Not a bad income for a days work at 16. That would be my advice to perform a service that pays well and will allow you to save up for the photography equipment. My son had saved up $1000 in under 3 weeks with spending part and putting 10% into his savings account which I also required. He had his dirt bike in less than a month, learned a new skill that paid well, saved a few hundred in the bank, had spending money and I got to pay out several thousand for his bike. Not a bad deal, hope you find your way to getting your equipment. If you make it your #1 priority you will. ",

If this is the case you can most likely make money on it. It is just about thinking where in the value-chain there is money to make.I used to be good at building and maintaning mopeds when I was 15. This was great fun and I started buying 2nd hand parts with a local specialist - selling it for a premium to the moped-guys in school. Services: Does your neighbors need any service (gardening/cleaning/computer help etc)? Start with a couple of  flyers for your local community and things may take off - you may be able to hire some of your friends if demand are high enough.TutoringIf you become good at a couple of courses in school you will be able to sell your hours to some that actually need your help.

The handful of us that did so, also happen to be the more driven individuals 17 or 18 years later. We all found a product or similar \u2018replacement\u2019 (best I can put it) that high school students had a fair to high demand for. None of these were necessarily ethical however so depending on your perspective\u2026. free market principles, value sold is in the consumer\u2019s eye, copyright infringements, etc. i respect your personal and all opinions. The only thing I regret is if we hurt the small business owner. My approach was selling \u2018knock off\u2019 Oakley\u2019s. They weren\u2019t just popular at the time for athletics but for fashion just as much, if not more. $90 to $140 for a pair to a high school kid was a stretch. I had a relative in NY. At approximately $4 per pair (very similar to the real product), my cost (in bulk purchases), I then sold them out the trunk of my 1993 Grand Am for approximately $30/pair. Again, I\u2019m not saying it was right, even though I\u2019m also catching myself bragging a bit, but it worked. On a side note, you can argue the price per production/outsourced labor to produce, vs. the profit redeemed if you want. I won\u2019t go into the ventures that my friends took on. All had one thing in common though\u2026. we identified a product or service that our peers wanted, but they couldn\u2019t afford them. We found a solution. ",

            "answer_text": "Something to consider: do you have an interest in computers?  If so, I would encourage you to get to know the people who work in the I.T. department at your school. Just say that you're interested in computers, and you were wondering if they knew about anywhere you could go to learn more about them. I.T. professionals at schools are often very busy (and a bit introverted), so it might take a couple of tries, but, in my experience, they're very nice people who love it when students show an interest in/appreciation for their work.  They also might be willing to point you in the direction of a job in the field, or even offer you one. One of my favorite jobs as a teenager was at my middle school's I.T. department. Under the supervision of the department, I cleaned, repaired, and updated the school's computers. Make no mistake--it was physically demanding, sometimes boring work--but it was incredibly fulfilling to know that I was finally doing something valuable to someone other than myself, and learning useful skills in the process. Plus, with all the skills I learned and money I made, I could build a serious gaming PC after only a few weeks on the job.  I've also had a few friends who worked for small software firms while still in high school. This one took a bit more planning and foresight. Generally, they took one or two summer classes in programming before they could land an unpaid internship somewhere. After their unpaid internships, they could often make $15-25 per hour working at software companies or freelancing. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine yourself 10 years in the future. What do you want to achieve in terms of money? Let's just say a house. Assume that you will buy a house cash. Now use the minimum wage or an approximation to determine if you can afford one on your supposed salary in 10 years. Chances are you can't. Am I right? Then your supposed salary isn't enough. Congratulations! You have just discovered income streams. To get money you need to minimise risk with respect to your portfolio. That is, your income should come from several sources. There are multiple ways to achieve this: Through investmentOwned BusinessHigh income salaryand othersWhen I was a teen I started with the business. Being an entrepreneur doesn't mean that you have to drop out from your studies, on the contrary. Businesses can fail anytime. When your business fail and it is your only source of income, you are stuck and it's not nice. This is why I always recommend teenagers, who launch business to get a degree. A degree is a passport for a higher salary than the minimum wage and you can use your savings as investment in your business.A business is a side hobby first until it is profitable enough and this generally takes a minnimum of 2 years.Investing on stocks will yield a very small amount of dividents (if any) and you will achieve a passive income in several years. (picture credit: Kaboompics) If you are a teen these things are important. Educate yourself finantially; finantial illeteracy is the reason many academically educated people stay in dept.Learn about how to prevent a company from failingLearn about how to maximise a higher return of investment.The best way to make money as a teen is to minimise all risk. You can launch a sandwitch business and it has a failure rate of 50% (50% success, 50% failure) Add a juice as second income stream and suddenly your food business has a risk of 25%. (0.5*0.5=0.25 which is 25%) If you are launching a business, bootstraping is always less risky than taking a loan (which I do not recommend; you can't take a loan when you don't even know where and when the money will come from right?). Another alternative are incubators. Therefore the best way to make money as a teen is to minimise all risks; start by one income stream first then diversify. You will definetly find something suitable for you as a start. ~Danel \ud83c\udfa8\ud83e\udd8b ",

Experiment with lemonade or homemade cookie stands (when I was a teen, I made $52 in three hours selling raspberry iced tea on a busy neighborhood street) 4. Sell jewelry!

            "answer_text": "Way too open ended of a question for me to possibly give a rock solid answer. Depends on what age teen, if you are above your states legal working age you can try to get a part time job. What you can also do is sit down, and think about your skillset. What things are you Great at, which are you Good at, then what your average and terrible at. Be honest with yourself, and then you can try and figure out how to make money off of your best skills. For example, as a teenager I had zero interest in mowing lawns or any sort of landscaping, working at a fast food joint or any of that. It wasn\u2019t that I was lazy I just sucked at those things. However I\u2019ve been messing with computers in some form since I was 3 years old (Old Radio Shack Comadore like system). By the time I was a teenager, I could build systems from scratch and repair pretty much any pre-built on the market. Between my neighborhood, school and card shop connections while not a reliable and steady source of money, I got little jobs quite often (usually simple virus and malware cleanup). My main hustle though, every Friday of every season but winter mom would let me be an hour or two late for school and took me to whatever church or business parking lot was holding a carnival/festival/picnic and I\u2019d go booth to booth as they set up to open that afternoon until one of the owners would hire me to work it for the weekend. It was a blast, they went on literally every weekend somewhere in the city and it paid just a little over minimum wage, but paid out nightly in cash. Other than that, I\u2019d make magic decks for cheap, but that out performed their price point and sold them for a small profit and stuff like that. I wasn\u2019t making great money by any means, but still on par with what I would have got working a little part time McDonalds gig, only I was having fun with what I did, and would have been miserable doing the fast food thing.

            "answer_text": "As a teenager (currently 21y/o), I made money in a few ways... 1.Mow lawns. It's that simple -- I mowed a ton of lawns, and brought in a few hundred dollars a week in 8th grade and beyond. My former employer actually sold a landscaping business when he was 18 for 250k back in the early 90s. 2. Invest in the stock market.  Before I get into this, I DON'T recommend this as a short-term moneymaking play. As a teen, you probably don't have a ton of cash. In my opinion, it's better to invest what little you do have in yourself during your formational years rather than putting money in the market unless you plan on pursuing a career in finance, in which you'll be able to simultaneously earn a real-world education.  But, if you choose to part ways with some money and have a good strategy / risk tolerance, you can make a decent return if you play your cards right. When I used to invest, I was a gunslinger. I traded stocks and 'bet the ranch' on volatile stocks back in '08 when I was 13 (aka the financial crisis / recession). I'm pretty sure I lost a lot of money back then. Who knows, but I was able to trade on volatility without really understanding much about stocks (not that that would've helped a ton anyways...everything went up and down in '08 for no reason at all)  3. Start a business. Anything. Just start it. Preferably a service business (avoid negative cash flow at all means) but start something. Do NOT worry about scaling. That will come later, if at all. I made both of the aforementioned mistakes. I tried scaling my profitable clothing company by leveraging a small credit line and was trying to compete with the big boys when I was 16. It ended up crippling the business that otherwise was relatively successful.  Note: this is just what I did. There are plenty of other ways, and while most people will say 'get a job' or 'do (insert menial task) for quick money', I'd like to think there are other ways as well. Think about. You're a teen. You may lack experience, confidence and so forth, but you understand why and how kids your age do things <-- that's important. Companies spend billions trying to figure it out. Figure out a way to make some money off of this. I did, or tried, and continue to try. Also, optimize for learning and doing rather than just making a few quick bucks. Learn some skills, like sales or how to code, even if it's just basic stuff. Find something you're interested in and double-down. Forget your weaknesses and what you don't like doing, this isn't school where you're taught to practice what you're not naturally good at. Hone your skills and use it as leverage. Outsource what you're not good at. This will lead to more interesting opportunities and ways to make money. Don't limit yourself or think you need degrees or awards or need to be an 'expert' to start. Fellow Quoran Casey Allen  ran a few businesses in his late teens / early twenties from house painting to a college-focused marketing agency. He has a ton of great insights on this topic as well. I actually interviewed him a few months which you can read here: http://www.howistartedmybusiness.co/casey-allen-entrepreneur-angel-investor/ ",

            "answer_text": " Thanks for the A2A. My mother used to pay me for good grades. We were poor growing up, so it\u2019s not like she had extra money. But it was very important to her that I get a great education rather than spend time working for below minimum wage. I am not saying this is right for you, and there is certainly nothing wrong with honest hard work to make money. But also consider the opportunity cost of your time. As a teenager, you are at a stage where learning has a lot of leverage - it can impact the college you can get accepted to, the career you will pursue, and many other things (including just the joy of learning!) So if you have to work to make ends meet, by all means, but if you can, I would learn rather than earn as a teenager. As for what to learn, the choices are many, and depend on you. I will point you to the area in which I have expertise in case it is one that interests you. I have put together a value investing reading course on my site that I have used to mentor aspiring value investors that I have worked with, if you are interested I think it is a good place to start. It picks the books that I have found helpful in mentoring people who are trying to become better investors, in an order that I think aids their development. As you read any investment book, I think it\u2019s important to ask yourself if/how you would like to change your investing philosophy/process as a function of what you have read. The idea is not just to imitate well-known successful investors, but rather to understand why they did what they did, understand how their strengths/weaknesses compare to yours, and then try to see if there is anything you can take from your analysis to improve your own process.

            "answer_text": "I made money doing errands for people such as going to the store for them and delivering their stuff back home, going to the post office for them to send out or retrieve mail, etc. Cutting grass and cleaning house for neighbors is always an option, as is pet grooming, pet sitting and dog walking. If you like children and are of a responsible mindset, you could always offer to babysit as well. My cousin earned money growing up by doing computer maintenance for neighbors-getting rid of viruses and uneeded files, organizing videos and photos, cleaning up desktop and installing new programs, printers, and compatible gadgets. You could offer a laundry service to the elderly, to blue collar men who work long shifts and have limited time to devote to responsibilities, to stay at home moms who just have too much on their plate and even to college students who are crammed for time between work and studies or may not have easy access to a laundering facility. I've seen people charge $2-$4 per pound of clothing washed and dried, with folding included and ironing & being hung on racks just after laundering for transport costing extra. You can clean pools in the summer, clean doorsteps, porches, sidewalks and driveways of snow in the winter. You can clean leaves and bird nests from rain gutters and you can pull weeds from gardens and flower beds. The possibilities are rather endless when you are a teen. If its something a busy adult needs done but may not have the time or the physical ability to do, you very well could monetize your efforts to do it for them. The best way to decide which odd jobs you should choose is to step back and look at your neighbors as a whole. What kind of problem do several of your neighbors have that needs solved? Do many of them have trees nearby and could use a good lawn raking? Do several of them live on hills that are difficult to get up and down in the winter where they might appreciate someone offering to go to the store for them? Is your neighborhood of the fairly upscale kind where the people living there might travel often for work or maybe they take long vacations and cruises? If they have pets who need cared for during these times then they might find value in having you look after their pets while they are gone as opposed to placing them in a kennel. If you live in an area where several single moms have jobs, you could offer to retrieve their kids from the bus and keep them safely at your home and help with homework until they get home from work (provided your parents wouldnt mind, of course, and your bus arrives home before theirs does). They would certainly appreciate the homework aspect, given as how the moms would be tired after a long day and would still need to cook dinner, feed and bathe the kids plus whatever other things need done around the house. Simply getting the homework out of the way for them could be a huge help. That being said, you may even offer private tutoring in a subject you are good at to kids in grades below you. As I said, find a problem several adults have in the area. Solve it. Why several adults? Stability. Job security. If you do satisfactory work for one neighbor, they will instantly think to promote you to the next neighbor who talks about having that same problem. Word of mouth is great marketing and you want several mouths speaking about you and your skills. If a trusted friend tells me \u201cso and so\" fixed the problem for them, I'm calling \u201cso and so\", too, because my friend has already built my trust in them. Get a few friends hiring you where you will have gigs scheduled regularly or back to back, perhaps 3 or 4 times a week, depending on how much of your own time you have to devote to making money, and you should be able to save up for whatever it is you're wanting the money for in no time. Good luck with your entrepreneurial endeavors! ",

            "answer_text": "When I was 14 and 15 years old, I had a lawn mowing and weed trimming business in the summers. In the fall, I would rake leaves and load/unload hay bales on local farms. In winter, I would shovel snow and run errands for people in the neighborhood. Once I turned 16 and got my drivers license, I started working part-time at a local bakery. I would go in early and make doughnuts, then come back after school and clean the floors and wash pans. I also worked part time at Walmart a few nights a week as a stocker. I also took occasional jobs painting people\u2019s porches, eaves, gutters, and wood fences. Now I teach high school. Some of my students make and sell cupcakes and breakfast burritos to earn pocket money and help save for college. One of my students has his own business called the Super Trooper Pooper Scooper. He picks up pet waste from people\u2019s yards. When my oldest son was a teenager, he got a job at Best Buy selling phones. My younger son got a job at Movie Tavern as a server, and he eventually became the expo in the kitchen there (he supervised the kitchen staff and made sure all the orders were correct before sending them out to customers).

            "answer_text": "There are many easy and legal ways to earn money online. The question is how much money do you want to make online. The definition varies from one to another. #1 Take Surveys Online You can try to make money by taking survey online. However, it is not possible to make a living by filling up surveys and you will not be able to make a sustainable income. However, it is the simplest and the most straightforward way to make money online as it does not require any special skills and qualification. Below you can find a list of legitimate paid survey sites you can sign up. Pinecone ResearchPaidViewPointOpinion OutpostSwagbucksiPollVivaticGlobal Test MarketMySurveyiPanelIpsosHowever, there are pros and cons making money through paid survey sites. Pros:Easy and straightforwardYou do not need any special qualificationFree and you do not need to have special toolsYou can participate and take surveys anywhere you wantAll you need is a laptop/ smartphone and internet connectionCons:Small rewards from taking surveys. It is possible to make $5 per month if you work extremely hardEasily get screened out in the middle of the surveyLose all rewards after expiration durationIt does not allow you to make a sustainable income. You need to constantly participate in taking surveys every day.#3 Freelancing Freelancer.com is the most popular portal which allows you to bid on projects, there are lots of projects in freelancer. But as high as the projects, there are lots of bidders also which makes freelancer a tough platform to survive, but once you get good reviews its very easy to get projects. Apart from freelancer, there are other websites where you can do freelancing like Odesk, Elance, Project4Hire, GetaCoder, and ThemeForest. #2 Affiliate Marketing Alternatively, you can become an affiliate marketer. I graduated as an engineer and after years of working 9-to-5, I got fed up with the routine work and decided to do something else that could earn me an opportunity to spend quality time with my family and make extra cash. I started as a blogger and expected to make some extra cash like anyone else. To my surprise, it turned out well where I made more money than what I could as an engineer. My preferred way is to become an affiliate marketer because it allows me to make a lucrative and sustainable income through blogging. You can easily make $300 - $500 per day by becoming an affiliate marketer. To make money from blogging (affiliate marketing), First, you need to find your niche. A niche means a target or a subject that you are going to write about. A niche can be your interest, a hobby or a skill. Any subject can be your niche, for example, people blog about collecting match boxes, bug photography, work-out program, or even daily political scandals and etc. Remember one thing is when you are finding your niche, avoid being too broad with your selection. For example, do not blog about Work Out Tips and Motorbike at the same time. Both of them fall on different categories and they just can't simply be put together. You could do a post about your niche (e.g. camera, guitar, trekking) and include affiliate links to any paid ones (e.g. Amazon or ShareASale). Create great content is not enough to make a lucrative income online today. You will have to make use of social media platform to promote your content and drive traffic to purchase items via your product reviews. My site earned my $7,000 within six months. Of course, I worked extremely hard at the beginning and success did not happen overnight. I spent almost 5 hours per day after work to make it worked. As my site matures, I spend 1 to 2 hours every day writing, optimizing my site, connect to social media and reply readers' emails. The best thing is the earning potential doesn't stop there and the revenue growth is still climbing up every single day (provided I publish articles regularly). At the time of writing, my site is making 5-figure revenue every month. Anyway, my answer is if you're passionate about a subject and you have decent writing skills, blogging definitely could be an alternative career path for you to make a living. All you need is to become an affiliate marketer. You will also find the pros and cons working as an affiliate marketer. Pros:The earning potential is enormous due to the exponential growth of the internet usersIt allows you to make sustainable income onlineIt allows you to quit your nine-to-five job and allow you to spend quality time with your familiesIt is a legitimate online businessThere are many affiliate programs on the internet you can participate (e.g. Amazon, ShareASale, Apple, FreeflyVR)Cons:It requires a lot of effort and timeYou need to blog from time to time (constantly publish content)You need to learn how to do affiliate marketingYou can\u2019t do it alone. It requires mentor-ship. You can do it alone with trial and error method but it takes a while to figure out the methodologyEasy to get scammed as a newbie as there are many so called internet Guru out there to steals your money and only deliver empty promises.I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche.

The internet is full of potential and you're starting young (and being young means you soak information in like a sponge!).Masses of potential here:- Dropshipping - Google this and be careful, a lot of companies are selling you a dream that can never be achieved.- Clothing company - My friend created Synical Clothing Co. when we were 14/15 - we're now 21. http://synicalclothingco.bigcartel.com/ He found this both fun, tied in with his hobby (BMX) and meant he earnt a bit of money - he is currently at Uni in Australia (we're from the UK) and which has been part paid for with profit from his clothing company - used his own photography, marketing (instagram, facebook etc.) and other bits to build the brand - he got in contact with other BMXers we knew and got them to rep his clothing for a few shirts/jumpers/jackets/hats etc. His Mum now posts the orders the site makes from home while he is abroad having a sick time.- LEARN something - Code (C++, HTML etc.), making apps/websites (kind of learning code), Design (InDesign and Photoshop creating anything digital) - see https://www.freelancer.co.uk/ or the US equivalent - once you have this skill and can build a portfolio of your work you can then charge people for your service.Just keep creating ideas, even if they are bad ones - 1000 ideas may create 1 that works.Keep me posted!

            "answer_text": "I think a lot of good answers have been made already by others.Let me just point out some basic points.Build on what is already around you \u2013 in your house or environment. If you come from an agriculture background, grow something and sell what you harvest. If you know how to fish in the river/sea, do so and sell your catch. (As a good youth, put some aside to supplement your family\u2019s dinner. Such a habit would help you go a long way, not just making money while you are in your teens.)If you can bake something (or make lemonade), you may make some money by putting up a stall outside your house to sell those. (Again, be good to use some of your proceeds to pay for the cost of using equipment/electricity/gas in the house to make the drinks or cakes.) The world of internet is opening up other opportunities too \u2013 to create apps or write ebooks. The skills needed to do those would have to be learned though \u2026 and that leads to another point.(Learning to programme software or writing a very good ebook on something and selling it online would require you to study ... in school, or on your own. While trying to make money, read books or posts websites that promote creating wealth. The more you know, the more options you will have to choose from.) The more you learn by observing others around you (or in other parts of the world) making money will help you plan your own strategies \u2013 which are the best and which are the ones you\u2019d enjoy doing.Some of the things you learn now will not make you rich NOW \u2026 but in the long run, all the experiences you gain can help you make a lot of money a bit later on in life.

Step 1: Find out your potential talent or hobby with using mind map. Could be in sports, arts and design, writing and language, games and entertainment.. etc.. and then go in detail on what are you really interested. The right one would be the one you should enjoy and work at the same time. Step 2: Look out for the niche in the market and has alot of demands. Then work out the algorithms. Example: (your interest) baking + (geometrical cake) niche = try to bake and sell + (target market) events and school = money + (free ad) fb, insta, youtube, kickstarter. To spread your word further. Step 3. Invest your money on something you desire + need. The rich usually buys exotic cars to attract attention amd draw crowd to promote their business. You should too. A heed of advice as well, dont lose track on your studies, put up your time table and organize your time well. People who say it is impossible instantly fail in life, and only people who give up fails too. There are alot of room for trials and errors as long as you have a positive-goal oriented mind. ",

Look at a lot of channels, not many have a million followers and not many of them and they got there by being good content or they got there because they were started by someone famous in the first place. Even if you can pull it off, it will take some time to be in a place where you can actually generate a positive cash flow let alone a decent hourly return for your efforts. My recommendation is look at activities that you can do that not a lot of people want to do. Mow lawns and wash windows. I did this a lot when I was a teenager and could easily get double minimum wage. Best part was I got the cash as soon as I finished, no waiting 2 weeks until pay day. In Canada that was seasonal so in winter I shoveled snow. Not as dependable but after a large snow fall I could make several times minimum wage and work 12 hour days through the weekend. I often would make more after a large snowfall as my burger flipping friends made in a month. Do yard work. Especially in the spring and fall you can make good money in this. During winter time look for places where they have dogs and when the snow melt starts offer to clean the yard. Not pleasent work but it will not kill you. Once you get a reputation and more work than you can handle, hire others to help. You can charge out at twice minimum wage and pay minimum wage. Nice profit. ",

            "answer_text": "You could also opt to use existing websites for making money. These include both active income and passive income methods. For example, you could sell some used items or invest in creating some digital designs that they can be sold on merchandise. Again, devote a sizable portion of your time to passive income so that you can slowly build up earnings that will arrive on autopilot without any extra added effort. Of course, a large portion of these sites does have their own respective apps. But these are certainly less involved in the gig economy, and more so in the longer-term projects that exist in the fields of photography, online marketing, graphic design, and web development, for example. Craigslist: This site has been the go-to resource for over a decade now for people that are looking to make a bit of extra money online. You can easily sell your used stuff, rent out a spare room in your home or apartment, and offer up your services to the world. Upwork: This website offers a great marketplace for selling just about any professional service. You don't need a merchant account, the website of your own or anything else for that matter. All you need to do is be able to provide a high-quality service at a reasonable price. But be informed, you will have to compete with many others that are constantly bidding on open jobs. Cafe Press: This website allows you to create digital designs that can then be sold on the platform. You'll earn a commission for everything that sells and you'll never have to deal with logistics like printing, warehousing and customer service. If you have some graphic design skills, then this is a great potential source for your web-based income. Fiverr: Israeli-based Fivver was started in 2010 by Shal Wininger and Micha Kaufman. You can offer gigs as low as $5 but also get paid much more for upgrades and add-ons. Mechanical Turk: Amazon's Mechanical Turk is a resource for doing human-intelligence tasks, or as the site commonly refers to them, HITs. You get paid a very small fee for any given HIT and you'll need a good deal of volume to make a substantial amount of money. But it is a resource you can use in your spare time to generate a small income online. Flippa: If you have a penchant for buying and selling, you could use Flippa, and its higher-end counterpart, Deal Flow Brokerage to buy and sell websites for a profit. You'll need to know what you're doing here, but you could easily make a sizable income by flipping income-generating websites for profit. Etsy: While Etsy's popularity has declined recently, it's still a great resource for selling handmade items online. No need for complex e-commerce sites or merchant accounts or any sort of automation. The company takes a commission of every sale and charges a small listing fee per item. But many still use Etsy as their primary source of income. The best part is that you can also sell digital products here such as poster designs. To know more visit this link Make money online.

            "answer_text": "What are the best ways to make money as a teenager? First, I\u2019m going to assume three things: Teenagers are young, and thus can\u2019t get a \u201ctraditional\u201d job do to legal restrictions.Teenagers have little to no money, so any type of investment is out of the picture (no stock options, real estate, or even savings account interest).Teenagers have ample time.So, you can\u2019t get a normal job, you have no money, but you have a lot of time? What can you do to make money? Summertime? Mow lawns! Of course this does require an upfront investment of owing a lawn mower and the gas to fuel it, but if you entrepreneurial enough, you can borrow someone\u2019s, such as your parents, or someone else\u2019s, perhaps in return for mowing their lawn.  Wintertime? Shovel snow from driveways! Again, you need something upfront\u2026 A snow shovel. Snow shovels tend to be cheaper than lawn mowers, though.  School time? Tutor! Especially if you\u2019re really good in a particular subject, you could find someone who isn\u2019t, and be compensated for helping them.  And of course, there\u2019s the classic teenager job: babysitting! Get paid to watch someone\u2019s children. In fact, you could even get paid to watch someone your own age if that person has some sort of disability or condition that prevents them from taking full care of themselves. P.S. I also wrote about 5 Ways to Make Extra Cash with No Upfront Investment, but while a teenager could potentially do some of the items in that article (they\u2019re all online stuff) you might need to do it underneath a parent\u2019s account. Unless you\u2019re 18 or 19, which is technically a teenager but also a legal adult in most jurisdictions. ",

            "answer_text": "I think being a teen can be a great advantage as most neighbors are willing to not just pay for odd jobs but maybe teach you a trick or two depending on the job. With that being said, use all the resources available to you whether that be going around your neighborhood asking if there is any work that you can help with to looking at job posts. If you are a teen, I would say make sure to be wary of fake job posts, scams and other possible dangers. I think another really good way is to use your network, even your parents. Find what interests you or something that you think is going to be useful to you and ask if your parents know anyone that you can help and earn some money. Even for free, if you shadow someone long enough, you will learn the lessons and be able to ask for pay to help out at a later time. If I could go back to my teen, I would ask my friends dad, a contractor if I can shadow him to learn how to put drywall up, mud tape the walls, paint, frame and plumbing. These are not only fun (I think) but also very useful when you get your own house. I am not a lawyer so in regards to the legal sense of things I can't say what the labor law is for under 18. Also I am speaking in the context of North America. ",

            "answer_text": "Landscaping. I cannot stress this enough. Landscaping is the way to go if you want to make money as a teenager, for multiple reasons: 1.Who actually likes weeding? I\u2019ll tell you one thing: my neighbors don\u2019t. Adults have jobs they have to go to, children and husbands to attend to, rental properties to manage, medical injuries they have to nurse, and a whole host of other real-world conflicts that put yard work way down low on the priority list. Unless they have a zealous enthusiasm for weeding, most people would rather just hire someone to get the job done so they don\u2019t have to worry about it. 2. You can earn higher than minimum wage by undercutting your competitors. It costs a lot of money to hire an actual landscaper. According to a google search I just found, it can cost someone anywhere between 45\u201375 dollars an hour to hire a professional service. As a teenager, you can charge $15/hr and make more than minimum wage (which is 11-something/hr in my area) while also guaranteeing that your business will look waayyy better to clients because you charge so much less than a landscaping company. Even though it will likely take you longer to do the work, it will still end up costing your clients less in the long run. Plus, people like to help out local teens- it gives them a feeling of goodwill and a sense that they\u2019re being of service. 3. It doesn\u2019t cost you much to get started. You probably have some weed diggers and shovels laying around the house. If not, you can buy used ones off Craigslist. If you\u2019re going all out and getting a variety of tools, I still bet it\u2019ll cost less than $50 to get everything you need. 4. You can strengthen your knowledge of gardening. Laying a tarp on the ground makes it easy to move a growing pile of weeds to your next weeding location. When trimming bushes, always start with the lower branches. A good way to weed a muddy area is to drag a hoe through the surface soil and scrape the weeds out. The best way to get rid of bindweed is to use poison; otherwise, it\u2019ll just keep coming back. That weed-looking thing with the zucchini leaves is actually hollyhock, and it\u2019ll put out beautiful pink flowers in the summer. These are all tips I\u2019ve learned from people who have hired me to garden. When I go to my next job, I can teach what I\u2019ve learned to future clients and utilize these techniques and knowledge to improve my work. 5. You make valuable connections and get free stuff. People often have me dig out plants they don\u2019t want anymore. I take them home and plant them in my own garden. My clients all have different jobs; one is a project manager, another is a real estate agent, another is retired but has a penchant for knitting. One couple has dogs who need petsitting occasionally. The more people I know, the more opportunities open up to learn more about a different field or secure a different job opportunity in the future. I\u2019ve made friends who give me handmade scarves and homemade cookies and anti-anxiety herbal tinctures for my dog. Through this, I\u2019ve enriched my sense of community. It\u2019s pretty awesome. 6. You set your own work hours. I make my schedule. I don\u2019t have to answer to an irate boss, or wake up any earlier than I want to. Everything is on my own time. Downsides: Weeding is boring. You\u2019ll want to invest in some music or talk radio or something.It\u2019s hot outside. Work hours are limited to mornings and evenings and weather fluctuations.You get covered in dirt. This doesn\u2019t bother me, but it might bother someone else.It takes muscle. I suck at using a shovel.Customers with unrealistic expectations. No, I do not have a bulldozer. Yes, it will take me more than an hour to weed your entire lawn. Sorry.All in all though, I highly recommend this job! ",

            "answer_text": "There is no easy way to earn money as a teen or at any other stage of life. Everything you do involves work. The thing is you have to find work you enjoy doing and what is enjoyable to you may not be enjoyable to someone else. So take a look at things you enjoy doing so far and what types of effort feel natural to you. Also think about things that take a lot of effort but you still enjoy the challenges. Finally, think about things that seem to test your endurance and turn you into a clockwatcher. These will give you clues on what you should look into and what you may want to avoid. Now, it must be said that experience is a good teacher, as well. You may be gung-ho on something till you actually start work doing it and decide that it isn\u2019t for you. Youth is a nice time to try a lot of different things to get to know yourself. A favorite saying I once read is this: If you want a snake to learn its shape, put it in a box. It means by experiencing the confines of the box, a young snake learns what it is. Here are a few suggestions: If you like small children you might be happy starting and running a small babysitting/childcare business or work for an established one. You will need to keep the kids busy doing fun things and take good care of them and any infants in your charge. You will need to take a first aid babysitter\u2019s course. If playing with small children is not your thing, do everyone a favor and skip this one. If you love horses, you might want to work at a horse ranch. If you love animals in general, you may want to get a job at an animal adoption center, humane society, animal hospital, or zoo. You may be able to get some valuable on-the-job training, references, and certifications if you are willing to volunteer first. If you love tractors, machinery and the outdoors, a being employed at a farm may be your best bet. If you have a strong interest in something and are willing to learn tech skills and purchase the right equipment, you might want to start a video channel and upload videos. If you love books and all things books, libraries and book stores may be for you. If you love clothes & accessories you may love working at a boutique or a department store so you can take advantage of their discounts. If you are good at a school subject, you might enjoy picking up some extra books tutoring other students. If you like to clean and organize, you might want to offer your services to neighbors and to the community. If you are quick and not easily rattled, fast food work could seem easy. The rate of pay for such work is slowly improving, and many places now offer tuition assistance for college. Sometimes family dining restaurants are in need of a weekend hostess who is personable so you might find that an easy gig. If you need some help finding a job, you should check out your state\u2019s employment agency. They often offer some skills training and assistance to prepare you for interviews. They usually offer a jobs website where you can apply for jobs. ",

To begin with, learn a skill. I started writing since I was six and started getting paid for it in 2014. I started the African Poetry Project and we made quite a couple of bucks from it. So first, learn a skill and being a (prospective) entrepreneur, either learn (digital) marketing, designing, accounting or coding - they'll pay off in the long run. And no, I'm not talking about school alone. Don't be shy to ask for payment for what you do. I've worked on Fiverr and the first time I got paid ($4 net) it was nothing but pure joy. So offer your services (after learning) on all e-platforms as well as physical businesses if you know an . The purpose of this is to earn you some bucks as well as give you a chance to learn on the job. Most important - CREATE! Your head is currently bubbling with lots of ideas (I guess). Pick out the one that wouldn't cost you a lot to start and just start. ",

You will be able to determine how much of a commission they get. You will also be able to weed out the newbies and get the best affiliates to promote your product thus making it much easier to hit well over $100 a day. # 3- Peerfly  Now, I will be a bit frank with this one. You can make up to $100 a day with this \u2013 depending on the product, but it is very reasonable to make around $50 a day with this website by just having people sign up with their emails. Peerfly is a CPA website where you get paid if people sign up their emails. You DO NOT have to make a sell all you need to to do is get people to sign up their email, and you make a commission. Not too bad. So if you have an excellent social media following, then this may very well be the website for you. # 4 \u2013 Fiverr  This is not necessarily an affiliate website, although they do have affiliate offers.

There are so many options that you can do with Fiverr that it will be more than possible to make well over $100 a day with this website. You will have to promote yourself, but as an affiliate, you should be well versed in doing this. # 5 \u2013 Upwork  This is much like Fiverr. Expect, unlike Fiverr where you get paid after you have done the job, Fiverr pays you before you have finished the job. # 6 \u2013 Vindale Surveys Now, I know what you are saying. Surveys! Really? However, you will be surprised how many people are making money with surveys. All you need to do is land the right surveys, and you can easily make an extra $500 a week \u2014 as NUMEROUS surveys are provided daily. Just have patience, and you will be able to start earning a nice income. # 7 \u2013 Amazon Associates  Amazon. Amazon is easily the most recognizable commence website on the planet. Becoming an associate of theirs is relatively easy. Making a sell however can be a bit more challenging. However, if you are an affiliate and you have an offer then it should be a bit easier to make a sell. Know this \u2014 if you fail to make a sell in the first 90 days, they will terminate your account. You will be able to sign up two more times, but if you fail to make a sell, then you will not be able to use their service for some time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Andrew, You asked, What are the best ways to make money as a teenager? I recommend becoming a waiter or a waitress for the following reasons\u2026 Money is good: Though the salary is minimum wage, you earn a lot in tips. Flexibility is good: There are lots of different work shifts, so it\u2019s easy to juggle college with being a waiter. It\u2019s good because you get to meet a lot of different customers: Some will be nice, some will be jerks - it is valuable training to learn to deal with all kinds of people. Plus you can become the favorite waiter or waitress of some customers, and they can ask to be seated at one of your tables. It\u2019s good because you will have to work with different managers: In one Red Lobster restaurant, there could be as many as 5 or 6 managers. Each with their own styles and standards. It is valuable training for your future to learn to deal with different managers. You will learn the ins and outs of business: You will learn how restaurant staff and menus are managed; what\u2019s important to customer service, and more. Free or discounted food: You can usually buy food from the restaurant you wait at, at a discount. Backstory: My daughter was a part time waitress at a Red Lobster, in her freshman and sophomore years of college. She was able to juggle work and college, even though she was in a 4 year college and her major was in engineering. With the money she was making, she regretted not having started waitressing when she was in high school itself. This advice comes from seeing how good a job it was for her, and seeing her W2s at tax time every year. ",

I would then approach 3-5 small businesses (preferably ones who target a younger demographic) and ask if you can run their entire social campaigns for 3 months for free.

After 3 months of kicking ass on these guys social media campaigns you should have A) some metrics that prove you are good at social.B) metrics that prove that social helped these businesses. C) 3-5 references and testimonials.  Then I would turn around and ask the people who's campaigns I had been running if they would like to upgrade to a retainer fee in order for me o continue my services, and also ask them to give me the names of 3 other business people they know, who's biz could be improved by social media help.  There you go. That's the beginning of a social media agency.

Your ears. What do you need to smell something? Your nose. What do you need to move from here to there? Your legs. And finally: What do you need to imagine and innovate ideas? Your brain. If you have all the above, i don\u2019t think you have any excuse of not getting something done.Remember, Excuses are made, ideas are thought, changes are executed. Don\u2019t make an excuse because small minds make excuses. Don\u2019t just think of ideas because thinking doesn\u2019t pay you. Execute your plans and ideas, success will be riding with you in your Ferrari. Motivated? Let\u2019s move on to real-work. Does age really matter? Started playing with computers at 12. Developed 5 applications and a website when i was 13 (ARN Utlities). Developed my first desktop game using \u201c*FPS Creator\u201d and later using \u201cUnity\u201d . Acted in short films since i was 14. Gave up acting to pursue my passion/goal (programming). Assisted developers of well-known international organizations at 16. And now,finally, i am starting my own online business. What has brought me this far? My dream of becoming big and making a difference. What are my achievements? Well, i hope you\u2019ve read that i assisted many developers. But more than that, i have gained knowledge. Compared to the knowledge of the computer/IT world, my knowledge would be 0.0.1% but it is significantly more than developers working on big companies. Am i bragging about myself? No, i am sharing the truth just so you know that you are not alone fighting. Am i making a living? Mind if i be honest? Well, i made some money doing freelancing and youtube. I am starting my online business in a few days. How much will i be making? An advice that i follow is: Dream big, start small. My first goal is generating $200 in one month. Next goal is $500, and then $1000 and so on. So, \"will i really be making money? \"Uh-huh, bad question. I rather ask myself, \"why wouldn\u2019t i be making money? \"This helps me improve my flaws. How did i got started? Again, mind if i be honest? I made a huge investment worth billions.\"How? \"Always remember, Time is valuable than money I hope you have already did the calculation but let me make it easy for you: I spent 6 years improving and training myself. But, for real, \"how much did i actually invest? \" Exactly $3. Let me type it so that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a typo : **THREE DOLLARS. \"How?\" Well, i bought 1 month web hosting from Ultra-Webhosting (Faster Website Hosting : UltraSpeed Infrastructure by Ultra Web Hosting). Here\u2019s pro-tip : Visit the link and choose web hosting and use \u201cHOSTING30\u201d as the coupon code for a huge discount. The discount doesn\u2019t matter because even without the discount, it\u2019s just $3 lol. So, how should you get started? What do you love to do? Find this out and money will knock your door. (Sorry but i cannot post all links here or else it will be marked as spam.You can verify each link if you want.) Like to play games? Start with small gameplays on YouTube. Want a more easy job? Visit the link at the bottom and follow the 1st link , get a job as a game tester, play as much as you want, earn as much as you want. Like to draw pictures? Create a Shopify store and sell there. Like to watch videos? Tons of services are available which pay just to watch videos. Like to surf the web only? Visit the link at the bottom and follow 2nd link, shorten any link(e.g. A link to a new song on youtube) share the link(on facebook or whatever) and get paid. Like to develop programs or are you a developer? Don\u2019t worry, i am launching my business fore developers where they can write articles, upload videos or courses and get paid without investing a single penny. Comment your email and i will send you the link to my website and blog soon. Like to write things like blogs or so? Visit the link at the bottom and follow 3rd link, buy a $3 hosting, monetize your blog, earn at-least $500/month from your blog. Like to workout? *Visit the link at the bottom and follow 4th link, (no offence, visit the link if you are not satisfied with your weight), take the supplement for a few days, get your desired body, upload a few videos on youtube, boost them, make more than $1000 every-month. Believe me, you can make a lot from this. And the best one comes at the end: Have a little money and want to invest? Visit the link at the bottom and follow 5th link, invest whatever you want in cryptocurrency, maybe $30, the revenue you can get is beyond your imagination. Before you say,\u201dNah, i don\u2019t believe you\u201d, why not sit back and think for a minute about what happened with BitCoin!! $15000 investment in bitcoin is worth millions now. I guess i gave you enough free resources to start with. I also shared some links where you need to buy or invest some money because, believe me, without investing, you can\u2019t get anything out of it. And the links i gave you require the least investments possible(aroung $10-$30). I really hope for your success. And i hope you would also wish me good luck with my business as-well. You can drop your email if you want so that i can ping you when my business is up and running and you can make money from it too.

            "answer_text": "College life isn\u2019t cheap. And so, it would certainly help if you could bring in a little bit of extra money, right? Fortunately, today that\u2019s a lot easier to do than it used to be, as the online working space has created a huge opportunity for students to make that extra bit of cash that will help them move from surviving into living. Now, we all know about the more common places to make money online. You can play poker, write for magazines, or perhaps use one of the big online freelancing platforms, for example. Still, there have to be better ways than that to make money, right? That\u2019s right. There are new opportunities constantly cropping up. Let\u2019s discuss a few of them here. Virtual assistant Are you a bit of a jack of all trades and do you frequently like to change things up? Then consider becoming a virtual assistant. Virtual assistants do a lot of stuff. For example, they might send out emails, write out dictated texts, set meetings, or arrange travel itineraries. Work on Fiverr - Freelance Services Marketplace for The Lean Entrepreneur The key to Fiverr - Freelance Services Marketplace for The Lean Entrepreneur is what is called the \u2018micro gig\u2019. These are small tasks that don\u2019t make you that much money, but because they don\u2019t cost you a lot of time, it can still really add up. What\u2019s more, as many of these jobs aren\u2019t that difficult, there is a real paternity to get started in te gig economy here. Sell stock photos Are you good with a camera? Then why not try to sell some stock photos? The big stock photo websites are always looking for new content that they can put up on their sites. Then you\u2019ll get a royalty every time somebody buys that picture. Work for an essay writing service If you\u2019re further along in your education and you\u2019ve got a natural knack for writing academic essays, then why not join an essay writing service? They\u2019re all over the internet and they can be great money makers if you know what you\u2019re doing and how to put together a reference table. Sell your artistic creation on Shop for anything from creative people everywhere If academics is not where it\u2019s at for you and you\u2019re a more creative type, then consider turning to etsy.com instead. This is a marketplace for the creatively and alternatively minded and is a wonderful place for you to sell your most artistic creations. Affiliate marketing Have you been writing a blog for a while and have you got a decent following? Then why not consider affiliate marketing? This is where you list products on your site and if people follow the link and buy the product, you get a little bit of money for that. Teach students in less advantaged countries There are a lot of universities out there that probably aren\u2019t as good as yours. The teachers might not be as good and the education standards might not be so high. The result? A lot of students in less-developed countries are looking for guidance and information from some of the better universities to get that edge that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. Sell tickets online As a student, you can often get tickets for events way before the public does. So why not turn that into a small business? Of course, you\u2019ll want to stay below the radar, but if you do it cleverly and know who is interested in these kinds of things, it\u2019s easy money. Do some online surveys There are plenty of websites out there that will pay you to do surveys. For example, Pinecone will pay you for doing surveys. You can also use the points you collect to get prizes. Last words And really, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. There are plenty of other things that you can do out there. Just do a search with whatever you\u2019re good at with the words \u2018make money\u2019 and plenty of results should pop up. No, not all of them will be realistic, but if you search long enough you\u2019re going to find something eventually. Just make sure it\u2019s not a scam before you sign on. Because that would be really counterproductive. Read the Complete Post Here : 9 Innovative Ways College Students Can Make Money Online Source : TechShiny | Inspire The People ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to do work with Photoshop, etc, you would need to market yourself. The fact that you can speak several languages is helpful. If you write well, you can look for freelance writing opportunities. I would sign up on websites that provide such opportunities and see if you can get some jobs. This will let you build a portfolio, perhaps get some referrals from happy clients and so on. Go to some local businesses and ask them if they are interested in having you make new signs or whatever for them. Perhaps they would be interested. In other words, hit the streets. Make sure to stay in safe areas though and let your folks know what you are doing. Maybe you could get some work doing translation. Companies that would like their websites or documents translated. Honestly, I don't know whether anyone will hire you.  There are limitations to being 14 and trying to get jobs. All sorts of legal issues can come up, including the fact that you cannot sign a contract at your age. But give it the old before-college try.  You can also do some more traditional work that is common for  young folks, such as mowing lawns, shoveling snow, raking leaves. If you don't mind physical labor, go to your neighbors and ask if they would like some help.  If you have the ability to sell antiques, and the cash to fund purchases, you could always do some buying at estate sales and reselling at your step-father's booth. There are always estate sales on the weekends. ",

            "answer_text": "First off there are no easy ways to make money for anybody. As a teenager you likely have some advantages over someone older. You may have low expenses as your parents may be covering basic survival needs\u2014food, clothing, transportation, and medical expenses. You don\u2019t have anyone besides yourself to provide for. You are young and more energetic than someone older. You can start at the very bottom because you have no one you need to impress. Starting at the bottom means you can work your way upward. You may have school but still have a great deal of free time available. Things you should consider: Do the dirty jobs\u2014cleaning up dog poop out of neighborhood yards, cleaning animal cages at vet clinics, washing cars and pressure-washing houses and fences, lawn care and landscaping;Do the jobs that may not pay so well now but offer great learning experiences\u2014assistant or apprentice to auto mechanic, plumber, construction runner, office runner [check law firms for these].Jobs you take on as a teenager may lead you to a lucrative career later on but they don\u2019t have to. Maybe you want a job where you can have fun\u2014work in a movie theatre or theme park\u2014or get free or reduced meals as part of your compensation. Some companies offer tuition assistance or reimbursement for college. Remember you are trading your time for money and other perks. Don\u2019t waste it trying to live a lifestyle to impress other people. Many of the people you know now will be strangers to you in 20 years. They will neither remember nor care about the impressions you made way back when. Your employers, though, do remember the extraordinary efforts made by someone in their first job and can serve you well as character references in your future. ",

            "answer_text": "First understand that everything in life is about making decisions, setting priorities and taking action. It is much easier to get a lot something than a little bit of everything. The best skills you can learn at a young age are the discipline to do what others will not and salesmanship. Being able to sell your self will put you head and shoulder above most adults that you will encounter throughout your life.  I would suggest an old school sales job. Start small and grow a business. My daughter had a friend who would go to Costco and buy canned sodas and snacks to sell at school. The school vending machines were very expensive so she could beat the school price and still make a profit.  How much money did she make? Selling just sodas and snack she was making about $100 per week. After a while she added some cheap merchandise like earbuds (kids always lose them) and even handmade purses. Don\u2019t pick these products. You need to research your market and sell what your classmates want. Some weeks she would make $300. All at school and just a couple of hours at Costo each week.  That may not sound like much money, but she never had to work at McDonalds and was free to set her own schedule and have enough money to buy what she wanted. Remember that this is not just about having some extra money, but learning some skills that will benefit you for a lifetime. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The sooner you start investing, more you\u2019ll have at retirement or you can retire early. My older daughter started investing nine years ago. She now has over $510,000 worth of stocks. She\u2019s 33 years old, and she has cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia, and is non-verbal and can\u2019t walk. This brings us to your first part of your question. Some smart ways for teens to make money. You\u2019ll have to see what\u2019s available in your area. I used to buck bails of hay, paint fences, built rock walls, re-roofed houses, and so on. That doesn\u2019t do you much good if you live in a city. You\u2019ll have to find a need and exploit it. Are there bike riders in your area? If so, maybe start off with patching tires and putting new chains on. From there, start carrying parts that are commonly needed. Maybe find abandoned bikes and rebuilt them to sell. Like I said, you\u2019ll have to look for opportunities to exploit. When I needed money the most, I looked for and found old furniture that needed to be repaired. I made sure they weren\u2019t cheap pieces. I repaired them, then sold them on Craigslist. Many cities have trash day when everyone can throw away their furniture and large household items. I once found a motorscooter that had a torn seat. Nothing else was wrong. It started right up! That one was pure profit. The city sometimes allow the item to sit for a week before coming around to pick them up. Search around then to find anything you think people would want if it was repaired and restored. Craigslist is a great place to search, especially their free section, to find things to resell on Ebay. A buddy of mine found an old hammer head along side the road on the way to my place. He put a handle on it, and sold it for more than what he paid for the handle but less than a new hammer. Once you get your mindset to find opportunities, creating opportunities will come easier. Best of luck to you! ",

Other options will snatch your time, you are a teenager your parents can fulfill you genuine requirements, You still comes under the category of a child you can enjoy your life be like a flower , Entire life is there to earn. because money also comes with consequences.

The most important lesson you can learn is that the way to make money is by serving others. You can make money by starting your own business such as mowing lawns or babysitting. You could start a paper out or flip burgers at a fast food restaurant. You could start a website by finding a niche to serve and a way to help people solve the problem. YouTube is really popular, you could start a YouTube channel. If you have a particular skill that you can exploit, you can make money on Fiverr or Upwork. With a little money to invest, you can find items for sale at thrift stores, on clearance, at yard sales, etc. and sell these items on eBay or Amazon. If you\u2019re interested in making money in the long term, you could take time now to learn a skill such as programming or data analysis. These skills will pay out big after you\u2019ve learned. These are just a few ways that you or anyone, regardless of your age, can earn a little bit of money. Figure out what works for you and take action. ",

If you learned a skill like Face Painting, Balloon Twisting, you\u2019d get invited to work at Birthday Parties etc. Nail Art, Dog Walking, fetching groceries or newspapers for Pensioners if they don\u2019t get things delivered or they just want a few forgotten items, you\u2019ll get calls from people offering you work. I\u2019ve just asked for 2 teenage girls (age 14) to do some gardening. These are relatively easy ways to make money but if you had access to a greenhouse or a space in someone\u2019s unused Veg Plot you could grow food & flowers, sell them at a Boot Sale. Whilst growing from seed is the cheapest route, it\u2019s economic (and smarter) to buy trays of established Plug Plants and grow them outside or in the greenhouse to 6\u2033 tall then sell them. NB. It\u2019s Good Karma to offer some of your home grown flowers FREE to a local Church or Hospice to brighten up their Entry Hall or Reception. Some people may appreciate if you\u2019d look after a Family Burial Plot. During Summer you could visit the Cemetery, strimmer around the grave and replace the flowers with fresh ones. You could be a Bike Courier cycling between Estate Agents & Solicitors delivering Documents within 1hr instead of them posting them. Work from Home - Build E-Bikes? If you have a Start-Up Fund of $300 you could buy a $100 bike, a $100 hub motor (sell the spare wheel for $20) $80 for a Li-on battery, assemble it into an EBike and sell it for $500. If you built & sold just 1 bike each day, starting with $300, by the end of the first 5 day week, you\u2019d have $1300! After you\u2019ve sold just 2 bikes, you have enough Funds to purchase the Parts for 2 more, so if you can build & sell 2 bikes a day, now you\u2019re making $2000/week. I should really try this myself! PROOF READING Despite the existence of software like Grammarly, many errors get past spellcheckers etc. and Authors don\u2019t like to send scripts/screenplays to Publishers with glaring errors. Grammarly won\u2019t likely pick it up if you\u2019ve skipped out a passage of text, or if you used a valid word incorrectly. If your Literacy is good, you could get casual work in this area. Uni/College Lecturers often give this type of work to Students so check Notice Boards. ChildMinding, Dog Walking, House Sitting, Banned Driver Chauffeur? If you have a Driving License you may be allowed to drive a neighbour to work if they\u2019ve been banned for 3\u20136mths or if they have an injury which stops them driving. Even if you have to pay a Premium on your Insurance it may still be worth doing, eg. you might get charged an additional $5-10/wk but earn $30-40 from Driving, pay it. Don\u2019t be tempted to do Takeaway Deliveries without having Commercial Driving Cover as you are effectively driving UNINSURED if you do. They want you to deliver quickly and that, combined with middle of the road stops, increases your risk of accidents. Whatever work you get, work Legally, and Safely. ",

You will find a lot of opportunity to make some good money while you still study. Let me try and list a few i did as a student way back in my days: become a sales person at exhibitions and events - visit the local office of industry associations like CII, they organize tons of events and you can get associated with event organization or be part of the team of booth staff for event participants.Weekend promotions - many companies organize weekend promotions at local shopping areas and malls. This is done through some event organizer / activation agency. You will get a list of such agencies from getit or any yellow pages service. Go register yourself for the next event.Become a teacher - if you have any skill say Maths / Physics / Language then you can teach at a local institute for a limited period of hours and make a good amount of moneySource work online - many sites online offer a chance to earn for basic tasks try mturk, this is not much but you will get a start for sure.Look for summer jobs - large e-commerce companies like Amazon organize regular sales they look for part time workers to do packaging and even delivery. This is short 2/3 week work.Can you become a host / MC? If you have a good voice and can hold an audience try the local radio station and the event organizer who does stage shows and parties. You may well become a celebrity as well.If you are moderately good looking and well built try the modeling space as well. Take care of your self and be healthy - t can pay handsomely.All in all you have a lot of options - go out and explore. Life is about building possibilities which can only happen once you start exploring. All the best! ",

Get a job. Even if you don\u2019t have any work experience. There are all kinds of places that hire first-time workers. You\u2019ll want the work experience, for one. Having a job as a teenager is a good way to avoid having zero work experience after you graduate high school. Plus, having a job is a good way to build skills \u2014 even if you wind up working at a McDonald\u2019s. Not only will you learn how to work in a fast-paced restaurant environment, you\u2019ll learn team-building and cooperative skills. Write yourself up a resume (if you don\u2019t have work experience, put down things like the school activities you\u2019ve participated in, the skills/languages you have, and the awards you\u2019ve won), and go around to various locations in your neighbourhood to see if they\u2019re hiring. You can also apply for jobs online, but I\u2019ve found that you\u2019re far more likely to get hired if you show up in person \u2014 that shows initiative. If you keep applying and make sure you\u2019re decently well-dressed when you show up to inquire about jobs, eventually, you\u2019ll get hired. Once you do get hired, work your butt off. Then, every two weeks, collect your paycheque. Voila. You now have money \u2014 not just a fixed amount of money, but a continuous source of income, as well as a way to gain contacts and work experience for future jobs. Look at you go. ",

You\u2019re going to get fierce competition from reselling items because of how popular Ecommerce has gotten in the last 3 years, maybe longer. Not saying there isn\u2019t opportunity you just have to weave a skill set to find it. Labour is always needed, especially cheap labour, learn how to negotiate now because in your adult years you don\u2019t want people paying you below minimum wage because you don\u2019t know how to. See a need and fill a need. I\u2019m not the biggest advocate of it but look at local businesses who may need websites or some help with their social media / public relations. If you\u2019re able to setup websites (or know how to outsource to fiverr) as well as understand how the social media game works it would be valuable to a business who doesn\u2019t know what facebook or instagram is.

He is too young to get an official job. Recently he has been venturing into customizing used shoes. My kids always worked, they had a lemonade stand or helped neighbors when they were small. They always wanted to have things I couldn't buy them so I helped them with their own business little. They learned how to budget for the lemons and sugar and split the profits. This has been a bit of a difficult thing. My kids were free to operate whenever they wanted, and routinely we would get some nosey person asking them if they were forced to do this, or if they were allowed to drink their own lemonade, and if I put them up to it. In the end it discouraged them. Someone with money trying to understand why I couldn't just give them everything a normal kid has. ",

Understanding money as a teenager is a whole different story. I\u2019ve always loved cooking, and from 14 I\u2019ve made my own packed lunch for school - not because my parents can\u2019t cook, but because I prefer my own cooking (sorry mum!). I started to become reknowned for my wraps which I got up and cooked myself every morning. My friends starting asking for a taste, and I usually got positive feedback. My inner entrepreneur sensed an opportunity. It began just with a few friends - my girlfriend at the time, a close footballing pal of mine and a few others. Now I didn\u2019t just wake up to make myself lunch, I also had others relying on me. Fast forward 6 months and I was making an average of 20 lunches per day. I won\u2019t go into my exact finances, but let\u2019s just say I was making on average of 500% profit margins. Fortunately, with no overhead (running out of my kitchen at home), I was pocketing most of the cash, and can now safely say from my year and a half operating, \u2018wrap god\u2019 (my name for my business - a pun on the Eminem song), I have saved enough to buy my first car, take a trip around the world, keep myself afloat through a hard 6 months I may encounter in my future, or even start something else. I worked alone, with little to no help from others. I did mostly my own promotion within school, and all my own shopping. So what do I mean by understand money? During my time in operation, I woke up at 5 every morning to cook before school, because it provided the best possible experience . Every penny I made was earned through physical work. I sacrificed 2 hours off every day to keep my little business running, and to keep my \u2018customers\u2019 satisfied. I may not have started a fancy internet business, or something that was necessarily scalable, but everything I earned represented value I was directly adding back to my community. Before, I could head into town with some pocket money in my hand and come back with nothing left, and feel nothing. Now, everything I spend means something to me. I truly understand what the phrase, \u2018money hard earned\u2019 means, and I no longer take anything I have for granted. My first question when there\u2019s any mention of a family holiday, a new house accessory, or anything of the sort is financial. Don\u2019t learn to make money - strive to understand it. Give it some meaning to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you musical? Play an instrument, sing? Can you do something else that people would like to watch? Yes? Then busking. AKA street performing. No, it isn't just for people who desperately need the money. Busking is for anyone with a talent to share. Find a business, preferably somewhere slightly on the busier side. Ask the owner of that business if you can perform on their property, after explaining what you wish to do. If it's a small business that needs publicity, they're almost guaranteed to say yes! Get your act ready, whether it's playing an instrument, breakdancing, juggling, whatever. Wear something nice-ish, in case you see someone you know ;). Ready a container to collect tips in. You're doing this for profit, after all. If your act is playing an instrument, use your case. And then.. perform! Have fun! Earn some money! Don't be discouraged if you don't collect much right away. If you establish yourself as a performer near that business you chose, people will eventually expect to see you. You might even get some regular customers. A tip for earning more money: People like to feel like they're helping more people. They'll be more likely to pay you if they know that you're not just going to use the money for yourself. Pick a local charity and establish that you're going to donate a percentage of your earnings to them. Make a sign, and put it right up next to or on your money collecting container. If you have a sign that says 1/3 of all profits goes to charity, or something similar, people will feel like they're being a productive member of society by giving to you. It helps you, it helps the charity, it helps the business you're performing in front of. Everyone wins. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to go about answering this question, and it all depends on your risk tolerance. If you\u2019re risk seeking, start a company. Starting a company is likely the riskiest way to go since you\u2019ll, in most cases, have to take on some sort of debt. This debt can come in the form of foregone wages, savings, or actual borrowed money. Since you\u2019re a teenager you\u2019ll probably need to borrow money - I recommend from a family member who is alright with you losing the money. If you\u2019re risk averse, you can take a more established route like blogging, drop-shipping, wholesale -> retail, freelance work, etc. The reward with almost any risk-averse option is very positively correlated with time/effort. I suppose this is the case with anything, but it\u2019s even more true here. If you spend several thousand hours learning to code you\u2019ll be able to make far more money than any blogging or spread/margin profits via various schemes. Of course, I didn\u2019t answer your question for no reason, my company offers a very simple way to make money online. Whoever comments their name below, i\u2019ll make sure your application is accepted. Read about it on the Money section of our site. ",

You can work as a fencing teacher, you can put out fencing videos online. You can make a blog about fencing. The money might not come straight away but since you are doing what you love, why not? If you do well, you will make a ton of money in the future.  If you need the cash fast, then you need to start a service which is teaching people how to fence. Hand out flyers around your neighbourhood saying that you are starting a beginners to fencing class and charge the first few lessons for free. Since your students would most likely be younger than you, ask their parents to watch you teach their kids. After a few free lessons, let the parents charge you what they want. If you are a good teacher, they would give you lots of money. If not, learn to be one.  PS: If you know you're good, and you know the parents are stingy, charge your own prices. ",

FiverrWith Fiverr you can do small tasks and get paid $5 for it, hence the name \"fiverr\" on fiverr you'll find that many people sell graphic designs, voice overs, etc. However that stuff is saturated you need to be creative and sell something that stands out. If you do sell something that stands out you can find your self making lot's of money right away. Niche WebsiteUnlike fiverr, a niche website takes time to make money however when it does start money you'll love it because it's passive meaning you don't have to do anything but collect your check at the end of the month. Now if you don't know what a niche website is, it's basically a website that 1. focuses on a very specific term or topic say basketball or football. And 2.

            "answer_text": "Easiest way is your relatives. Have an aunt that works in HR but is clueless on using a computer? Offer to help and negotiate a price. Don\u2019t be greedy, but don\u2019t undercut yourself either. I had an aunt that I would help her with computer related stuff and I didn't charge much because It was guaranteed she\u2019d be calling me to come back soon and she lived less than a mile from me. My grandmother hired me to cut her grass, patch a hole in the wall thanks to a cousin, mount her TV and I assembled her old TV cabinet. Another way is doing deliveries for Postmates on your bike. If you don\u2019t already, get a good commuter bike, large backpack, and insulated food bags and you\u2019re good to go. You won\u2019t be able to deliver alcohol until you turn 21, but you can deliver food and run errands. Plus you can log on or off anytime you want. Grubhub pays better, but you have to be on a schedule. Enroll in a vocational/trade school. You can learn a lot of useful trades and be able to do more work for relatives. My first electrical job was installing a doorbell for an aunt. I was never certified, just knew enough to be dangerous. Since then I've replaced outlets and switches, installed and replaced ceiling fans, and repaired apartment intercoms that the tenants were willing to pay me for the work because building management was too slow. You can also try apprenticeship with a electrician or carpenter for example. For minimum wage or less you can be a helper and learn from a professional and once you get certified, you can work for them or start your own business. You can also take online courses or watch youtube instructional videos. Buy a clunky beat up car from a junkyard and try to get it running again. And now you are a mechanic and as time and money permits, you can build your own workshop in your parent\u2019s garage. You can always donate blood or plasma for money. It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s pocket change and tax free income. Sell stuff on ebay. Figure out what stuff you can sell. Go to flea markets or search on apps like OfferUp or LetGo for cheap stuff and then turn around and resell it. Buy some junky smartphones and try to repair them. Once you learn how, you can market yourself for doing phone repairs. Advertise at community colleges or high schools. Only work for cash. There are more ways but the point being that these are ways to make an honest buck as a teenager and can be turned into jobs when you reach adulthood. I have done most of these myself and shocked people how I could afford nice toys and gadgets when I didn\u2019t have a job. ",

            "answer_text": "When you\u2019re young, you can practice doing smaller task to make money that will eventually teach you the mentality and skills to pursue bigger businesses as you age. Easiest way to make money without any investment is to simply sell things that you don\u2019t want or need around your house. You\u2019d be surprised how many items you have laying around that you haven\u2019t touched in months. A lot of videos games can be sold for a good amount of change too!Ask your neighbors if you could mow their lawn or have a car wash in your local neighborhood. I know this one sounds cliche, but it works and you\u2019d be surprised how nice older people are when you offer to help them out.Arbitrage - Go to a thrift store or garage sale and try to find items that are extremely undervalued (you would have to research the cost of these items selling on ebay or amazon etc.) and buy all the items that being sold for a cheap price & sell them for the higher value online. Example: You find an old laptop at a garage sale for $40 and sell it online for $200. The concept is fairly vague, but once you understand how this could scale into bigger things such as private label or starting your own business based off the idea, then you could make a lot more.Last way is to freelance. Find something you are skilled at and go on Fiverr or Upwork and try to see if anyone would be willing to pay you to do what your offer. Example: You are good at making funny memes and somebody needs a person to create viral marketing post for their social media page. Whatever it is, there is someone out there who would be willing to pay you for it.Hope these tips helped. There are also apps that pay you money just for playing games. I found a video showing one app that pays you for playing. You can see the Youtube Video Here. ",

Assuming that you need a basic amount every month for your extra pocket money, here\u2019s what you can do! The best thing you can do is, There\u2019s this App I\u2019ve been using. Dream 11. It\u2019s a fantasy sports app available on App store and Play store. Make sure you have a decent football/Cricket knowledge if you\u2019re planning to do it. The way it works is, You make a team of 11 players combined from two teams playing (7 Maximum and 4 minimum from each team) and decide the Captain (2x points) and Vice captain (1.5x points). Join paid leagues. Avoid Grand league and don\u2019t overinvest. You need to verify your account. Verify E-Mail.Verify Phone number.Verify Pan card.Verify Bank account.Now that you\u2019re just 15 and don\u2019t have a PAN Card and probably no bank account either, Find someone from your friends and family who does. Make sure you open the Dream 11 account with the same name given on the PAN card and Cheque book/Pass book. You can add money Via PayTM but for withdrawing, You need to verify. They\u2019ll give you a tad bit amount as a joining bonus too. Play it. Win it. Withdraw it! This is legal and fun too! But You\u2019re 15 now, Make sure you\u2019re not missing out on anything important because of this. Give it roughly 15\u201330 mins a day. I\u2019d also want you to let your parents know what you\u2019re upto. Open up to them, And you might not need all this fuss in your life. After 21, There\u2019ll be a lot of money, But no childhood. Make sure you do well! Any help, I\u2019m always here. Do it safe. Do it well. Cheers! (: ",

Best of all its totally legal This answer is from my blog Personal Evolution where I go into more detail: We've all seen the adverts for Bookies offering stuff like: bet \u00a35 and we'll give you \u00a320 for free! These have been going on for years! The question has always been is there any way to get that \u00a320 without risking it? Enter betting exchanges! These allow people to take a position on the opposite outcome. I'll explain with a... Quick Example: Manchester City vs Arsenal There are 3 outcomes for Manchester City... Win, Draw or Lose. At the bookie (i.e. Ladbrokes) you would \"back\" (bet for) an outcome (i.e. Manchester City to Win). However at an exchange you \"lay\" (bet against) the outcome (i.e Manchester City not to win - which means you bet for them to lose or draw). So that's the basic mechanic of the exchange.. Why does this mean free money? Now using both the Bookie and Exchange you can bet on all outcomes of the game i.e risk free This in its self is useless because you would still lose money if you did this with just your own money... However using the free bets we can effectively get money for nothing... Because by betting for and against the outcome of the match you can guarantee a slice of that free bet. ",

Retail arbitrage is basically when you will go to a store like Walmart or Target and you go to the clearance aisle or if you see an item that's much cheaper than it usually is you can actually get that item and then you can check the price on places like eBay Amazon or Facebook marketplace. Then go ahead and sell it for more than what you paid. A lot of people do this with kids toys, and they buy them in bulk when they\u2019re on sale. There'll be like big Lego sets like 80% off and people buy like 10 to 20 LEGO sets resell them on eBay or Amazon and make like $300 - $500 profit. There are people that actually do retail arbitrage as a full-time income I'm not saying you guys are gonna make a full-time income but it is a great way to make a couple 100 if not a couple extra thousand dollars every single month.

            "answer_text": "\"if it were easy everybody would do it\" There is no easy or profitable --  by profitable I mean something that has a satisfying outcome related to effort put in the business --   way to make money legally, when you have just a few hours a week and while you are studying at boarding school,  otherwise everybody would do that thing that makes money. To make money you have to deliver something that a lot of people are willing to listen, you have to be great in what you do (es: you make a youtube channel about cooking, or about do it yourself, or about hacking, or about smartphone, etc etc...) and you have to sell (here you need high marketing skill, not really though, but i need to know how to do this) to the people in way that they will be entertained and will continue to follow you. You need, almost to master the things that you are \"teaching\". You'll have to study a lot, and put a lot of hours of works just to set you up, then maybe you'll get the first view, then if you're really great at what you do the subscribers will follow and you'll start to make a small amount of money, then if you're the best and you target a lot of people and you go viral, you could make even a living, but it will be almost impossible. Given the fact that you don't have much free time, you can't focus only on doing this thing, so i'd tell you to let this thing go. maybe in 2 or 3 months you could have done what a normal person, out of high school, would have made in 7 days, so you are at a huge disadvantage. I'd focus only about the school, try to find some interesting book worth reading about enterpreneur, or coding, or finance, or whatever do you find interesting. pursue your passion, and money will come to you. I'd suggest you to read: \"4 hour workweek\" by ferris, \"little book that beats the market\" by greenblatt, these are easy reading books that will give you a lot of usueful advice, but pay attention, not everything is correct or it's gold, so maybe if you're unexperienced they could drive you on the wrong path. for other advanced lectures i'd wait... i just pointed out the first two that are worth reading and will deliver the best outcome with the less time spent, because effectivness is the most important thing (and it's different from efficiency) The most important thing is your mindset here: there are two ways to get rich: one is to have all you want, the other is to be satisfied with what you have.this in my opinion is the whole point of the question, you're young, you don't really need that money... If you're still willing to try, make a youtube channel, write a blog, or stream on twitch while you play some videogames. but you won't have time to be good enough, if you aren't already that good, so pretty much there is a waste of time.

Once you master in a field, make a profile on a freelancing website, getting your first order is difficult but stay determined, and provide quality to your client once you get orders rolling in. I will tell you my experience. I learned graphic designing from an institution back in high school and didn't earn anything until second year of my college. I never thought to make money with my skill, but now I do, and it's pretty good for a student. The main thing which you'll get from freelancing is experience, how do you sell your service, how do you provide quality to your client, how do you talk, how do you tackle deadlines. These things matter more than money. Learn and get experience. You have to earn money for the rest of your life, assuming you don't need it for any kind of emergency.

If you think you're too good to do that sort of work, or that it's only fit for some other race, or illegal immigrants, you won't make money. Everybody on most of the jobs I worked had no problems with other citizens, but we all would have fought foreigners for our low-paying jobs. One of my brothers, and a friend of his stocked shelves at Kroger, but all stores need stockers. You can get certified as a lifeguard, and work at a municipal or country club swimming pool, or caddy at a golf course. If you get a job, do it right, without bitching about it. Prove yourself to the boss, and leave the phone in the car; you aren't being paid to play with it! I got promoted to better positions, by bosses who saw the potential in me, based by how I handled the tasks assigned to me. If you are picking up litter, pick it ALL up. Don't claim knowledge you don't have, but be trainable. Be the one who steps up to the task, instead of hoping someone else gets put on that one. The best jobs are the ones you get, and make money at, not the ones someone else has. Those are filled already. It doesn't hurt to apply, though. ",

It will probably not be the start of a career, but it will give you a jumping off point to build on or expand upon. It may very well act as a guide to show you what you don\u2019t want to do. I started at 17 years old as a maintenance assistant at a heavy equipment company. I learned some basic mechanical skills. but usually was kept busy cleaning the yard, doing a lot of sanding and spot painting and helping the older, more senior guys perform some more complicated task. Knowing I probably did not want to do this sort of work as a career prompted to apply myself at the community college I attended that fall. I discovered that I liked psychology and that I could write. I ended up leaving school with an Associates degree (A.A./Humanities). I worked in retail for a couple of years, when a good friend, who had a degree in Communications/Marketing from Penn State wrangled me an interview for a sales job at a small newspaper. I really liked it and left there 17 years later in middle management. With a couple of marketing and sales jobs in between, I ended up working for a state agency in Labor and Industry, a very dry technical job with great benefits. I retired after 6 years with a small but welcome pension. The moral of the story, be willing to try anything and give it your best shot. Act as if your life depended on the job you have, whatever it is. You can never tell where it will lead or what door it will open later in life. ",

I don\u2019t mow lawns for money since I don\u2019t really like lawns, but if outdoors stuff is your thing, then mowing peoples\u2019 lawns is a good way to make money, get exercise, and do something you enjoy.Kill random insects. No, seriously. Did you know that there are a lot of people who dislike carpenter bees? All you need is a tennis racket, just saying\u2026Organize a bake sale. If you like baking and cooking, you could make a bunch of baked goods and sell them.Do other odds and ends. Usually someone will pay you for doing something they don\u2019t want to do.Ages 16\u201319 In addition to the previously stated things, teens in this age category can usually: Get a job. You can probably get a decent minimum wage job at 16\u2014go work at McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s. These usually are decent jobs for teenagers.Tinker around. At this age, you might be mechanically inclined or inclined toward other manual labor. You shouldn\u2019t have too hard of a time getting work like that.Lifeguard. That\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do. If you\u2019re a good swimmer, then this could be a pretty good job.Babysit. You likely can drive, and you also likely have a phone, so this is a great way to make money if you like kids\u2014or can fake liking kids.Tutor. I do this as well. I\u2019m tutoring another person in Latin. If you\u2019re a good enough student, this can also be a pretty easy way to make money.Overall, I\u2019d say the biggest thing is motivation. Making money takes effort and time. You have to be committed in order to make money. Any of the above would be great for a teenager looking to make money. But you have to be willing to commit to it. If you aren\u2019t, then I\u2019m sorry, you aren\u2019t ready to be making money. Civility. Honesty. Diversity. Andrew Steiner ",

            "answer_text": "You can mow lawns and make a TON of money. As long as you have a mower, you can ask your neighbors if you could mow their lawn. If they say no, go to another house and ask them. If they say yes, agree on a day that you can mow it and a price. I can\u2019t tell you how much to charge, as it all depends on the size of the lawn. Look up pricing info online and try to charge a bit less than a company would, as you are not a professional. Above all, do an excellent job on their lawn, ESPECIALLY on the first mow, as the first mow is like a first impression in meeting somebody important. Do a great job, and you will most likely be able to mow their lawn every 1 or 2 weeks. If you have the time and can manage it, add more yards to your route. With just 1 lawn, you should be making at least 20 dollars, and that is the BARE minimum. (Very small lawn.) It should only take you around an hour to mow a lawn if it is a medium to big lawn, depending on the mower. A small lawn can take as little as just 20 minutes to mow, while a very large lawn can take 2 hours or more, although you would get paid a lot more for that. The easiest lawns are not only the smallest, but the ones without any obstacles in your way. Yards with multiple trees or rock formations can be harder to mow, as well as downhill sections without room to turn around at the end, causing you to have to pull the lawn mower back up the hill, which can be very strenuous. It may feel like a lot of work, but you can easily make at least 100 dollars in just a couple of hours of mowing. When you\u2019ve finished, you\u2019ve got the money and still have almost all of the day to do whatever you want to do! ",

They usually last for a month to 6 months and you may also choose to work from home in some cases. 4.\tPut up stalls in fest. Fest take places in various places from colleges to local housing societies. Figure out the cost it will take you to set up a stall and decide on what sort of stall you want to put up. It could be a food stall as well as a product selling shop. 5.\tHelp by doing community services. These include various tasks from babysitting, gardening, running errands to tutoring, conducting an art/music/dance class for the younger kids around your house. 6.\tDo home chores. If all goes wrong, ask your parents for extra allowance in exchange of doing home chores. Most likely parents would agree to this as they would be happy to know that you are ready to learn to take on some responsibility around the house. ",

Professional tutors are expensive, and your primary goal should be to seriously undercut the competition in order to compensate for a lack of experience. If you go with $15 an hour, you could tutor for two hours a night, three nights a week, and pull in $90 per week for six hours of work.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say try and land a gig job on Fiverr or other sites like that. You can say you\u2019re just starting out and want to build up a reputation, so you\u2019ll do free work for reviews to build up your legitimacy and skills (unless you have a portfolio of some sort that shows experience in the work you want to do already). I\u2019d say that\u2019s a good way to start building connections, and connections are good to have in freelancing. Freelancing has many avenues of work available, and you will be surprised the different ways you can earn money aside from a \u201ctraditional job\u201d, i.e. standing at a cash register for hours to be paid minimum wage. Your time is valuable, I\u2019ve read you should value your time at $50 an hour. That could be valued as productivity, amount of fun you are having, skill-building, etc. You are the director of your life and you have the power to affect the outcomes in your life. Take executive action and don\u2019t settle for less. I\u2019ve done work on crowd-sourcing website such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific, Testable Minds. There are others out there, but those three are the ones I\u2019ve had the most experience with. I highly recommend the first two, while the third has occasional work it can be a nuisance to validate yourself with a webcam each time a study comes up. You could look into starting an e-commerce store, do affiliate marketing, learn SEO and optimization, learn to write quick e-books that provide value, just learn and grow through experiencing the unknown. You never know what you are capable of until you try. Get after your goals, get motivated, take some responsibility for how you want to live! Don\u2019t settle for less unless you feel you have to, it\u2019s not about the end-goal but the journey. Good luck on everything. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re like many teenagers, you probably spend several hours online, either on a computer or a smartphone. What are you doing? Watching videos, taking surveys, surfing social media, listening to music? You can do all of these things and get paid for it if you sign up for various sites. SWAGBUCKS Swagbucks is a site that allows you to earn gift cards and cash by taking surveys, shopping, watching videos, and so on. You need to be 13 years old to sign up. The way it works is that you use the Swagbucks search engine to go about whatever you were going to be doing anyway. You rack up points, which can be exchanged for gift cards or Paypal. IBOTTA Ibotta allows you to purchase from different places and you earn cash back. It is literally like buying everything at a discount, but they pay you to buy their stuff. Ibotta works with an enormous number of online retailers and apps: Uber, Samsung, Apple, Home Depot, Under Armour, Olive Garden, Fossil, and more. You name it, you can make money shopping there with Ibotta. MUSICXRAY If you like discovering new bands, musicxray might be right up your alley. Those looking for ideas on how to make musicxray for teens will be glad to know that MusicXRay sends new music to your inbox and you get paid a few cents to listen to the songs. That\u2019s it! You might be wondering what the catch is, but there is none. After 30 seconds, you can skip a song you don\u2019t like and still receive compensation. If you do like the song, though, the company\u2019s assumption is that you\u2019ll share it with your friends and maybe even support the artist. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone. YOUTUBE VIDEOS When it comes to money-making opportunities on YouTube, the cliche is, of course, the video game streamer. If you are a gamer, you\u2019re probably familiar with PewDiePie, the Swedish YouTuber who features various video games. While gamers are popular on YouTube (and even more so on Twitch), there are a lot of them, so if that\u2019s your art form, you\u2019re going to need to be competitive. Consider thinking about other ways of making money on YouTube. Maddi Bragg is YouTube-famous for her beauty and \u201coutfit of the week\u201d videos. Lucas and Marcus Dobre are 17-year-old twins who make challenge videos. You also might have heard of charli\u2019s krafty kitchen, which features an 8-year-old who makes $127,000 per month with her cooking and baking videos! DIGITAL PRODUCTS Could you see yourself writing personalized poems, sending out a list of ideas for a blog, or creating some other type of digital product? You can earn money online through a platform like Fiverr, which allows creators to charge $5 (or more) for a specific service or product. If you are a writer, you might evenwrite an ebook to sell on Amazon for Kindle. This is, of course, a long-range project, but you could earn passive income in the form of royalties for months or even years after you publish yourebook And if you like taking photographs, you could sell stock pictures through sites like Shutterstock or iStockPhoto. This is another way that you can make royalties, so if you upload a lot of photos, you could see a nice income trickling in each month. ",

And this can be used to earn some money. First things that come to my mind are as following: For example you can start a blog or a small online store and start earning money there. Or you can learn a little more on how to build websites and help people do it for money. This one is rather good in a long term perspective. And today it\u2019s not difficult at all. Or you can do some copywriting for other websites and blogs. If you\u2019re a communicative person, they also hire people to write emails and social media posts. That would be another option. If you learn a little about web design, that would be a real catch, because people are willing to pay for it the most. If you\u2019re interesting in trying to conquere the web, here\u2019s a good place to start with \u2014 Startup Hub. There are tons of guides there, so you can choose a sphere you want to work in. ",

Most fast food places have decent pay and great benefits. Just go to places around your city that you tend to go to often and if you see a hiring sign, walk in and ask a manager about it. If you have any skills or hobbies, you could also look around at places where your passions lie. I know someone who works part time at an auto shop because his dad taught him a lot about cars and I know someone who interned at a tech company because they liked coding, so they spent the summer skimmimg for errors in programmers\u2019 codes and testing the software. There's a lot of options put there if you just keep looking. Hope this helps! ",

As a teenager, no matter what you do, earning a lot of money isn\u2019t likely to be one of them so the best advice is to find something your passionate about, find a problem that needs to be solved and figure out a way to solve it.

When you're going to college, it's nice to have a little money, and you're going to earn that money by doing a part-time job. Now, when you're 18y/o+, your minimum wage suddenly is a lot higher than now, which sounds like a reason to start looking for a job when you're 18, but it is also a reason for people not to hire you, and instead hire a 16y/o whom they have to pay less. Therefore it's good to have some experience before you turn 18. I worked in a supermarket for three years (different supermarkets though),first as a stockboy and later as a cashier, which were really nice jobs. You often get a relatively good wage and it's sure you can work a nice amoumt of hours every week, trough the whole year. Also, if you want a day off, it's often easy to arrange someone eho can work for you instead. Another popular option is working in a restaurant. In a restaurant you often work long shifts, many days in the week, but that is mainly during vacations. The conditions are more harsh, the pay is not always guaranteed to be good, due to not having that many employees it can be hard to arrange a day off, but all those things are compensated for by the fact that during vacations, as I said, you can work a lot. And if you're lucky, you may get high fees. ",

Think about what you are capable of learning to do and find someone who is willing to pay for that.  Everyone starts out with no experience, the way you get experience is by doing. Convenience stores, grocery stores, shopping centers, any business that interacts or sells to people needs employees to talk to customers. Present your self to those companies in such a way that they will say to themselves \"this kid can sell out product\", and you will get a job.

            "answer_text": "While in High School I made 600\u2013800\u20ac/year working about 2 hours per week. 2 hours per week is literally nothing. I did it in my spare time just for fun and I ended up saving almost all of it. Want to know what I did? Tutoring. A family friend needed someone to tutor his son as he struggled in Maths and Geometry. I went to his house 2 hours per week, earning 10\u20ac/hour (I would say it\u2019s average price in Italy, especially for a high school teenager). I\u2019ve been tutoring him for 3 years now and I love it. I\u2019m attending University now and I\u2019m tutoring also another kid, so I would say I work 3 hours per week, earning ~900\u20ac/year. I recommend this to everyone who is really good at a subject as you could earn good money working in your spare time. I\u2019m tutoring just two kids but if you tutored more kids you could earn way more than what I earn, working just few hours per week. I know people who do this for a living: they have a Degree and therefore could possibly earn 20\u201330\u20ac/hour, maybe more, and also tutor a lot of kids earning enough to live comfortably. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a teenager I did a lot of yard work. It was a pretty sweet gig. I saved up over $5,000.  But what I didn't know about back then was the power of investing and compound interest.  It is a powerful force. And it's more powerful the younger you take advantage of it.  I would recommend that you learn about investing. Read The Intelligent Investor. It's Warren Buffett's favorite investing book.  If you invest properly, that $5,000 would grow at 12% to 15% per year.  What you should try to do right now is to put your savings into a ROTH IRA. You can contribute a maximum of $5,500 per year into it. The great thing is, if you wait to withdraw your earnings until (I think it's) age 65, you don't have to pay taxes on any of your earnings. This is huge.  So let's say you save $10,000 as a teen. You invest this. You earn $1,200 your first year.  If you invest that $10,000 at a 12% return for 55 years... you will have over $5,000,000 in the bank.  thanks for reading, Eric Earle Director of Youth Development www.mentorportland.com ",

Now to get started online, for most of the online business modules you will need some amount of capital to get started like dropshipping, amazon fba and many others so if you have the start up capital which should be approx 3000 dollars the it is fine but if you do not want to invest in your business or you do not have the capital then you can start affiliate marketing. You do not have to own the product, do support, inventory or any other thing. You just have to promote the product that you want to product, it can be a physical product or a digital product. You will be given a affiliate link which will be unique to you which you will use while promoting it and when someone clicks your affiliate link then you will get a certain commission % on the product usually it is 50%. So i think the best way to get started for a teenager should be affiliate marketing and if you want to know more then you can click here ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Mate, For a teenager, the most importance should be given to your studies rather than how to earn money. Still, if you are considering to earn money, I assume you will not be getting into investment, as teenager+no experience+investment = LOSS! So, better first learn your way, try to find a mentor in your circle who have prior experience with these, or if you don't find someone Offline, try someone online. Don't trust anyone simply, and give your any sensitive data, but listen to them, and learn from them. At the start, this seems to be impossible, and will seem not worth it, but let me tell you, the starting is always the toughest part. So, try to overcome that. Once you have gained some info regarding the same, you are ready to earn online. But don't go gangsta investment, wait, stop, think and take a decision. Never take impulsive decision when you are investing, that can be more harming than helping. Also the best way to earn money from online is to provide service. Service in which you are good. Like if you are good at photoshop, try to offer your service in sites like Fiverr, etc, and you can earn Rs. 300 to Rs. 6K+ per order, depending upon the time you invest, the dedication and the quality of your work. So, if you are able to complete just 10 orders monthly, you can earn something betweek Rs. 3K-60K!!! :) Hope this helps you in some way. ",

I eventually built a big business which I sold and retired young (see details in my other posts). I attribute a big part of my success to my experience running a small business when I was younger. I only wish that getting customers today was as easy as it was then. You didnt need a business plan or investors, just a big smile and a willingness to work hard. You could have 10 customers by the end of the day, just in your neighborhood! Start doing it today. The experience you gain is invaluable and will be a huge advantage when you start out on your own later in life. ",

            "answer_text": "The Internet and e-Commerce is an integral part of a teen's life. Email, instant messaging, and social networking sites allow easy communication between friends. Teenagers spend an enormous amount of time surfing the Internet. All this makes them experts in the online world which in turn makes it easier for teens to make money online. The internet allows people with different kinds of backgrounds to start a business at a very low cost; this makes moneymaking opportunities for adults available to teens. In fact, teens may earn even more money online using the same income-generating programs that adults use. This is because they have a wider network of friends who are more tech-savvy, and they usually have more free time. There are many ways for teens to make money online. Paid surveys can be a good way for teens to make money online. There are companies who are searching for a teen's point of view. This is a fun way for teens to earn extra cash, but I found it in a bit on the slow side... there are also a lot of scams out there that require you to make an initial payment in order to start surveys. Don't fall for those. Testing online games is another way teens can make money online. Game companies and game websites will pay teens to test games and give feedback or reviews. The only problem with this option is that these sites usually have long waitlists. It also shares some similarities with the paid survey sites. For every legit site out there, there are 5 that are trying to scam money off you. In my opinion, the best way for teens to make money online is through affiliate marketing. One of the easiest ways for teens to make money using this method is to build a large network on MySpace or Facebook and then promoting products that your friends would be interested in buying. You could simply post a link to the product and earn a commission when your friends make a purchase. Now is a great time to start affiliate marketing for teens, the Internet is flourishing. Every day there are more people making purchases online. Take advantage of this and act now! Jim Wa is tired of seeing get rich quick-schemes polluting the Internet. He is trying to make people see the truth behind these programs and set them onto the right track to make money online. ",

If that is the case I don't see what you can tack on the side without leaving the job altogether. Alternatively, do you think you would be able to make it more efficient and are there any issues relating to copyright/patent which would stop you from developing the idea and making a competative product, perhaps at a lower cost or has more functions, but at a low out-lay but justifying a higher retail price and therefore greater profit margin.  Do you have a strong grasp of basic skills such as arithematic, reading, and even Grade IV maths and above; i.e. helping younger or even children your age to improve their skills.  You could always set up a tutoring operation which you could charge out a fee, and probably payable by the parent. As you are not a teacher there may be certain areas you would not be able to tutor, but certainly helping other people with their homework should not be an issue.  You  can only ask your local authority which deals with education what you can and cannot do.  Best of luck with your endeavours.  ",

But knowing which industry will depend on your skills.  Sites like Upwork (formerly oDesk) have plenty of options, from writing, to design, to customer service, to data entry. But you have to hunt for the contracts that pay a decent rate. On the plus side, you can use either an online funding source like PayPal, or connect it directly to your bank account for payments.  If you have a car, you can offer something like a home delivery service. Maybe offer to help the sick, elderly or busy professionals with daily tasks, errands, grocery shopping, ect.  When my friend was a teenager she opened up a maid service. Though she did this with her mother, so she was never alone. If you plan on going into people's homes, make sure you protect yourself. Have someone aware of where you are at all times, keep a schedule complete with address and times with a third party, or if possible, go with a third party. ",

It will teach you GREAT skills. Also, people will WANT to help you succeed in a way that you won\u2019t have as an adult. I\u2019m helping all of my children start businesses at around ten years old. There are so many things you can do to earn revenue. Some things I\u2019d highly recommend: Start a youtube channel. Learning to build an audience as a teenager will pay you dividends for your entire life. Being comfortable on camera is a GIANT asset, especially in the age you\u2019ll be growing up in. Alternatively, you could twitch stream and upload to youtube. There are a lot of useful skills from streaming too.Start a Blog. Blogging can be a really good source of income, and learning to write well is a great skill.Start affiliate marketing. You will definitely need your parents to help you a little bit with this one. Pick your favorite social media network and learn to build an appropriate audience on there. I can help with this one if you pursue it. Hit me up.There are always the classics like cutting yards and babysitting. You\u2019ll have to learn to sell yourself, which is a useful skill. Learning to go door to door or market is incredibly powerful. They both also require hard work, which building your work ethic is useful.Join an online classroom program and learn a skill you can contract out. If something interests you like programming or graphic design, learn that and start freelancing. Try and pick a skill you can continue to monetize as an adult. Make sure to create a blog as a side hustle and keep your projects there, along with talking about what you learned. Future employers will be crawling over each other if you have a portfolio from when you were a teen! But if you are successful in one of those, you can freelance for more money forever.I\u2019m sure there are a lot more but there are some good starters. Good luck and take advantage of this time you have now! ",

Make sure you tell them to tell their friends your selling drinks. I have tried and tested this so it's possible, all you need is a store to buy 12 packs from for $6 or more, and try not to get caught. After a week maybe, depending on your school, you may have teachers or other staff trying to shut you down. Don't get discouraged if you get shut down, just keep going for it with a new plan, like maybe recruit some friends to help you sell the drinks, so it's harder for teachers to follow. This is one idea that I've made a lot of money on and one I personally suggest for anyone who\u2019s into making money. ",

Since I assume most of you have a iPhone, there is an app on the AppStore called Blabber, this app allows you to message your friends or other people and make $15.00 by texting each other. Instead of using Whatsapp or iMessage you can use this app and make money at the same time. To make $15.00 you need to send 15.000 texts in order to get payed and when you reach that you can instantly pay out to your PayPal Account and they are usually very fast at sending the money :) If you would like you can add me on the App, just search for KevX on the Find Friends tab and add me :) Hope this helped you, if you thought this comment was useful please upvote, so other people can do this too :P ",

I\u2019ve seen stuff like \u2018drawer lot\u2019 going for 200 dollars on Ebay. A drawer lot is a bunch of stuff in your drawer ALL up for sale. SO some common stuff in a drawer lot are badges, coca cola bottle caps, patches, teddy bears, books, pencils and pens. If you have a stuff-full drawer why not sell it? I know someone who has sold all his useless stuff like old comic books, pens and all sorts and by the end of the year, he learned around 2500USD through Ebay. Think about what you like & sell them and buy them. I personally like hats, morse keys and trumpets. What people do is to flip them. I personally haven\u2019t flipped any items but I have one restored by myself but have no intention of selling. So, people buy a crappy looking thing (hat, car or anything) and then they buy them really cheaply, they fix it up and sell it for 2 times the value they bought it for. That is really it. Good luck!

If you have a busy highschool life some places will let you work on the weekends, breaks, or summers. Not only does it pay well, but you get to experience a different environment that allows you to network and build relationships that could benefit you later on. Plus it\u2019ll look great on college applications\u2026 >:)\u2026 Also, classes are really not that long. It usually takes 4\u201312 weeks including a minimum of 75 hours of instructions and clinical training.

Do what you want, you only live once. I would also suggest you, from my own experience, to develop a personal brand throughout your journey so that not only you can have an impact behind a company name, but also with yourself, which is pretty cool. And for the skills you\u2019re asking, I would highly suggest you to develop self-awareness, gratitude, patience, productivity and emphaty. By mastering these skills and doing what you truly love, you will for sure on the long-term earn as much money as you want. (wait 15 years) Good luck. Hope it helps! ",

Depending on the price of Ethereum. Now imagine if you got good with numbers. And you started off with $25 put into a tiny little mining allocation. Then every week you did odd jobs and continued to invest your money building up your mining shares. Eventually you could be like a gold miner but in ethereum. Another way is to speculate. Imagine if you bought shares in APPLE of GOOGLE while they were in the garage. No one wanted them when they were in the garage. But you bought shares when they were low. Then you hold onto to them until they go high. Long term. This is all long term stuff. Short term stuff. This is simple. Here is how to be a financial genius. Look for all the things that no one wants to do because it sucks. Then think about a way that you could make that easier for them so it doesnt suck, And charge them for the UNSUCK factor.

The best way to make money as a teenager is to: Ask other people businesess, whether you can help to sell their products to your friends and earn commissions.Make sure that the product fits your target market.Your first target market should be teenagers too. Because its easy for you to understand what they want and how much they are willing to pay to solve certain problems.Go ahead and sell to them. Get your first 10 customers.Once you manage to earn more than $1,500, start learning on how to approach your target market using paid advertising.I recommend you to learn Facebook Ads. Finally, always bare in mind that the most important skill you need to master are both marketing & selling.Work your ass off and take action. Right now.   ",

If gaming is a passion for you, then I'd recommend you combine both of those. Since most YouTube gamers don't have their own blogs, it's a great way to capture a bigger audience faster. If you're not into gaming, then blogging would still be an awesome way to earn some extra money. What you'll need to figure out then is what you're really passionate about and start writing about that. For actually making money this way, you could go for using ads on your blog (easiest, but less profitable) or to sell someone else's product as an affiliate, which takes a bit more effort.  Just keep in mind that these methods take some time to really get going. If you're starting I'd recommend you stick with it for at least 3 months until seeing significant result (although you can get them earlier with hard work). Best of luck with whatever you choose to do! :) ",

However, in a \"teach a man to fish\" fashion, I will move on to the more meta part of this question. There are basically two different ways to make money; to leverage a skill you have and work, or to start a business. You can use your skill to start your business. For example, with the article writing, you could potentially start as a one man article writing team. With enough capital, you could start outsourcing the articles and merely coordinating projects between other freelancers. This is a process known as bootstrapping. Whatever it is you decide you want to do, make sure you research your market. Research it a lot. Read about it whenever you possibly can, and don't ever stop trying to learn new things about it. That's the only way to get better, and in the process, make more money. Best of luck! ",

Once I had learned the basics, I convinced the shop owner to put me on the books and more than double my hourly rate.  I'm able to use the shop during off hours, so I do a side project or two a month. I also teach primitive wilderness skills a few weekend days a month. I don't make much from it, but it's so enjoyable that I don't consider it work. ",

When I was in college back in 2000 where DSL and broadband internet was like some sort of far from hand technology, only modem internet is available (internet speed was 64 kilobyte/sec). Downloading media like mp3 files or movies rmvb or avi was not that easy like today. Those days we trade movie from hard drive to hard drive. I OWNED A HUGE Directory of media back days. I thought maybe I can trade my storage with money. But It remained an idea. There were no ligitimacy no social media to advertise. So you can get benefit from internet to sell your items, craft works, services etc.. Remember you are in your gold times right now to learn something that later will grant you making money. ",

And if you\u2019re managing that and school well, then maybe even pick up some odd jobs on the off days from your part-time job. ( Raking, shoveling, ect.) If you really need extra money think about selling something? Everyone nowadays has some sort of electronics worth a few bucks. Now, lets assume you're under 15. (Backwards I know, sorry.) You could do odds and ends around your neighborhood or even for your parents and save up. Before I had a job I sold sneakers, something like one of those sneaker heads. I would trade one pair of sneakers (bought for $180 and kept in new condition for a few months) for 2, 3, sometimes even FOUR pairs of new sneakers also of which costed $180. That a great come up already but watch this, wait a few more months and then sell those trades for $250+. Now you have 3x250=750 all off of $180, some patience and hustle. Hope I helped!

            "answer_text": "You might have already heard hundred of thousands of methods and techniques to make money online but there are few things that you should ask yourself: 1: Investment: This is not necessarily money, even time is an investment. So how much time are you willing to spend or can you spend for this purpose is the first question that needs answer. 2: Strengths: What are your strengths? What are you really good at? You can make people pay you only if you give them value in terms of quality, professionalism and support. Find your answer to this question and read the next. 3: Weakness: If you have identified your strengths, then you should definitely know your weakness too. It could be even \u2018fear of talking to a stranger.\u2018 Whatever it is, be honest and tell yourself this is your weakness. Only if you identify your weakness, you will be able to create a strategy to put your strengths to good use by circumventing your weakness. 4: Platform: This could be physical or digital. You can market yourself and try finding works by visiting local meetups, business community etc and this falls under the physical category. You can also do this effectively online. There are various platforms available these days. For example: Imagine that one of the strengths you have is that you are good at talking to people and you enjoy doing that. There is this language marketplace called Lughaa that helps you find language learners who are willing to pay you for a 15 minutes to 1 hour talking session so that they could practice talking with a native speaker. It\u2019s free to register as a seller, so no investment there in terms of money. 5: Be creative: Competition is tough so in order to get good visibility, you need to be innovative and creative. All the best! ",

Instead think about listing services with upwork or fiverr. If you draw, you can make good money drawing gamer or vintage style maps of imaginary places. If you have good grammar, you can write a short story or novel and sell it. If you play around in photoshop or some other graphics program, you can design simple flyers, book covers or CD covers. You can work for your parents, extended relatives or family friends. If you like more hands on type stuff, work for people you trust cleaning pools, cleaning out aquariums, mowing lawns, shoveling snow, walking dogs, pet sitting for people when they are out of town, helping someone clean out their garage or shed. You could even deliver meals to elderly people. Sometimes families have time to cook extra food for a loved one but little time to deliver it, cause the person will want to talk to them forever. A nice delivery teen is the perfect answer to that problem. Look around and listen when people talk about their problems. Offer solutions that are a win/win. ",

I hated getting up early in the morning, but in the South it was pretty miserable by noon so you needed to get most of your yards cut early. People are always looking for someone to help them, clean the attic, spread mulch, babysit, collect papers or mail, water the yard, weed, walk the dog. A flyer outlining services you can offer in you neighborhood could lead to some nice opportunities. Once people understand that you are reliable and are willing work you may be surprised at what they offer. Just remember to always be there on time. I saw that a high school kid in my area was offering to help people set stuff up on their phones and computers on one of the neighborhood social media apps.

Let\u2019s say that you want to work for an advertising firm after college. How about you learn coding or social media marketing skills. You can learn any number of skills for free, and all of them will make you stand out. I like to think of work as the act of trading time for money.

            "answer_text": "There are always the traditional ones: mow lawns, babysit, perhaps even clean houses. In the U.S. You can start working at 16 but I believe more in the non-official work. It's a lot more flexible if you're in school full-time. Teen years are a great time to hone some unique skills. One that'll be invaluable is learning to write code for websites. If you do it well you can make over $100,000 a year with no degree. Knowing about technology is the biggest advantage the younger generation has over older adults. When people don't know how to do complicated or confusing tasks they hire people to do them. The more seemingly difficult the task the higher the pay. Coding can be an amazing niche if you do it well. ",

What is it you want to be? What job do you want in the future? Nowadays, there are THOUSANDS of free and paid courses online available at Alison, Udemy and even just learning off Youtube. Consider learning a skill and setting up your own business - it\u2019s a slow process but can benefit you in the long run, especially as you\u2019re a teenager. If you are a good writer or designer, consider using platforms like Squadhelp, Upwork, Freelancer and PeoplePerHour - more and more businesses are outsourcing and it can be really great to work from home in your spare time and earn an extra income. Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses! ",

Good luck! :)",

Note: As a Teenager, Do not aim for money because it will spoil you later on. After you turn 30, you will regret that you should have never asked this question. Find a part-time job that is related to your EDUCATION or leave it.I would recommend you to learn courses and techniques. When you have a good grip then start learning about Entrepreneur Skills (Learn from reputed sites like Forbes), which helps you make REAL MONEY out of your skills :D I did the same thing and i made 10-times more than my job has paid me ;) However, it took me 6 years to figure it out.

Instead, I milk the money out of every opportunity I can get. Here are some ways I have made money: I got a paid internship with a startup app to manage their Instagram page and general marketing. I get paid a quarterly stipend. An internship that I can do from my laptop/phone is the best! No travel time at all!I have house/cat/babysat for family friends and neighbors. Housesitting is really popular over summer vacation because so many people go out of town. If you talk to neighbors ahead of time about possibly arranging something, you\u2019ll start earning cash in no time. Dog-walking is also a really great (and healthy) way to earn spending money.User Research Studies! Many tech companies offer money for your feedback. I have earned a lot of money through focus groups and studies. This is not a steady source of income, but it is very helpful when you are trying to save up.",

Talk to your boss and ask if he would be willing to promote/give you a raise or small profit sharing if you can get all of your friends into his shop. Step 3. Don't worry if he says no, you are 15 years old responsibly working-do you have any savings? If so I would consider buying a used ice cream cart and getting a vendors licens-consumption license for your town. Step 4. Based on savings either ask or don't for your parents to invest in you-ask them before you start the whole thing. Step 5. If they say yes and give you enough for one day's inventory find a fair in town-whether in the summer or sooner. Step 6. Sell for a low price and tell your friends about it. Underprice the competition, they may be able to order in bulk but you don't need to pay yourself yet. Step 7. Do this at many fairs and maybe even find a small spot where you can sell regularly in town. Step 8. If everything goes well parents will be paid back, you will make money, and you will have a completely legitimate business venture. [certain things such as posssibly incorporating can be things you ask your parents about-until you learn yourself especially because it can't be in your name-depending on location] ",

Now to answer the question \"How can I easily make money\", well if anyone on Quora had the answer to that questions, we'd be somewhere else.  But in all seriousness, there are a lot of people on here with similar questions, you have to understand that making money isn't hard, you just have to be smart about your time and how you use it. You can go out tomorrow morning and start cutting grass/shoveling show pending your location. After an entire days work, you've made a nice amount $100-200.  Was it worth it? To some adults that's how much they make in several days so it would sound like it. But now lets get a team, maybe your siblings to go out and cut just as many lawns as you did alone, you give them a 25% cut and now with just 4 people working with you, you have quadrupled your earnings -25% that you'll be giving as pay.  And that was just an example using your siblings and a lawnmower. We haven't even started talking about getting a computer and a couple million friends (threads) to do your work for you, now we're talking big-money!  ",

I had to pass a test at the Utah division of agriculture (pretty easy, about $75), get a business license (local and federal, about $75), buy a back pack sprayer ($100), and a hand sprayer for inside ($8), then I bought a gallon of bifenthrin from univar ($30). So for about $300 you can get everything you need to start spraying for pest control. You typically dilute the chemicals 1 oz to 1 gal and use about 1 gal to spray the outside and inside of a small home or apartment. It takes 10-15 min and you can typically charge 50-75$ a home and easily beat what other companies are charging. Pm me if you have more questions. Also I still do this (I\u2019m currently an engineering project manager, and do this on the weekends) ",

More complicated is that you might need things like a drivers license and a vehicle. But this doesn\u2019t mean you are without options, though they probably aren\u2019t what you wanted - and it really depends on the reason you are wanting to support yourself. If you don\u2019t have a place to stay right now, seek help. Most places have special programs to help minors. However, be aware that it might come back to haunt whoever is supposed to be your legal guardian, depending on the situation. One of the things you can try to do is become emancipated so that you are your own legal guardian. This might - or might not - remove some of the barriers to working. ",

Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the merchant never sees or handles the product.

You can learn almost anything that you need to know that way. You surely have school books that you should read but don\u2019t limit yourself to that. Then learn about how to invest. If you can invest in securities do that otherwise research crypto currencies and other digital assets. Look at what worked for others in the past and learn from that.

I have Some idea they Can help you for make Money Online. #1- Blogging: Blogging is one of the ways to make money online, but it\u2019s also just a hobby for many people. You can blog for fun or money, but I would suggest blogging for money if you can. To earn handsome money from your website, you have to create good content and market your blog well, and you will start generating revenues. #2-Paid Writing: If maintaining a blog is difficult for you but you still want to indulge your passion for writing, you can jot down articles for other blogs or sites such as Weblogs, Helium or PayPerPost. Writing an e-book can also be a good option. E-books are investment free, with no cost for printing and shipping. If you have a strong command over languages, you can become a copy editor, where Webmasters will pay you to read articles and correct grammatical errors, sentence fragments, etc. #3- Freelancer: Freelancing is a great option for professionals who are experts in their respective trades and know how to ensure customer satisfaction. Various freelancing and project-oriented sites allow companies that need help to describe their projects. Freelancers and small businesses offer bids, ideas or proposals, from which the buyers can choose what they find most suitable. Websites such as Elance cover everything from programming and writing to data entry and design, while RentACoder focuses on software programming. #4- Youtube: If there's a dramatic performer hidden inside you who craves applause and adulation, upload yourself on YouTube. You can be a filmmaker, musician or comedian who wants a wider audience. Your earnings will come from ads displayed on your video page. This process is similar to the pay-per-click advertising program common to other Website ",

At first, you might think that the small amount that you are saving is too small, but the small amounts add up to a much larger amount in the long run.  Saving $100 per month, you would have saved over $7,000 by the age of 20, and if you put them in a fixed term deposit account, you will have some additional money gained from the interest. Albert Einstein one said the following:     P.S. I don't know if you are familiar with compound interest at your age.

I\u2019ve run my dog walking business for about a year and I\u2019ve made more than $6000 from it. I have also been featured in a magazine called Claremont Living because of my dog walking business. I recently raised my price per walk from $5 to $6 because I\u2019m getting older and wanted to make a little more. Also, I\u2019m going to high school this year and want to be able to reach around $8000 dollars before I start school again. I don\u2019t plan to continue walking dogs when I get older but I do want to start my own online business.

            "answer_text": "The easiest would be affiliate marketing. What should teenagers promote? Something they know about right? Well what do teenagers are good at? Video games!  I would mix this knowledge about games with the the best source of traffic - which is Reddit. And Voila! You\u2019ve made money! Sounds simple? Sure, It\u2019s not hard, but you can\u2019t just go on Reddit and promote affiliate links. That is against the rules and your posts will get taken down and you will get banned. So what is the solution? You should check out the Reddit-Twitter Master Method which shows how to earn on Reddit in long-term. How much can be made? The best month I did was ~$8000, so a lot! And I work only 2 hours a day. Is every month that good? Of course not, but I\u2019ve never earned less than a $1500 a month. Good luck on your journey! I wish you won\u2019t even have to start working a real job, because till you\u2019ll be in your twenties you\u2019ll be earning online a lot more than you could earn in a real job. You could become a Digital Nomad. This could be you!  ",

I chose this number because you probably have 0 expenses and parents help (in most cases). You could do odd-jobs, get a part-time job or shovel/mow yards in your area. However, a much better plan is to craft a specialized skill and then sell that service. Whether it's online products, marketing, Instagram, YouTube or web/app creation. You'll make much less for a bit but if you stick to it, you'll have a skill for life. Example: Web dev at $50/hr, you'll need to bill 40 hours of work per month. However, as you advance you can charge much more. Increasing your income or decreasing your required effort. This of course assumes you want to build things, some people just want to work for someone else. ",

            "answer_text": "Reliable, easy, yields a lot of money pick 2. There are two ways to make money, either you provide a device or good someone wants, or you invest. Potentially high yield investments, like investing in a startup or gambling are very risky. The potential yield is high, but the expected yield is very low (often negative), because most of the time your money goes up in smoke. Goods or services that are easy to provide aren't valuable. Working at McDonald's pays very little because anyone can work at McDonald's. Professional football players make a lot of money because very few people can play football at a professional level. Generally a good or service is hard to provide either because it requires a lot of effort or training, or because it requires exceptional talent, or both. It's all supply and demand. The truth is there's no free lunch and no easy way to make money. Otherwise, everyone would already be doing it.Either you work hard or you get lucky or, most often, both. ",

Start a small business cutting the lawn and other yardwork or other household chores. Develop a clientele for whom you do yard maintence on a weekly, or monthly basis. 3. Pool cleaning, if you already know how. 4. Sell homemade baked goods, if you find the work is good enough to interest people in your neighborhood. ",

Another thing I did was used a website called Fiverr ( Get Everything You Need Starting at $5 - Fiverr ) as if you have a creative/ technical side to you this is great, as people can pay you $5 (around \u00a33.80) to do thinks for them that you enjoy/ can do well!

Surely someone will need your help. Look at the jobs on there, there's a lot of old people that need help with yard work and stuff like that. So just make a post and take a look at what kind of jobs are on there. A lot of grocery stores will let people your age be baggers, try that. And the smart thing to do is put most of it in the savings account because you make more money that way. Just make sure you have $5 in there every month or you'll get charged a $15 fee. ",

Well, making money as teenager could be difficult because: You lack experienceYou might lack some skillsYou have limited resourcesNow imagine, at this young age, what if you are an actual professional. Like a legit professional who in amazing at something, then of course you\u2019ll earn and now what if I say this is not a very difficult thing to achieve. Internet has made learning so easier that, you can overcome all the obstacles I just mentioned above. There are skill based institutes which provide you with specific skill based training to help you excel the field you are interested in. And as teenager making money through some kind of work that is possible right from home is more comfortable. There are several types of work which you can do online right from your laptop such as: Data EntryContent WritingDigital MarketingGraphic DesigningWeb designingWeb DeveloperVideo EditingThe easiest one for teenagers to earn, according to me is through content writing. This because we all know to write and all we need is some strategies and formats and techniques of writing that can help one boost the audience reach.  These skills are really simple yet important and could be learned very easily. Just as mentioned that as a teenager, you can still be a certified professional and earn, there are institutes like IIM SKILLS which provide content writing courses.Very interestingly, IIM SKILL has no set boundaries for anyone to join this course which means from pure beginners to professionals, everyone could join this course. The curriculum is so well designed that it matches the learning requirements of beginners, amateurs and professionals.The course duration is just 4 weeks which means teenagers just need to invest 4 weeks and tada!, you are a certified professional now.In case you are thinking that, lack of experience might be a factor to limit your earning, and then IIM SKILLS offers a 3 month internship to students based on their performance in certain test.This was just content writing, but there are similar institutes which provide other skill based courses and if you are interested in any, then go for it. The world is more opportunistic than it has ever been, so grab what\u2019s right for you. ",

I will tell you what I did. When I was a student, I used to take tuitions and save money every month. I thought about investing my money. So, I researched and started saving money every month and decided to invest my money with Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). With SIP, you can invest a fixed amount in mutual funds step-by-step monthly or quarterly over a period of time, thereby averaging out your cost of investing and benefiting from the power of compounding. SIP is an investment vehicle offered by mutual funds to investors, allowing them to invest small amounts periodically instead of lump sums. The frequency of investment is usually weekly, monthly or quarterly. You can start with as low as Rs. 500 per month in SIP. This is an ideal option for starting investments initially. This kind of investment provides you the option to invest small amounts too. So saving money monthly and then investing it in SIP is very much possible. I did all my investments via Sharekhan. You will get guidance from an expert to start with your investment. SIP is best option for a student. You can get best returns after the maturity date. Such investments will help you in putting a habit of saving money. You will always save out a portion of your earnings and invest them. This is how you can start earning and investing as a Teenager. I am sure you will be happy about the decisions you made today for a better tomorrow. :) ",

For e.g., in my place there are a lot of kids whose parents are working and have no time to spend with them. So for someone who can make those kids happy, the parents would be ready to pay money. Or things like helping with their chores and getting paid for that. When people feel that you are making their life easier, they will become dependant on you and you can make a lot of money providing services or after a while you could have workers under you. ",

Assuming that you are decent at your studies, I suggest applying for a job at your local Tutoring Business (Spirit of Math, Kumon , etc...) They pay anywhere from $12~15 starting wage per hour in Canada, and they can pay anywhere from $5~8 in the USA. This is a good starting wage that requires less hard work. These teaching assistant positions give you relativrly easy work for a decent wage, and the work helps keep your mind sharp. If you work for a longer period of time, you may be promoted and get paid more. These jobs don't require materials, just your mind. My starting wage at 14 yrs old was $12.50 an hour doing something that was extremely easy (aftet a year I now make $16 per hour), and as a bonus, working in the field of education looks excellent on a university resume. Hope this helps. ",

This one takes time though because I have to take a few different five hour training courses from Red Cross to get certified in baby sitting and I took a class on CPR, Hemlich maneuver, broken bones, etc. on what they are and how to treat them. After that I was qualified to go babysitting and I started babysitting family members, neighborhood kids, and other people's children. This is earning me a lot of money. Another way was helping my parents at their work. My parents have their own small business and they help do projects with JPL, NASA, and other groups like that. My mom is away in the Philippines for a month so I am helping my dad with paperwork and other computer problems and that has given me good money. A last one that I do is a lemonade stand. And even though it's a lot of work having to sit in front of your house for ours but I earned good money there too. ",

Does \u201cteenager\u201d mean: \u201c13 and unemployable except on a family farm, due to labor regulations\u201d, OR\u201c19 and a legal adult for almost 2 years, about to run 20, with a 2 year college degree\u201dThere is essentially no job market in the U.S. for anyone under the age of 18; that\u2019s the age of majority, at which you are considered legally an adult. There are a number of reasons for this, but the increased child labor regulation is the main one. When my sister was 14, in 1978, she worked a food counter at a ski lodge, which they felt was perfectly fine for a 14 year old. The primary driver for the increased labor regulation is claimed to be on behalf of the children \u2014 but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because all the \u201cstarter jobs\u201d are being filled by blue collar workers who were formerly employed in manufacturing jobs which have been subsequently off shored. It prevent 14\u201317 year olds from competing with these workers for employment. So unless you meant \u201c18 or 19\u201d when you said \u201cteenager\u201d, you have a very limited set of options, you also have a very limited set of hours, and it\u2019s worse during the school year.

Peer to Peer lending on the other hand is a relatively easy asset to understand and make money in without the volatility in the stock market that can sometimes drive adults crazy, let alone youthful kids. LenDenClub is one such P2P platform I invested in at an early age and to be honest, it\u2019s been great! Returns as high as 35% can be gained with relative easy and comfort for teenagers looking to earn some extra money! ",

With an account, instead of buying small, not really useful things, you can buy something big. Save up for somethin\u2019 like a laptop. ",

It is in bank prison. IT cannot be set free for a whole year. Take the left pocket money and when you are at home put it in a coffee can with a slot on the lid so you can drop it in.

The best way to make money by a teenager in India is by giving private tuition. Yes, this is a very old method used by Indian teenagers to earn money. But this has different benefits which very few people generally note. I have been benefitted in various ways by giving private tuition. The first and foremost is earning a handsome amount every month. Secondly, private tuition helped me a lot to practise for various competitive examinations for Government jobs. I learnt to speak Hindi fluently, thanks to my interactions with my Hindi-speaking students. Finally, I learnt about a new city (Delhi) while traveling in public transport to go to the residence of my students. So, not only earning, private tuition has many other positive aspects for the tutor. ",

You can participate in competitions that will get you prize money(this is not a long term source). If you\u2019re good at subjects like programming n all, you can do free lancing!

Recently, I have faced with the insurance issues that understood that it entails a bulk of paperwork and annoying meeting with agents. And now, I have found a project that is called Socratus. It is a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. With this ecosystem, companies will be able to cut operating costs, create new insurance products, deal with data analysis more efficiently and many other benefits. Right now, it is on the stage of private token pre-sales. And I think that it is really worth investing in. ",

That\u2019s low pay but more than you had, and leads to better things like managing the enterprise. It takes a little longer to learn a craft in a vocational school and then use that to get a better-paying job and perhaps later open your own business. It\u2019s riskier but potentially very rewarding to open your own small business as a teenager, if you enjoy selling. Lots of opportunities there to succeed or fail, and to learn from your failures and make it big. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be risky to invest in individual stocks. However, if you do, it is best that you read investment books/articles and research the companies. If the company invests in research and development, then they are likely to have good future growth. It is also important for a company to have excellent cash flow, low debt, and good inventory turnover. Also, you want to be cautious of buying companies who have to over rely on buying other businesses in order to grow. Are they buying good companies that will help increase their profits? Other important things to consider are the business\u2019 moat, their revenue growth, and the number of stocks you include in your portfolio. Invest in different industries. I suggest accessing the websites: Types of Narrow Moats What is the ideal number of stocks to have in a portfolio? | Investopedia. I also recommend refraining from borrowing money especially when you are a beginning investor. When the market is doing well, it is tempting borrow. However, you could end up buying the stock at near the high price. Instead you should be greedy when most people are scared to invest and fearful when they are greedy. I suggest investing money you won\u2019t need in 10 years because sometimes, a market downturn lasts a long time. I recommend investing your money in small chunks or buying index mutual funds. I hope this information helps! ",
