            "answer_text": "If you are looking for low outputs then you can simply buy a energy harvester model for it online from TI or any other company website. It includes a diode rectifier and a buck-boost converter to step up the voltage level. If you want a higher output then you need to connect multiple piezoelectric plates together or apply more pressure. ",
