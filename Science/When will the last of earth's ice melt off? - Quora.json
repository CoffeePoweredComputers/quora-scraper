            "answer_text": "Earth is currently in the Quaternary Glaciation that dates back about two and a half million years. We are currently experiencing an interglacial warm period that has lasted about twelve thousand years so far, and is nearing it\u2019s end. Of course, even during this interglacial we have large amounts of ice. However, when the interglacial is over we will have much more ice, a couple miles thick sheet of it in parts of the United States. That period will last a hundred thousand years, then we get another brief interglacial like the one we have now, which we refer to as the Holocene. The cycle we are in now(glacial, interglacial, glacial) shows no evidence of changing soon. The coming glacial will be within the next few thousand years or sooner and will be catastrophic to humans, likely costing billions of lives. The recent increase in CO2 in the atmosphere and projected future increases in CO2 will not stop the next glaciation. Much larger forces are involved. Eventually of course the sun will turn into a red giant and fry our planet, but that event is billions of years away. ",

            "answer_text": "The ice of Antarctica is at least 700,000 years old and estimates are it has been there for several million years. Since the beginning of the ice age we are currently in. It is not going anywhere fast. Same for Greenland. It has more ice on it now than it did when Vikings sailed the seas. Of a much larger concern is, will we again experience a Glacial Maximum. Will the Laurentide, Cordilleran, Scandinavian, Polish and Siberian Ice Sheets regrow, wiping out a trillion trees that now stand where those ice sheets did 12,000 years ago. Will North America, Northern Europe and Northern Asia again have huge chunks of them covered in ice, eradicating dozens of major cities, and displacing billions of people from their homes, and their nations. Can we figure out a way to prevent that? That is the concern people should have. ",
