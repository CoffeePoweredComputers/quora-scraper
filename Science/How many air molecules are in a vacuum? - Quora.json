            "answer_text": "If you know how good a vacuum, the temperature of the vacuum, and how large a volume of vacuum you have, you can calculate how many molecules. From the ideal gas law, PV=nRT. P=pressure (lower in vacuum)V=volume (assume stays constant)n=number of moleR=ideal gas constant (8.3145 J/mol degrees-K)T=temperature, assume 0 decrees C (273 degrees K).If we keep temperature and volume constant, the number of molecules scales exactly with the pressure. An ideal gas has one mole of molecules in 22.4 liters of volume at 0 degrees C. We can say that: (1 atm)*(22.4 L) = (6.02x10^23 molecules)*R*(273 degrees K)Plug in your actual volume, pressure, and temperature, and calculate the number of molecules in your gas. Note that if P=0, there must be either zero molecules or zero temperature. BTW, there is no gas which is well modeled by the ideal gas law at zero degrees K. ",
