            "answer_text": "I disagree strongly with the somewhat snarky answers asserting that the scientific method doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s an entire field of inquiry called philosophy of science that exists to do nothing but figure out how science should be conducted, in order to arrive at conclusions we can be confident about. Getting around to your question: no, the scientific method does change. For example, we develop new approaches to deciding whether a theory is acceptable as scientific. For a while we relied upon verificationism, an idea that arose in the 1920s. It asserted than only statements that are empirically verifiable via the senses are acceptable. This rejects theology, metaphysics, spirituality, ethics, aesthetics, and various other non-verifiable assertions. But in 1959, the philosopher Karl Popper proposed a new criterion for accepting scientific assertions: falsificationism. Rather than asking, \u201cis there a way to prove this right?\u201d we should be asking, \u201cis there a way to prove this wrong?\u201d It can be summed up as, \u201cNo amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.\u201d This is now widely accepted; in the court case that decided that Creationism was unscientific, it was cited in testimony describing the nature of science, and the judge referred to it in his decision. We get new tools, too. For example, the statistical concept of confidence was first devised in 1937. This enables a scientist to determine how many samples she should take from a population in order to establish a given level of confidence in the accuracy of the results. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no monolithic scientific method. If you examine the history of science, you will find that the standards for what constitutes good science have changed over the decades and centuries. Moreover, standards vary across disciplines and sub-disciplines. And to this day there are debates about what the scientific method ought to be. Scientists often disagree about the best set of methods and practices to adopt. So for now, the scientific method is subject to change. Of course, if the \u201cmethod\u201d is extremely vague, then anything can seem to fit. \u201cObserve, hypothesize, experiment, theorize\u201d is pretty vague, and if you allow these steps to occur in any order, then you can capture vast swathes of science.  To get some historical perspective on the evolution of science and standards for science, see these books: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, by Thomas Kuhn Against Method, by Karl Feyerabend You may also want to check out this page: Philosophy of science - Wikipedia ",
