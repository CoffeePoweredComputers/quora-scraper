            "answer_text": "Yes, you can measure the speed of light with an electric fan, a laser pointer and a mirror (and a tape measure). Shine the laser pointer through the electric fan at the mirror. Adjust the distance to the mirror such that the returning beam does not shine on the opposite side (from the laser pointer) of the fan blades. When this happens, measure the distance between the fan blade and the mirror. What is happening is a \u2018slice\u2019 of light is passing through the section of the fan blades where the blades aren\u2019t, then travelling across the room and back in perfect time to pass through the next gap in the fan blades. You will need to know the speed of the fan and the proportion of the blade to gap in the fan. The smaller the proportion, the more accurate your measurement will be.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. If you have a microwave oven without rotating plate, you can do it using grated chocolate, provided that you know the frequency the oven works on (should be stated on the rear or in the technical specifications). The microwave creates a stationary wave inside \u2014 so if you cover a plate with grated chocolate and turn the microwave on for a while, you should see melted chocolate in \u201cantinodes\u201d and intact chocolate in \u201cnodes\u201d. If you measure the distance between the centers of adjacent melts, convert it to meters and multiple it by two (it is just a half of the wavelength) and then by the frequency, you should have the c. As the light is the same electromagnetic wave, just with a higher frequency, its speed is the same. ",
