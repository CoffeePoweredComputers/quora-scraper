            "answer_text": "Life\u2019s made of atoms and consciousness What is an atom? The atom is the smallest particle of chemical elements that exist. It contains even smaller particles, you have electrons, negative charge, protons, positive charge and neutrons, no charge or neutral charge as some say. The atom has a nucleus, it\u2019s where the neutrons and protons are,outside the nucleus electrons are there moving around, we don\u2019t know exactly where, we can only estimate.  The black part is where the electrons can be, the darker the place, the higher is the possibility to find electrons there\u2026 To make it even more complicated, the proton and neutron are composed of three quarks each. The proton has two 'up' quarks and one 'down' quark. While the neutron has two 'down' and one 'up'. An 'up' quark has a 2/3 positive charge and a down has a 1/3 negative charge, which explains why it\u2019s more right to say that neutrons have neutral charge rather than \u2018no charge\u2019. There are six types of quarks, as far as we discovered so far, which are called \u2018up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom quarks\u2019. What\u2019s interesting is that atoms are 99% space as we can see, but the different charges of negative and positive is what\u2019s holding them together, in fact it\u2019s so strong that we are connected this way and it takes A LOT of energy to separate us. For example, water is what we call \u2018hydrogen bonding\u2019, it\u2019s much stronger than a \u2018dipole-dipole interactions\u2019 let\u2019s say acetone, both are liquid at a room temperature point, but they have different boiling points, when the liquid turns to gas, so the boiling point of the acetone is 56C while the water is about 100C. So it takes more energy to \u2018break down\u2019 in a way water molecules than acetone molecules, thus making water bond stronger together\u2026 So when someone tell you that you\u2019re waste of space, just agree and say, \u2018so are you, so is everyone\u2026 we are made of atoms, atoms are 99% which makes us 99% space thus making your statement true\u2026 Didn\u2019t know you liked physic..\u2019 okay maybe don\u2019t\u2026 In case you\u2019re interested to know\u2026 Human body is made of 99% oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, remember, we are roughly 57% water, what is water? It\u2019s H2O, hydrogen and oxygen, just to make it more logical in case you think it\u2019s not :) . The other 0.85% is potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium, while the rest 0.15% is nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus So\u2026 what about consciousness then? \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ummm, well\u2026 I\u2019ll avoid saying anything about this one here :) anyways.. your question didn\u2019t really ask for explanations, so yeah Hope this was helpful, in a way ",

            "answer_text": "Good answers here, but no one addressed your sub-question about whether money was one of those two things. Money is simply a construct, a tool developed to move from a barter economy to a trade economy (wages are essentially trading your work for the tool that allows you to trade for other things). Money isn\u2019t necessary for life. Most of life on the planet couldn\u2019t care less, and even humans have managed to build communities that didn\u2019t rely on it, although you don\u2019t see it much anymore. If we chose to do so, we could certainly build a society that didn\u2019t use money. So perhaps the nub of your question has to do with living life as part of a society. You could go it alone, perhaps, and become completely self-sufficient, but it\u2019s a tough haul. Instead, most of us choose to live lives that are dependent upon others. We contribute something and get something back in return. Thus, the two things such a life is made of is 1)what you do for yourself, and 2)what you do to tap into the abundance available in a cooperative society. Both of these are important. From our conception, it\u2019s a balancing act between developing individuality and building relationships. ",
