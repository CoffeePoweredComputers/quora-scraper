            "answer_text": "Because folks really want/wanted to know details about how the planets work.Or details about their properties.Or they really want to know which planets would be feasibly colonized.Or they just can\u2019t believe the science about planets they were taught in elementary or high school. Those are some seriously out of date texts.Or maybe they were awestruck by reading the John Carter series by Edgar Rice Burroughs. And they began learning about Mars, and that spread out to the other planets.. Maybe they didn\u2019t plan to study planetology; it just sort of happened.Or they think, hmmm, already tens of thousands of biologists, 10\u2019s of thousands of geologists, meteorologists, economists, but hey, only a few hundred planetologists. I want to make a difference. I want to stand out. I want to study what hardly anyone else knows.or they look up at the night sky and just hmmmm wonder. .. look at that word: wonder as a verb, and wonder as an noun.",

            "answer_text": "Planets have the effects on each and every matter in the Solar system. Solar system is designed in a particular way to Sustain the life on the planet earth. As we live on planet earth we need to consider the effects of each planet on the earth. And studying planets can be interesting as we get to know how long the day is on other planets, how much is the Temperature range on other planets, how long is the year on other planets, are there possibilities of life on other planets in past or future ? So start reading some concepts about it, you'll definitely get some interest in it. ",
