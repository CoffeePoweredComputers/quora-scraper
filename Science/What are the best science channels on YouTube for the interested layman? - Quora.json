Text is superior. The exception is for special simulations or visualizations, which you can find on you tube, but it's better to download the movies individually after reading the text. There's a nice visualization of sphere eversion on you-tube, a few good lectures by Susskind and so on, but I still think the medium is no good in general. It is also full of false science which is impossible to rebut, because the comments are broken. ",
