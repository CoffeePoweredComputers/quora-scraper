            "answer_text": "All the known particles in the universe can be divided into two groups: The ones that have an integer spin 0 , 1 , 2 that form all the matter in the universe (these are known as bosons) and the ones which have a 1/2 integer spin which give rise to the forces (fermions) acting upon matter particles. Common examples of bosons are photons, gravitons, He4 atoms, etc. Common examples of fermions are protons, neutrons, and electrons. And in the most simple words, Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle says that two identical fermions cannot be in the same quantum state. (viz., the condition of its quantum mechanics system which can be described through a wave function or a complete set of quantum numbers) The Pauli exclusion principle is said to be one of the most important principles in quantum physics, largely because the three types of particles from which ordinary matter is made (electrons, protons and neutrons) are all subject to it, so that all material particles exhibit space-occupying behavior. Interestingly, though, the principle is not enforced by any physical force understood by mainstream science. When an electron enters an ion, it somehow mysteriously seems to \"know\" the quantum numbers of the electrons which are already there, and therefore which atomic orbitals it may enter, and which it may not. Thus, it forms the base of many quantum concepts, understanding which will enhance your understanding of the principle itself.  One example, it effectively explains the very existence of different types of atoms in the universe and the large-scale stability and bulk of matter.To understand how, consider the Bohr model, (which depicts the atom as a small, positively-charged nucleus, surrounded by negatively-charged electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus, similar in structure to the Solar System, but with electromagnetic forces providing attraction, rather than gravity, also an equal number of protons and electrons will ensure overall electric charge is zero). Now as per same, electrons in an atom are constrained to occupy certain discrete orbital positions or \u201cshells\u201d around the nucleus. The closer electrons are to the nucleus, the more strongly the electric force is pulling them in and the more energy would be required to free it from the clutches of the nucleus. Each energy level is composed of a certain number of sub-shells which can each hold a given number of electrons (2, 6, 10 and 14) with the innermost shell holding only 2 electrons. The number of available sub-shells increases as the energy level increases, so that successive shells can hold a total of 2, 8, 18 and 32 electrons.  It is the Pauli's exclusion principle which dictates this arrangement and effectively forces electrons to \u201ctake up space\u201d in the atom through this arrangement of shells. By recognizing that no two electrons may occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, it effectively stops electrons from \"piling up\" on top of each other, thus explaining why matter occupies space exclusively for itself and does not allow other material objects to pass through it, while at the same time allowing light and radiation to pass. Consider, if two identical particles are forced (for instance, by an extremely strong gravitational force) to try to have the same quantum numbers, they will respond with a repelling outward force, known as \"degeneracy pressure\". Electron degeneracy pressure results from the same underlying mechanism that defines the electron orbital structure of elemental matter and prevents compression of matter into smaller volumes of space. Pauli's principle can also help explain the existence of the different atoms in the periodic table of elements and the sheer variety of the universe around us.For example, when an atom gains a new electron, it always goes into the lowest energy state available (i.e. the outermost shell). Two atoms with \u201cclosed\u201d shells find they cannot form a chemical bond with each other because the electrons in one atom find no available quantum states in the other which it can occupy. So, the arrangement of electrons, particularly of the electrons in the outermost shell, also affects the chemical properties of an element and how atoms are able to bond and combine with other atoms (the basis of chemistry), and therefore the way in which molecules interact to form gases, liquids or solids, and how they aggregate themselves in living organisms.

            "answer_text": "The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle which states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half integral spin) cannot occupy same quantum states within the quantum systemThis principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons and later extend to all the fermions in the spin statistic theorem of 1940.In case of electrons of the atoms it can be stated as it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electrons atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers :The principle quantum number (n)The azimuthal quantum number (l)The magnetic quantum number (ml)The spin quantum number (ms)For example - if two electrons reside in the same orbital the n, l, ml values are same the their ms must be different and thus the electrons have opposite half-integral spin projections +1/2 and -1/2Particles with integer spin, or bosons are not subject to Pauli exclusion principle any no of identical spin. Any no of identical bosons can occupy the same quantum state.The Pauli exclusion principle explains the wide variety of phenomenaOne particular important consequence is of the principle is the elaborate electron shell structure of atoms and the way atoms share electrons, explaining the variety of chemical elements and chemical combinations.Example ",
