            "answer_text": "No. It's hard to define thoughts in physical terms, but they are certainly not molecules. Thoughts are an emergent property of our complex neural processes. In other words, a thought is more akin to a weather system: areas of high pressure, areas of low pressure; wind, rain, the occasional storm, but the basic ingredients (air, pressure, movement) are the same before and after. Thoughts are more complex than weather fronts, but the basic metaphor holds: the neurons, action potentials and neurotransmitters are present before and after a thought. What changes is their behaviour not their chemistry. ",

            "answer_text": "There have been recent studies in mice looking at how memories are formed from the neural network in the brain and how (as mentioned) the totality of the network forms a thought or a memory. Not just one neuron or even tens of neurons. ",
