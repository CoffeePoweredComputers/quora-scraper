            "answer_text": "Blood tests cant detect cancers as such, however they are used as tools alongside several other investigative modalities to aid in the diagnosis. The presence of a tumor in the body might result in the elevation of some chemical substances in your body which are known as tumor markers. For eg., a surface ovarian cancer might result in the elevation of a tumor marker called CA-125. However just an elevation of CA-125 alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of cancer. Still today, the diagnosis of cancer is always finalised based on the gold standard investigation, a biopsy of the suspected tissue and pathological analysis of that tissue. However if suppose someone's Ca-125 levels are high, their doctor would investigate further and do CAT scans to detect whether there is a presence of a mass. Certain features within a CAT scan point strongly to a malignant mass, like hetereogenous echoes and presence of calcifications and septations. Still, the final diagnosis of whether it is a malignant mass or not and more importantly what type of cancer is it, will be decided only by a pathological study of the mass.However, these tumor markers in the blood play a very important role. They are not used for the purpose of diagnosis, but for follow-up purposes. After removal of the tumor and chemo and radiation and all, the doctor would followup the patient with levels of the tumor marker regularly. If they suddenly show an increase, it points very strongly to the fact the tumor has come back and hence is pretty useful as a simple follow up tool.Tumor markers also get elevated in various non neoplastic processes, like alpha fetoprotein gets elevated in liver cancer as well as other benign liver diseases. Hence, they are not completely reliable as a sole diagnostic tool for cancer detection. But they are very valuable for follow up purposes as well as to see whether the entire tumor was removed or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Dr Maillie Thomas, general practice consultant and Cancer Research UK clinical manager, says: Tests that do not detect cancer can still provide important information about what the cancer is doing. If blood tests do not detect the cancer, the only way to know for sure is to have a biopsy. The test results should tell you the cause of the cancer. Sometimes blood tests can also tell you how well the cancer is working. If you think your blood test is not showing an abnormal result, speak to your doctor. Also, check with your GP or radiographer before taking any particular test. They'll advise you on what to do next. If you are said to have cancer, your doctor will do a detailed examination of your body. During this time they will test for drugs such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in your blood. This test is a simple urine test and does not detect if there is a tumour. This is how the test works in detecting cancer- when you have a tumor in your body, it results in highlighting some of the chemical changes within your body. These chemical substances are also known as tumor markers. For example Pal Pal ovarian cancer will result in highlighting the Tumor Marker which is called CA 125. however a doctor can not confirm the presence of an ovarian Cancer just by looking at the Tumor Marker. You have to go through several tests after knowing about the suspicious change in your body. a lot of medical clinics use the term gold standard. Based on this gold standard investigation which is also known as biopsy, it can help in studying the suspected tissue which might have resulted in cancerous growth. Treatment Certain forms of cancer will respond to treatment and eventually eliminate themselves, which can include: Treatment for most cancers is designed to kill the cancer cells. This means that other cancers will be harder to treat. However, certain cancers do not respond to the treatment and require chemotherapy. Treatment of some cancers is aimed at taking away the cancer cells from the bloodstream. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several blood tests to detect cancer. Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is a protein found on most ovarian cancer cells that is secreted into the blood stream and can be measured. CA125 can also be found on other normal and cancerous cells in the body. Cancer antigen 27.29 (CA 27.29) is a blood test that is done specifically for people with breast cancer. Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) is used to monitor response to breast cancer treatment and disease recurrence. CA 19 9 :This test looks for the antigen called CA 19-9 in your blood. Antigens are substances that stimulate your body's immune system. ... A high amount of CA 19-9 is most commonly caused by pancreatic cancer. But it can also be caused by the other cancers and by infections in your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test that measures the amount of AFPpresent in blood. ... Individuals who aren't pregnant still have some AFP in their blood, but levels are normally low. High levels of AFP in adults who aren't pregnant usually indicate certain types of liver disease Prostate specific antigen is checked to detect prostate cancer. ",

Samples collected for cancer blood tests are analyzed in a lab for signs  of cancer. The samples may show cancer cells, proteins or other  substances made by the cancer. These test could include blood chemistry tests to analyze metabolites, gene mutation testing  to look for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, Complete Blood Count to measure numbers of the different types of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, in a sample of blood which could indicate abnormalities.  A doctor wouldn't give such a serious diagnosis as cancer without exhaustive testing. While a blood test is a good marker, it is not to be solely relied on as the body can do strange things but still be healthy.  @Understanding Laboratory Tests ",

If the PSA is greater than 10, it\u2019s an indication that prostate cancer is likely present and should be investigated further.
