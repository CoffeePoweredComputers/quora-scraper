            "answer_text": "Archaeological sources are mainly divided into Artifacts, Ecofacts and Literature. Artifacts are those remains at an archaeological site that are formed due to the human intervention. For example: pottery found at a excavation site. Ecofacts are those remains that are left as a result as result nature. For example: pollen grains and animal remains found at a site. the pollen suggests the environmental conditions of the era to which it belongs. While animal bones help to understand the faunal remains. It also helps to understand what all animal existed, what we hunted for food and what were domesticated by humans. Literature is the beginning of historical era. History is limited to the literature, but archaeology uses the same literature to pin point the exact place to which the literature refers. For example: A. Cunningham uses the travelogues of Yuan Chwang and Fa Hein to find the Buddhist site Taxilla. There are various other sources like coins that comes under numismatics, dendrochronology..etc. ",
