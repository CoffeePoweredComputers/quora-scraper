            "answer_text": "The abbreviation cf. (short for the Latin: confer/conferatur, both meaning \"compare\") is used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. It is used to form a contrast, for example: \"Abbott (2010) found supportive results in her memory experiment, unlike those of previous work (cf. Zeller & Williams, 2007).\" It is recommended that cf. be used only to suggest a comparison, and the word see be used to point to a source of information. Cf - Wikipedia.
