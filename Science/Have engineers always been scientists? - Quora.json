            "answer_text": "The modern 21st century adjectives are slightly different than their historical meanings. Take the Roman aqueducts. Clearly built by Engineers. They are tangible things. However, in order to construct the concrete thing shown, it was not necessary to have had a natural philosopher (the predecessor to the contemporary natural scientist) discover the rules and laws that govern arches, building materials, physics, etc. It was entirely acceptable (the things are still standing today) to have a group of Engineers test and optimize the best ways in which to construct the aqueduct structures\u2014irrespective of the underlying rules of gravity, physics, etc. Yes, they needed to measure things, but modern mechanics didn\u2019t exist. So the principles were not there in any formal sense.  I would say, Engineer and Scientist are not mutually exclusive nouns. A Scientist may find themselves doing some \u201cengineering\u201d, and an Engineer may find themselves taking a step back to study some Science. What would you call yourself, then? I would say it is best to stick to a label that describes the majority of what you\u2019re paid for. If you run HPLC all day to purify things, in an attempt to get the purest compound (while studying how to optimize the HPLC conditions via changing packing material chemistry), then you\u2019re an Engineer. If you run HPLC all day to study the efficacy of elution fractions on inhibiting a sub-set of signal transduction pathways in various cell lines and their mechanisms, you\u2019re probably a Scientist. The term Vocational is relevant here. If your work mainly contains vocational/trade elements, then you\u2019re mainly an Engineer. The term scientific method is somewhat relevant here. Though nowadays it isn\u2019t the rule anymore, in general, if your work requires use of some form of a scientific method, then you are most likely a Scientist. Engineers can get away without rigorous application of a scientific method to carry out their work. The gray areas are that, unlike the Roman aqueducts, Engineering nowadays does utilize a set of Laws/Theories. The latter historically derived from the work of Scientists (physicists mostly). But, many Engineers do modify the Laws/Theories as well. However, they do it to further their engineering principles, not just for the sake of the Scientific Law itself. That brings me to an important point: the end goal. Many Scientists (myself included) can get pretty annoyed over the mentality of an Engineer (a majority of them, at least). I think this is what engenders the sensitivity of someone being called A. or B. Engineers by nature are rather superficial in their treatment of particulars. They love modelling things\u2014regardless if the model captures reality\u2014in an attempt to show something follows a pattern towards an \u201coptimal\u201d set of conditions. Upon retrospect, it isn\u2019t all to uncommon for reproduction of this model to fail. However, under the same exact conditions (of time, weather, Voodoo magic, etc.), the optimized method works very well. Finally, many would say an Engineer is an Applied Scientist. OK. Labels are labels, but, when I find the applied science my colleague did fails to describe the nature of the effect, I largely question what science, exactly, were you applying, dear Engineer? ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with many statements in your description: \"Science has officially been around for 500 years or so\"  Science has been around for thousands of years, rationalism came a few centuries ago with Rene Descartes. Rationalism was a powerful advancement in the scientific field and led to the progress we all know today. The rough idea is that everything is rational and can be deduced through rationality rejecting the rest. (This led to the major fight in the West between the church and scientists, but this is a digression so let's keep the answer concise.)What you seem to think is science is actually known as Experimental Sciences, say Statistics, Probability Theory etc.. All these appeared a few centuries ago and are actually based on this \"trial and error\" fashion or empirical observations. Before the rationalism appeared, Science was more abstract, and gave amazing results. For instance, Eratosthenes was able to calculate the circumference of the earth with an amazing accuracy (error of 16.3% or 1.6% depending on the historical data) given the technology. And we can go on with many things discovered before this \"500 years\". These results were far more abstract and based on theoretical approach not \"trial and error\". On the other hand, engineering as we know them today appeared during the Renaissance era not \"since the beginning of civilization\". Before that, it didn't really have scientific basis and was mostly a know-how. Some architects were able to design wonders and some geniuses were able to build them but it was mostly different from science. ",

            "answer_text": "(Skip to bottom if you want the TL;DR short version. I would\u2019ve written a shorter response, but I didn\u2019t have time\u2026. >:-) I remember a poster in my grade school library, with great illustrations showing the 10 categories of the Dewey Decimal System - in particular, that the 500s were \u201cScience\u201d and that the 600s were \u201cTechnology\u201d - or, actually, I think they may\u2019ve been called \u201cApplied Science\u201d, with the idea being that the 500s were \u201cPure Science\u201d. The former include things like math, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, and geology. The latter include medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and \u2018engineering\u2019 and \u2018chemical engineering\u2019. (There is also the 300s category of the social sciences, like economics, political science, psychology, and sociology, but in 6th grade I didn\u2019t care about those. >;-) That distinction has stuck with me for 40 years, and I think is helpful here. Although the line is blurry at best, many scientists are quite obviously not engineers, and many engineers are not at all scientists, at least if we try to draw some distinction. Otherwise, it\u2019s useless to have two different terms. I\u2019d offer at least one crude way to think about it: know, vs. make/do. Scientists attempt to explain and understand things. In fact, the original term during the Enlightenment era was \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d, meaning \u201clove/pursuit of knowledge about nature\u201d (nature in the sense of the physical world/universe, not trees and bunnies). They may and often do use engineering in the course of their discovery - building an apparatus or inventing techniques - but those are not the objective. (Think particle accelerators like CERN, or radio telescopes, or 18th c. glassblowing chemical equipment, e.g..)Engineers attempt to create: to design or build or invent something, or to make something happen. (I\u2019d add \u2026.using \u2018systems\u2019.) While they may and often do use a discovery process like the scientific method, testing different approaches, they also often do not. An architect engineering a house would be a good example of this - it would be a stretch to call what he\u2019s doing \u201cscience\u201d, while it is certainly \u201cengineering\u201d. On the other hand, a chemical engineer, say, may often need to \u2018do science\u2019 - research and experimentation - in order to engineer a refinery or fine-chemical production process.Now of course there\u2019s often crossover, where both science and engineering are brought into play, as shown above. It\u2019s more a question of purpose, emphasis, end-goals, than it is discovery vs. creation. And trying to separate the people into two distinct, non-overlapping classes is of course difficult at best and silly/pointless at worst. But to answer the original question, given the above: No. An engineer is not inherently also a scientist, although he/she may also \u2018do science\u2019. And vice versa. It\u2019s not so much about the person/title as it is the activity in question.  One last thought, as a comparison: \u201cis a composer considered a musician?\u201d. And my answer is analogous: no, although a composer usually also plays music, in fact usually must just in order to compose. Thinking of the popular music industry: there are bands who write their own music and perform; there are professional songwriters who write the songs that are performed by others - and there are the pop stars who perform songs written by others (not to slam, say, Justin Bieber - I think even he apparently does some of his own songwriting\u2026. >;-) But when someone says \u201cI\u2019m a composer\u201d, they are not saying the same thing as \u201cI\u2019m a musician\u201d. Otherwise, again, we don\u2019t need two terms. (And, oh yeah: \u201csinger-songwriter\u201d is a term of art in that field, which is telling.) ",

In the sense of the term \u201cscientist\u201d meaning \u201cone whose profession is the conducting of scientific research, with no specific end product or process intended as the result,\u201d then no, engineers are not scientists, nor vice-versa. The primary distinction is that while both professions very often conduct research using the scientific method, the engineer is applying this method and conducting his or her research with the specific goal of furthering a specific practical design, while the scientist is conducting research simply to gain knowledge about the item or phenomenon being studied. The two fields are very similar, of course, and both scientists and engineers conduct research, publish, and often teach.

So there is no official definition of scientist. The title \"engineer\" is protected in some places: France, Canada and USA at least, but most likely many more. Now, for an unofficial definition, I would say a scientist is a generic word for someone who uses a scientific process to understand and predict causes and effects. Engineers should be a subfamily of scientists using their knowledge and science to build things and solve practical issues. So an engineer is a special class of scientist. ",

Generally these engineer/scientists will have PhD\u2019s. Your average engineer (with or without a PhD) can and often does work alongside scientists on scientific projects. Many engineers are involved with the design and construction of particle accelerators, telescopes, and space missions. ",
