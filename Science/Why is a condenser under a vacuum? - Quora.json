            "answer_text": "work done in turbine will be more if exhaust pressure is kept low..So to get better efficiency we use vacuum in condenser.. When steam id condensed its volume reduce y a factor of 1/20..So there will,be vacuum there .onlt thing tjat disturb vacuum is air leakage or non considerable gases which are removed bu ejector. ",

            "answer_text": "The expansion in turbine takes place from boiler outlet high pressure and high temperature to the condenser pressure. To increase the work output from a given turbine, you have two options: Boiler pressure can be increased to supercritical pressure, but the temperature is limited to a certain value because of metallurgical limitations in making turbine blades. Hence, you can\u2019t increase temperature indefinitely.Decrease the condenser pressure. Again, this cannot be decreased far below the atmospheric pressure, because the air starts leaking into the system. But, the pressure is decreased to a certain value below the atmospheric pressure.",
