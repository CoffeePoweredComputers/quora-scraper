            "answer_text": "We need to distinguish organic chemistry as a set of undergraduate classes from organic chemistry as a type of chemistry research. Both are hard, but for different reasons. I\u2019m not an organic chemist, mostly because I don\u2019t very much like the subject, so I will focus my answer on the difficulties associated with organic chemistry courses, and in particular my own complaints. In my view, organic chemistry is hard because it is specifically designed to be a rat race where 90% of premedical students\u2019 dreams go to die. Such a purpose had made organic chemistry not only overly time-consuming , but also rather uninteresting to learn. Now I say this despite the fact that I did decently well in all my orgo classes (I got an A- in both of them), I don\u2019t hate organic chemistry because of the grade that I received; I hate it because of what I had to go through in order to get that grade. When I was taught organic chemistry, the courses emphasized brute force memorization more than other other subject I had every studied. Sure you could get lucky and answer some questions just by understanding the fundamentals of chemical structure and reactivity, but no one can predict a Grignard reagent will add a carbonyl group to a ketone (Grignard reaction), no one can predict that an alkyl group can just switch carbon atoms during certain kinds of elimination reactions(1,2-rearrangement), those facts must simply be memorized. As an example to prove my point, here is an actual question taken from one of my orgo tests. It asks to rank these acids based on their pKa (how acidic they are).  Now, yes, you can get a 6/9, maybe even a 7/9 on this problem just through understanding some basic qualitative chemical principles like resonance or the fact that sulfur generally forms weaker bonds due to it\u2019s larger size. Although even then you would only have 5 minutes for this problem on an actual test, so you can\u2019t spend too much time thinking about each structure. But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s put time constraints aside; there is still no way you can predict whether say methanetiol [math]CH_3SH[/math] has a higher or lower pKa than say 3-Nitrophenol(structure D), based on qualitative principles alone. You would have had to memorize those pKa\u2019s before coming to the test. And by the way, this is not just my opinion, both my professor and my TA advised me to just memorize the pKa\u2019s of about 40 different compounds in order to be ready for these kind of questions. I still have the flashcards. At the end of the day, organic chemistry is an empirical science. We know the outcomes of reactions and their mechanisms not because we sat looking at the line structure of the molecule all day until, eureka, we figured it out using some ridiculous set of qualitative rules. No, organic chemistry is not math or physics and it cannot be solved like math or physics. We know the outcomes of reactions because people go into laboratories and carry them out, and then use some kind of spectroscopy or spectrometry to verify the result. THEN we come up with the qualitative rules after the fact. The only serious scientists who can actually predict reactions before they have ever been done in a laboratory are using some very heavy duty quantum chemistry, and even then they can often get it wrong. Now all this memorization and using fuzzy logic with qualitative rules wouldn\u2019t be too horrible if you were learning something meaningful. I absolutely love history, and learning history often involves quite a lot of memorization and a bit of fuzzy qualitative reasoning. But what keeps me interested in history is the fact that I feel deeply satisfied with what I\u2019m learning, that the knowledge I have gained has benefited me greatly and given me a new outlook on the world. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for organic chemistry, most of what I learned in orgo was entirely meaningless. Sure, the basics like SN1, SN2 substitutions reactions are pretty important to know for anyone broadly interested in biology, because they are so common. But beyond those basics, knowing the 50 different ways you can synthesize a ketone group and the 50 different mechanisms for said ways, is quite frankly useless. Ok fine, maybe it\u2019s not useless for actual synthetic organic chemists, but 95% of the students in your typical organic chemistry class are not going to be synthetic organic chemists. Memorizing the plethora of information that organic chemistry forces you to memorize in neither practically useful, nor is it somehow intellectually enlightening. It\u2019s just busy work. Busy work assigned to pre-med students in order to filter out which ones have what it takes to succeed in medical school. Yes, in medical school you do have to memorize a LOT of information, and yes the information you memorize is really important to your practice. But, it has very little to do with organic chemistry. Organic chemistry just serves as a kind of pseudo, that\u2019s why medical schools emphasize your grade in it so heavily, it\u2019s very indicative of your ability to memorize by brute force a large amount of monotonous information. I don\u2019t mind time-consuming classes that are practically useful or intellectually enlightening, and I don\u2019t mind easy classes that are useless. But organic chemistry is the hellish combination that is both time-consuming and teaching me information that I cannot apply to any technical or nontechnical aspect of my life. When I study for organic chemistry, I know the only reason I am studying is so I can get a good grade, and that makes every minute feel like an hour. It takes the all the joy out of learning a new subject, and leaves you with a pile of tasteless ash you need to shove into your brain by the end of the term. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s why that\u2019s why everyone finds it difficult, but it\u2019s certainly why myself and many of my closest friends found it difficult. On a final note, now that I\u2019ve ripped into organic chemistry I think I should add a bit of nuance and say that, while I find the material taught in your average course to be completely ineffective for most of the students, organic chemistry as a subject is still extremely important. Many of the wonders of the modern world from medicine to industry wouldn\u2019t be possible if it weren\u2019t for our extensive understanding of carbon and it\u2019s very special chemistry. I have nothing but respect for actual organic chemistry researchers, the work they do, and the knowledge base they need to do that work. ",

            "answer_text": "My undergraduate degree is in Industrial Chemistry. I graduated with honors and found all of my major classes pretty easy \u2014 except for Organic Chemistry. I am extremely good at memorization and I am probably best than most in problem solving, specially if you could use math to solve the problem, but pretty much any kind of problem solving I am great at. Still, Organic Chemistry wasn\u2019t as intuitive as all of the other courses. That is one reason I wanted to get a PhD in Organic Chemistry \u2014 I thought there must be some kind of trick to it to make it easy and I needed to find out what it was. I eventually found out what my problem was, at my subconscious level I could not believe my own inability to predict the outcome of organic reactions with logic and mathematical modeling alone. I was trying to find specific patterns and numeric logic to Organic Chemistry and encase the outcome of reactions to my past experience, but some reactions simply defied my internal logic and knowledge. I actually needed to memorize the way that bonds had behaved in the past and use only that, even if that information would go against my own logic. Once I trained my brain to stop applying my own logic to try to solve the problems, and instead use only the patterns I had memorized, I was able to master the courses, but I have to admit \u2014 my brain complained and squealed because that is not in my nature. But even after mastering what they teach you in college, the real issue is that organic reactions don\u2019t always go as you would expect, as a matter of fact, scientists still can\u2019t figure out the absolute logic in organic chemistry, which is why is so hard to create a good computational simulation software for organic reactions that would be reliable and that is why we always have to try the our theories in the lab, sometimes they just defy our expectations. Think about it, if organic chemistry were easy, we could easily program computers to tell us exactly what you would get with any kind of established parameters and we wouldn\u2019t need to do things in the lab. There have been many advances in biological computing and in many kind of engineering, but there is still a lot to do in organic chemistry. In a sense, organic chemistry is similar to human behavior, you can theorize the outcome, usually based on past behavior, but many times it just surprises us. ",
