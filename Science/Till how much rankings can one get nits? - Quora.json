            "answer_text": "It depends on the stream, category as well as your home state. Also it depends on the nit that you want. Like the new ones of Sikkim etc close at 1.5L and the old ones like trichy, Warangal close at 20k.By closing I mean the last seat to be occupied. Well it is absolutely meaningless if you go to the new nits as you don't get the feel of being in an nit nor placements and nor you have the faculty to boost of. So strive for less than 30k rank. All the best:-) ",
