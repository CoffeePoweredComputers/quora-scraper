            "answer_text": "It is much easier to understand when the term alkaline earth metal are explained word by word. The first term alkaline : They are called alkaline earth metals because they form alkaline solutions (hydroxides) when they react with water . So basically, this term alkaline means that the solution has a pH greater than seven and is basic. Thus, the alkaline earth metals form very basic solutions and are excellent reducing agents. The alkaline earth metals are named after their oxides, the alkaline earths, whose old-fashioned names were beryllia, magnesia, lime, strontia, and baryta. These oxides are basic (alkaline) when combined with water. \"Earth\" is an old term applied by early chemists to nonmetallic substances that are insoluble in water and resistant to heating\u2014properties shared by these oxides. So in short, this is how Group 2 got its name.. Btw, same question has been asked earlier in Qoura, and here is the link: Periodic Table: Why are group 2A elements called alkaline earth metals? It might be helpful:) ",

            "answer_text": "As with so many scientific words beginning with \"al-\", it derives from Arabic, al qali, ashes of a burned plant. These ashes are rich in sodium and potassium. (The Latin word for potassium, kalium, comes from the same source, and that's why potassium is written with a K.) The alkaline earths are from mineral-derived sources which, in their oxide forms, behave much as the alkalis do. It was not until later that scientists were able to separate the metallic, elemental forms from the oxides, but the name \"alkaline earth\" stuck. ",
