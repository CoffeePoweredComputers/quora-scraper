            "answer_text": "The short answer to \"what can probability predict?\" is nothing. At least not with certainty. Probability is what you use when you can't predict something. Probability is a good long-term decision-making and forecasting tool we use in the face of uncertainty.  Before you flip a coin, if the probability of heads is 50%, this cannot predict the coin flip. If the probability of heads is 98%, you still cannot predict the coin flip. However, if you were to make a prediction in the later case, it would make sense to \"expect\" a heads and plan accordingly. Probability cannot predict the winning lottery numbers. It can't even say if you personally should or should not play the lottery. However, in the face of uncertainty, probability can give you the average value of the lottery ticket, and you can decide for yourself whether or not to buy one accordingly. Probability can't predict whether it will rain at a specific spot at a certain time. It compares present conditions with past data and says with a certain likelihood whether or not it will rain. Sometimes the projections show a 99.99% chance over a certain range of time. You'd be foolish not to pack an umbrella or relocate your outdoor wedding, but nothing is certain until it happens. Probability gives you a sense of the average and a sense of how much you should expect things to deviate from that average, but it can't tell you what will happen. ",

            "answer_text": "I am know Athourity in this matter, but it seems that Probabilities function well on a macro level, because large wholes offer better patterns in information. So it may predict say how many Christmas trees you should sell this year, if you have a log of the several years beforehand. But when dealing with sub wholes and with micro levels, a probability will not predict accurately. Like, if I should have 30% Douglas firs and 70% Faiser firs, since the last year I was left with more Douglas firs, or 60% of the 8\u2019 trees were not sold, so I should only have a lot of 15 not 50. It is because an aggregate of sub wholes will be less likely to show enough data to arrive at a statistic. Statistics for Probabilities is the process of getting a pattern coherent enough to make a hypothesis as to what will happen in a given amount of time, in this can one year. So, a probability will better predict activities that are macroscopic, but microscopic probabilities are less predictable. That\u2019s what I think. ",
