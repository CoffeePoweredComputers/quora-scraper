            "answer_text": "Seeing as there are lots of well written answers about how group I elements most easily have a stable valence shell by dropping an electron shell, I\u2019ll take the liberty of being a bit more technical. Yes, the Lewis dot model explains perfectly well why sodium and potassium are so weakly bonded to their lone valence electrons but if we dig deeper into the actual quantum mechanics, namely the effects of shielding and comparative energy levels, what we\u2019ll see is that the real reason group one elements are \u201cstrong\u201d reducing agents is the simple fact that virtually all other elements on the periodic table pull on those electrons with much more force. *Rant on Shielding, Electron Orbitals, and Energy Levels incoming\u2026 Let\u2019s look at sodium and chloride as examples to keep ourselves grounded. They form a very common salt and they\u2019re on the same row on the periodic table so my explanation will go smoother, though it will apply across different rows as well. The valence orbital for the outer electron in sodium is the 3S orbital (If you don\u2019t know what orbitals like S and P are\u2026 I\u2019d recommend a google search cause I don\u2019t feel like writing a novel\u2019s worth of words here would help anywhere). The valence orbital for chlorine is\u2026 3p. Ideally (in a one electron hydrogen model) these two orbital types are degenerate, and even in the multi electron realities the two energy levels are really close. This means that the 3p electrons in chlorine and the 3s electron in sodium are both relatively similarly spaced from their respective nuclei. This means the overwhelmingly dominant factor in how tightly the electrons are bound, and by extension their energy levels, are primarily determined by the electromagnetic attaction exerted by the nucleus. Neutrons don\u2019t exert any such force because they\u2019re neutral so this means we\u2019re only going to focus on atomic number. Sodium\u2019s atomic number is 11. Chlorine\u2019s is 17. This means there are 6 more protons pulling on all of chlorine\u2019s electrons than there are for sodium. At this point, it\u2019s not a tremendous leap to infer that if these two atoms were brought into close proximity, the chlorine atom\u2019s much higher charged nucleus would pull an electron away from sodium. Now hold on, you might be thinking, what about the other electrons that cancel out chlorine\u2019s charge? After all, initially both sodium and chlorine have zero net charge. Again, this comes down to the fact that in quantum mechanics approximations made with the Schrodinger equation electron shielding effects are weak enough to simply ignore and approximate to zero in comparison to the electromagnetic forces of the nucleus on any particular electron. But what about salts from different rows? This explanation so far fails to explain why, say, potassium fluoride is created as an ionic compound. Well, at this point it comes down to orbitals. Remember how both sodium and chloride had the number 3 assigned to their valence shells? That\u2019s not just some arbitrary number but an objectively defined quantum number. The higher the quantum number, the \u201chigher\u201d the energy level of the electron orbital in question and the larger the distance from the nucleus. Potassium\u2019s valence shells have the quantum number 4 while fluorine has a valence quantum number 2. No, this does not mean potassium\u2019s electrons are twice as far from the nucleus as fluorine necessarily but it does mean 4s,p,d,f orbital electrons are much more weakly attached to their nuclei than 2s,p,d,f orbitals. This means it\u2019s still reasonable for fluorine to drag the electron away from potassium as it has a space available in a lower quantum number orbital. And in case you ask, yes the row number on the periodic table does in fact tell you the quantum number of the valence shells. Though once you get into d orbitals and transition metals in general that system gets kind of muddled. Hope this helps expand the picture. Feel free to comment if something\u2019s unclear or I made a mistake. (which I very well might have in my long answer) ",

            "answer_text": "Group one elements are strong reducing agents because they have one valence electron in their outermost shell therefore they are loosely bound by the nucleus causing them to increase in their atomic size and as a result their ionisation potential ( minimum amount of energy to remove an electron from the outermost shell ) is less. Thus, they could easily lose an electron making them good reducing agents. ",
