            "answer_text": "The term \u201cphilosophy\u201d is used, these days, to refer to two very different things. First, it is used to refer to a academic department found at most universities and colleges (it is one of the Humanities and is generally administered by The School of Arts & Sciences). Secondly, it is used to refer to a literary genre. This genre (Western philosophy) originated in ancient Greece and consists of a huge variety of texts produced over the last 2,500 years in Europe and it also includes texts written in North & South America and in far flung outposts of intellectual life like New Zealand or Russia. There is nothing that all these texts have in common, either in style or subject matter. Wisdom is something that some people acquire by having paid attention to their own lives and the lives of other human beings (some long dead). While it clearly has an intellectual component, it is more generally believed to be found in people who have had a large range of experiences (perhaps by having worked at a many occupations or traveled to many countries). Also, unlike much philosophical writing, wisdom generally has a practical bent (not unlike Aristotle\u2019s phronesis). There is no empirical evidence, as far as I know, that spending years of one\u2019s life reading texts commonly considered to be works of philosophy is helpful in acquiring wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy is a tool. It is a tool that enables us to understand the invisible world of abstract ideas. The counterpart is math. Math is a tool that enables us to understand the visible physical world of objects. Philosophy enables us to draw distinctions between meaningful information that can be validated. Wisdom is knowing how to use this information. ",
