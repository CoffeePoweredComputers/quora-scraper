            "answer_text": "The original question has been modified by Quora moderators. My answer to the original question was based on the question of the nature of HUMAN nature. I would like to address, therefore, in my answer to this question, the nature of \u201chuman nature.\u201d An economic division between humans has existed as long as humans have existed upon a planet of limited resources. Nevertheless, an accepted fallacy as truth has distorted the underlying fact behind our division. Ours is not a division because of resources, but a division because of ideologies (our ideas and perceptions). When used correctly and symbiotically with nature, there are more than enough resources upon earth to provide the basic physical needs for every human being; to have enough nutritious food to eat, clean water to drink, basic housing and utilities, basic clothing, and basic healthcare \u2026 way more than enough! What keeps us from sharing the abundance of resources so that we all have equal access to them? The answer: our different ideologies. Giving science the due respect it demands from rational thinkers, let\u2019s assume that the human race has evolved into a typical species in the animal kingdom. How then, through this supposed evolutionary process, did our species evolve so dramatically different than any other species in the natural world and become atypical? Where does there exist another species, genus, family, order, class, or phylum\u2013\u2013in which its constituents are, by their own choice, divided into class structures\u2013\u2013where one individual dominates and controls another in order to benefit itself exclusively? Outside the human species, where does there exist another animal group that consciously sees its other members as lower class, middle class, or upper class? Where else are there caste types set, wherein by birth alone, a creature is assigned a specific honor that sets it in prominence above others? Where in the animal kingdom do the natural instincts of one member serve itself instead of the whole? Human nature is vastly different than the rest of nature. Why? Because humans are the only life form that defines and attempts to control nature for its own benefit. Therefore, the natural world is a human world. The world exists because humans say it exists and define its existence by the existence and protection of the human individual\u2013this natural tendency is HUMAN NATURE. This natural tendency is why humans establish borders, nations, communities, and families, and seek for personal riches and emotional securities such as patriotism or religious or group affiliations that separate them from others. Though these things are abstract, and are as varied as each particular mind interprets their meaning and value, they have become an important constant, and the utmost desire of a person in search of his or her natural balance. Even those who do not want borders, nations, communities or families, and who do not seek material wealth or depend on the emotional securities that distinguish one human from another, still protect their individuality by NOT belonging to the group of those who do seek after these things. Inevitably, it is impossible for humans not to crave their individual selfish desires\u2013\u2013no matter what they might be. Humans have taken dominion over the world. Where there exists a law of nature, there also exists human reasoning to circumvent it to serve human need. The long-term effects of circumventing the laws of nature, which have been followed by all other animals for millions of years, are not measured when the expected standard is the end fulfillment of human behavior\u2013\u2013happiness. The standard of human happiness can only last if it supports individuality, i.e., HUMAN NATURE. Once a standard is set and accepted by the whole of humanity, it isn\u2019t long before exercising free will motivates an individual to set him or her self apart from, or above, the whole by attempting to change the established standard. The reason for continual scientific and technological advancement has little to do with what is best for the whole, but all to do with what will help promote individuality. To be the one who discovers the next great step in the standardization of human happiness, lends to the constant desire to be recognized apart from the whole. Inventors, explorers, scientists, actors, musicians, athletes, business icons, or whoever differentiates and distinguishes themselves from others, all have one common goal: to become the one who sets the self apart from the rest. These are the 1% of the human species. However, the personal goals of the 1% are not shared by everyone. There are many, many people (the 99%) who have no interest in setting themselves apart from others in this way, but have found their own happiness in other ways. They have no desire to outdo their peers, and consequently, contribute little to the advancements of technologies that ostensibly support human happiness. Yet even so, they too, in their own way, seek individuality. Ironically, through our efforts to establish a universal standard of living by which all can benefit, we have created our own opposition and challenges that diametrically oppose the balance (happiness) we seek. From technological advancements, cities are developed and concentrated on small tracts of land where happiness is hardly experienced by their citizens. To escape urban sprawl and the crowding effects of these advancements, we escape to the mountains, deserts, and other natural environs left unaffected by the standard of living effectuated by the 1% and forced upon the masses. The irony is this: We circumvent natural law and its environs in search of happiness, and then ironically, return to these same environs in their natural state to recapture and experience what we lost through our own actions. All of us want to experience happiness. Nothing is more soothing and provides more comfort than an unforced smile that comes as the result of a preconceived notion or desired individual goal being fulfilled. Goals are based on what is conjured up in the mind. They are images created by the desire to experience happiness, which are directly associated with the need to sustain individuality in a vast sea of humanity. From the moment a little girl, for example, is able to distinguish herself from others, she begins to establish fundamental concepts of her world and what she must do to maintain who and what she is, and what she should be when she becomes an adult. She aspires to fulfill her happiness. Our aspirations, our HUMAN NATURE, lead to miraculous discoveries intended to promote the concept of self-realization. Television, books, magazines, and predominately, the examples of the adults around her, (who appear to a child as those who have a stable and secure self-image), create images for the little girl. From these images, she formulates her desire to become someone or something that either fits securely within the standardized images, or puts her above them. And when she can do neither, the opposite of happiness is experienced. Our insistent determination to assert our individuality has propelled the human kingdom into a chaotic state of affairs that threatens its very existence. Under the auspices and power of but a few (1%), the survival of the majority (99%) hangs precariously thin by a small thread unwoven from the tapestry of humanity. One end of the thread is held by the 1%. At the other, dangles the masses, who unknowingly are bound by a delicate link, which if severed, would precipitate their downfall or their liberation. There is a sword that can cut both ways and sever the thread with one mighty blow. It can release the weight dangling from its unsteady point of attachment, giving solid ground to maintain its mass with stability. As it cuts, the thread is left dangling without purpose, held by those who are no longer needed to hold it up. The sword is truth. There are more than seven billion human beings upon the earth at this time. Less than one percent (seventy million) of these hold the rest in chains of slavery and inequality from which there is no escape. The promise of becoming one of the elite\u2014one of this blessed one percent, assures the efficacy of the rationale for the chain: work hard enough in the fields of slavery, and one day, you might become a master. Upon the wall in plain view of the enslaved, hangs the key to their chains. It is not a tangible key, because there is no actual lock. It is the writing upon the wall that resonates in words that the chained cannot interpret for themselves: The truth shall set you free! Someone must boldly step forward without agenda and personal expectation, wielding the sword of truth in defense of the yoked. The sword will cut for the benefit of the poor, the meek, the downtrodden, and the exploited of the world. But for the exalted, who are those who live deliciously and fare sumptuously from the woes of others, the sword only cuts one way: \u201cThe lofty looks of man must be humbled, and the haughtiness of men bowed down. The sword of truth and justice must fall upon every one who is proud and lofty, and upon every one who is lifted up, and they must be brought low. Like glorious trees of both cedar and oak that are high and lifted up, the truth must fall them into splintered wood. It must fall upon the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, which are the borders that keep the lofty isolated like islands of the sea. These mountains will flee at the truth and the islands will be removed out of their place. \u201cIt must fall upon all the ships which sail upon the sea of humanity carrying treasures of silver and gold\u2014the idols of man\u2014from one port of merchandise to another. The truth must fall upon all the pleasant pictures painted by the brushes of selfish artists who have colored beauty which they alone behold. The sword of truth will cause the loftiness of man to bow down, and the haughtiness of men to become low; for the truth alone must be exalted for freedom to reign. \u201cWhen the truth is revealed, a man will cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which were made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats which live in the clefts of rocks, and on the tops of ragged stones. Who are these wise ones and wherein are they to be accounted of? The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator, these shall all cease because their breath is in their nostrils and the truth they have not known. The truth will exalt the children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.\u201d Here is that truth. It is the REAL TRUTH: For every one person who can claim success in reaching the standard of accepted self-awareness and prosperity, ninety-nine others suffer from the means used to achieve this prosperity without the ability to attain it for themselves. In the race to be counted of worth in a world of values and standards set to benefit those who set them, no notice is given to the devastating effects of the contest. \u201cFreedom\u201d is an abstract idea perpetuated by those in power over others. Evident forced slavery has simply been replaced with tacit slavery. Rising to the sound of a rooster\u2019s crow to harness the mule to the plow has been replaced with the obtrusive sound of an alarm clock that signals the beginning of another enslaved day. In both types of slavery, the wise ones are forced to work or they will die. The former was provided food, clothing, and shelter; the latter is given a piece of paper that must be exchanged for commodities owned by another slave owner. The slave\u2019s desire to live enriches the landowner for whom he or she works, and also the merchant from whom he or she must purchase life. The former was forced into chains if work and rules were not completed as established by the master; the latter is locked in a jail cell for the same reasons. Neither chose to be born into slavery; each would have rather been born the child of a slave owner: one who never saw the butt end of a mule pulling a harrow, or the other who will never hear the sound of a time punch-clock. Though modern owners do not outwardly display their employees as personal human property, the slave trade has transformed itself into a shared commodity of the corporations and wealthy of the world. Within the commercial organizations that buy and sell goods, make products, and provide services, there exists a proprietary implication that if a slave refuses to work for one business, in order to remain alive, the rebellious runaway must submit to another. By running away from one plantation, the need to eat, and be clothed and housed necessitates the acceptance of another. Chained ignorantly without lock or key, the writing on the wall has little affect on our minds and attitudes. We see ourselves as individual and equal human beings, instead of slaves. Thus, have we been convinced and deceived. The very essence of our innate human nature disallows the possibility that we can be controlled. We are convinced by our masters that it is possible that one day we, too, might own a business and have others work for us. Thus deceived, we forget our immediate state of enslavement by the illusory daydream of financial freedom and wealth. Day after day, our minds are gratified and lulled into a tempered calm as we toil in the fields, cubicles, or other employment we do not enjoy but have chosen by force. The \u201cDream\u201d satisfies our inner conflict by convincing us that it is possible to become a landowner; hence, we are indeed equal to our masters who were once enslaved like us. We are not isolated to being slaves to the rich and powerful, but have also become indentured to our own desire to become a master. \u201cGetting ahead in the world\u201d has become the model of individuality. It becomes easier for us to alienate our minds from the conditions of poverty and destitution required at the bottom of the corporate chain, because of the image in our minds of future success and the opportunity to jump from the ninety-nine percent to the one percent. We have become desensitized to our own slavery. We pay no attention to human history that has paved a path of awareness to the place where the thin thread hangs. History demonstrates that the set percentages (1% to the 99%) have never changed, and never will\u2014one wise one on top needs ninety-nine others below in order to keep them buoyed up on the sea of humanity. Many of the ninety-nine die with little notice or fanfare, and are soon replaced by other unknown faces, struggling to stay alive, and hoping to one day reach the top. The 1% pays no attention to the loss of faceless individuals of whom they knew nothing. Clothed in robes of excess and prosperity, they find no relevance in any matter outside the walls of their personal kingdom of gratification and family. The robes by which they are clothed came at a price\u2014the cost of other human beings, whose every breath stitched the woven threads of their contrived tapestries: In the torrid sun, the stones of the fields are removed by calloused hands. Sweat stings the eyes of those who work tirelessly; laboring until the sun gives way to a reprieve of darkness\u2014TEN. Each day the field is plowed, furrowed, and prepared for seed, which requires more sweat, more toil, and more death to produce the billowing soft fibers\u2014TWENTY. When nature takes it course, and the mortality of verdant leaves becomes evident by the colors of harvest, more souls are tasked with the burden of collecting the crop. Nature\u2019s product is delivered to others\u2014THIRTY. Day after day, night after night, broken hearts and souls sit in the same position, separating and spinning the delicate fibers into thread\u2014FORTY. Passed on to others who stand at the loom, or the machines that have replaced it, the threads are woven into cloth using the same process, every minute of every day of every year, expressing the apparition of a human shadow cast upon the loom, until no distinction can be made between the two\u2014FIFTY. The cloth is cut and sewn by bent backs and fingers, sitting undaunted in dungeons of production overseen by task masters who peer intrusively, assuring that no move is made that is not expected\u2014the same moves that were expected yesterday, that are expected today, and will be expected tomorrow\u2014SIXTY. Checked for quality and packaged appropriately, the product is ready to be transported by redundant hands and hearts\u2014SEVENTY. Transportation provides the means up the chain by driving along roads of boredom and melancholy, finally arriving to unload the cargo\u2014EIGHTY. Received with pride and hope of profit, the changed and fabricated natural seed is proudly displayed with a learned sense of fashion by those whose hope resides in its marketable placement\u2014NINETY. Unaware of the ninety-nine people who brought it into being, the one out shopping sees the beautiful robe that is envisioned hanging next to the many others in the wardrobe of the one who will turn off the closet light, never giving a second thought from where each robe came. Money has become the determining value by which others are appreciated or depreciated among the wise ones. A brain surgeon spends his time studying and gaining experience to save lives. These doctors allow slaves to remain well enough to continue working in the fields where they pick the strawberries and milk the cows from which the scarlet fruits are covered with white delight to satisfy the surgeon\u2019s morning palate. Without something to eat, from where would the doctor get the energy to save lives? How many lives does he save in comparison to how many are saved by the produce of the hardworking fieldworkers? It takes only one doctor to operate on a brain, but ninety-nine migrant workers to assure the harvest doesn\u2019t spoil in the countryside fields. The 1% worth is augmented, not only by the values they have placed upon their own abilities, but also by the prospect that by the sweat of the brows of unseen others of lesser means, their worth can be increased. Appalling to human decency, corporations and capitalistic business enterprises offer stock in their companies to the 1% who can afford to buy them, promising that by paying low wages, few benefits, and keeping the ninety-nine percent in slavery, a healthy dividend will be paid for doing absolutely nothing! These stocks are more precious to the holder than the lives of the oppressed needed to create their value. To avoid personal accountability for actions deemed necessary in pursuing profit, the 1% found a way to detach themselves from the stigma of greed and merchant despotism. The introduction of \u201ccorporations\u201d and \u201ccharitable foundations\u201d created entities as abstract as the values placed upon them. Corporations are groups of wise ones acting as a single entity with one purpose only\u2014profit. Charitable organizations are set up to bring value to the ones who set them up, or donate to them, with attempts to hide profits and deceive themselves and the rest of the ninety-nine, that by what they are doing, they are solving the world\u2019s problems. Without taking away the purpose for which they are established, corporations and charitable foundations cannot acknowledge that the real problem is slavery\u2014and they do absolutely nothing about this! Profit is the monetary worth that remains after the value of the ninety-nine has been subtracted from the value of the one. To increase the sum of this insensitive equation, the value of either the one or the ninety-nine must be decreased proportionally to obtain the desired amount of profit. Since corporations and foundations have replaced the one, or better, the ones have become the corporations and foundations (and most business laws protect and secure the value of the person founding these entities), only one determinant is left to be lowered to increase the overall profit: the 99%. The equation is: (corporate/foundation value) \u2013 (human value) = (profit). These entities will not, by choice, devalue themselves; therefore, the only determinant left to be reduced is human value. At length, there are those who awaken from the deep sleep into which they have been lulled by the carnal security provided by their master. By the light of day, they see the hopelessness in reaching the top of the chain. They have become the Humanity Party\u00ae. They witness others clamoring over each other, dragging each other down in their attempt to reach the top. They realize they have been deceived by the master, and that there is no lock on their chain. Cast aside, the chain no longer has significance to their individual state of existence. Yet, without it, they will die. So they fight the masters, determined to proclaim their independence from the chains by which they were bound. But their sticks and stones are no match for their masters\u2019 whips and weapons. They either submit or are killed. These are seen as rebellious criminals, terrorists, or insurgents who have no hope of being valued by others for what they refuse to do. So they gain value in their own eyes by what they decide to do for themselves. They did not set the standard and values by which they have been judged by others. They had no part of the decision made between two one-percenters insistent on perpetuating their own value by creating the standards. Hitherto forced into existence, the 99% must submit the identifying nature of their souls to the will of the 1%. \u201cSubmit or die\u201d is a far cry from the liberty inalienably guaranteed by free will and the ability to recognize the self. Submit to what? To the self-evident realization that one human beings is not considered as good as another? Can this submission transcend the feeling of knowing that the self exists independently because of its ability to think and recognize itself? Claiming one is better than another prioritizes the worth of existence, thus giving credence to the imposed reality that supremacy negates the lives of those considered inferior\u2014the ninety-nine do not exist to the one. Many years might pass before the ninety-nine percent finally realize they are not valued by the one percent as equals. But as they do, a revolution of thought replaces their inner struggles with wars and rumor of wars, demanding that they are recognized and valued as equal human beings. Unfortunately for the masses (even if the majority possess powerful hand-held weapons and the physical strength to wield them against the minority), technological superiority allows just one to be at the controls of a warplane or nuclear weapon and quash any revolution of the greater number. The one will always rule and set the measures, the values, and the standard to which the ninety-nine must submit or be killed. What is needed is for the ninety-nine to appoint one to represent them, who becomes the \u201cAnointed One\u201d and possesses the power and knowledge to represent all equally. This chosen one must possess the gentle nature of a lamb to assure equality and fairness to all, even to the 1%, but brandish a sword from which none are immune from the strength of its blow. This \u201cAnointed One\u201d is truth and justice for all equally. This \u201cAnointed One\u201d is the Humanity Party\u00ae. THumP\u00ae has the solutions. No one else does.

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, one must look at the general meaning of \u2018human nature\u2019. This would refer to the psychological, distinguishing and social features of the human being. Apparently our behavioural traits and characteristics fall within a certain framework. The scientific Myers-Briggs Test categorise 16 actually, but then this is a very controversial area and many other scientists say one should not put a whole lot of trust in it. Who to believe? Believe it or not there is a definite framework that can be considered with regard to the nature of human nature. I notice in your subtext you specify not to incorporate religious perspectives. But this would indeed skirt around important issues. And that would be that by the very nature of human nature - we are followers. We essentially like groupings, and that can be within religion, social groupings, college/university groupings, work related groupings. political groupings. It is what we are usually good at. When we are not clinging to religion, we are holding tight to our culture. We form patterns within the societies we live. These societies influence us more than we care to admit. Last evening I watching the Democratic Conference unfold, after having watched the Republicans last week. There was a scene outside the conference hall showing crowds turning out bedecked with the American flag. Dressed in the American colours. The children too were dressed in these, as were a lot of dogs. The Americans psyche is leaning to the very patriotic - you do not see the same scenario in the UK where we dwell. The British on the whole are not quite so demonstrative. It is just not in our nature. Therefore as I understand it the basic tenets of human beings the world over are the same and are derived initially from our genes, but outside influences from our nurturing, our challenges, the experiences we encounter, the societies we are brought up in bring about slight or in some respects significant changes.
