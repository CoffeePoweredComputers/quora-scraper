            "answer_text": "Science fairs are extremely exciting events during the school life and you can win the hearts of the people only with something that is a working model and does something interesting. You can try one thing that I made for a school exhibition while I was in school. I built an automatic candy dispensing machine. It worked on the principle of metal being a good conductor of electricity. When you drop a coin, and press the button it completes an electric circuit. that was otherwise broken. Now there is a see saw structure with a motor that control the swing. The candy is kept on one side of the see saw. When the circuit is completed, the motor rotates and causes the see saw to go down and the candy slides out of the window to the user. This is just a gist of the project. If you feel like doing this, feel free to ask me the minute details as well. All the best. Cheers. ",
