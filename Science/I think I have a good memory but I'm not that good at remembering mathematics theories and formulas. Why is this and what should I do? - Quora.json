            "answer_text": "Formulas and theorems are just the conclusions of derivations. They aren\u2019t supposed to be memorized. If you understand how something works, you can derive for yourself what the pattern is and then formalize it. Your formalization can look different from the formula, but it\u2019s correct as long as they are equivalent so they give the same results. If you can\u2019t derive the pattern or if your pattern gives different results from the pattern in the problem, you should go back and make sure you understand the concepts of what you\u2019re studying or rethink those concepts from a different perspective, and then try again.

It may take a little time, but don't worry--brains are very good at remembering things when we don't get in their way. Just stick with it, focusing on understanding the material; no need to micro-manage your brain. ",
