            "answer_text": "When a material makes the transition from the normal to superconducting state, it actively excludes magnetic fields from its interior; this is called the Meissner effect. This constraint to zero magnetic field inside a superconductor is distinct from the perfect diamagnetism which would arise from its zero electrical resistance. Zero resistance would imply that if you tried to magnetize a superconductor, current loops would be generated to exactly cancel the imposed field (Lenz's law). But if the material already had a steady magnetic field through it when it was cooled trough the superconducting transition, the magnetic field would be expected to remain. If there were no change in the applied magnetic field, there would be no generated voltage (Faraday's law) to drive currents, even in a perfect conductor. Hence the active exclusion of magnetic field must be considered to be an effect distinct from just zero resistance. A mixed state Meissner effect occurs with Type II materials. One of the theoretical explanations of the Meissner effect comes from the London equation. It shows that the magnetic field decays exponentially inside the superconductor over a distance of 20-40 nm. It is described in terms of a parameter called the London penetration depth. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the Meissner effect? The Meissner effect is the exclusion of the magnetic (and electric) field by a superconductor, due to the gain of an effective mass by the photon, making the electromagnetic interaction a short range force, within the superconductor, with many parallels to the acquisition of mass in the standard model by interaction with the neutral Higgs particle. Any existing magnetic flux through the conductor, as it becomes superconducting, is trapped and is confined to narrow flux tubes.  ",
