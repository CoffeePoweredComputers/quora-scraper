            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201c What is line spectacular?\u201d We know from Bohr\u2019s atomic theory that free atoms have sharp energy levels. Since energy levels are sharp, transitions of electrons from higher energy levels to lower energy levels give rise to emission of sharp spectral lines. By free atoms we mean atoms that are so far apart that there is no interaction between any two atoms. Atoms in gaseous phase fulfill this requirement completely According to Bohr's theory, the emmision of light from an atom occurs when an atom undergoes transition from an upper energy level to a lower one. But we need to know how the electron gets into higher energy prior to emission. Normally the electron in the gas exists in its lowest or n =1, level. To get into a higher energy level the electron must gain energy or be excited. One way of this to happen is through the collision of two gas atoms. During the collision some of the kinetic energy of one of the atoms is gained by the electron of another atom, thereby exciting the electron from n =1 level to a higher energy level. This excitation can also occur by electric discharge also. This electron on transition from higher to lower energy level emits sharp spectral line. Emission of spectral lines from gaseous atoms at low pressure gives rise to emmision line spectrum. Like emission line spectrum we also have absorption line spectrum. That spectrum finds explanation with Bohr's atomic theory. ",
