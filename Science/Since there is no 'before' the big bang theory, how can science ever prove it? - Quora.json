            "answer_text": "You are assuming here some (popularized) version of the \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d that is an inadeqate or wrong picture. The wrong picture here is that this assumes that the big bang scenario can be brought back all the way to some initial singularity (which shows up in the mathematical model) and would in some sense bring back the universe to a single point of space and time where all matter space and time are suppose to have \u201cbegun\u201d. What would it even mean to say that time has a begin, since a beginning already presumes that time exist\u2026 This however isn\u2019t the way science looks on it now, and the official version of the Big Bang theory does not presume that all matter space and time started in a singularity. Instead, the Big Bang theory can only go back as a very brief instance of time after the fictional singularity, in describing the physical reality at that point in time, in which the universe was much smaller, denser and hotter, and can not tell with certainty what went on before, because the physical theory to explain the physical reality before that instance in time, can not be experimentally verified. The point is of course that very near the singularity, we need a physical theory that combines both gravity and quantum mechanics. But such a unified theory does not yet exist. It can only be aproximated by using quantum corrections to gravity. From that, new models have been developed to describe the early universe, and one of the succesfull theories still dominating today is the theory of cosmological inflation. In simple words, this theory states that before the big bang (the expansion of the universe) the universe expanded at a much more rapid rate (exponentially fast, at least 50\u201360 e foldings) for a very brief time period. The theory of cosmological inflation has made predictions that have been experimentally confirmed, and also explains some features of the universe, the original big bang theory could not explain. More over, the theory of cosmological inflation, instead of seeing it as a prequel to the big bang expansion of the universe, can be looked on also as a cosmological theory on it\u2019s own, describing the universe on a very much larger scale, outside the boundaries of space and time of our observable universe. In this variant of the theory of cosmological inflation, named eternal inflation, the universe keeps inflating once inflation starts. In every part of the universe however, inflation stops after some finite amount of time, due to the random decay process of the underlying inflaton field (similar to how nuclear decay happens). But since parts of the universe that have not yet decayed grow exponentially fast in size, this effectively means that inflation never stops, and is therefore future eternal, In every part of space where inflation stopped, a new universe is born, like ours. It is very likely then that our universe did not emerge as the first universe, but as one of many other universes that keep on emerging, and this process could have been going on for an arbitrarly long time. We might never know what went on before our universe was born or what caused inflation to start in the first place, because all observable evidence for such phenomena have been effectively erased by the inflationary process itself. In fact the very first physical phenomena we can ever observe happened much later on, the decoupling of light and matter, which we see today as the cosmological background radiation. ",
