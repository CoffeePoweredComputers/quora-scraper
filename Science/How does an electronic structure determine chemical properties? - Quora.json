            "answer_text": "Mostly by the arrangement of the exterior shell of electrons.  This relates to how readily they accept or donate an electron to surrounding structures.  This in turn relates to how they bond with nearby elements (strength and physical characteristics) and how many free electrons they donate to the material (conductivity).  The energy of the exterior shell of electrons is also related to the perceived color of the material. As an example, one materials which really wants an electron, because their outer shell is lacking one, is a basic solution.  This solution has an OH+ molecule (which needs 1 electron to make its shell complete).  So, it will strip off electrons from nearby, less strongly bonded molecules to fill it's void.  This is why caustic solutions will dissolve things. ",
