            "answer_text": "Yes, there are many examples of this. For example, ionic monomers can polymerize such that two cationic monomers or two anionic monomers can react to form a dimer as the first step in formation of a polymer. For example, acrylic acid can be polymerized to form polyacrylic acid and vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride can be polymerized to form a polybenzyltrimethylammonium chloride. There are also examples of condensation reactions that have the same effect. For example, phosphoric acid when heated can be condensed to form pyrophosphoric acid. ",

            "answer_text": "All cations can form bonds - just not with other cations. All anions can form bonds - just not with other anions. Cations have a + charge which repels other cations with a + charge and the same logic applies to the - charge on the anion. However, the + of the cation WILL attract the - of the anion. Having said this, you can have two cations bonded to a single anion but once again, the cations are not bonded to each other. ",
