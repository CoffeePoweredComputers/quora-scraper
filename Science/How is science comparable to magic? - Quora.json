            "answer_text": "They\u2019re actually closer than most people might think. Among the similarities: Both are disciplines that seek to understand how the world works.Both are motivated by our desire, to at least some extent, to impose our will on the world.Both involve experimentation, at least to some extent.Both involve the search for general principles that can apply to specific situations.In both cases, those general principles can appear arcane to the uninitiated.As for that last point, this is an alchemy diagram:  This is a depiction of the root system of the Lie group , which is a mathematical structure that has significance in particle physics. (Since LaTeX can\u2019t do double duty as a hyperlink, see here.)  Of course, I\u2019m not suggesting that  has alchemical significance. I\u2019m suggesting that to the uninitiated, the superficial similarity of the two diagrams might be striking.  Obviously, there is a key difference. The key difference is what to do when an experiment contradicts an established principle. In magic, the experiment is somehow written off by post hoc distinctions. In science, the established principle is abandoned. For example, according to a hypothetical magical principle, it might be the case that chanting certain words and waving the right magic wand will light up a room. If someone tries it and it doesn\u2019t work, there are \u201cnatural\u201d explanations: there\u2019s something wrong with the magic wand or with the person. Perhaps, for example, the person is avaricious. As we all know, that causes the person\u2019s heart to be \u201cdark,\u201d and that person therefore can\u2019t use a light spell. Or maybe the wand came from a tree under which a \u201cdark\u201d event happened. You get the idea\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "First you need to pin down what you mean by magic. It might seem obvious, but when you explore it a lot of people mean different things when they say \u2018magic\u2019. The most common definition would just seem to be \u2018something supernatural\u2019. That\u2019s a vague idea, and not a very helpful one when you get right down to it. The term \u2018supernatural\u2019 itself is not really a coherent idea. If you look at a lot of things that people call supernatural there really isn\u2019t a good reason to call them that. For example, if ghosts are real, then they are actually part of the natural world. Why add \u2018super\u2019? For some the term \u2018magic\u2019 means a supernatural thing that is an intentional creation, a spell or charm or something similar. In that sense it is at least not a natural thing, so it gets closer to having a meaning. That still would seem to suggest that magic is a way of achieving a goal. Science, by comparison, is a way of gaining knowledge. So a better question might be \u2018How is science comparable to technology?\u2019 Technology is a method of getting things done, and while we might think of technology in terms of things that use electricity, the term really applies to even very simple machines like axes and hammers. It even applies to things that are purely means of organization, methods. What that means is that magic would then simply be technology that involves the supernatural. Though that leads us right back to the issue with the word supernatural\u2026 ",
