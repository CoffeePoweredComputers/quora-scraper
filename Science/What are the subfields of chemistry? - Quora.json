            "answer_text": "Roughly it can be divided into five fields: inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry and high polymer chemistry. However, there aren\u2019t absolute lines between them because cross fields are common. In Greenwood\u2019s Elemental Chemistry it\u2019s stated that The category of inorganic chemistry is outdated so the concept of elemental chemistry is used here. The book is organized by elements and for most part it introduces inorganic matters, but at the end of each chapter introductions of related organic matters are given. There are a kind of textbooks called \u201cstructural chemistry\u201d and they are about inorganic, organic and physical chemistry. High polymers can be inorganic or organic. ",

            "answer_text": "Chemistry has about as many subfields as there are chemicals. The main branches are inorganic, organic, biological, physical, and nuclear. It seems as though a new branch emerges as soon as someone writes an academic paper about something new, whether a substance, a reaction, or an interaction that has not been written about before. ",
