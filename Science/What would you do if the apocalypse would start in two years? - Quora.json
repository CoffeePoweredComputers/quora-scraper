            "answer_text": "It depends on the situation. If it\u2019s a zombie apocalypse I\u2019ll probably stock up on canned food and MREs if I can get some. Then stay at my home for most of the time, I would still do some scavenging for food and necessities. I would probably survive for one or two years before either becoming a zombie, get killed during scavenging, or escape and find a new place to start over again. If it\u2019s a world war then I\u2019ll probably get drafted into the military and die during combat. If it\u2019s something like the Fallout series then I would probably survive, considering I am in Vietnam, close to China but not close enough to get killed by the blast. I would probably perish in the year following the apocalypse. The entirety of Vietnam would fall into something like Fallout. There will be people who will steal and raid others and there will people who will be settlers, just trying to survive. There will be people who are \u201clone wolfs\u201d, these are the people with survival skills, combat skills with experience, and overall, a survivor. But seeing how close Vietnam is to China, I would give at least 4 to 6 years for Vietnam\u2019s population to plummet, reducing raiders and settlers to an amount that would make Hanoi into Boston from Fallout 4. Remnants of the military probably becoming mercenaries, and everyone else being either settlers or raiders. ",
