Exactly what you get in soil will depend on the composition of soil, the plants growing in it, and the moisture content. But it's common to find small amoebas like Acanthamoeba, and also amoeboflagellates like Naegleria, which can switch between amoeboid and flagellated stages. Small flagellates are pretty common, although identifying species is kind of a pain in the neck. A few genera of ciliates are pretty common, notably Colpoda and Cyrtolophosis.  Small diatoms and green algae are also not unheard of. And my favorites: testate (shelled) amoebas are fairly common and diverse, at least in moist soils and leaf litters. Here's one, Euglypha, with a test made of silica scales and spines\u2014in life, the pseudopods would be coming out of the aperture at the lower right:   All the soil protists that I can think of at the moment have the ability to form resistant cysts if the soil dries up. They essentially secrete a thick wall and go into suspended animation, for months or years in some species, until the moisture returns. So you'll find protists even in desert soils, albeit not as many as you might find in a rainforest soil. An older but still useful overview of what all those protists are doing may be had here, although getting the full text requires payment or a subscription: The Journal of Protozoology ",
