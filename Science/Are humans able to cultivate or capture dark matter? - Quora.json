            "answer_text": "As of now, nothing about the particulate nature of dark matter is known by us.  It is called dark matter as it does not interact with light and thus cannot be \"seen\" in a conventional way.  What we do know, is: a) that it is pressureless (the constituents do not collide with each other), b) it is acted upon by gravity, and c) it is not acted upon by electromagnetism.  Beyond this, we have no knowledge, and thus no detector technology that can \"harvest\" or capture dark matter. Dark matter is still a hypothesized form of matter that helps our theories to agree with observations extremely well. Particle theorists and experimentalists are still trying to find the \"true\" nature of it. ",

Also, it is very, very far away. So to capture or cultivate it we\u2019d have to know what it is first. It might not even be a single type of matter. Also, if it were up close, we\u2019d probably be able to see it and it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cdark\u201d. ",

Once we detect its existence, then I am pretty sure that we can understand it deeply-although more problems will arise-after overcoming all the problems.And if that happens, we can confidently and happily cultivate DM and keep it in a captured state if it were not too harmful to do so.

Dark matter is nothing like the common matter we see . We cannot see it or touch it but just observe its effects. So when we know so little about something we can surely not cultivate or capture it.
