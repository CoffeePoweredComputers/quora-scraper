            "answer_text": "Yes Asha. I would put it little differently: One can get in touch with the real nature and come out the non-working beliefs about self/others and world, which one is holding on to. The first step for any change is understand where you\u2019re. You need to create an awareness about yourself and learn about the methods and tools, which let you know where you\u2019re. You may have to attend some personality, behavioural classes or read books; Now, once you understand, first thing to answer is: Is it really required for you to change the nature? What\u2019s wrong with the current nature? I think these initial steps are enough to put you on the journey of change. Note that this is not a black and white, fixed in stone approach. You\u2019ll keep getting the answers from within, as you start pealing the layers of your personality. ",

I\u2019d say the best way is to observe and understand the positives we are capable of exhibiting or expressing through our own being. Once we\u2019re clear, we should start implementing it. When you think about it, it\u2019s the basics that parents teach a child. ",
