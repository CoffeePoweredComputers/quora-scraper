            "answer_text": "It is like asking why NO (i.e., N-O)is paramagnetic whereas N2 (i.e, N-N) is diamagnetic. Or why O2 (i.e., O-O) is more paramagnetic than nitric oxide, ON (i.e., O-N) Why and how a molecule is paramagnetic or diamagnetic is explicable by the construction of molecular orbitals by the LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) and then piling up all the available electrons of all atoms in the molecule across the molecular orbitals (MOs) following all the rules of electronic configuration, such as Aufbau Principle, Hund\u2019s Maximum Multiplicity, Pauli\u2019s Exclusion Principle etc among other symmetry aspects. Thus one would be able to arrive that TiCl2 (with 56 electrons, 22+17+17) has finite number of unpaired electrons in the MOs where as there in TiO2 all electrons (38 = 22+8+8) are in pairs. -Prof. A.
