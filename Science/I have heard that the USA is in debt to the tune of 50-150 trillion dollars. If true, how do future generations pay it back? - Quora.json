            "answer_text": "The latest numbers that I obtained from Wikipedia today say that the total US national debt is 17.6 trillion US dollars.  Calculating the national debt is a fairly complex undertaking because our country, our government, our economy and the world in which all of the those items exist is extremely large, complex and constantly changing. Many different organizations calculate the national debt in many different ways, often to match up with their preferred political ideology.  But I think any number you might pick between 15 to 20 trillion US dollars is probably a reasonable starting point for discussion.  For simplicity, I'll just stick with the 17.6 trillion number. Now 17.6 trillion is a *very* large number, but it is not an insurmountable number.  This amount of money is about one quarter of the amount of real, measurable wealth that the United States produces every year.  The national debt does have a measurable impact on our economy.  Like any reasonable system of borrowing and lending, when a person or a business or a country  has borrowed a larger and larger share of their income, lenders are understandably more reluctant to lend yet more money to the borrower. Based on the fear that the borrower may by unable or unwilling to repair some or all of the existing or new loans.  The larger the debt grows, the larger that negative impact of that debt grows.  This impact is measured by the cost of obtaining additional loans.  Lenders usually charge more interest to those they consider poor risks than those who have fewer and smaller debts. A simplistic answer might be to just stop doing anything else with our money except paying down the national debt until that debt is gone.  This sounds good on the surface, but there are many things that we would like to spend our money on today to buy things that we cannot otherwise afford.   Some of these purchases are for items that we have decided that we simply cannot live without. Like second and third engines for military jets that only have room for one engine; or submarines or tanks that the military has asked us not to build.  Other items are more frivolous, like food for hungry people or medicine for sick people.  But all in all, there are many things we would like to buy today.   Spending our money today paying down the national debt, means that we cannot buy these other items now, or possibly ever. One of the other complicating factors is that spending money on goods and services today has what is called a multiplier effect.  Having good roads, airplanes that don't crash, safe food, clean water and breathable air an infrastructure that does not collapse means that all of the other businesses in our country are better able to compete and produce wealth and value that we otherwise would not have. Spending down the debt also has a multiplier effect in that it becomes cheaper to borrow additional money in the future.  The question of how much to spend today to buy immediate value versus how much to pay down debt to buy future borrowing power is a complex and contentious issue. Reaching the issue of how will we or the future pay back the amount we have borrowed is the most speculative topic of all.  Much of this depends on what our personal, national and world economy is going to do over the next twenty to fifty years.  Since we are often completely at a loss to explain the economy twenty to fifty days in the future this can open to a huge amount of interpretation. There are typically variations on four basic curves that economists draw when looking at the future value of the size and complexity of the entire world or a large nation. 1. An improvement curve that reaches a maximum and begins declining2. Improvement curve the reach a maximum and holds steady at that level3. Continuous straight line improvement for the foreseeable future.4. An improvement curve that maintains and extends past exponential into an exponentially improving future. The first three of these lines are the ones most often employed by economists to explain current and future trends.  Using variations on these trends there are often good reasons available for paying down our national (and world-wide) debt at an aggressive pace.   However, the fourth possible curve presents an interesting situation.In this projection, the pattern of exponential extension and expansion of personal and collective wealth that we have experienced over the entire lifespan of the human race will continue to expand exponentially.   Given this projection, paying down our debts today is a fool's errand, that needlessly causes us unproductive and unprofitable harm to present day society.  In this path, the world will produce and possess such large stores of wealth and value in the future, that paying down our national and world-wide debt however large in today's terms, will be a trifling sum in terms of our future wealth. In this conception of the future, the major driver of well-being both current and future is to do whatever it takes to hasten the arrival of this future exponential improvement to our wealth.  This is not currently a popular position with economists, but there is a small but significant minority of technological and social specialists who see this situation not only as possible, but probable. Time will definitely tell. ",

            "answer_text": "If you exclude money the federal gov owes to the Federal Reserve and to other parts of itself, the federal gov owes about $12 trillion to the public.  Household debt roughly doubles that.  State and local govs add a bit.  All told, it is only a moderate burden compared to GDP, and most of it is owed to Americans. The thing about a national debt is you never want to pay it all off.  Government bonds are crucial for business and finance.  They're like interest-paying money.  People buy government bonds so they can keep their wealth in a liquid form that earns a bit of interest and yet they can still use it to buy stuff when they need to.  If you paid off the debt completely, there wouldn't be any bonds and banking and commerce would freeze up, paralyzing the economy. On the other hand, you don't want it to get too big, either.  If the debt gets too big compared to GDP, a country has three choices:    reduce the debtincrease GDPsome combination of the twoReducing debt means having government raise taxes and/or reduce spending until the tax income is larger than government spending.  Unfortunately, raising taxes is painful and so is cutting government spending.  People really don't like either choice. Increasing GDP is much more fun.  That's how we got our big debt under control after WWII.  We didn't pay it off, we just outgrew it.  Unfortunately, GDP growth in the U.S. has slowed dramatically since then and the Democrats and the Republicans in the U.S. can't agree on a way to get it back on track. Some friends of mine are working on a big project to rethink how we could do that.  I've included their ideas and some of mine here: Shakti Amarantha's answer to Are there actually any policy steps at all that can be taken to spur U.S. economic growth? ",
