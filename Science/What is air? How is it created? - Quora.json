            "answer_text": "Air is the name we use for that thin layer of gases that surrounds our particular planet. Its composition is primarily a mix of of nitrogen and oxygen, in diatomic form, with a number of trace gases[1]. Earthly life has evolved to depend on the particular ratio of these gases. Water vapor is a critical component, while CO2 levels are the primary regulator of global temperature[2]. Air is created by the mechanisms of the planet; volcanic outgassing, water vaporization, photosynthetic processes, and organic decay being primary drivers. A balance among these processes is how air is created and maintained. Once established, the creation and destruction cycles remain in balance. Unless disrupted, as has recently occurred, through large-scale conversion of buried hydrocarbons into atmospheric CO2.
