            "answer_text": "Information technology \u2013 often shortened to just IT \u2013 is a buzz phrase you\u2019ve probably heard ad nauseum if you happen to work with IT personnel or went to school for anything related to computers. IT workers are highly specialized in their field, which is probably why they\u2019re often just called \u201cIT nerds.\u201d They like what they do and understand it inside and out. IT workers are also essential to just about every modern business model. If a company relies on phones and emails, chances are that there\u2019s an IT professional behind it all making sure the cogs in the machine function properly.

That\u2019s what this job is for.Education: A bachelor\u2019s degree. 3. Computer forensic investigatorComputer crime detectives \u2013 The Best Schools reports that computer forensic investigators search for, identify and evaluate information from computer systems, often for trial evidence.Education: TBS says that you\u2019ll need a degree in computer forensics, information security or cyber security.

Mobile application developerChances are that you and most people you know have smartphones and/or tablet computers.
