            "answer_text": "An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retain all of the chemical properties of an element. Atomic structure:Atoms coalesce to form molecules, which then interact to form solids, gases, or liquids. Atoms are primarily finished of three particles; they are neutrons, protons and electrons. Neutrons and protons are present in the central part of the atom. This central part is called nucleus. Electrons are found outside and around the nucleus.Atoms have different properties based on the arrangement and number of their basic particles. ",
