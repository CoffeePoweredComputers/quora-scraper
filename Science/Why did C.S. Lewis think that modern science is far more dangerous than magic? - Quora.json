            "answer_text": "Hello there Ryan, Magic being based on belief is \u201ceffective\u201d only between the recipient\u2019s ears and might even be classed as pseudoscience. But, It is also a mature feature of the society, being essentially a psychological phenomenon. That is because magic is not real, though interesting enough alchemistry is/was. Alchemistry is a precursor of modern chemistry and when mixed with magic, helped the illusion along. Now for science. Science is a way of thinking logically and investigating and quantifying natural phenomenon using the Scientific Method[1] which is basically philosophy in action. Science is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study of scientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by which that success is achieved. Among the activities often identified as characteristic of science are systematic observation and experimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formation and testing of hypotheses and theories. How these are carried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like these have been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity from non-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical form of scientific method or methods should be considered science (see also the entry on science and pseudo-science). On the other hand, more recent debate has questioned whether there is anything like a fixed toolkit of methods which is common across science and only science. The method separates science from pseudoscience. The problem with science and technology is that it doesn\u2019t ask \u201cShould this be investigated? Is the society mature enough to handle the results.\u201d Instead, it proceeds to uncover and understand that which can be conceived. Science grants the immature species with knowledge it is not capable of handling wisely. It has no moral compass, it is bereft of ability to empathise and has no conscience. To C.S. Lewis it had no obligation to, or even acknowledged higher powers (God) and therefore was a grave concern. At the moment the world is full of evolved hominids that are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals[2] who can\u2019t handle the science or technology they have. Hell, they can\u2019t even handle a dialog for that matter. In any event, Lewis watched the World Wars, the development of atomic weapons, and the incredible inhumanity that put money into war, or preparing for war, instead of society. He lived until 1963 and saw a lot of the immaturity of the species and it bothered him. Ciao Footnotes[1] Scientific Method[2] Men in Black (1997) - IMDb",

            "answer_text": "You are, perhaps, thinking of this passage in Lewis\u2019s The Abolition of Man: \u201cThe fact that the scientist has succeeded where the magician failed has put such a wide contrast between them in popular thought that the real story of the birth of Science is misunderstood. You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse.\u201d And the impulse is a lust for power. That starts out, Lewis says, claiming to be the desire to control nature for human benefit, but it always ends up as a desire to control other people. The reason science is more dangerous than magic is simple, and given in the first line: science works, magic doesn\u2019t. But both are equally dangerous in their intent. A ruthless genetic engineer is as willing to transform future generations as Circe is to turn sailors into swine. The ruthlessness is the problem, of course, and the ruthlessness comes from, or is excused by, \u201cdebunking\u201d\u2014dismissing ethical concerns as \u201cunscientific\u201d because ethics is just taboos left over from tribal living, or repressed guilt from subconscious resentment of parents, or whatever the favorite theory is. This dismissal of conscience by allegedly scientific analysis is done very selectively, against the technocrats\u2019 opponents, never against the values and impulses of the technocrats themselves, though the process would work just as well. Lewis goes into this. ",
