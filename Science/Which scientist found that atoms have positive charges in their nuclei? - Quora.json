            "answer_text": "Michael Faraday deduced that the atomic theory of Boscovich fitted the facts of chemistry and the physics of phenomena such as electrical conductivity far better than any prevailing theory of the day. This involves the atom as a center of electrical force, consisting almost entirely of distributions of that force. Faraday's atomic conception was entirely modern. The vindication came in the beautifully simple yet definitive demonstration of Rutherford. ",
