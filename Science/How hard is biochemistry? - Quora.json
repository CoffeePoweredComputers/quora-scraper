            "answer_text": "Biochemistry is hard, because it assumes you know a lot of relatively knew knowledge. Take math for example. When you take calculus, it assumes you know algebra and some trig. You have been taking algebra and trig for years, so it\u2019s old topics with new applications and twists. Biochem is different. Biochem uses organic chemistry, a class you take in college. Hell you might take biochem right after it. Biochem uses cellular and molecular biology. A class you also take in college. Biochem uses physics, a class you take in college. I assume you see the trend here. You are now using 3\u20134 different concepts that you just learned a few months ago or a year or 2 ago. This isn\u2019t a course where you have been training or doing it for years (chem in high school won\u2019t help you at all, and most people don\u2019t even take physics in high school), it\u2019s a course where it assumes you\u2019ve completely understood the previous courses you\u2019ve recently taken, and now wants you to apply it. This is what makes biochem harder than other subjects. ",

So I\u2019m comparing to learning how to trade, computer programming, data science. It\u2019s very doable and I think easier than all the above. Ochem is just putting a puzzle together with memorized reactions. There will be a lot of memorization. Kreb cycle. Citric acid cycle. The math is not complicated at all. Frankly it\u2019s all about internalizing info and then fitting it together to come up with something cohesive. I guess one could say the same about the endeavors mentioned above, but all are less straightforward and more about adapting to the current circumstances and project, not as much information on these subjects (exception programming, where everything is known). Perhaps cutting edge biochemistry is a bit different, but then it really requires you know how different proteins and kinases operate, etc etc. A lot of memorization so you know the lay of the land and can make educated guesses about what research to conduct. If you\u2019re doing bench work as a technician. It\u2019s basically following a fancy cookbook recipe unless you\u2019re really doing cutting edge things\u2026and even that is just trial and error based on what has worked for other things in the past. Time consuming, yes. Particularly difficult, no IMHO. ",

            "answer_text": "BOTH At times, it is hard. Like mind frustrating, exasperating, angering, mind bogglingly and annoyingly hard. You will feel like to give up. Some nights, tons of coffee won\u2019t help you either. Remembering those amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, wont be easy at all. Confusion will be a constant partner. Trying to imagine those micro , nano substances will be hard. Coping with the pressure of all those things will be difficult. Teachers wont always explain you in detail. Searching 3\u20134 huge books and sometimes even more will be time consuming as well as tiring. But at the end of the day(or night) , being able to solve that single question, understanding the entire topic and being able to connect all those small things ,will be worth it. Yes biochemistry is a practical subject, it will demand a lot of your time in its practicals but to be able to do practicals you need the knowledge , you need to study. Personally, for me biochemistry is like a mystery, u solve one and it gives you a clue for the next. Even though it is hard at times, it will never be boring. If you put your effort,it will be hard in the starting but latter on , it pays, it will be easy.!! ",

            "answer_text": "It is not hard. Same difficulty as general biology. Often it is more interesting to the student than chemistry (more biology, which is familiar and observable) but more sophisticated than intro biology. If you passed biology and chemistry you can pass fundamentals of biochemistry (biochemistry 101). Anyone can if told the facts. Same amount of info as biology\u2026. If you bombed organic chemistry totally or haven\u2019t taken it that will not hinder you in biochemistry one bit. Most biochemists don\u2019t understand organic chemistry at all. It\u2019s not necessary. You do not run biochemistry reactions. Only the body can do that. You measure but don\u2019t manipulate things much, you separate things but only to know mass\u2026not to move it forward. \u2026you hope that your research is practical. You never know. It takes a life of work to maybe discover something useful in biochemistry. In chemistry, it happens in months. The work is tougher, more mentally challenging and way more fun. I learned it in reverse as it was my major. Knowing functional group name made no difference. Just understand polarity. ",

            "answer_text": "How difficult your study of biochemistry will turn out depends on the following factors. Do you know and understand organic chemistry well?Which textbook do you choose?Does the teacher force you to memorize the long chains of reactions?Regarding the tutorial, I highly recommend the book by Jeremy M. Berg and John L. Tymoczko. You can use their short or full course. Stay away from the Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. In organic chemistry, the best textbook is currently the manual by David R. Klein. In my opinion, this book is fascinating, and not just detailed. If you master its material, you will become a life sciences superstar. Unfortunately, you cannot influence your biochemistry teacher\u2019s approach to presenting material and evaluating student performance. The curriculum of the biochemistry and molecular biology courses overlap to a large extent. After passing biochemistry, it will be much easier for you in subsequent years of study. ",

If you're referring to how hard biochem is as a subject to pass, it really isn't that hard as long as you have the drive to read. However, if you're referring to how hard it is as a scientific field (research), the difficulty stems from the fact that biochemical systems are mind-bogglingly complex. There are simply too many variables that need to be controlled. Biochemical systems are chaotic such that a small change in your starting conditions can yield to massive deviations over time. ",

Very mysterious, looks crazy, like get-outta-here kind of amusement!! But slowly and carefully when you unravel the mystery step by step\u2026 it all comes together like a beautiful story. You have clarity about what exactly happens within you. It is still so magical that our body has the capacity to do all of those things at such a miniscule level, so well managed and economical\u2026!! You will know what I mean when you get into the subject. So\u2026 BIOCHEMISTRY is not a subject, it's a treasure map! Go explore and have fun doing so! ",

I would say a strong grounding in general and organic chemistry is essential, and some introductory molecular biology is helpful.  Biochemistry seems overwhelmingly complicated at the begining, but later on in your studies, the interlinking of various metabolic pathways makes the overall picture emerge.  It's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, you need quite a few pieces in place before the overall picture is seen, and then the details are a lot easier to navigate. ",

Compared to any non- science major it is hard - as are all science and math degrees. Compared to other science degrees it will depend on your own abilities and interests. If you are excellent in math you might want to try physics. This not to say that math is unimportant but that the field is less math intensive than physics or engineering. However, compared to zoology there is a lot of math involved. Keep in mind the chemistry aspect. Lastly, it is a complex field and will absorb whatever degree of effort you apply to it. ",

There are concepts that may be difficult for some to learn, and these are different for different people. For example, I have a very good friend that though physical chemistry was easy and it was very difficult for me, but he had lots of issues with biochemistry. ",
