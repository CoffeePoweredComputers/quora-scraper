            "answer_text": "You must define your terms before such a comparison is possible. Do you mean by \u201cGod\u201d the God of Abraham? History is replete with thousands of gods. You cannot assume we all have the same definition, and I would submit that even within the same religion no two adherents have exactly the same concept of their shared god. Is this god omnipotent, eternal, all-knowing, creator of all, compassionate, and involved with individual destinies? Does he promise eternal salvation? Does he punish sinners? Maybe your god never interferes and only had sway in the distant past. Let us know and we\u2019ll talk. If by nature you mean the \u201cnatural order of reality\u201d or the rules governing the physical world around us, you will find that many peoples have equated \u201cmother nature\u201d with a god as the initial originator and rule-setter of all we perceive. Most define nature merely as the \u201cway things are\u201d; there is no why or cause, it simply is. What do you mean? Fundamentally, however, one must decide whether either term connotes some level of purpose. Here in lies the modern distinction. Nature, as defined by scientific evidence, has direction and rules of behavior that we can readily observe and predict; but, it has no purpose. Gods usually have a purpose in mind when they act to interference in human affairs or in the \u201cnormal\u201d processes we observe. Again, you need to be more specific before we can fully engage.

            "answer_text": "If you ask people to define what they mean by \u201cgod,\u201d some will equate such a thing to nature. If you keep asking, you will find that almost everyone has a different answer. Some will give pat answers like \u201cI believe in the god of the Bible.\u201d If you press and ask for specifics, those who do not have them will cut off the discussion. Those that do have them will provide specifics that are different from those of other people. I suspect that everyone\u2019s definition of god is like a golf swing: everyone is different \u2026 which tells you a lot about gods and religion, most of it is made up in your own imagination. ",
