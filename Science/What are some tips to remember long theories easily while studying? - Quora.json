            "answer_text": "Revising matters , a study states that when you revise what u read for the first time within next 24 hours , that is going to stay longer, else it might be volatile.Even when you read for the first time ,try to conceptualize , or better imagine what you read . That improves perfect understanding and even will make you self realize, when u lack a logic in the imagination(that might lead to recalling).so read-conceptualize-revise. That formula works out for me. u may try it too! ",

            "answer_text": "Read the theory once and try to explain it to yourself,  write down what you understood from the first reading (in bullet points) . Now, do the second reading carefully and cross check with what you had understood from the first reading referring to your bullet points. Make the necessary changes after your second reading.  Repeat the steps till you feel confident enough to write all the points correctly without needing to refer the theory.  Divide and conquer. ",
