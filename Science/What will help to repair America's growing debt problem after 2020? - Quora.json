            "answer_text": "Nothing. Nothing can stop the growing debt problem faced by the U.S. or, for that matter, that of almost every other country in the world. Most people blame the debt problem on temporal issues like the COVID pandemic and the trillions that our politicians have shoveled out to help stem its economic effects. While that has perhaps worked, and will likely ebb post-pandemic (whenever that comes), our towering deficits will remain. Those deficits are built into our modern political system. They are a function of promises needed to propel progressive campaigns in our democracies, including promises of consumption support made decades ago, primarily for Social Security and Medicare. These two programs alone cost about three quarters of a trillion dollars per year, outspending everything else we think of as the federal government. So, tax the \u201crich,\u201d right? I see a lot of that, including in the list of responses below. But even if our \u201crich\u201d were forced to liquidate their holdings and hand it over to Congress, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay for even several months of those programs, let alone for all the others envisioned by the far left in their unicorn plans. But those plans, and the need for their political opponents to at least somewhat keep up with those irresponsible promises, will prevent anything resembling the fiscal sanity needed to bring our deficits under control. Even they start to do so, it\u2019s probably too late. The liabilities for our existing programs are greater than the total net worth of the United States, including every share of stock owned by every billionaire. For those of you not financially savvy enoughbto understand what that means, I will quote one of my favorite movie villains: \u201cIt means you\u2019re broke. You just haven\u2019t run out of cash.\u201d And for the MMT loons who believe that the U.S. can simply print as much as it wants (or even better, just add zeroes to electronic accounts created out of thin air!), I have no answer except to say that magical thinking will not save us. The governments of our most liberal states, like California, New York, and Illinois, are all facing down the threat of bankruptcy. They are counting on the Federal government to bail them out. That\u2019s why Nancy Pelosi is holding up massive additional aid against the effects of COVID. She wants to bail out her state. CNN and the NYT unsurprisingly seem to overlook any mention of that particular sticking point, but that\u2019s all of the reason for the hold up. But to the extent the Democrats succeed in saving their states, and pushing for the same policies at the federal level that have gotten their states into so much trouble, they are simply hastening the day that the U.S. hits the same wall. Except no one can bail out the U.S., even if we were willing to sell our sovereignty to do so, which is what overly indebted nations have had to do in the past. And I don\u2019t want to imply that Republicans can save us. Republicans in power have proven to be just as fiscally irresponsible, just with regards to other priorities, and at not as much of a breakneck pace (aside from the temporal problems they had to face, and with full support of the Democrats). The only consolation may be that it\u2019s not just us. Every major country in the world has fallen into the debt trap. They have had to in order to compete. No one will be spared. Not the EU. Not Japan. Not China. \u201cEurope makes universal health care work!\u201d Europe is even more f*cked than our Democratic states. Your family may have that crazy uncle who spends profligately on himself and his family and friends, mindlessly blowing his credit card limits, then cashing in on his home equity to desperately make the payments. We all see the crash coming like a slow motion train wreck, and warn him of the impending doom if he doesn\u2019t reform his spendthrift ways. And at some point, when he realizes it\u2019s too far gone, he says, \u201cwhat difference does it make at this point. Might as well enjoy myself while I can.\u201d The day of reckoning always comes. I\u2019m watching it now with my Uncle Sam. ",

            "answer_text": "The Democrats will do it. AGAIN.I think the first time it happened was after the Panic of 1887 Clinton\u2019s policies were on track to clean up the debt problem created by Reagan and Bush I, until Bush II returned what he called \u201ca surplus\u201d in what amounted to a bribe of taxpayers, cut taxes for \u201cThe 1%\u201d (again) and started two elective wars \u201coff-budget,\u201d run the economy into the ground, destroyed tens of millions of US jobs, and ballooned the National Debt. Then Obama was elected and got the economy going and creating jobs again. That began reducing year on year deficits. The situation Obama inherited was so bad that he only able to reduce the rate at which the National Debt was increasing, but had the next President not cut taxes for \u201cThe 1%\u201d AGAIN, chances are that the National Debt would have started to decline. Instead yet another Republican President has made another huge mess of the US Economy and has yet again ballooned the National Debt. As the Republicans continue to run up the National Debt by cutting the taxes of their political patrons, increasing military spending (for the further benefit of their political patrons), and making the majority of Americans poorer, each recovery is harder than the last. Perhaps the next Democratic administration will be able to stop the economic bleeding, but the American public is going to have to learn and accept that tax cuts have literally NEVER paid for themselves. That \u201cThe 1%\u201d are not the \u201cjob creators.\u201d And that keeping 50% of the US population too poor to pay taxes DESTROYS the US Economy and the American Dream.

            "answer_text": " President Trump: Tariffs on foreign steel saves American Jobs. One thing remains consistent in this current economic environment: \u201cAmerica continues to spend more than it receives in revenues,\u201d and this has been the case since 2016. [1] Add the Federal Government\u2019s borrowing of more money to pay its bills to the equation, and we arrive at a situation where less capital is available for the private sector. [2] I\u2019m no economist but if government does not collect more than it spends, it will be next to impossible to reduce the annual deficit. The Federal government never spends less than it collects. [3] Thus, cutting the purse strings of the Federal government would be another viable solution to decreasing the deficit. In 2015 the Federal government collected $3.5 trillion in taxes, 60% of which from income taxes, yet spent $3.69 trillion, creating a $439 billion deficit adding to the federal debt. [4] President Donald J Trump, though disliked by many, is a business man who is in tune with the economic atmosphere in America. His strategies thus far, has involved the renegotiation of several trade agreements that has the potential to reduce the U.S. deficit. In short, thanks to Democrat government, the U.S. deficit is a growing behemoth that can only be resolved by smart conservative government. In my opinion, Donald Trump has the solutions to resolve America\u2019s growing debt problem beyond 2020. If only, people could look beyond the deceptive Democrat anti-American narrative that now seeks to weaponize the CCP virus as a political tool and support President Trump\u2019s America First Agenda; voters would join forces at the ballot to combat the growing deficit by voting for 4 more years of President Donald J.

            "answer_text": "What will help to repair America's growing debt problem after 2020? Bankruptcy comes to mind. Starting a few new wars around the world, especially the ones we owe money too. Elect a Democrat President, Senate and House of Representatives and pack the Supreme Court with 13 liberal Leftist Marxist Justices. Make Washington DC and Puerto Rico a State and add 4 new Senators all being Democrats. Do away with Electoral College so three or four states determine who the President should be. Adopt the Green New Deal add everyone to Medicare. Eliminate 170 million people from their employer based healthcare that unions worked years to get included in their bargaining contracts. Double Digit inflation like under Jimmy Carter also paid down national debt with devalued currency that wasn\u2019t worth much more than funny money would do it. Turn on the Printing Presses and call it Quantitative Easing and print so much money that green stamps would have more value like Obama did. Don\u2019t forget to have the Senate do away with Filibuster and making 60 Senators pass anything and reduce that to 51 after you add 2 new states and 4 Democrat Senators. If you can\u2019t beat them at the polls, stuff the ballet boxes. The Simple answer is to elect all Democrats, do away with the two party system and turn America into a Third World Country and not pay any of the Debt back. In other words, destroy America, pay back trillions upon trillions in reparations to those we have wronged in the past and put everyone on Medicare, Food Stamps and UN-employment. That should do it. Let\u2019s not forget to knock down a few statues of our founding fathers, burn down a few cities like Portland and Seattle. Don\u2019t forget to defund the police so no one is safe in America, only the looters and rioters will have rights. Have the crime rate go into the stratosphere in predominately ran Democrat Cities like Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis and throw a few other cities in there for good measure. Don\u2019t forget to take a knee every time you see the flag or a Military Hero in Uniform (might want to be careful with that one, they may send you into the Twilight Zone) and make sure you disrespect those who gave their life defending our Constitution, the American way of life and law abiding citizens. Make sure you take away free speech from our colleges and universities where only the left can say their point of view. Be sure only Marxist and Communist manifestos are taught in our universities. We wouldn\u2019t want college graduates to graduate with free thinking ideas. Censorship should be the norm on all your cable networks like NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN and the press like the New York Times and the Washington Post. Don\u2019t believe anything you read in the New York Post even though it was started by Alexander Hamilton. That about does it. Don\u2019t forget to vote Democrat on all the down tickets so we can be sure to have this list in our everyday lives. Vote. Your country depends on it. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to repair America\u2019s growing debt problem, it is first necessary to understand where that debt problem comes from. Basically, our government borrows these enormous amounts of money that make up our multi-trillion dollar national debt, to hide from the public, the liability of economic policies designed to benefit our small, wealthy class, at the expense of our Working Class. So for example, when we enact tax cuts for the rich in the idiotic expectation that doing so will cause economic expansion and job creation, the deficit those tax cuts create is borrowed. If the government didn\u2019t borrow the money necessary to cover the deficit created by the tax cuts, the public would eventually understand that tax cuts for the rich not only don\u2019t produce the promised economic expansion and job creation, they actually hurt the vast majority of our Working Class citizens who realize absolutely no benefit from the cuts. The same is true regarding the funding for our perpetual state of warfare. Unlike previous generations where, if the US was involved in a war, taxes were increased and the public was compelled to pay as we go for them, our current policy is to simply put the cost of our wars on the National credit card, and pay for them from the future earnings of our Working Class. The reason we do this is because if our citizens were taxed directly to pay for our wars, eventually the citizens would demand an end to them. So to repair America\u2019s growing debt problem, we have to address the economic policies that are the cause of that enormous debt. Instead of borrowing to cover the deficits caused by tax cuts for the rich, we need to be honest with our citizens, by increasing taxes on those Working Class folks who do not benefit from the tax cuts. If the public understood that tax cuts in the present for the rich will be paid for in the future by the Working Class, we would put a stop to that policy right away. Same for our constant state of warfare. If our citizens were taxed directly to pay for the continued military involvement all over the world and especially in the Mideastern oil countries, we would put a stop to these conflicts. Almost all of our National Debt derives from tax cuts for the rich and expensive wars for control over the oil reserves in someone else\u2019s country. Once we understand this, we would immediately stop financing tax cuts and wars by borrowing. And when we do that, we would realize that since the rich were the only beneficiaries of the tax cuts and the oil wars, they should pay for those obligations themselves, which would lead to significant increases in taxation of their accumulated wealth. That would solve the problem altogether. ",

In fact, for the government to balance the budget, it has to reduce spending by half and get down to the levels (as % of GDP) of the 1950s. But it can\u2019t, because most of the government budget is mandatory spending (required by law) and are projected to grow to 17% of GDP by 2040.

With that said, a lot of the 1 trillion in federal deficit is healthcare related via Medicare, Medicaid, VA and etc. Currently, Medicare is forbidden to negotiate down drug prices. With single payer, Medicare becomes the only buyer. With an economy of scale, the US can get the best deal for drugs and medical equipments. Also, single payer would reduce hundreds of billions of wasteful spending on administrative cost. In the short run, the US can save 700 billion on healthcare cost, that would tremendously reduce deficit spending. States would also be in much better fiscal conditions because Medicaid takes up a lot of states budget. ",

I think we could hack it in half and not have any significant degredation of our national defense or security postures. Step 2 would be to rewrite the tax code - taxing the ever-loving shit out of businesses that fail to invest in research, development and their employees (i.e., highly taxing capital gains and dividends, and encouraging economic growth through tax breaks geared toward increased employment and wage hikes), and reversing all the tax breaks we\u2019ve given the rich dating back the past four decades. If we taxed in 2020 the way we did in 1955, we wouldn\u2019t have an annual deficit approaching $3,800,000,000,000 - we\u2019d have a surplus.

While this may not be good for mid term elections Trump has little allegiance to the Republican party and absolutely none to the Democrats. It could be painful and it will be up to private industry to take up the slack of a smaller government. If Joe Biden becomes our next president the spending will continue in earnest and our credit rating will either be damaged beyond repair or taxes will be raised exponentially. Biden has already promised to raise taxes \u201con day one\" which might help the deficit unless his spending is more than his tax increases. But regardless of who becomes the next president it's likely the national debt will have to be addressed in the next four years. If not inflation and interest rates will quickly go into hyper mode.
