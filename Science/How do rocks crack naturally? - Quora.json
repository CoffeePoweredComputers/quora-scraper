            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways this happens. A common process is that rocks crack as they get exhumed, which is to say when they get closer to the surface as erosion occurs at the surface. The release of pressure causes the rocks to expand slightly and this can cause them to crack. Weathering processes can also crack rocks, particularly frost wedging (common in mountainous areas) and the diurnal heating and cooling of a rock outer layer in hot arid environments. Tree roots will also do the trick. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what the rock is. Rocks like granite that form miles underground are under greater pressure than rocks that form near or on the surface. When granite makes its way to the surface, it isn\u2019t under as much pressure, so it cracks and begins to expand, the process being called exfoliation. Also, within the beginnings of such cracks, if water were to make it\u2019s way in, then freezes, formed ice expands, thus widening any cracks, which is called ice wedging. Wind, heat, and chemical weathering can also help in the development of cracks. ",

            "answer_text": "The most common route is by the action of water and temperature change. Rainwater seeps into faults or cracks in the rock. If that happens and the temperature then drops below freezing, the water turns to ice and expands, forcing the cracks to widen. ",
