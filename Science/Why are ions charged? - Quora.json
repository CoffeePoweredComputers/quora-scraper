            "answer_text": "Since ions are formed by pulling out of electrons or adding up electrons to the radicle thus carrying either positive or negative electromotive forces on these ions. So sodium has eleven electrons and outer shell has eight. If one electron is taken out then only ten electrons are present in that Na+ ion. Likewise the negative elements add one electron to become (-)ive ions. ",
