            "answer_text": "Actually, we don't see water directly. Water is denser than air, so it refracts and reflects light. It also allows certain solids to float on it or become suspended in it. This is what we see. Reflections on the surface. Distorted images below the surface and things floating on and in the water. We don't see the water itself. Because water is colorless. Some might argue that water does have color. That like air, it scattered light, which gives it a blue tint. But answer this, if a mirror reflects the image of a red balloon, is the mirror red? Or are we seeing the balloon? Water and air has a blue tint, because it reflects the sun. Am I crazy for seeing reality this way? Does anyone else? ",

            "answer_text": "Water is colorless because we originally evolved eyes in water, so they are fundamentally adapted to a range of wavelengths which penetrate water. Our eyes contain a lot of water which we look through. (Insects on land have developed a wider range.) Thus we can see liquid water if: (a) it has something in it - color, mud, plants, which is the case with most natural bodies of waters. (b) there is an interface with air. There is reflection and refraction from light coming at an angle to our eyes because of the different properties of the two mediums. Even looking straight down onto a perfectly still surface this effect is just perceptible because of the angular width of our vision. ",
