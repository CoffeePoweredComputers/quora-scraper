            "answer_text": "I tend to not worry about sickness until I am sick. Even when others around me have had colds, I always remain in a positive state and talk to the cells in my body. Sometimes I catch disease off others and it only lasts a day or two. When I was young I believed what the doctors told me and at the end of last century my doctor was working very hard to give me cancer. He nearly had me, until one day I saw him checking the oil in his very expensive car. He used the same compassion and precision as he did when he cut bits off me, except he had a deep love for his car. I met a young indigenous man a couple of months later who introduced me to the Rainbow Serpent and I cured myself. There was no money transaction, only unconditional love and his self-respect. When I first heard about the virus, it was just another \u201cKung Flu\u201d. We have had a few of them. I then heard from a person who has given out valid secret information over the years. He has connections and if he is given the green light then he makes a video. He said that COVID-19 was a man made bio-weapon that had not yet become as deadly as it could be. A vial was smuggled out of the bio-lab in Wuhan to be sold on the black market. Something went wrong, shots were fired and the vial got broken in the open market. I knew in the beginning it was highly contagious and had a low level of deadliness. It has proven to be less deadly than many of the common flues. The man made shape is the same as human exosomes which is why it is so efficient at being contagious. 5G and Elon Musk\u2019s satellite network are also part of the plan to cull 95% of humanity. We can help ourselves against both the 5G microwave radiation and \u201cKung Flu\u201d by raising our own vibrations into a higher consciousness. It is not just mind over matter, it is using our own electromagnetics powered by the intelligent energy of our emotions. The radiated electromagnetic spectrum that Musk and his fellow scientists and biologists are working from is only a small band of electromagnetic energy that works in waves at the surface level of consciousness. Beneath the surface is the infinite shapes and geometries of electromagnetic emotional energy units (EE\u2019s) that move in space and not through it. Radiated electronics are based on negative electrons that repel each other, whereas like EE\u2019s are attracted to like EE\u2019s and can vary in size. We can imagine a golden sphere as our armour and charge it in a positive way with our own unique consciousness and EE\u2019s. This is what happens in a football stadium when a crowds emotions all work together. The atmosphere gets electrically charged and it can be easily felt. I am Australian and I support my prime minister as he is in a very difficult position but supports president Trump. I respect both leaders as they deal with Communist China and the Triad\u2019s who may be in control. I don\u2019t know. I do know that there are different dragon families involved at the top echelons of power who want control of the whole planet and it is the free countries led by Trump and supported by Putin that will eventually win out. I was not aware of this at the beginning of \u201cKung Flu\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks Rodney for asking. Initially my perception was that it is a pandemic no doubt (when President Trump declared it as a pandemic), but will not last long. The basic perception was about vaccine preparation. Also, it appeared a virus in lab that went berserk and spread (there were many theories about Wuhan-related spread). Then there was hue and cry that pilgrims were allowed to enter from Iran into Pakistan. That was the point when I started sniffing the trouble. I started reading about Spanish flu and the casualties. Worldometer has been providing country-wise detail (again the figures have been a debatable issue). Then clips on WhatsApp and social media started appearing about masking other deaths and enhancing death numbers under coronavirus. Again that raised eyebrows about authenticity of data. Then there were political problems and blame game started after German minister committed suicide. THAT WAS SOMETHING ALARMING. Italians were seen struggling and Spanish people followed with huge numbers. In the meantime Chinese managed to cap their deaths and fresh cases. Lockdowns played a big role in impacting economy adversely all over the globe. All this has its weight. Now I am afraid that this pandemic is going to last for another year may be more. I do not know but even if the numbers fail to depict exact dimension of catastrophe, we can label the problem as \u2018very serious\u2019. Thanks for reading the above. ",

            "answer_text": "At first, I considered it to be a novel virus, but similar to other diseases, where a person is contagious after the disease becomes spread throughout a person\u2019s body to be obvious both to the person and to others. After all, we humans have a long history of being able to see the disease process at work, and we have learned to avoid contact and proximity to diseased people, in order to remain safe. I was wrong as wrong can be. Covid-19 is apparently highly contagious, when no symptoms are apparent in an infected person. Thus, all our experience has not prepared us to deal with this pandemic, and we need to behave differently than we are accustomed to behaving \u2014 if we are to manage the spread of the disease. So, yes my idea has changed. What I find insane is that so many people ignore this reality. This is a great social problem. I\u2019ll leave it there, otherwise I will begin a toxic socio-political rant. ",

The President of the USA didn\u2019t think it was a problem. People were dying daily & it\u2019s so problem for him. He did one good thing. He dedicated billions of dollars for research for a vaccine. He continues to hold rallies without a mask & most attendees don\u2019t wear masks or social distance. The virus can enter your body by breathing,ears,& eyes. Spittle can go 20 feet when you cough or sneeze. Be prudent & take precautions. ",
