            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start by realizing that ants are arguably the most successful animals on Earth, since their total biomass exceeds that of anything else. That being the case, I hope you don\u2019t want to totally eliminate them, even from a fairly small property, as that would be doubtful even if you were to apply a lot of chemicals. The next issue is the term natural. There is no universal agreed upon definition. With all of that in mind, try boiling water poured slowly into the mound. This works better at night, since most ant species are inactive then, meaning most of the colony members are in the nest. If it is a well established nest, the queen may be too deep to be reached by the water, in which case the colony will not be eliminated. In addition, invasive fire ants (but not the native ones) may have so called super colonies which cover acres and have multiple queens. In my area, we do have two species of anteaters. We call them horned lizards. I have also observed my chickens eating ants now and then, but only the larger species. So, the short answer is that there really aren\u2019t any truly effective natural options. Sorry. ",

They\u2019re too generalist and numerous for that to be practical (and safe, most likely.) There is one way to \u201caddress\u201d ants: move to where they aren\u2019t! This gives you several fairly nice locales to check out. Of course, you won\u2019t be going to a Tuvalu or Venice. These are known for there much milder summers. Even better, there\u2019s a short list! Your three options are: Greenland. I sure hope you can speak Greenlandic. You\u2019ll need it!Iceland. The land of fjords, volcanoes, fairies and people that speak like Vikings.[1]Antarctica. Like science? Penguins? This place might be for you! It gets a bit chilly in the winter, though.Honestly, though, you can\u2019t get much cooler than a place without ants, right? Better being a jacket.

We may try the neem bush and it can be used directly or you may boil it and throw it on the ants nests. You can also use the sap from the tree bark and make it into a paste and this can trap ants, Hope this will helpyou ",
