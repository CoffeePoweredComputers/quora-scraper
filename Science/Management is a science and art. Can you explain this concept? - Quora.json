            "answer_text": "Saying something is a science is a short hand way of saying that there is one right way of doing it. If you learn that right way, and you have all the information you need, you can execute the tasks flawlessly. And your perfect execution will be the same as anyone else\u2019s. There is only one right way to solve a quadratic equation and anyone who is given the same quadratic equation and who applies the correct method will come up with the same answer. Saying something is an art is a short hand way of saying that there is a lot of personal judgement involved and that there is not necessarily one right way of doing it. Copying what someone else has done might not work for your for a variety of reasons. Given a specific book, two different designers may create two very different covers, either of which might be highly successful. Most things are in some way a science and in some way an art. There are basic principles of management which new managers would do well to learn, which may be very helpful in normal circumstances. But some managers have been very successful because they have used their personal judgement to do things very differently, perhaps because their organisation is highly unusual, or because they are living through unusual times - or just because they want to try something new. Of course, some of those mavericks fail, just as some people who stick to closely to last year\u2019s rule book fail. Nothing is guaranteed. ",

            "answer_text": "I think saying anything is both a science and an art is a means of expressing how the activity requires analytical and empirical skills (science) but also imagination and intuition. For instance\u2014a manager must know how to organize a work flow, must be able to organize, articulate and oversee projects, must understand budgets, hire staff and so on. That\u2019s the science of management. But those tasks also require empathy, imagination, insight. Or they should. Hiring new staff doesn\u2019t must mean reading through resumes and selecting the person with the most exceptional qualifications; it also means deciding which applicant will fit into the team, bring additional skills to the task, contribute to a positive and productive environment. That\u2019s an art. Even recognizing who should take on which project requires knowing more than who\u2019s got seniority or whatever. Or these arts of human understanding OUGHT to be a part of the science of management, I have said many times before that we spend too much time separating math and science from the arts and humanities, the left side of the brain from the right side, the analytical from the creative and imaginative. All these thing work in concert. No one has half a brain. Few successful people in the sciences, engineering, business and math don\u2019t also embrace the arts in some way. Nearly every great artist has also been engaged with STEM. ",
