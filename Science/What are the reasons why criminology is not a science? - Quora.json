            "answer_text": "A2A Copied and pasted from another answer: It\u2019s not a hard science such as chemistry, biology or physics. Many find it confusing because by definition, it\u2019s the scientific study of crime, however it\u2019s really a social science that falls under sociology, so that\u2019s where it differs from forensics, which is science as it applies to the law. Criminology studies the cause and effect of crime and its impact on society. It utilizes studies to analyze trends and various factors in order to learn about what makes offenders commit their crimes, ways to predict criminal behavior, and punishment, and how to deter it based on statistics and the criminal history of those already found, tried, and convicted. Just as in forensics, although in a different manner, it\u2019s an interdisciplinary approach, and overlaps some with other disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, and biology.  ",
