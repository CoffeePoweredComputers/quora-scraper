            "answer_text": "Valuation was a lot easier before we became a speculator-culture.  Back then, the value of a company was its net yearly income.  Shareholders received a portion of the profits according to their stock ownership.  This payment was called a dividend.   The theoretical value of a share of stock was the total of all dividends that would be paid out over the life of the company.  In this regard stocks and bonds were quite similar in that they acted much like annuities. This required predicting the future in terms of likely dividend and likely life of the company, but it was at least a bounded sort of prediction problem. Today, very few stocks pay any dividends.  Instead, the stock market acts much like any other market for collectibles in that what a share of stock is worth is only based on what someone else will pay for it.  People buy shares in the hopes that someone else will pay more for it later.   This is called speculating, which is a polite word for gambling.   The current value of a stock is based not on what it is producing today but what people hope it will produce in the future. We say that in business, the seersucker principle always applies...\"In any group of ten people there will be at least 2 who are willing to claim to be seers and 5 suckers willing to listen to them.\" No one can predict the future.  When it comes to human opinions, or \"sentiment\" as the market experts put it, even trends don't tend to mean much. The thing to remember is that a company has a value at any given point in time based on all the cash and assets it holds at that moment minus any debts and obligations it has.  Any valuation above that is a guess at the future.  This is generally referred to as a valuation being \"x times earnings.\"  The bigger X is, the less likely it is to be an accurate prediction. ",
