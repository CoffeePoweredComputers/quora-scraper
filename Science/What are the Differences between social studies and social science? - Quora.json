            "answer_text": "The social sciences are scientific disciplines that whose subject matter involves human beings and human activity. Often denigrated by the natural sciences (especially physics and chemistry) as the social sciences have yet to develop \u201claw-like\u201d theoretical models. Of course, our subjects are more difficult: the speed of light does not change because the photons are in a good mood, nor do chemical reactions fail to occur because the molecules are depressed. The social sciences are: Anthropology, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology. Additional social sciences, depending on how the discipline is practiced, are History and Geography. The other social science \u2014 one that is held in high esteem \u2014 is economics; unfortunately this is the least scientific of the social sciences and the only science that I know of that regularly discards data when it does not support established theory (every other science keeps the data and begins to question the established theory). Social Studies (like Cultural Studies) is a melange drawn from the social sciences and the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Religious Studies, etc.) that has more of a Humanities emphasis. The discipline of Social Studies may examine similar topic areas to, say Sociology, but the approach will be more philosophical than it is scientific. ",

It's the science of the society; the in depth knowledge and systematic study of each branch of social transaction. It is empirical and based on various scientific methods of deduction to arrive at a conclusion based on facts. Let's say, if you are studying economics under social sciences you will need to concentrate on the production and distribution part of the social transaction. Social sciences are taught under a higher studies curriculum whereas, social studies is school based subject. ",
