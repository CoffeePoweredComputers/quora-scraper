            "answer_text": "There is a difference. Hydrogen peroxide solutions are not stable and decompose to water and oxygen. To help stabilize the hydrogen peroxide solution, stabilizers are often added (e.g., acetanilide). For many uses such as an antibacterial (typically 3%) or as a bleaching agent (6\u201310%), the stabilizers do not cause any problems. However, some foods are treated with hydrogen peroxide and when used for this purpose, the stabilizers cannot be added (e.g., acetanilide has some liver toxicity associated with it and may be left on the food). So, the difference is that food grade does not contain any stabilizers, \u2018regular\u2019 hydrogen peroxide probably does contain a stabilizer. ",

            "answer_text": "Not much if any other than the food grade label means it's purity has been certified to at least the required amount. This means the Food grade label will usually cost more. I do know the price difference is not a great deal and I would just pay it if my intended use was going to be ingesting it. If you are thinking about trying this as oxygen therapy you should know that one bottle will be way more than enough to reach your tolerance level of being able to continue taking it. I would recommend you search Amazon(Dot)com using \u201coxygen therapy\u201d or \u201cliquid oxygen\u201d which will bring up a list of much better products that you will be able to stomach for as long as you want.
