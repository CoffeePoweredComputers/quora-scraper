            "answer_text": "If we heat ice then it melts. If we heat liquid water then it evaporates. It changes its phase from solid to liquid to vapor or gas. Ice can change into vapor directly by sublimation. If we cool it then its phases change in the reverse direction. Pressure affects the transition points. If we ionize gas by heating it or subjecting it to a strong electric field than it will convert into plasma. The gas pressure is relevant here too. I said \u2018ice\u2019 and \u2018water\u2019 above but this same happens with most of other substances. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three main factors, namely temperature, density and pressure. An extreme example is formation of the quark gluon plasma which requires extreme temperature of trillions degrees and density of nuclear matter for conversion of hadronic matter into the quark gluon plasma, which was the state of our universe just few microseconds after the Big Bang.
