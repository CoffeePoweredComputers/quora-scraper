            "answer_text": "There are LOTS of myths about lightning. Following are some of the more popular myths (from the US National Weather Service): Myth: If you're caught outside during a thunderstorm, you should crouch down to reduce your risk of being struck. Fact: Crouching doesn't make you any safer outdoors. Run to a substantial building or hard topped vehicle. If you are too far to run to one of these options, you have no good alternative. You are NOT safe anywhere outdoors. See our safety page for tips that may slightly reduce your risk. Myth: Lightning never strikes the same place twice. Fact: Lightning often strikes the same place repeatedly, especially if it's a tall, pointy, isolated object. The Empire State Building is hit an average of 23 times a year Myth: If it\u2019s not raining or there aren\u2019t clouds overhead, you\u2019re safe from lightning. Fact: Lightning often strikes more than three miles from the center of the thunderstorm, far outside the rain or thunderstorm cloud. \u201cBolts from the blue\u201d can strike 10-15 miles from the thunderstorm. Myth: Rubber tires on a car protect you from lightning by insulating you from the ground. Fact: Most cars are safe from lightning, but it is the metal roof and metal sides that protect you, NOT the rubber tires. Remember, convertibles, motorcycles, bicycles, open-shelled outdoor recreational vehicles and cars with fiberglass shells offer no protection from lightning. When lightning strikes a vehicle, it goes through the metal frame into the ground. Don't lean on doors during a thunderstorm. Myth: A lightning victim is electrified. If you touch them, you\u2019ll be electrocuted. Fact: The human body does not store electricity. It is perfectly safe to touch a lightning victim to give them first aid. This is the most chilling of lightning Myths. Imagine if someone died because people were afraid to give CPR! Myth: If outside in a thunderstorm, you should seek shelter under a tree to stay dry. Fact: Being underneath a tree is the second leading cause of lightning casualties. Better to get wet than fried! Myth: If you are in a house, you are 100% safe from lightning. Fact: A house is a safe place to be during a thunderstorm as long as you avoid anything that conducts electricity. This means staying off corded phones, electrical appliances, wires, TV cables, computers, plumbing, metal doors and windows. Windows are hazardous for two reasons: wind generated during a thunderstorm can blow objects into the window, breaking it and causing glass to shatter and second, in older homes, in rare instances, lightning can come in cracks in the sides of windows. Myth: If thunderstorms threaten while you are outside playing a game, it is okay to finish it before seeking shelter. Fact: Many lightning casualties occur because people do not seek shelter soon enough. No game is worth death or life-long injuries. Seek proper shelter immediately if you hear thunder. Adults are responsible for the safety of children. Myth: Structures with metal, or metal on the body (jewelry, cell phones,Mp3 players, watches, etc), attract lightning. Fact: Height, pointy shape, and isolation are the dominant factors controlling where a lightning bolt will strike. The presence of metal makes absolutely no difference on where lightning strikes. Mountains are made of stone but get struck by lightning many times a year. When lightning threatens, take proper protective action immediately by seeking a safe shelter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u2019t waste time removing metal. While metal does not attract lightning, it does conduct it so stay away from metal fences, railing, bleachers, etc. Myth: If trapped outside and lightning is about to strike, I should lie flat on the ground. Fact: Lying flat increases your chance of being affected by potentially deadly ground current. If you are caught outside in a thunderstorm, you keep moving toward a safe shelter. Myth: lightning flashes are 3-4 km apart Fact: Old data said successive flashes were on the order of 3-4 km apart. New data shows half the flashes are about 9 km apart. The National Severe Storms Laboratory report concludes: \"It appears the safety rules need to be modified to increase the distance from a previous flash which can be considered to be relatively safe, to at least 10 to 13 km (6 to 8 miles). In the past, 3 to 5 km (2-3 miles) was as used in lightning safety education.\" Source: Separation Between Successive Lightning Flashes in Different Storms Systems: 1998, Lopez & Holle, from Proceedings 1998 Intl Lightning Detection Conference, Tucson AZ, November 1998. Myth: A High Percentage of Lightning Flashes Are Forked. Fact: Many cloud-to-ground lightning flashes have forked or multiple attachment points to earth. Tests carried out in the US and Japan verify this finding in at least half of negative flashes and more than 70% of positive flashes. Many lightning detectors cannot acquire accurate information about these multiple ground lightning attachments.

Myth: Lightning Can Spread out Some 60 Feet After Striking Earth. Fact: Radial horizontal arcing has been measured at least 20 m. from the point where lightning hits ground. Depending on soils characteristics, safe conditions for people and equipment near lightning termination points (ground rods) may need to be re-evaluated.

            "answer_text": "If ten seconds pass between lightning and thunder, the thunderstorm is far away and therefore not dangerous. Wrong. If there are ten seconds between lightning and thunder, the storm is already relatively close. The formula to calculate the distance to the thunderstorm is: Counted seconds times 333 = distance of the thunderstorm in meters. In our example, this means that there are ten seconds between lightning and thunder. 10 x 333 = 3330 meters. So the thunderstorm is about 3.3 kilometers away. In addition, lightning does not have to strike a person directly to be a danger. Even if it strikes 30 meters further away, it is dangerous. This is because from the point of impact the voltage spreads in a circular pattern and can still hit people. In addition, it has been observed that lightning strikes five kilometers or more from its original cloud. If, on the other hand, no thunder can be heard at all, then the thunderstorm is indeed far away and not dangerous. It is best to go home quickly by bike or run. Wrong. Bicycles do not attract lightning, but if one strikes, the metal conducts electricity particularly well. This makes the bike a life-threatening hazard. It is therefore better to stop immediately in a thunderstorm, dismount and move at least three meters away from your bike. Running away from thunderstorms is also not a good idea. Because the so-called step voltage is also a danger to life. This means that when you take a step, there is a difference in voltage between your feet when you hit the ground in close proximity. Electricity flows. Even if it sounds silly: If there's a thunderstorm directly above you and there's a risk of lightning strike, it's better to jump out of the danger zone with your legs closed. You can open an umbrella without any problems. Wrong. Even if it rains, you'd better close your umbrella. Because most models contain metal. If you also use the umbrella to represent the highest point of an environment when you are outdoors, the risk of lightning striking directly into the umbrella increases. Then the flash goes from the hand via the arm directly into the heart. Lightning never strikes in the same place. Wrong. High and especially singly standing objects are particularly susceptible to lightning strikes. The Empire State Building in New York is very often struck by lightning. Up to 25 lightning strikes there every year. Thus, those who know a tall building or a tree that has been struck by lightning should better stay away from them during thunderstorms. During thunderstorms one should lie down flat on the ground. Wrong. Even though lightning usually picks the highest point to strike, this strategy is not the right one. When lying flat on your stomach, the current generated by a nearby lightning strike can flow through the body, from the head to the feet. ",
