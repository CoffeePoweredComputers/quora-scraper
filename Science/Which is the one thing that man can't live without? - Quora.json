            "answer_text": "Oxygen, Water, Food, Shelter. A human absolutely cannot live without these things. Of course you probably know that already. So here are a some more. Air pressure: humans require the pressure of the atmosphere to survive, the Armstrong limit is the altitude at which blood boils at body temperature due to the lack of external pressure, it\u2019s why astronauts wear space suits. Metals: Various metal ions serve an incredible number of function in our bodies, a well known one is Iron which forms a part of hemoglobin. Other lesser known ones are calcium which allows your muscles to move, sodium which helps in neural transmissions, and zinc. Human contact: Human are a social species and thus require social interaction, some more than others. The Effects of Isolation on a Child's Social Development as well as various papers on solitary confinement and mental health describes this phenomenon well. Gravity: Yep this seems like an odd one but humans evolved in Earth\u2019s gravity and require it (as far as we know) to maintain proper growth. Bones and muscles atrophy in zero G and this is the reason why NASA hasn\u2019t sent anyone to Mars yet. It would be very hard to survive without gravity. Immune System: Your immune system does a wonderful job of keeping you alive, it fights off all the microscopic invaders that try to eat you from the inside out. Gut bacteria: Yeah this is an odd one isn\u2019t it, but it\u2019s actually true, we all have colonies of E. coli bacteria in our guts and they help with digestion. Without them our immune systems would fail, we would have trouble digesting stuff and getting vitamins. ",

            "answer_text": "What are 3 things you can't live without? I could say oxygen, food, water and okay, those things are important. Necessary, in fact. But they kind of go, well, without saying. So my three essential things apart from those necessities are as follows: My laptop - I need this for work. It\u2019s absolutely necessary. It goes every where with me and once the lid is open, I\u2019m totally focused on what I\u2019m doing. I can\u2019t be distracted. Don\u2019t allow myself to be distracted. In fact, you could walk into the room butt-naked and bearing a bunch of long stem red roses and a box of the most expensive candy and it\u2019ll will have been a wasted effort on your part.My cell phone - COVID-19 has deemed it absolutely essential. Not only for work but to keep in contact with friends and family during Stage 4 lock-down. I need to be able to reach them - and possibly annoy them- at any time of the day and night. That\u2019s just how much I care about them all.My flat-iron & curling wand- I don\u2019t think this really needs much of an explanation. Most of my natural hair has gone due to chemo but the wigs I have still need styling and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m leaving the house for any reason whatsoever looking like I\u2019ve just rolled out of bed. I could be bleeding out, in dire need of resuscitation and close to flat-lining. But if I\u2019m going to check-out, I\u2019m going to be doing it looking good. Never mind vanity apparently being a sin. I\u2019m an atheist.",
