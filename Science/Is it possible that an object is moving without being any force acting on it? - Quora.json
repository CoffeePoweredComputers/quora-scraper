            "answer_text": "This is actually kind of a quirky question. Although you probably are thinking \"accelerating\" rather than \"moving\". For one, motion is always relative. There's no such thing as a fixed point in space, there's only a fixed point in space in relation to a planet, a star, or a galactic center. And then for each of these, there's two possible contexts, for example for a planet you can be motionless in relation to the planet surface, or you can be motionless in relation to the planet's orbital path around the Sun. So just the notion of whether an object is moving is vague and subjective. It could be said that there's no such thing as an object perfectly at rest. If an object is seemingly at rest outside our solar system, but is still within the Milky Way galaxy, it's still going to be in motion orbiting around the galactic center. We can consider an object seemingly sitting in space not moving, but what is it not moving in relation to? It's perhaps not moving with relation to one galaxy, but it would be moving in relation to any other galaxy. The object could be not moving in relation to your self, but then it should be obvious that you and the object are moving with respect to something in your surroundings. There isn't really a point of reference other than a galaxy (the galactic center) or any singular celestial object such as a spacecraft, star, moon, planet, or random comet/asteroid. We can talk about an object not moving within a laboratory environment, because it can be at rest on a table and we can see that it isn't moving. But technically it's still moving since we're on a planet surface and that surface is spinning with the planet, which at the equator would be a velocity of around 1000 mph. To go ahead and try to answer your question... Is it possible that an object is accelerating without any force acting on it? Force is really the only thing that can make an object move (i.e. accelerate). There isn't a cause of movement (acceleration) other than force, so the plain answer to your question really is this short. If an object is observed to accelerate in some direction (going into motion in a new direction) you can conclude that some kind of force acted upon that object. The other possibility, of course, is that the observer started moving and the observation is invalid... but we're more or less assuming a valid observation has been achieved and verified, if we're watching the object for movement. By the way, if you\u2019re interested in the forces required for celestial mechanics that causes entire planets, moons, and stars to follow orbital paths, and many other cosmic dynamics, then it\u2019s worth studying what I believe to be the true cause of gravity, which illuminates gravitational force as a result of the impartation of particle momentum from asymmetrical background permeative particle fields.

            "answer_text": "Yes. In fact this is normal. There is no frame of reference in which something is sitting still, but not described as moving when viewed from a different frame of reference. You have made a very simple misunderstanding. Force doesn't cause movement, per se. It causes a change in the current speed of movement. It causes acceleration. But perhaps you were asking this another way. If there is an object that is not moving, and then it is moving later, must a force have acted upon it? There is a case where no force acted on the object. That case is where the force acted on the observer and the observer's frame of reference is accelerating, not the object being observed. Consider: You are siting in a car and looking at a stop sign. The stop sign is fixed to the ground. Now, using only your eyes for observation, the sign (and the ground) all appear to be moving. -- But in fact, it is the car that started moving. The force acted on you, not the sign. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, no problem. If you accelerate then in your reference frame you are stationary but the object in question will accelerate (coordinate-wise) even though you will not be able to identify any real force acting on it. For example, when I sit still on the chair in the night and stare at the stars then they seem to run around me in the circular motion (and circular motion means centripetal acceleration) , even though there is no force to make them do so. That is what makes difference between inertial and non-inertial frames of reference. ",
