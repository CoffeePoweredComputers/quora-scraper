            "answer_text": "The transporter and replicator share some aspects of their technology, but they aren't the same kind of device. The transporter converts an actual object into a form which can be \u201cbeamed\" through space and reassembled, exactly as it was before beaming. This exact duplication is essential for things as complex as living beings, and many other kinds of complex matter. It has its quirks, some of which may work in individual stories, but are harder to fit into a single technical explanation. It can be used to \u201cedit\" the object sent. Rare malfunctions can create a duplicate, a reflected signal which is enhanced twice to allow both to create objects. Duplicates require the system to fill in the missing matter with stored reserves, and tends to result in one or both copies failing to be perfect. But even if they are both functional copies, it still requires an original object to allow a living creature to be duplicated. The replicator doesn't use an original object as its source. It instead uses a program to create objects from.stored materials, similar in concept to a current 3D printer. As such, it builds its objects out of pre-designed structures and molecules, and like most programmed devices, tends to duplicate structures repeatedly in order to make larger objects. The inherent resolution, especially for quantum states, is far less than the essentially perfect transporter. Replicators often operate at very low resolution and detail, when making objects which don't require fine structural components in order to work. For food, the replicator can run anything from simple protein and carbohydrate bars, to simulated cellular (dead) structures for better quality foods. The Federation disallows using it to create living beings. The basic design seems incapable of actually doing that anyway, because it lacks the ability to create the complex fine structures of living matter. But a medical replicator could use living cells as building materials, in order to construct artificial organs and other body parts for medical repairs. Doing so gets around the resolution limits, by making the raw materials by other means. Creating a larger, complex life form by this method would seem difficult. Like Frankenstein creating \u201clife\u201d from dead body parts, putting all the pieces together and making them work as intended would require very fine detail, control, timing, and energy in order to have the creation function as a living creature. Very simple life forms might be possible to create by this method. But what about the future, after Next Generation era? It is hard to say, since we've seen other species with more advanced technology do things which look miraculous even to Federation science. ",

            "answer_text": "It could be argued that the replicator actually DOES create life. The replicators are basically small transporters. The ship\u2019s main transporters scan an object or person to determine the exact composition and position of every particle in their body. Then, they disintegrate that person, and use raw matter from the surroundings at the destination to re-build that person or object again. Make no mistake - the person doesn\u2019t move. They die on the transporter pad, and an identical copy is made at the other side that is a living, breathing doppelganger who shares all the original\u2019s memories and emotions. It can (and does) also create clones this way. Cmdr. Riker had this happen to him on TNG, when a transporter accident created his clone Thomas Riker. Thomas was a separate individual with his own memories and life as soon as he stepped off that pad. He was identical to Will in every single way, but he was unquestionably alive and a new person. The replicator is just a transporter with a different function. It takes a \u2018gel\u2019 made of all the molecules you need to create something and transports it onto the replicator in the right combination to make a steak, or a cup of tea, or a screwdriver. It does this using in-built templates with all the information it needs on them. Given that it\u2019s just a mini-transporter, if you had the \u2018template\u2019 of a live mouse you could assemble and replicate infinite mice. You\u2019re only restricted by the size of the replicator. I assume that this is against Federation law, but it\u2019s definitely possible. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to start with the way I would do it because Thanksgiving is coming! I would have a Matrix Farm. This farm would exist as a virtual experience inside the computer onboard each ship. You would go to the farm, and pick out your animal, you would cook your food on a grill in the holodeck, and then you would print that food into a real-life replicator.  So this means, your food would grow naturally through real-world modeling of animals that exist in real ever-day possibilities, including the plants, the farm, the sky. Just nail that idea down into your brain: a real-world simulator. Then once ready for harvest, you can then print out from the simulator. Drawing out the idea this means you would have the variety, the real-life experiences of those animals, and plants. And it means the computer will have modeled exactly how the item exists and you could print out the item during any stage, from beginning to end, and would include the real experience of the food had. Included in this experience would be the animal's birth, their free-range lifestyle, the pain of the animal's death, and the prayer that is accompanied the food when you bless the replicator for providing you a bounty of food. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see Star Ship crew protesting outside the holodeck. The Real Way it Might Work In the ST Universe, they often say how replicated food isn\u2019t nearly as good. I also think that they often refer to the replicators as a type of 3D Printer. This would increase the flexibility of the tool, and probably have users abandon keeping copies of the original pieces. Keeping a copy of anything real on file presents some issues that I covered in another post. I\u2019ll link to that here. So this would indicate the relationship between real food and replicated food is not that it\u2019s the same thing, but that it has properties that have been tested in the kitchen to replicate what real food isis like. This actually applies to lots of things, like guns, or musical instruments. So from what I have surmised, it\u2019s more like the relationship between an Impossible Burger and a real burger. Yes, they use transporters. And yes, they use transporters can copy things. However, they aren\u2019t even very close to the same thing except for some perception and nutrient requirements by humans. There is more to consider, to get those jobs output, there might be a difference in data storage and data processing. You could see this as a comparison between a picture using vector, vs pixels. Imagine if you wanted a steak. If you had a copy in memory to \u201cprint\u201d every time you wanted a steak, then it would be an exact copy, and each steak you ordered would always be the same; that\u2019s not very fun. Unless they added in 1000 different variations. \u201cFine\u201d you say, \u201cjust have 1000 variants and I\u2019ll take a random steak\u201d. Okay, you are right that is better. However\u2026 Now apply that to the varieties of food that people will want. That\u2019s a lot of storage. \u201cFine\u201d you say, \u201cbut in the future, they will have huge hard drive storage.\u201d Don\u2019t forget\u201cOur Man Bashir\u201d in DS9 where they struggled to contain the images of just 5 crew members in the Holodeck. In Voyager you say, \u201cbut they had the doctor, that\u2019s a lot of memory!\u201d But the doctor wasn\u2019t organic, nor based on organic principles. So maybe DS9 does present a limit to storage. But if you understand the difference between a vector-based image and a pixel-based image, then you can understand how the storage of many foods as vectors or in some sort of descriptive format that translates into a 3D object might be what they are using. Vector\u2019s would also allow for variations much easier than a hard copy of any item. For your edification: from Google.Unlike pixel graphics, vector graphics aren't composed of individual picture elements; rather they are made up of geometric primitives, like lines, circles, or curves. ... In contrast to pixel graphics, the display size of vector graphics has no effect on memory requirements.Jul 20, 2020 This is how you get Sisko\u2019s Creole Kitchen, not just for experimenting with food, but because food is something that is not going anywhere quite yet.

            "answer_text": "Food is a LOT less complicated than life. If you replicate a steak, it just has to have the taste, texture and nutrition of a steak. Even if your replicated steak is so exact that it would fool the most dedicated carnivore, that's nowhere near the accuracy required for life. If you tried to replicate a cow, you would get something that looked and tasted like a cow, but it wouldn't be a living cow. Imagine you have a replicated cow, and tried to perform an autopsy to see why it wasn't alive. When you took a sample and put it under the microscope, you would find that it didn't have cells. It doesn't need them, it only has to be accurate enough to fool you into thinking you're eating a steak. It doesn't need cells with nuclei, robisomes, golgi apparatus, etc. The complexity of a cell would be just too much to duplicate with the accuracy required for it to be alive. \"Close enough\" will do for food, not for life.
