            "answer_text": "Yes, it is absolutely possible. We are just beginning to understand how we may be able to create such phantom sensations. Recent work in restoring the sense of touch has shown that electrically stimulating directly in somatosensory cortex through implanted electrodes can evoke feelings that one's hand is being touched. This article describes some work that has been done in monkeys, but ongoing research at the University of Pittsburgh and other institutions has shown that the method works in humans as well. Creating an artificial sense of touch by electrical stimulation of the brain There are also ongoing investigations into restoring vision through electrical stimulation of the retina or the primary visual cortex. While currently crude, there are no forseeable insurmountable barriers to the technology eventually reaching the stage where evoked sensory experiences are indistinguishable from natural experiences. In theory, if one can figure out the precise pattern of stimulation to provide, any sensation could be replicated... and perhaps even emotions or more complex thoughts or memories could be inserted...
