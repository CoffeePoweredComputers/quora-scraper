            "answer_text": "Enzymes are bio catalyst generally made up of amino acid . They help in lowering of Gibbs free energy of the reaction and speeds up at normal body temperature itself remaining intact at the end of mechanism. They show all kind of catalysis but most commonly seen is acid base catalysis. ",

            "answer_text": "Enzymes are biological catalyst which are usually proteins.enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction . Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy require to initiate the reaction .enzymes do this by binding to the substrate and holding it in a way that allows reaction to happen more efficiently.the part of the enzyme where the substrate binds is called active site.here,the enzyme changes shape slightly , fitting tightly with the substrate and forming the enzyme-substrate complex.
