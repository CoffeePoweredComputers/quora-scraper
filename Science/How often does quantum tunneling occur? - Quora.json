            "answer_text": "It\u2019s actually reasonably simple. A quantum has no exact location. Its location is a probability function until you measure it. Then you sort of force it to make up its mind. (That\u2019s an anthropomorphic explanation, but close enough for our purposes.) So, if you put a supply of quanta on one side of a barrier, they cannot cross. But because their position is uncertain, each quantum has a small, but non-zero probability of being on the wrong side of the barrier when \u201cforced to make up its mind.\u201d  This is one of the few quantum phenomena that is 100% just as surreal and magical as it appears. Quanta can surmount an insurmountable barrier using nothing but probability. If macroscopic objects could act in this way, you\u2019d have Douglas Adams\u2019s humorous party trick in which the Infinite Improbability Drive is used to make the hostess\u2019s underwear jump three feet to the left. It\u2019s exactly that odd. But tunneling has real world practical applications, not the least of which is: it makes stars work and enables us build a type of high-powered microscope.  ",
