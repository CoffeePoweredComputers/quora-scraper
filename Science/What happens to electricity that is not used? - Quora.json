            "answer_text": "Lots of good answers here! Mostly based on electricity generation from fossil fuels. Not all, certainly, but I want to focus on the answers based on traditional power generation, which is largely fossil fuels or hydroelectric generation. One thing I'm not seeing in these answers is the increasing effect of solar and wind energy production related to the posed question (What happens to electricity that is not used?). Unlike traditional power generation these are relatively unpredictable (especially wind). They give lots of power at times and none at others. And while you can turn them \u201coff\u201d in times of excess, that just means that energy is unavailable to the consumer. So what do you do with the excess solar electricity you get? It's a very good question. Every spring (late spring, May-ish) California makes a huge excess of solar power. Spring is a time (at least in California) when you're not heating or air conditioning your home (and office buildings, etc.) because the climate doesn't need you to, but it's also a time when the sun is shining at almost peak amounts. Hence the excess of solar electricity. Where does this excess go in this particular case? Simply put, they give it away\u2026(https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-electricity-solar/). (I don't agree with everything that that article says, btw, but I think it's relevant to this subject.) Bottom line is that this is why energy storage is such an important part of the equation. If we can store excess energy when the sun or wind is dumping loads on us, then we can use that later when we need it. Aside from hydro, I can't think of any renewable energy that can regulate output on demand. (Nuclear not withstanding; it's clean, but not technically renewable.) Admittedly, this hasn't been a serious issue so far, because we're a very power-hungry society, but energy storage will be a very very important issue as we go forward. Batteries are the most obvious solution, but there are other options also... But that's getting off topic to the question at hand. Anyhow, I suspect strongly that this isn't the angle that people that have been responding to this question, have been considering (and honestly, that the questioner was thinking about either) and their answers have been, in my opinion, quite informative and accurate, but I thought this was an angle that was worth thinking about\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "There is no extra electricity in the power grid. A fact that surprises many people is that when a generator is supplying power it is hard to turn. Reduce the power demand by switching off some devices, and the generator becomes much easier to turn. It makes perfect sense, of course, but it still surprises people. So, if power demand decreases, the generator would tend to speed up. But that can\u2019t happen. The speed of the generators is rigidly synchronized with the power grid to be (in the US) exactly 60 Hz, so what happens is that the amount of steam to the turbine is reduced, keeping the generator turning at the same speed. Reducing the steam demand in turn means backing off on the fuel (in a fossil fired plant) or reactor output (in a nuclear plant). Normally, since power plants are providing electricity to a large area, changes in demand are smoothed out by the average of all consumers. Demand does change throughout the day, but usually in a predictable manner. An exception can occur when a breaker somewhere trips, and a large fraction, or even all of the load on the generators must be shed. You can shut off the steam to the turbines, but that steam has to go somewhere\u2014and right now. Allowing the boiler to explode is considered bad form, so a very large relief valve opens up and the entire boiler output is vented to the sky until an orderly shutdown can be accomplished. When that steam valve lets go, many of those within a thousand-yard radius will need a change of underwear. But no, \u201cextra\u201d energy never makes it onto the grid. Edited to add: With the increase in solar and wind power, which is generated without any particular link to demand, the need is becoming apparent for \u201cgrid storage\u201d which allows power generated during off-peak to be stored and used later during peak periods which may occur during nighttime or calm wind periods. Several methods have been contemplated or tested, including flywheels, pump storage (where water is pumped up to hilltop storage), and others. One idea, which becomes more feasible as electric vehicles become more plentiful, is to use the combined battery power of vehicles plugged into chargers as a distributed storage device. As of this writing, no significant percentage of the grid is capable of storing energy for future use, but times are changing. ",
