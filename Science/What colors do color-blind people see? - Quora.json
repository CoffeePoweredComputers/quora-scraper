            "answer_text": "Colour blindness does not (usually) mean being unable to see colour. There are three types of colour blindness: Protanopia - reduced sensitivity to red wavelengthsDeuteranopia - reduced sensitivity to green wavelengthsTritanopia - reduced sensitivity to blue wavelengthsProtanopia and deuteranopia are not wildly different in their effects, and together are known as red-green colour-blindness; tritanopia, sometimes known as blue-yellow colourblindness, is relatively rare. All are genetic, and the proximal cause is the failure of the appropriate photoreceptors in the retina to develop. The genes involved are on the X chromosome: as women have 2 copies of this chromosome, damage or mutation on one chromosome can be compensated for by a second, intact copy. Men have only one X chromosome, and are thus more likely to be affected by colour blindness. This is what a person with normal colour vision sees:  Red-blind (protanopic) people see this:  Colours that containing red appear as the colour combined with red to create them - so orange looks yellowish, and purple appears blue. Green-blind (deuteranopic) people see this:  Not a great deal of difference from red-blindness, just a bleaching of some shades. Blue-blind (tritanopic) people see this:  Again, colours containing blue appear as the colour combined with blue to create them: the purple crayon looks dark red. Colours that contain yellow now look like the colour combine with yellow - the two green crayons appear blue, and the yellow crayon is off-white.  There is a form of colour blindness, achromatopsia, where no colour is seen, only shades of grey (including black and white). It is very rare indeed, and results from the developmental failure of all photoreceptor (\u2018cone\u2019) cells. They are thus reliant on their \u2018rod\u2019 (night-vision) receptors, which are on the periphery of retina. A lack of colour vision is the least of the problems these people face: rod receptors max out at fairly low levels of illumination, and provide poor detail vision, so these individuals are very light-sensitive and have poor visual acuity. There are lesser forms of achromatopsia, where one type of cone - usually blue - develops normally, but this is even rarer than full achromatopsia.  While colour blindness is usually genetic, it can be \u2018acquired\u2019 - for example, through retinal disease or brain damage. In the latter instance, the eye still encodes colour information correctly and passes it to the brain, but the brain can no longer interpret that information. Interestingly, if asked to guess a colour, a brain-damaged achromat will usually be correct at a higher rate than chance, suggesting that colour information is being passed around the visual centres of the brain in some format.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of color-blindness. I\u2019m color-blind. I always find this graphic on color perception very useful in explaining why I see the way I see.  What this diagram points out is that we have overlapping receptors for colors in our eyes. We have rods and cones which perceive different wavelengths of color better than others. The one on the left is the blue receptor set. The one in the middle is the green receptor set and the one on the right is the red receptor set. The overlap between red and green receptors is very large, but the blue receptors don\u2019t overlap nearly as much. In my particular case, I have 100% blue perception, 5%-10% green perception and 0% red perception. Does this mean I can\u2019t see red? No, I can see red, but I see it mostly with the green receptors. Does the very poor green perception mean I can\u2019t see green? No, I just need more green input to see green. What this all means is that on color perception tests like this, I score very, very poorly.  People with good color perception see clear numbers and shapes in all of these color dot fields. I can see numbers and shapes mostly clearly in only 7 of these at this size of graphic. If I zoom in on each of them, I can see another couple. For clarity, I can see the 12 in the upper left hand corner, everything on the bottom row clearly except for what I think is a 5 in second one from the left, the 12 and 70 on the right side of the second row from the bottom and what I think is 41 on the left end of that row. But I \u2018see\u2019 colors in all of them. If you asked me what colors, I\u2019d be guessing about 90% of the time. I get a lot of color from context. For example, tree trunks are brown and leaves are green. Except when they aren\u2019t, and I might very well not be able to tell. Similarly, it\u2019s very difficult for me to tell whether grass is green and healthy or brown and dying. In general, the larger the size of the color patch, the more likely I\u2019ll be right in identifying it. Many people can see tiny dots and identify color, but I\u2019ll need a big solid circle of color to identify it. Saturation matters too. One of the ways I tend to describe what I see is that it\u2019s as if all of the colors were downgraded. Neon super-saturated colors become normal. Normal colors become pastels. And some of this means that normal figurative painting and watercolors are relatively meaningless to me. So much of the aesthetic pleasure is bound up in color perception and what the person is doing with it, and that\u2019s almost entirely invisible to me. Similarly, I can\u2019t tell if someone is blushing or flushed from their skin color, but I can frequently infer it from body language or panting or the like. Most people who are color blind can see colors. But there are a vanishingly small percentage of people who can\u2019t perceive any colors, but only shades of grey. Typically they have serious vision problems of other sorts as well. ",
