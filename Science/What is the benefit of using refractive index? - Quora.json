            "answer_text": "Refractive index consolidates a lot of complicated information into a single meaningful parameter. Most fundamentally, materials are described by their permittivity [math]\\epsilon[/math], permeability [math]\\mu[/math], and conductivity [math]\\sigma[/math]. So given the following parameters, can you say how fast a wave propagates or how quickly it decays? I cannot. [math]\\epsilon = 9.2 \\times 10^{-12}[/math] F/m[math]\\mu = 1.26 \\times 10^{-12}[/math] H/m[math]\\sigma = 10^{-20}[/math] S/m However, if I am told the refractive index is 2.0, I immediately know the speed of the wave is half the speed of light in vacuum. In lossy materials, the refractive index is a complex number. [math]n = n_{\\rm{o}} - j \\kappa[/math] [math]n_{\\rm{o}}[/math] is called the ordinary refractive index and it is the parameter that completely describes the speed of a wave inside a medium. [math]\\kappa[/math] is called the extinction coefficient and it completely describes the loss of a medium. Both of these would not be apparent just given [math]\\epsilon[/math], [math]\\mu[/math], and [math]\\sigma[/math]. If you want a little more information about this, and other meaningful parameters, watch the videos for Lectures 3b and 3d here: Applied EM | EM Lab ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, I do not fully understand the question. Thus, only some general remarks: Refractive index is, in principle, the speed of light in the first, less dense medium (e.g. vacuum or air) divided by the speed of light in the second, denser medium (e.g. glass). Said second speed usually also is slightly different for different wavelenghts (Abbe number is used to take this into consideration) and different sorts of glass . If a light beam bundle having one \u201cfront\u201d hits a curved surface between two different refractive indices, some beams of the bundle hit the surface later and are therefore \u201cbraked\u201d (or \u201caccelerated\u201d) later. This leads to the whole front being bent (and the beam thus focused, if the surface curvature and refractive index for the specific wavelength match). Hope this helps\u2026 ",
