            "answer_text": "Deep space or interstellar? Technically we have done deep space by going to the moon. When SpaceX and MarsOne go to Mars that's definitely deep space. Interstellar travel on the other hand, going to the stars, that is completely different and even more difficult. The universe is huge. It takes light, the fastest thing in the universe, takes years. Our nearest star, other than the Sun, is Alpha Centauri is 4.367 light years away. So it takes light over 4 years to get to Earth. So at the Universal speed limit it takes 4.367 years to get there. We cannot reach anywhere near that. SpaceX BFR which will be the most powerful rocket in production does 16,777 mph the speed of light in comparison is 670,616,629 mph. We\u2019re not anyway near. Luckily the Universe has given us loopholes in the universal speed limit. Like Einstein Rosen bridge Gravity or warp drives can be possible. Gravity can disrupt the fabric of Space-Time, planets and stars. Black holes can rip through it. Space-time is a sheet and can be disrupted. Then there's the Universe as a balloon analogy  if the surface of the balloon is the Universe, then what's under the surface. If we could access that either through wormholes or like in Babylon 5 as a hyperspace. Which is a dimensional/universewhich lays beneath the real Universe. Although I like the idea of a hyperspace, you miss out a lot of the universe. Like what\u2019s between the stars and Galaxies. Not that we are anywhere near interstellar travel and I can't see it being as early as Babylon 5 and Star Trek portrayed it. Maybe by the 24th century we'll have interstellar. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean human travel to outside our solar system? And to what end? Other than the ability to say \u201cI was there.\u201d I can\u2019t see what mankind gains from sending human beings into deep space. We can gain all the information we need from space probes and we don\u2019t need to worry about killing people in the long slow process. It has taken 40+ years for the voyager sattelites to get outside the solar system and apart from the odd few hours as they whipped past planets, there hasn\u2019t been an awful lot to see. I can\u2019t imagine what sort of hell spending 40 years of ones life existing in a small metal box with nothing more than stars to look at (which could be viewed just as easily on earth) would be especially knowing that you were destined to eventually die in that metal box. Any developments of current technology will never make the deep space travel goal attainable. Now if somebody comes up with a flash of genius and finds a way to use electrical power to insulate oneself from gravity for example then deep space travel might then become a possibility. But when that flash of genius might come? We don\u2019t know if it ever will. ",
