            "answer_text": "Pierre de Fermat was a pivotal figure in the early days of modern number theory, and had a lasting impact on the renaissance of the field. He did, however, make quite a few mistakes. Furthermore, he never actually insisted he had a proof of his \u201cLast Theorem\u201d; he made a casual remark about it in the margin of a book, and then lived on for many years and continued to write about mathematics without ever once mentioning it. There's no reason to believe he actually recalled making that comment or thinking he had a proof. He certainly never wrote it down. I think people take the term \u201cLast Theorem\u201d to mean that he died immediately after making some mysteriously cryptic announcement. That's not true. It's not \u201cmany\u201d mathematicians who believe he didn't have a proof: all of them do. Although we can't know with absolute certainty what a long-dead person might have thought of, we can be as certain about Fermat not having this proof as we can be of Cleopatra not having discovered general relativity and neglecting to tell anyone.

            "answer_text": "A2A. Alon Amit has it right of course. Fermat enjoyed writing people letters to tell them about things he discovered. If I remember right, he would say things like, a French mathematician has proven this, can English mathematicians prove this too? He told people he had proven a special case of his conjecture, which wouldn\u2019t make much sense if he thought he had the whole thing. He probably was more careful when he wrote letters to brag about things than when writing a note to himself. A lot of people have mistakenly thought they had a proof at least temporarily, especially before writing it out in full. He didn\u2019t know his note was going to be published when he died. So no, even if he were unusually reliable, nothing points to his having been right. If there is an afterlife, I hope he\u2019s somewhere where he can find this amusing. ",
