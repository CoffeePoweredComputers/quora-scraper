            "answer_text": "Whatever the meaning explained by others I would give a simple explanation for the word \"cutting edge\"which can be extended to the word \"technology\" or any appropriate word or term.Edges in a square such as road turnings or a piece of cloth or a piece of paper are at right angles or they are sharp,thus forcing you to take a 90 degree turn. Supposing the roads have a smooth and a curved turning,taking a turn will be smooth and convenient!! So also cutting involving anything. So cutting an edge removes sharpness and makes things smoother, easier and may be helps in being fast, such as in a race track! Right?. So also when this idea is applied to any thing scientifically, you are adopting science and adapting technology to be adept in making all aspects of our life easier, sailing smoothly throughout the passage of our life thus removing all sudden turns and removing all the \"sharp\" edges!!!   One must also remember that our earth as well as all planets, stars , galaxies are all in the process of removing the edges and are in the process of removing or smoothening of all the edges!!! getting rounded !!!

            "answer_text": "Cutting edge technology means 'new technology'. That is to say, recently released stuff (hardware, software, tools, whatever). The advantage is that it tends to be more powerful ... the disadvantage is that it tends to be more buggy (because nothing finds bugs like actually being used for years.) The etymology is to do with ploughs - the cutting edge of a plough (a farming implement to cut turf) is the bit that runs ahead, and dates back to 1825. The use of the phrase to mean 'the bit that runs ahead' as a metaphor dates from 1964. ",
