            "answer_text": "Original Question: Why are scientists not able to discover God? I\u2019m not aware of any scientists who have ever spent time looking for gods, other than as a personal belief system. Perhaps you mean \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t science been able to discover gods?\u201d The answer to that is simple: they don\u2019t exist outside the human mind. There is zero, and I do mean zero, evidence that gods have ever existed, could ever exist, or are necessary - for anything. Conjecture, assumption, wishful thinking, cognitive bias, belief, reliance of ancient mythology, reliance on religious dogma\u2026, are not evidence. In addition to this, through the study of anthropology, archaeology and history, we\u2019re able to say that gods are nothing more than an invention of the ancient human mind from some 75,000 years or so ago, at a time when our distant ancestors were just beginning to think about the natural world which surrounded them, and could only conjecture that invisible spirits caused all the natural events around them, to happen. The belief that these invisible spirits (what we call gods) controlled nature stayed with us right up until the time that scientific exploration of the world around us started to take place and provide alternative explanations, a small time span in relation to the supernatural belief, which by now had become part of our evolutionary make-up. Organised religion, responsible for maintaining this belief, has been with us in one form or another for at least 10,000 years, and they use this ancient god concept as a means of attracting and retaining followers by way of promising people these invisible gods will look after them in life, and offer them eternal \u2018life\u2019 in a place called heaven, after they die. This is hugely comforting to the masses and psychologically is in deep accord with several basic human desires, believed to be as a result of the aforementioned evolutionary process. But organised religions do this for two reasons. Firstly their own survival; without hundreds of millions of followers believing their tales, they\u2019d soon cease to exist, and secondly, because having hundreds of millions of followers gives them huge power and control over people, not to mention wealth. But none of it is actually true. It\u2019s all based on this ancient belief system, which no-one has ever provided one iota of evidence to substantiate. Gods do not exist outside the human mind, period. ",

            "answer_text": "For the same reason it hasn\u2019t discovered the teapot orbiting Saturn. God likely doesn\u2019t exist. There is no reason to think God DOES exist-it comes down to evidence. For science evidence has to be objective, which means it is the same for everyone, and reproducible, which means it can be demonstrated repeatedly. Now if you\u2019re a believer, you may feel that your personal relationship with God is all the evidence of his existence you need. Ok, fine, but that evidence isn\u2019t objective-you can\u2019t use it to convince someone else. Likewise, you might have experienced a coincidence or chain of coincidences so unlikely that you would call it a miracle, and consider that evidence of God. Great, but that isn\u2019t reproducible. Scientifically speaking neither of those mean anything. What you would need is to somehow be able to consistently demonstrate the existence of God or God\u2019s actions on earth. And these experiments HAVE been done, by highly competent scientists. And they all found no positive results. Now this doesn\u2019t mean God DOESN\u2019T exist-a supreme being conceptualized like most people conceptualize God would certainly be able to thwart any test human scientists could come up with, but it DOES mean that there isn\u2019t any reason to think he DOES exist. And in science, one of the guiding principles is the principle of parsimony, also known as Occam\u2019s Razor. This principle states that the explanation that explains all the facts in evidence that is the simplest is usually correct. Any explanation for any phenomenon that includes the existence of God is necessarily the most complex explanation because it requires one to assume the existence of a being necessarily more complex than the known universe. And the likelihood of such a creature existing without any evidence of his existence is vanishingly small. So until such time that there is evidence, the existence of God will remain a matter of faith and outside the realm of science. ",
