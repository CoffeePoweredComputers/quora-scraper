            "answer_text": "For the fun of it. When I was an undergrad, I ended up hanging out with the grad students, most of whom were working on PhD\u2019s. I enjoyed that then because it was an opportunity to work with cutting edge technology. I didn\u2019t merely want to make things work, but I wanted to understand why things worked. These were people asking those questions. After undergrad, I went off to work for a university as a sysadmin figuring I\u2019d eventually get a graduate degree. After a few years of watching how grad students got treated, I decided I was never going to put myself through that. And, around that time, an opportunity came up to work at JPL. JPL was a huge amount of fun. Because space. And I was doing lots of programming on the system that dealt with commands going to the spacecraft, which was cool. However, I eventually realized that due to the structure of the place, I would eventually run into a glass ceiling unless I had a masters degree. And when that occurred, it might be a time in my life when it wasn\u2019t convenient to go back to grad school, so I decided to get a masters. For various reasons, I went back to the school where I\u2019d been a sysadmin and worked with a wonderful advisor. He reminded me of how much I enjoyed research, particularly the part about building new things and understanding how systems worked. I decided to stick around for the PhD because I was having fun. It has probably worked out for me financially, but I went into it assuming that it wouldn\u2019t. (There\u2019s a pretty high opportunity cost if you look at working with an MS for an extra 3+ years vs. getting a PhD stipend.) It\u2019s certainly worked out for me in terms of being able to continue to work in research and to have a job that I enjoy going to most days. But I also know people who have managed to prove themselves and so do jobs similar to mine with an MS. But the training helps to make it easier to get there as a PhD. All in all, if it\u2019s not obvious to you why you want to get a PhD, you shouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s similar to riding a motorcycle or being a musician or other things that are likely to cause pain. Unless there\u2019s a large amount of joy, the pain isn\u2019t worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have said this well, but I'll chime in, as I asked that question myself more than a few times in the final years of my PhD. A PhD is a research degree. If you succeed (not just graduate) you should be an expert in a particular area and (more importantly) have learned how to formulate a research agenda and pursue specific research questions. That isn't a skill set every employer needs and it doesn't necessarily say much about whether or not you can deliver well-written, tested software on time and in budget. Having said that and having been working in (effectively) an industry developer job for the past five years, what I've found is that my training has prepared me very well to ask questions at a higher level of abstraction, to recognize and plug gaps in our knowledge, and to think a bit beyond the highly focused build this now mentality that often drives development. I tend to approach projects from a more holistic perspective than others. Some of that is my personality, some of that is the specifics of my research focus, some of that is simply a research oriented mindset that was deeply ingrained in graduate school. Those skills can bring a lot to a development team. And there's the key part. My background brings strengths to a team and those strengths need to mesh well with the other people and skills on the team. Mad forbwhat opportunities open up, the ones you make happen. Pursue a PhD for a reason. If you don't have a pretty clear reason to head down that path, don't start on it. But at the same time, recognize that things change, some doors open and others close. A PhD builds skills and (hopefully) puts you in a position to find creative ways to apply those skills as new opportunities arise. ",
