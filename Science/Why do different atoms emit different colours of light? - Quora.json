            "answer_text": "Different atoms emit different colours of light because when electron jumps from lower level to some higher level it absorb energy and when it move back to lower energy level it emit a photon of same energy as [math]E=energy of higher level-Energy of lower level[/math] As the energy difference between different orbits is different so the emitted photon has different wavelength depending upon energy difference and each wavelength corresponds to a specific light colour. I hope that you get the point! ",
