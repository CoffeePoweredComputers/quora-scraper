            "answer_text": "They each denote the opposite end of the frequency range used by humans - kind of like Left and Right. Ultrasound is anything above about 20 KHz, and Infrasound is anything below 20 Hz. So Ultrasound is very high frequency, tends to travel in a straight line under some circumstances, making it useful for sonar-like applications, and bounces off most solid objects. Infrasound, on the other hand, is very low wavelength and tends to penetrate matter quite effectively, and can even be caused by (and can cause) seismic waves. But the most important thing to remember is \u201cSound\u201d is from 20Hz to 20 KHz. Infra means \u201cBelow\u201d so sounds below this are automatically Infrasound. Ultra means \u201cAbove\u201d so sounds above 20 KHz are Ultrasound. Within both Infrasound and Ultrasound, you\u2019ll find a range of unusual and interesting properties that varies entirely with the frequency. ",

            "answer_text": "They differ by their frequency. These terms typically refer to sound waves, rather than electromagnetic waves, because the term ultrasonic refers to waves that have a frequency higher than what humans can hear. Often taken as anything above 20000 Hz. Infrasonic refers to frequencies lower than what humans can hear (typically less than 20 Hz). A Hz represents 1 cycle per second. ",
