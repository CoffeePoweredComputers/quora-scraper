            "answer_text": "\u201cPure science\u201d in any discipline is about theory and experiments to test and advance the theories that are in development. In this case, a theory is a formal explanation (for behavior or observations). \u201cApplied science\u201d in any discipline is the application of what is known (via theories) to specific problems or opportunities. In both pure and applied science, math is employed to deal with measurements and relationships; math enables concise, clear-cut statements, statements that can be evaluated as true or false. Math is a kind of language for science. Physics is the most developed of any scientific discipline. Social science has not identified the fundamental variables in the same way that physics has (key variables in physics, for example: distance, mass, time, change in position (velocity), change in velocity (acceleration)). When I studied at university, the powers that be only acknowledged physical phenomena, not mind/emotion independent of the physical brain which plays a role in psychology. So the idea was that what we humans perceive as thoughts or feelings are really just chemical processes in the physical brain according to social scientists. There was an acknowledgement of political systems [Easton], and econometrics and such, but I really believe that social science has not had its Isaac Newton to identify the relevant key variables and relationships yet. Of course, this does not stop researchers from putting forward theories and trying to apply the lessons learned from research; we have to keep trying to advance knowledge. Hope this helps. ",
