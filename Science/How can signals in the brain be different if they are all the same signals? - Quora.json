            "answer_text": "I know right? how weird is that, and it\u2019s true. The signal being sent through the neurons are all the same, even the same strength, it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a cascade of ions rushing in until it reaches the end of the axon. Yet different neurons still have different effects, how can the same signal do different things? Well think about it, how can the same electricity be used to wash my clothes, provide light in the dark, provide heat for my cooking, provide cooling for my stored food, and provide entertainment in the form of TV/Console/Laptop? It\u2019s all electricity?  I might have simplified electricity a bit too much here, but the point should be clear. It\u2019s what\u2019s at the end that does the magic rather than the electricity itself. In the image above we see these Axons, colored orange and the myelin colored purple. Nerves look a lot like electrical wires right? The signal traveling along the axon doesn\u2019t carry the feeling per se, it\u2019s where that signal ends up. At the end of that axon differences already arise, different axons transmit different chemicals. These neurotransmitters already change what happens. That same signal can release different transmitters, from serotonin to dopamine to GABA. that last one even does the opposite of what you\u2019d expect, it inhibits the next neuron. In the brain this kinda looks like this. Tiny balls filled with chemicals. Already very different from what we intuitively know about signals. Depending on what\u2019s in those balls we have different effects on the receiving neuron.  So that same signal can already lead to different effect depending on the type of neurotransmitters being released. Just like how the same electricity can either heat up or cool down my food depending on which appliance I plug in. I did skip one part about neurons, the signals aren\u2019t completely free from information. The signal is always the same strength, but that\u2019s not the only property we can use. A neuron can send several signals with plenty of time in between, or it can send signals real quickly right after another. This is the frequency, which also affects the end-result. Then one last thing, the point where the signal ends up ALSO determines the effect. That same signal sent to the visual cortex will be experienced differently than that signal being sent to your limbic system (emotions) or being sent to a muscle. Different areas take that signal and different processes follow. If I put a big magnetic coil on your head to make neurons fire, depending on where I put that thing I can either make your fingers move, let you see static dots, moving dots, or even sounds. Location matters in the brain.  Because of the variation in the body, that same signal can be used to make you feel and experience different things. Different connections, different locations, different frequencies, all work with the same signal. Why we actually \u201cfeel\u201d happy or sad is a different question all together, and we have no idea yet where this subjective experience comes from. Cool isn\u2019t it? ",
