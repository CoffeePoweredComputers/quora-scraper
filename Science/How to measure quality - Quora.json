            "answer_text": "How do you define what is quality for you? Think of it and then think of the measurable characteristics of it. Quality for a given literary site may be signalled by the readership of long stories. Long stories take time to read, so the more time spent there, the better. If you want to be precious about it, use a spreadsheet to relate time spent for every story in your site to the length in characters, like X seconds per 100 characters. Quality for a given photo site may be signalled by the indication that readers want to keep seeing more pictures. In a slideshow, each picture opens after a click, so the number of pageviews is the key raw measure here. If you want to be even more precious in this example, you could divide the time spent by the pages viewed in the average of visits. The bigger this index is, the longer a person spent looking at each pic. Quality in a given site may also be indicated by the loyalty of the visitors. So, sessions per user could be a nice metric to watch. You can even split your users by slots of frequency: x% only came once; Y% came more than 20 times a month; and so on. But more than anything, first define quality, then devise the indicators. ",

            "answer_text": "There are at least two, very different definitions of quality. The first is adherence to specification. Simply was what was produced what the specifications say was supposed to be produced? This is typically the definition used in manufacturing. The second is far more nebulous. Does it look good, feel good, smell good, last a long time, meet or exceed high expectations? Note that these definitions are not mutually exclusive, however, they are very different. ",
