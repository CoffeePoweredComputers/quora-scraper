            "answer_text": "Excellent question... Unlike In our visible as well as microscopic world the same law hold for every spining body which is if body is marked with two points lying opposite to each other (on the two opposite faces) suppose face marked as 1 initially faces towards u and now start spining the body it indeed after certain rotation extent its side marked as 1 faces away from u but if u want to see the side 1 again u need to rotate the body through 360 degree.... However so doesn't apply to frrmions like electrons they live in the quantum world hence the laws governing qw seems very strange as if we mark two opposite sides of electron 1 and two respectively 1 initially facing towards u to see same side again we need to rotate it through 360 multiplied by 2 wow it is really strange.... But it is the law that governs quantum world ",

            "answer_text": "Let me try to answer this question in a round-about way as follows. Please bear with limitations of the illustration used here.  Circles in the the first row represent Bosons. Due to their integral spins: A Boson goes through a full circle in some dimension.A Boson can be stabilized on a surface in an infinite way, since the circle offers infinite possible points of contact.Bosons can be easily rolled on a surface, since the circle has no node.Bosons look alike.Semi-circles in the second and third rows represent Fermions. Due to their half-integral spins: A Fermion goes through a semi-circle in some dimension.A Fermion can be stabilized on a surface in a single way with face up, since the semi-circle offers a single point of contact.Fermions cannot be easily rolled on a surface, since the semi-circle has nodes.Fermions do not look alike.",
