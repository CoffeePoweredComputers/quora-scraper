            "answer_text": "Ah, you\u2019d be wanting Corum & Corum \u201cFireball production from a Tesla Coil,\u201d 2003, where James and Kenneth Corum set up a pair of overtone-tuned secondary coils with a common primary driver. This essentially produces a sort of \u201ccapacitive discharge\u201d if ever the two plasma-streamers from the tops of the separate coils should touch together. The plasma shorts out the two secondaries, also instantly switching both to a single phase and a common lower frequency.  Tesla wrote that his \u201cfireballs\u201d were accidentally produced when strong overtones were present in his secondary coils, no doubt superposed in phase with the main oscillation sinewave. The higher harmonics cause the output waveform to have much sharper edges than pure sine waves, such as the 1,2,3, etc., harmonics of a delta function. With the Corum\u2019s setup we\u2019d expect a much larger, briefer discharge than the usual results seen when a lengthening plasma-streamer touches ground. Two streamer-tips merging, while momentarily charged to opposite high voltage, should give 2X the peak volts, and 4X the peak power, all occurring an an extremely sharp transition: over less than about a quarter-cycle of the higher frequency. Tesla called these \u201cdischarge of inconceivable violence,\u201d (presumably where a slow-crawling spark from your Tesla coil, rather than buzzing as usual, suddenly goes \u201cBANG!\u201d) The Corums discovered that a pure metal electrode wouldn\u2019t make any fireballs. Instead, various sources of contamination were required, including Nikola Tesla\u2019s original gutta-percha or rubber wire-insulation, partially charred, or even set aflame by the plasma. The Corums found that the \u201cBL\u201d would only persist for a second or two. However, the strong e-field surrounding a Tesla coil would keep the BL going for much longer. (We also see something similar inside Microwave Ovens, where the HV field inside the oven can power a plasma for many minutes.) There is a legend that Tesla kept a bright red Ball Lightning in a little box, and carried it around with him. If true, what was the power supply? He\u2019d need a portable Tesla coil, heavy batteries, etc. (Or, he\u2019d just have to be inside his own lab, with wireless light bulbs everywhere, and the ceiling covered with metal plates connected to Tesla coil HV terminals.) Heh. On the other hand, maybe it wasn\u2019t a BL, maybe it was just a wireless lightbulb: a device equally as magical as BL, back in 1905.  Apparently the \u201cball lightning\u201d being produced in the Corums\u2019 setup is the same thing as \u201cweld spatter.\u201d So-called weld-spatter is not simply some hot glowing metal droplets. Instead it is a weird, expanded structure, a fractal network of metal nanofilaments and incandescent gas. It\u2019s not plasma, it\u2019s actually fairly weighty, and tends to fall downwards and bounce around. (As it cools from its incandescent state, this \u201cball lightning\u201d shrinks enormously, finally forming a warm metal bead or grain.) Below: modern \u201cBL\u201d produced by cap-discharge through a silicon wafer  . Besides the Corums \u2026Robert Golka tried some Ball Lightning experiments with a huge tesla coil inside an aircraft hanger. Golka hoped that \u201cball lightning\u201d might be an electrodynamic plasma-soliton; a stable structure which might provide the secret of non-turbulent plasma for nuclear fusion reactors. But the Corums (as well as earlier Russian research with capacitor-discharge) found that \u201cBL\u201d instead more resembles a white-hot chunk of aerogel, where the initial air/plasma combination condenses into a \u201cgel nanostructure,\u201d a three-dimensional fractal percolation structure having a very low density. Like metal feathers, or metal styrofoam, heated white hot. Below, R. Golka, shorting out his submarine battery (YT vid)  ",

            "answer_text": "Ball Lightning is a strange and rare occurance, with thousands of anecdotal witnesses. Basically it appears as a luminous ball that floats through the air, often during lightning storms. They seem to contain a large amount of stored energy, which is occasionally unleashed on objects they contact. Some people think it is just swamp gas and a lot of imagination. Maxwell\u2019s Equations (as reduced by Oliver Heavyside) do not admitt the existance of this phenomenon, and yet there are too many accounts to regard this asmere folklore. Tesla claimed to be able to create clusters of such balls at will with his equipment. To my knowledge, no one knows how he did it. I read an account of someone claiming to create ball lightning in a microwave oven. He said he lit a candle in the oven and then microwaved it. He thought the carbon plasma from the candle somehow nucleated the effect. I have not tried this\u2026 ",
