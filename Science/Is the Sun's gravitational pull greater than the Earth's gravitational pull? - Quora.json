            "answer_text": "If you compare the force of gravity between the earth and a person on the surface of earth to the force of gravity between the sun and a person on a surface of earth then the earth\u2019s force of gravity is stronger. (this is why we don\u2019t float up towards the sun, yet the earth still orbits it). If you compare the force of gravity between the earth and the moon to the force of gravity between the sun and Alpha Centauri (the suns nearest stellar neighbor around 4.4 light years away) then the sun\u2019s force of gravity is greater. Ultimately the force of gravity depends on the distance between two object\u2019s individual centers of mass and the mass of each object you\u2019re comparing the force of gravity between. The equation for this is Newton\u2019s Gravitaion Equation. ",
