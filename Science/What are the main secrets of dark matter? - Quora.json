            "answer_text": "Dark matter as named by science so far has no complete information that tells what exactly it is. However, By study and measurement of weight of cluster, And dpeed of star movements of the inner and outer moving lines in the galaxy, and many other ways its existence was proved. According to the Ketab revealed on Musa and messenger Mohamad (PBUH) that is a timeline of creation sequencing creation events step by step through time, nothing known in it as dark matter. However, at the very early stage of the big bang, there was a spark ignition which ended the two early sub particles rubbing each other to start the ignite and the spark to lose their properties and became foam,\u2026.. Foam is matter. In addition, the spark produced puff wind when they put off. That wind was accumulative adds up every spark ignition happened, becoming the fifth universe energy. The foam was accumulative as well, and at the end of creating the atom, the foam enveloped or sleeved the atomsi a huge cloud of atoms and foam. That foam became smoke when the fifth energy began to thresh the foam from the atoms creating the different matter atoms from the light to the very heavy minerals. The resultant smoke taken with the stream of the fifth energy creating the skies of the galaxies, While atoms left behind out of these skies under the gravity control. When creating the skies of the galaxies ended and expansion started, Gravity turned its head in the surrounding of the galaxies skies and matter with the smoke started to move together inside the galaxies towards their centers. As the smoke was a thin layer of foam that sleeved the atoms, then became smoke, the smoke have weight. In fact scientists measuring the weight of the clusters, and movements of stars in the galaxies, and any other experiment, actually they are proving the existence of that smoke. You cannot find smoke in earth or any celestial object, because smoke us under the fifth energy control and the celestial objects are under gravity control. They gather in the center of the galaxies because it is where the fifth energy at its most, same as matter where gravity at its most. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m neither qualified in, nor interested in, giving you the answer provided by scientific methodology, which is to say the answer provided by that way of searching for cosmological answers which relies on what seems inferred by sense imagery. Up until around 1600 AD, Science necessarily relied exclusively upon sense images acquired by the naked senses. For, up until the first telescopes and microscopes were introduced c. 1600, there were no sense images acquired with the aid of such instruments. It was naked senses\u2019 sense images or nothing. These days, Science still relies a great deal upon the naked senses\u2019 images but as modified by million and billion dollar super-magnifiers, colliders, and other such aids to sense experience (cf.: with what Einstein says about Science and sense experience on pages 226 & 290 of Ideas And Opinions, Bonanza Books, New York, 1954 hard bound edition). On the other hand, I\u2019m quite possibly the supreme authority in giving the answer provided by what some might call philosophical methodology, but what I prefer to call \u201cintrospective methodology\u201d. That\u2019s a way of searching for cosmological answers which relies far more so upon what I judge is inferred by: (1) how my mind\u2019s concepts (especially mathematical ones) relate to one another, and (2) my mind\u2019s operations upon my sense images rather than upon what\u2019s inferred by those sense images themselves. I\u2019ve been working on that \u201cintrospective methodology\u201d since 1957, and, the cosmological system thereby produced, I call \u201cEsoptrics (i.e.: from \u201cesoptron\u201d, a Greek word for mirror), the algebraic logic of the dynamic mirror\u201d. What, now, is \u201cdark matter\u201d according to Esoptrics\u2019? Needless to say, the details amassed by what\u2019s been under development for 63 years are far too many to set forth here. Three of my 21 self-published books in print are dedicated to doing that. Here, then, let me first give an answer too brief to mean much as it says this: For Esoptrics, dark matter and energy are realities which only appear such because an observer moving thru the universe using a lower level of locomotion\u2019s medium (i.e.: LM for short) cannot come even remotely close to detecting adequately what\u2019s so moving using a level of LM much higher than the observer\u2019s. To give some level of intelligibility to that, let\u2019s resort to a kind of figurative explanation so: Imagine an astronomical number of transparent spheres (i.e.: say 10^77) all concentric with one another in what we\u2019ll call a multi-combo named Omega. Each sphere is distinguished from all of its fellows because, figuratively, each has a discrete \u201cdiameter\u201d running from as little as 2^-128 to 2^128 times the atomic diameter of 5 x 10^-8 cm. (i.e.: from c. 10^-47 cm. to 18 trillion light years in \u201cdiameter\u201d). Omega is thus what Esoptrics calls a 4 dimensional \u201cspace envelope\u201d or, more accurately, \u201cLM field\u201d. In such a scenario, objects moving away from Omega\u2019s center can do so using any one of Omega\u2019s 10^77 concentric spheres. I\u2019ll not go into what, per Esoptrics, determines which sphere is to be used. Imagine one of those objects, Alpha, is fleeing Omega\u2019s center using the sphere whose \u201cdiameter\u201d is 2^128 times that of the smallest sphere. The \u201cdiameter\u201d of Alpha\u2019s LM is thus only 5 x 10^-8 cm.; and so, Alpha can\u2019t go very far from Omega\u2019s center. Imagine another one of those objects, Beta, is fleeing Omega\u2019s center using the sphere whose \u201cdiameter\u201d is 2^200 times that of the smallest sphere. The \u201cdiameter\u201d of Beta\u2019s LM is thus 3 billion miles; and so Beta can go as far as 1.5 billion miles from Omega\u2019s center. Image a third object, Gamma, is fleeing Omega\u2019s center using the sphere whose \u201cdiameter\u201d is 2^256 times that of the smallest sphere. The \u201cdiameter\u201d of Gamma\u2019s LM is thus 18 trillion light years; and so, Gamma can go as far as 9 trillion light years from Omega\u2019s center. Alpha may well detect much about Beta; but, if Alpha tries to detect Gamma to any extent, Gamma is bound to appear so extensively different from Beta, that Gamma\u2014together with any energy Gamma might radiate\u2014is going to appear as a kind of reality totally different from what\u2019s found in Beta. Thus, per Esoptrics, is born what can APPEAR to be dark matter and energy. The thing to remember here, though, is this: The spheres are concentric (i.e.: their centers are not outside of one another in the kind space inferred by sense imagery); and so, for some of the distances from Omega\u2019s center, Alpha\u2019s LM, Beta\u2019s LM, and Gamma\u2019s LM are the same LM as far as separation from one another in sense imagery\u2019s kind of space is concerned. In other words, though Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are to no extent separate from one another in the terms of sense imagery\u2019s kind of space, they are\u2014in the terms of Esoptrics\u2019 kind of LM\u2014astronomically far apart from one another in \u201cmathematically logical sequence\u201d (i.e.: by way of example, our concepts of 1 vs. 10^77 are to no extent separate from one another in space, but are astronomically far apart in the terms of a numerically logical sequence limited to counting in the terms of our concept of 1). How can that be? The answer to that is far too complicated for here, save to say this: Rather than a \u201cspatial\u201d maze, the universe, for Esoptrics, is a mathematical maze the real kind of which cannot be understood, unless one is well versed in the mathematical system arising as the effect of the fact that The Infinite One\u2019s tri-functional act automatically includes sextuplex (i.e.: 6) real relations. In short, Esoptrics is a cosmological system so radically different from all other systems, that, so far, very few people can even begin to grasp any part of it. ",
