            "answer_text": "There are two parts to this question and I will try to answer them both PART I WHAT CAN I DO TO IMPROVE MY MATHEMATICS COMPREHENSION Read more books! Mathematics is a language. Just like French, Spanish, Python, Ruby, C++ they all take time to read and understand what you are looking at. Even before you attempt a problem, read the problem! I would tell my students that there is a procedure that everyone goes through and I\u2019ll take you step by step: Step 1 : Read the problem Step 2: Cry Step 3: Read the problem again Step 4: PANIC Now generally what happens here people go back to step one and then we have this vicious cycle of never really getting to seeing the beauty of a problem. Here are the last two steps Step 5: Read the problem again Step 6: Draw a picture When you read the problems ask yourself do you understand every word that is the problem says. Often people read with a inkling of what they are reading, but never actually understand the specific words that are being said. We miss the beauty of what is happening in context when we skim over words that we do not know or even just jump straight into a problem before understanding what the question is even asking or worse expect the calculator to give you an answer! When you finally understand the words, draw a picture.This can be done a variety of ways writing some fancy algorithm (step by step procedure) creating variables (just a place holder for anything that you want to look at) to solve to for (whatever \u201csolve\u201d means) writing it down on a napkin writing on walls or windows ( I\u2019ve done this and I have gotten strange looks, that\u2019s not me but the guy is checking my work)  Wherever and whatever you can write on get it down on someway somehow Then ask yourself what do I know? chances are you know more that you think once you have organized your thoughts down. Look for PATTERNS. Again since mathematics is a language all its own, there are patterns that should emerge based off your previous knowledge, or a pattern that appeared in earlier topics from somewhere. Once you \u201csee\u201d the pattern apply it or find other sources out there that might point you to a pattern that you are not seeing. So moral of part I -read more (textbooks, literature, youtube, khan academy) -draw what you see PART II I\u2019VE HAD A \u201cBURNOUT\u201d PERIOD \u201cinsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\u201d Albert Einstein If you are feeling burnt out from doing mathematics you are in good company! This happens because the education system has failed us by only allowing students like yourself to merely listening to people like myself drone on and on then giving mountains of homework on stuff they barely understand. There are a lot of people who probably feel the effects of burnout. It\u2019s really how you cope with that but also how you re-engage yourself into the material. I have given you plenty of ways to mix up the learning a little bit (see above after moral) but there are plenty of resources out there that can help you in the discovery of making material seem more interesting. Granted, you might never find functions and the effect of changing their coefficients fascinating, but the ability to manipulate them yourself and play around with them can really be not only beneficial to you but also allows for you see things and learn things differently. There are different math topics out there where software might be helpful for us to use ( and free!) that can aid in your understanding. The other thing you can also try is asking your teacher what material is coming next so that you can read the material prior to taking notes, once you have read the material having the teacher walk through examples can then help you get a better understanding of what you are reading and you can see how the teacher uses the language of the material to bring everything back together. If you are interested in seeing what things are out there that can help your learning of mathematics feel free to reply to this and I might be able to point you to some places that are good websites and free software to help out Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "One of the difficulties with Mathematics is that it is very much like a pyramid - each layer builds on the previous work. Unlike history courses that can be (and often are) self contained, Mathematics is not. You cannot just jump into statistics or topology for example, you need to understand the previous, foundational material. Your situation is not uncommon. Often good students move into high school and their studies suffer. There is this whole new world of topics in education, part time jobs, members of the opposite sex, etc. For many (most?) this seems to rectify itself in junior year as they have developed the ability to successfully juggle all of these various interests. However this usually means they are somewhat deficient in Mathematics because they do not have the algebra and geometry foundation established. It is not that they have no knowledge of these but it is less than what is required to do well at the higher levels of Math. Again, this is not abnormal. Many universities will accept students based on their academic record and testing while requiring them to take non credit Math review classes. If you wish to avoid this, do the review on your own. Conveniently there are many places on the internet for just such a review. Khan academy is where I would begin. Don't give up on your desire to study Physics based on just this situation. Yes you will have to do some extra work (is a half hour a day too much?). It can be done, you just have to work harder for a while. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I am simply going to copy paste from the answer I given from the question Whats the best way to get better at Maths? If you want to excel in maths you should follow these principles Determination : Be determined that you will understand everything that you want to know about maths no matter what.Rid yourself from negative thoughts: When we keep on telling ourselves that we can\u2019t do it we just can\u2019t we are feeding ouselves with negative energy and then we seriously can\u2019t even solve simple algebra, instead develop a positive attitude and tell yourself \u201cIT IS JUST MATH AND NOTHING ELSE\u201dPassion: Develop a passion for it and you are bound to gain success.Understand which mode of instruction is better for you: Are you an autodidact? Do you learn best by reading? Do you learn best by watching, listening or are you a hands on learner.Use resources available to you\u2014 the internet, books, videosDevelop a positive mind set.Have fun.Take it slow.Work hard.Never quit.And this method is proven effective for studying mathematics. Try to understand the basic concept of a given topic and build upon it do a practice problem and if you made mistakes it is okay. It is a stage of learning. Try to understand why you made those mistakes then deeply understand the ideas correct them and form a solid ground for those concepts. After that apply them to real life situations. You can also create your own way of solving questions just for fun :). Then steadily increase your difficulty. Build upon the concepts you previously learned and also do this if you think you faced yourself with a difficult question. Retreat to your basic ideas or do a question you can easily solve and deeply understand what you did there. Finally take it easy. Go out enjoy and never lose sight of your goal.  Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to study mathematics cumulatively. Any deficits in basic work and logic will show up later. These basic mistakes will kill your advanced work. The study of mathematics is not all technical, abstract, or systematic. This shows the subject character, but as its student you will need character. Each mathematician is different, a unique person. They share common aims with the mathematics and people, but in whole. If you reflect on the advanced studies in mathematics, or any subject, you will need a superior mind. There is no way around your own mental faculty, sufficient for good work. There are also few concepts to state, instead of your mind. It follows, most advanced work will come by studies in philosophy of mind and relevant subjects. They will augment mathematics advancement. ",

Our A-level (18+ exam) syllabus was crazy (we had to memorize over two hundred equations) and our teachers were poor. I assumed that a bit of private tuition once a week would let me catch up. It didn\u2019t, and that could have prevented me going to university. Learning the stuff by rote wasn\u2019t my issue; I was just too slow solving problems. Nobody can teach that.
