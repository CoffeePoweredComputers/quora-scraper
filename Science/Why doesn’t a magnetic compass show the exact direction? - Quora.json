            "answer_text": "The magnetic compass points to the \u201cmagnetic poles\u201d of the earth and not to the true poles of the turning earth. This nearly north pointing behaviour can be out by a few degrees and as much as 40 degrees or more. This error is called declination and is established for all areas of the earth. It is known in local areas by those that use magnetic compasses, like Scouts and boat owners. Here\u2019s a map showing the declination over the earth between true and magnetic bearings.  ",

            "answer_text": "The exact direction uses true north, which is different and far from the magnetic north. The magnetic north is separated from the true north by an angle of dip, which is just an angle of deviation of the magnetic north to the true north. A compass points to the magnetic north, and so gives a direction that seems different from that of a map (or gps that might be using true north. ",
