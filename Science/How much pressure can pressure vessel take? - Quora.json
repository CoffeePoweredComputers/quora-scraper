            "answer_text": "Answer is simple pressure for which you design it. now coming on to the calculation part there are many international standards like ASME SECTION 8 DIV 1 , DIN PED ETC which will give you thick for particular pressure vessel Above standards are limits the calculations to some standard geometries and are conservative in nature. If you want to work for lesser thickness you have to FEA of the same or subject to the pressure practically. If you want theory then please refer standard Som book which will give you insight on the forces acting ",
