            "answer_text": "For the bizarre standards of outside of current consensuses among scientists, academics (far more common than scientists and not really the same thing despite the PhD\u2019s), journalists and their editors/producers, etc. you\u2019d need: The fresh carcass preserved (refrigeration or frozen) delivered to a major brand-name university zoology lab or internationally known zoo for dissection and typing. Otherwise even with photographs it\u2019s probably just a common animal that looks odd (but not significantly mutated.)The lead on the dissection team needs to be very ambitious and articulate, looking at the findings as the way to progress their career rather than end it, so willing to risk the enormous credibility destruction that happens routinely to anything outside of the standard paradigms in academic science (and always has, believing in scientific consensus is the killer for actual research and progress.)Any video or photos are assumed to be expertly and expensively edited digitally despite the cost and lack of access to those services, and how creating a fake image is rarely profitable (unless you\u2019re a news network producer, then fake images and selective editing are your bread and butter so of course everyone else must do it too.)With the absence of a carcass from instantly killing it on sight or finding a dead one, there may be some DNA evidence (feces, saliva, urine, scraped flesh, shed scales or claws/nails, etc.) although no matter how distinguished the DNA lab team is, they\u2019ll be discredited and mocked like the ones who\u2019ve evaluated Sasquatch DNA recently.",

            "answer_text": "Actually an interesting question- what evidence would work? Photographs can be faked, eaisly. Videos too, if maybe less easily for a layman. Physical evidence- footprints, damage- can all be faked. Eyewitnesses, even lots of them, can be unreliable. Even a death wouldn't prove it (\u2018Florida murderer trys to blame killing on a dragon, more at eleven') A body could be tested, but good luck getting a reputable scientist who's willing to analyse your dragon. Without that, everyone would just assume you'd misindentified a big lizard or something. Even with it, they'd just assume your scientist had gone nuts. I think the only way I can think of is releasing the thing into time's square or suchlike, and even then most people would probably assume an elaborate hoax . Dragons are so archetypally \u2018not real' I doubt you could prove they existed in a way that people wouldn't assume a fake over dragons. I don't know what lesson to learn here, but there is certainly one. ",
