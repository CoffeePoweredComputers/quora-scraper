            "answer_text": "It depends on several factors. First, what's the density of the minerals that make up the sand in question. Keep in mind that Sand is a name refering to how big the grains are and not what they are made of. Though most sand is made either of Quartz (quartz density 2.65 g/cm\u00b3) or shells from marine animals made of Aragonite (aragonite density 2.9 g/cm\u00b3), there are exceptions (olivine density: 3.2 g/cm\u00b3). Remember that those density values are for the bulk, solid, compact minerals, and not for the sand made out of them.   Olivine Sand (Photo by Ezra Zeitler) Second, there is the matter of how compact the sand in question. Compaction means that weight reduces the spaces between grains by making them closer in a closed-packed arrangement. That reduces the total volume of sand but has little impact on weight so it reduces the porosity and increases density (see image below).    The angulosity or roundness of the grains also affect compaction, with angular grains being generally more easy to compact than rounded ones. Sands made out of animal shells are not only made of a denser mineral but also made of usually more angular fragments, so you can expect it to be somewhat denser than quartz sand.   Third, cementation and matrix also change density, and involve finer materials, like mud and clay (matrix) or chemical precipitates (cement) that occupy the spaces between grains, increasing the mass of the sand while having little effect on it's volume. Like compaction, this reduces the porosity and increases the density (see image below).   In the same way, wet sand has water in the pores instead of air, which also increases density akin to matrix and cement. In the end the typical, dry, non-compacted beach sand has the typical value of 1.6g/cm\u00b3, while similar sands with varying compaction, cementation, matrix and water ammount range from 1.5 g/cm\u00b3 to 1.8g/cm\u00b3.  Keep in mind this is just the common values for quartz/aragonite sand, Black sands made of placer minerals can typically reach 3 g/cm\u00b3 or more. ",
