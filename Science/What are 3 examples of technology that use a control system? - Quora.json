(And the microwave oven has a power supply!) The microwave oven controls power level by turning on and off the magnetron that produces the microwaves in a fixed pattern for the power level. It then turns it off and beeps at a predetermined time. (Some more advanced models do use some form of sensor and feedback). The others involving heating or cooling generally have binary on/off controls (e.g. a thermostat, that switches state at a preset level, with a small amount of hysteresis to avoid cycling back and forth too frequently). The rest are examples of proportional control. Both the human and the cat have a wide array of control systems. For example, the pH of their blood is tightly regulated through multiple feedback mechanisms; the most important of which are breathing (removes CO2) and the proton pumps in the kidneys (manages HCO3 levels). Glucose levels drive eating behaviors, creating complex interactions where the cat controls the human to produce food The sight of food in either signals the production of hormones called incretins, which regulate the speed of the digestive system. These signals also pre-load production of insulin, which is then further controlled by feedback from those glucose levels. Too low, and your brain dies. Too high, and you start to damage a wide array of tissues that get bound up with the surplus of glucose. Cats get diabetes, too. The ticking rate for clocks and watches is tightly controlled by a mechanism called a scapement (or \u201cescapement\u201d), with more or less energy being pumped into the oscillating part (balance wheel or pendulum). The earliest known example dates to 1285. You probably have only seen a rotary telephone dial in movies. But the rate that the dial returns is tightly controlled by a mechanical control system called a governor. At higher speeds, centrifugal force presses a weighted friction member against an interior friction surface, slowing it more. At slower speeds, it presses less or not at all. This is carefully designed (back in the early 1950s) to keep it very close to ten pulses per second across a long life of the friction surfaces wearing against each other and the gradual weakening of the drive spring.   (Diagrams from the Bell System Technical Journal, Nov-Dec 1954, \u201cA Governor for Telephone Dials: Principles of Design\u201d by W. Pferd, page 1267. This article had a big influence on my view of engineering when I first read it circa 1972-1973.) Here\u2019s some background on regulation of blood pH by the kidneys: 2.4 Renal Regulation of Acid-Base Balance And more broadly, this covers respiration and kidneys: Anatomy and Physiology. An example of power supply regulation relevant to most of the devices would be the Buck Mode Switching Regulator described in this tutorial: https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/power/switch-mode-power-supply.html ",
