            "answer_text": "The main reason was that Japan pursued a self sufficiency programme in the years between WWI and WWII. It was also sidelined when many treaties were negotiated between the \"Great Powers\" and its regional interests (security, economy) were likewise ignored by the Western nations who were fixated on their own spheres of influence. The Brits still of course saw the Japanese as a backward and not (civilized\" people using the standards of the Shanghai club as a measure. Typical Brit arrogance which was to cost them dearly in SE Asia .Japan preferred to be seen as a nation that produced shoddy goods for export,and one that was reclusive and backward all the while building up its naval forces with the long term goal of overthrowing the British and Dutch colonial empires and replacing them with a domestic, Japanese led economic and military association.Their technology was directed mainly to its naval forces with the army suffering as a result with poor tank and artillery development. The Mitsubishi Type O (Zero) was a revelation and shock to the West when it appeared. Very long ranged, extremely maneuverable and packing a powerful punch, to dogfight against it was to commit suicide in the antiquated aircraft available. The Long Lance torpedo was likewise a very unpleasant shock to the West as were the heavy cruisers and carriers.The flaws in all these were a lack of armour protection due to lack of raw materials and for increased speed/maneuverability, no self sealing fuel tanks and most vital of all - rudimentary manufacturing capability which led to supply chain chaos. Many parts were made in back yard sheds and these suffered from atrocious QC as would be expected. Given these limitations though, Japanese technology was reasonably advanced by WWII and certainly comparable to that of the allies. Keep in mind that the tech was designed for specific objectives. Designing and manufacturing even medium tanks for use in the tank hostile mountains and jungles of SE Asia would be a ludicrous waste of resources. Making heavy long ranged bombers (like the American B17 or the British Halifax) would likewise be a waste, as the Japanese plans called for a very limited area of control so medium bombers like the Betty would suffice ",

            "answer_text": " There is this country called the US, we gave them a crap ton of our own technology intel and other materials to make their weapons so advanced. Matter of fact, most weapons in Japan\u2019s military hardware comes from the US. I mean sure, Japan makes their own weapons, but most of that progress came from America, we helped them progress to that technology. While back in WW2 Japan had to make their weapons from scratch and they were on their own, which is the reason some of them were not so good. ",
