            "answer_text": "You are referring, of course, to the Florence Nightengale Environmental Theory. Florence Nightengale, who was born in 1820 and began her nursing training 1851 in Germany. She later served the injured soldiers during the Crimean war (1853-1856). In 1859, she published her views on nursing, hence her reputation as the \"first nursing theorist\". She strongly believed in formal education for nurses. he also was a statician, using bar and pie charts to highlight key points. In her book in her book Notes on Nursing: What it is, What it is Not, she said, unlike medicine, the goal of nursing \"is to put the patient in the best possible condition for nature to act upon him.\u201d he Nightingale Environmental Theory states that nursing \"is an act of utilizing the environment of the patient to assist him in his recovery.\" According to her, external conditions can prevent, suppress, or contribute to disease and death. She distinguished between three types of environment: physical, psychological, and social. The physical environment consists of physical elements where the patient is being treated. It consists of things like ventilation, air, light, noise, water, bedding, drainage, and diet. Cleanliness, she said, relates directly to disease prevention and patient mortality. The physical environment also influences the psychological and social environments of the person. The psychological environment requires activities to keep the mind active and involves communication with others about the patient and about other people. It can be affected by a negative physical environment which can lead to stress. Finally, the social environment consists of the patient's home or hospital room, as well as the total community. It can be affected by the physical environment by factors such as clean air, clean water, and proper drainage. While the Nightingale Environmental Theory has remained the bedrock of nursing care ever since, she has drawn some criticisms. For instance, she obviously did not anticipate today's environmental crises. Her insistence of providing fresh air to patients can be questioned in light of widespread air pollution, and ventilation which she strongly advocated can introduce impurities which in turn man infect open wounds and drainages such as in burn. She also rejected the germ theory. Nevertheless, her Environmental Theory revolutionized nursing practices and continues to influence both modern nursing and health care in many ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Florence nightingale (1820-1910), is considered as first nurse\r theorist. Her theory of nursing focused on the environment and she\r gave a detailed portrayal of each feature of environment in her theory. Nightingale\u2019s concepts of theory are brief, simple and easy to\r understand. It is still applicable to practice today. It makes the nurses\r to work more e\u0679cLentl\\ by using their own intuition about patient care\r and modLficDtLon of environment. Nightingale wrote about many of the essential beliefs of the natural\r hygiene movement. She referred to these hygienic beliefs as the \"laws\r of life\". In Nightingale theory the person himself is responsible for his\r health but collaboration with nurse and environmental factors.\r According to Florence nightingale many of the problems faced by\r the patients are not directly related to their ailment but the\r environment in which they are living. Florence nightingale theory is based on her personal experiences\r which she faces during providing care to sick and injured soldiers. In\r her theory she described that there is very strong relationship of a\r person with his/her environment, health and nurse. Being a nurse I\r need to know the ways by which I can provide better health to my\r patients as in my scenario I failed to take care of my patient in such\r way. $\u0456er this assignment I am able to identify the all environmental\r factors which can exaggerate of any patient health and ways to correct\r them in order to gain level of recovery and satisfaction among patients.
