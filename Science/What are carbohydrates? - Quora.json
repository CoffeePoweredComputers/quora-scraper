            "answer_text": "Carbohydrates are a major fuel source for our bodies, consisting of 45-65% of calories in the standard American diet. Carbohydrates are found in grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, soda, juice, and desserts, among other sources, and have become even more abundant and affordable in the United States because of the genetic modification of plants and products that make them easier to grow, as well as more palatable. Carbohydrate Structure: The basic structure of carbohydrates are carbon chains (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), with two functional groups: a polyhydroxyl, or \u2013OH group, and a carbonyl, or C=O group. There are three different classes of carbohydrate structure: Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates and cannot be broken down into smaller carbon chains. These are found in natural food sources, and are also the intermediate and end products of digestion and metabolism. Examples include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Oligosaccharides are made up of 2-10 monosaccharide units, the most common being disaccharides, which are 2 units. And polysaccharides are made of more than 11 monosaccharide units. Both classes of carbohydrates can be broken down into the monosaccharides they contain through digestion and metabolism. Common oligosaccharides include maltose, lactose, and sucrose. Common polysaccharides include amylose, amylopectin, cellulose, and glycogen. Carbohydrate Digestion and Absorption: The body can only absorb monosaccharides, so oligo- and polysaccharides must be broken down into monosaccharide units during digestion. This digestion happens in the oral cavity (or the mouth), the stomach, and the small intestine, and involves multiple enzymes, some of which are general, and some of which are specific to a certain type of carbohydrate. For example, the enzyme alpha amylase breaks down both oligo- and polysaccharide bonds in the oral cavity, while the enzyme lactase works specifically on the breakdown of the bonds in lactose, an oligosaccharide, in the small intestine. Implications in the Body: Carbohydrates, once they are broken down into glucose, are the first fuel source the body uses for energy in cells. Blood glucose levels must be tightly regulated within the body. Not enough blood glucose in the body, or hypoglycemia, in the short term can result in excessive hunger, fatigue, lightheadedness, and a lack of mental clarity because the body doesn't have enough fuel for energy. Too much blood glucose, or hyperglycemia, can result in weight gain, and in the long term can result in Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. ",

            "answer_text": "Carbohydrate is a term that actually covers three separate groups: sugar, starch and fiber. In its simplest form, a carbohydrate is glucose, a fuel our bodies can burn quickly and efficiently. There is more than one type of sugar, but glucose is the most basic and most easily metabolized by the body. Starch is what most people think of as carbohydrates. More often than not, using starch and carbohydrate interchangeably is entirely fine. A starch is simply a more complex form of sugar that is broken down by the body into glucose. Dietary fiber is most often plant matter and is found in many of the same foods as starches, such as whole grains. Fiber can\u2019t be broken down into sugar and is most beneficial because of the indigestible compounds it contains. These, rather than being broken down by the body, are used by bacteria in the body for multiple benefits. Fiber is very important to proper health. Carbohydrates in your diet When it comes to how many or how few carbs you need in your diet, it can be something of a tricky business. Olumia Life is specifically designed to make this process easier. In fact, for most people, adding carbs to your diet is not an issue, it\u2019s determining how much you need to cut back. Carbs, particularly sugar and starch, are a major part of the epidemic of obesity and being overweight, coupled with not enough exercise, poor sleep, etc. We often have too many carbs in our diet due to eating overly processed food, improper serving sizes and snacking poorly. Starch and sugar is often used to improve the taste of frozen foods (especially low-fat ones) or to extend the shelf-life of baked goods. Not that the cinnamon rolls you find in a gas station were healthy before, but those plastic-wrapped bricks are even more unhealthy than fresh ones. Cutting out starches completely, though, isn\u2019t the answer. For proof that starch can be part of a healthy diet you can simply look at the cuisine of many Asian and Mediterranean countries. Whether it\u2019s pitas, pasta or rice, both areas are marked by very healthy, long lives because of the amount of starch they consume. (Of course other factors, like olive oil and fish consumption, play a part in that as well.) ",
