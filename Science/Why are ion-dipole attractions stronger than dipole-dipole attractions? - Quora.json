            "answer_text": "Ions are permanent charges and the charge is a full charge. What I mean can be explained with an example. If a Na (sodium) atom loses an electron completely and becomes Na+ ion, it now has an excess proton compared to number of electrons. It is a full positive charge residing permanently on the Na+. But a dipole may be a permanent dipole, or an induced dipole. A large organic molecule has a large electron cloud covering the entire molecule. Let us assume that the molecule is neutral and not polarised. Now if a sodium ion (Na+) comes near this molecule, the large electron cloud will be attracted by Na+ and pulled towards it. Therefore the end of the molecule near the Na+ ion becomes rich in electrons and develops a partial negative charge (electrons only moved slightly from their equilibrium positions; no electrons were lost, hence partial charge), and the other end where the electron cloud is now thin develops a partial positive charge. The molecule has now become a dipole and the polarisation was induced by the presence of the Na+ ion; hence it is an induced dipole. Permanent or not, dipoles have only partial charges at the ends because electrons only shift their positions. They are not completely lost. Now we have three possibilities: (1) Attraction between two ions (ie. between two full charges) like Na+ and Cl-. This will be the strongest. (2) Attraction between an ion and a dipole (ie. between a full charge and a partial charge). This will be weaker than the attraction between two ions, right? (3) Attraction between a dipole and another dipole (ie. between two partial charges). This will be the weakest of the three. If you like this answer, please upvote as a token of your appreciation. ",
