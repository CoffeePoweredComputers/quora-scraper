            "answer_text": "Very interesting question mainly because it illustrates a big reason why we are only a few steps away today from the cave we came from. I should modify that, only some of us today exists in this state, it appears the military should be excluded. One could say, one big hurdle to Einstein\u2019s Unified Field Theory was that it did not include the strong force, which is, a huge factor in current scientific thinking, one of the major forces of their \u2018Standard Model\u2019 of the Universe. For heaven\u2019s sake what would possibly keep those protons and neutrons within the atoms nucleus together without any strong force? Unified Field Theory The 20th century science we are being taught today is a religious dogma based upon mathematical equations developed by theoretical physicists. It is highly guarded by a priesthood of very narrow minded individuals that hold steadfast to a \u2018closed\u2019 mathematical science; mainly because of a bias against the other religious worlds. Einstein, was a theoretical physicist also, thus all his theories were based upon equations. The Unified Field Theory (UFT) consisted of sixteen very complex Riemannian geometry and tensor matrix equations, which ten were related to gravity and the remaining six to the electromagnetic force. The electromagnetic force and the weak force were combined into what is called an electroweak force; therefore, the only force not included in the UFT was the strong force. QM and 4th spatial dimension The strong force missing was one reason why it was discarded, but was it the only reason? Einstein was not a follower of Quantum Mechanics (QM), and his UFT utilized Kaluza\u2019s 4-dimension spatial geometry which resides outside QM. In viewing Einstein\u2019s sixteen equations, all ten for gravity could be solved independently, versus the six electromagnetic equations which was totally dependent upon the gravity equations. From this it appears that physical matter was totally dependent upon gravity to form versus gravity being dependent upon matter\u2019s mass. What is strange, logically (not mathematics), the mass being created by science\u2019s nucleus is probably totally dependent upon the same force that mass is being created by. Using Einstein\u2019s UFT and science\u2019s QM we have a big paradox. Gravity being the \u2018strong force\u2019 One could come to a conclusion using Einstein\u2019s UFT, gravity coming through a 4th dimension could create the electromagnetic force which is needed to create matter. Where would the strong force be to hold the quarks together and thus the nucleus of the atom. Gravity is the weakest force in Nature, how could it be the \u2018strong force\u2019? We measure gravity outside matter, this measurement is based upon the summation of all the forces within what we call atoms, or matter. One may wonder that what we measure gravity outside the matter may just be some residual, or an overabundance of the total gravity to create the matter. Now here is a potential key to this scenario, why do we need a 4th dimension? Threat to science\u2019s religious thinking We do not need another dimension in QM and the \u2018Standard Model\u2019, these theories are both \u2018closed\u2019 and \u2018static\u2019 scientific theories, all predicated upon no intelligence and no outside influence within the Universe\u2019s three-spatial dimensions. Could that 4th spatial dimension be bringing more than just gravity and the electromagnetic forces into our three dimensions? Now one can see where the real potential problem could arise within the priesthood; this could change their whole religious world. Maybe with their 26+ mathematics courses creating unlimited number of equations, all proven with experiments, could not be the complete solution to how the Universe started and works today. Sacrilege complete heresy! An UFT and an \u2018open physics\u2019 It appears both the Nazis in the past and today\u2019s military hinging their projects on a different science than being taught today. Once we got into space, they came to the conclusion that there was a previous civilization far superior to our rudimentary science we are being taught today. Their signature is left throughout our solar system, and it has become evident we are just mere steps from the mouth of the cave and will remain there as long as we keep this current scientific thinking. Einstein\u2019s and the German physicist Kaluza\u2019s UFTs from the 1920\u2019s was much closer to reality than where we are today. Both these geniuses were proposing, in effect, an open physics. A physics that Tesla, the Nazis and the current U.S. military is using to create their technology projects. So don\u2019t think Einstein\u2019s theory of everything has totally vanished; it is only nonexistent in the current rudimentary science being taught today. Reach the stars It should be noted, this advanced ancient civilization was not playing the NASA game, they were deep into the solar system, and probably far beyond. Once we get by this rudimentary science and deeper into space, we can then verify this, and more important we also will be able to reach the stars. \u201cIt isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so.\u201d -Will Rogers ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t verify this and I don\u2019t even recall where I read it, but the claim has made that the Einstein was working on his \u201ctheory of everything\u201d, writing in his notebook, on the day he died. Genius has its limits, though\u2014Einstein\u2019s conception of quantum mechanics and thus one pillar on which he would have to base a theory was no longer generally accepted and is now contradicted by a substantial amount of experimental evidence. It\u2019s pretty hard to produce a successful theory when you start off disagreeing with reality. ",
