I am considerably elder than you and let me tell you, I've wondered just the same, as much as I hate having felt that way, I hated my mom for not letting me date back then. Now that I am in an age where I can be open about dates and my relationship with my parents, let me tell you that your parents know most of the times what's best for you. You are still young at heart and trust me sweetheart heartbreaks hurt more than physical pain ever could. However, I genuinely appreciate you taking your parents consent as I don't see most young kids doing that these days. So, pls stay patient for just a couple of years and trust your parents :) XOXO, Yagna. ",
