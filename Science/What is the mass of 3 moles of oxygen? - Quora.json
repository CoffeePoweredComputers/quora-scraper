            "answer_text": "One mole of oxygen atoms has a mass of 16g. So three moles of oxygen atoms would have a mass of 48g. However, you would never get moles of oxygen \u201catoms\u201d, as oxygen always pairs up into molecules of O2. And one mole of oxygen molecules has a mass of 32g, so three moles would have a mass of 96g. Oxygen atoms occur naturally, but only temporarily, as they are highly reactive. So you wouldn\u2019t naturally get a mole of oxygen atoms. ",
