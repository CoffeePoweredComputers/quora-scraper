            "answer_text": "I discuss this at length on my blog. Revenge of the spies. How to become a target for the CIA, MI6, FSB and Mossad all at once. I have extracted the portion dealing with the origins of Novichoks here. As Iran produced Novichoks in 2016, it seems likely that 20 or 30 countries could make them.  Mirzayanov, who did not work in the lab itself, says that only the most sophisticated countries could make Novichoks. This list would be the US, the UK, France and Russia. Actually, in 2016, Iran declared that it had made five members of the Novichoks family. If Iran can make Novichoks there are probably at least 20-30 other countries with the capability. Iran gave the spectral data to analyse the agents to the OPCW. The OPCW is therefore very well-placed to analyze the British samples. Novichoks are apparently not difficult to make in principle. Two relatively innocuous agrochemical precursors can be carried by an individual. Creating deadly Novichok is apparently just an issue of mixing together. How this produces a powder at first pass is beyond me. However, before being put into weapon it must be made and tested. The big problem is to avoid killing yourself after mixing the precursors. The huge investments at government run CBW sites Include enormous levels of protection against accidental exposure. A sufficiently desperate mafia chemist might decide to work with a fume cupboard, a Hazmat suit and a sealed room with a shower outside dispensing detergent based shampoo. After all, household detergent could neutralise traces left behind, particularly in the case of a fast decaying agent. There are two claims about potential Soviet sources. Mirzayanov says that the material was made in Nukus, a facility in Uzbekistan. The precursors came from a pesticide factory in Kazakhstan. US inspectors pulled down the Uzbekistan facility in 1999, somewhat late, considering that the Soviet Union fell in 1991. If the material had any shelf life, it could have been a leftover from Nukus. Another option for Russian production is Shikhany near Saratov where my office is based. This is a more serious option as a source. Saratov was a closed city, precisely because of the presence of this facility and the nearby Engels Air Force Base for long-range bombers. Without samples of the Russian Novichoks, it is impossible to say that the poison came from Russia. It can be done by looking for impurities in Russian samples, if they exist, they might correspond to a samplw of known Russian origin. It can be done less reliably by looking for matching impurities in the precursors. It could just possibly be done by looking at the ratios of phosphorus isotopes in the compound. This could indicate the general area in which the phosphates were mined. Unfortunately Russia is one of the biggest exporters of phosphates in the world so Russian phosphates could be anywhere. The only useful conclusion would be their absence proving that they didn't come from Russia. ",

Most disgusting fact is that they hit Syria the night before OPCW inspectors arrived to investigate. It is witch hunt method, sources are \u2018classified, top-secret, intelligence, griffed\u2019. It is not a proper manner to do international relations.  Skripal case - such a stupid crime, and russians are not stupid at all and more it doesn\u2019t benefit Russia. If we put emotions aside and think logically - a long-ago-retired russian spy is poisoned March 2018. I\u2019d suppose he could prove or disprove some facts, so we must look who may be interested in these facts, who is currently investigating something important about Russia. Some state-level poisoner, because an ordinary citizen couldn\u2019t access chemicals.  an update to support my answer. Alexander Shulgin russian representative at OPCW demonstrated a document by United States Patent and Trademark Office, dated December 1, 2015. supposedly this http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=2&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=58&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=bullet.ABTX.&s2=cavity&OS=ABST/bullet+AND+cavity&RS=ABST/bullet+AND+cavity Key moment for me is the name \u2018Novichok\u2019 in the text of patent. USSR programm on chemical research of this type had name \u2018Foliant\u2019 and the group of agents had names like \u2018A-234\u2019. Alexander Shulgin says there are 140 patents on \u2018Novichok\u2019 keyword at Patent search - Patent Attorneys - Patent Applications - Patent Sale and it means that USA developed and patented nerve agents of Novichok type. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Another update by Mr. Craig Murray, British ex-ambassador Where They Tell You Not to Look - Craig Murray I see direct connection Skripal - Miller - Cristopher Steel - Trump\u2019s russian dossier And this reason seems to me more fitting into Skripal\u2019s poisoning case than any other ",

These things are not easy to create, if they were, there would be dead amateur chemists and school children all over the world. They have motive plus weapon plus previous record of numerous murders of ex-spies including using radio active materials, or exotic poison pellets in umbrellas. Is a bit more than a guess. Total resistance to co-operation from Russia, as with other murders such as the polonium murder, does more than suggest a complicity at the very least. (Abnormal radiation was detected on the seats of the agents on the planes out of and back to Russia.) Personally I think Russia deliberately uses these \u201cclumsy methods\u201d so that everyone knows that the Russian State, murders its ex-spies. If they used bullets it could have been a dispute with anyone. The Russians WANT those ex-spies to know who it is. And don\u2019t care about the reactions of the West. They just deny it, and appeal to a public which has been fed crap for so many generations they have no hope of objectivity. There is no doubt that there is a strong link between criticising Putin or opposing him politically and being dead, or locked up for tax evasion. Every one who has started to look like a possible challenger has come to a bad end. ",

However you need more than the means to obtain a suspect in an attempted murder case, you need three factors: means, opportunity and motive. There are two actors who had the means: Russia and Iran. Of those only Russia ever had a motive to kill the man, we can discount Iranian agent being behind the poisoning as lacking a motive and we\u2019re only left with Russia as a result. However the question is about where the poison was manufactured, which is a conjecture that follows from this point. It might be that Iran provided the poison to Russia, but this seems needlessly complicated. Why would Russia use Iranian poison if they can make their own? Therefore the poison originated in Russia, in all likelyhood. MI6 can probably tell who brought it in and when, but disclosing that to the general public would threaten to expose their agents in Russia and you\u2019ve just witnessed how they treat those. ",

The British \u201cultimatum\u201d demanded that the Russian government explain how a nerve agent that was only ever produced in Russia (it was actually Uzbekistan but don\u2019t worry about it) ended up in Britain. They can, however, reasonably assume that it was produced in Russia or the USSR. It could have feasibly been produced outside of Russia, but that seems unlikely given the knowledge of how to make it is probably a well-guarded secret. How it got outside of Russia is anybody\u2019s guess, especially given that Russia had supposedly destroyed its last stores of chemical weapons. Whether it is therefore reasonable to assume that the Russian government would have any idea what Novichok was doing outside Russia is up for debate. I\u2019m still not entirely convinced that it even was Novichok. If the only known supplies are in Russia, how exactly is Theresa May able to ascertain that it was a mysterious nerve agent that only exists in Russia that we don\u2019t know the chemical composition of or anything? The same people who are now asserting that Russia has undeclared supplies of Novichok ready to unleash upon the world once also declared that Iraq had undeclared WMDs and\u2026well, you know the drill.

It is almost impossible to identify the laboratory where the chemical agent was produced. Think about this- the agent is characterized by the exact chemical formula, meaning the type and number of atoms plus their spacial structure. It doesn\u2019t matter where the chemical produced since it has the same exact chemical formula. The only thing if there are certain contamination or packaging, which can point to the location. But for the pure substance it can not be determined where it was produced. It is a common knowledge for the experts in the field. There are twenty countries producing Novichok; the scientific papers regarding the Novichok appear regularly. By the way, Russia is not among these twenty countries. The name Novichok was introduced to the line of nerve agents by somebody in the English-speaking country, not Russia, since Novichok (in Russian means novel) sounds very Russian and plus sounds like \u201cnow we chock\u201d, which is a simple psychological trick to induce negative connotation towards Russia.

In 1999 the entire unit was dismantled and decontaminated, under OPCW supervision. We will need to hear from OPCW whether all the Novichok precursor chemicals [it is a \u201cbinary\u201d agent, only becoming fully toxic when two or more less toxic precursors are mixed together] were fully accounted for and safely disposed of. It would also be necessary for those precursors to be stable and effective over 26 years. But the key point is that both sites were at all times under tight Soviet/Russian military control. So any possible leak is a Russian government responsibility. ",

It could have been produced anywhere, including the UK. Russians are indeed the inventors and during 80s they probably were world leaders in best knowing how to produce an agent that interacts with the human enzymes to paralyze them in the same way insecticides paralyze the insects but now it seems that a large part of it is common knowledge for chemists working in the field except the weaponization, delivery etc. So the Brits (including their then PM, Theresa May) have been lying.
