            "answer_text": "First of all there is no guarantee that current laws of physics are true. Laws of physics are not absolute they were created for the purpose of human understanding on how universe works. They are based on logical deduction of human. A physicist work is to define them based on their understanding. So whenever they find something new about universe they will generalise new law. Also even in our universe , a place exist where current physics laws hold no meaning and that place is  ",

            "answer_text": "A law of physics (any falsifiable scientific theory) is only valid until disproven. Recall that in the 1600s Newton and Kepler worked out mechanics, gravity, elliptical orbital motion. Those equations are still valid, but a lot of science was unknown to them, like atomic theory, quantum mechanics, etc. There are still unsolved problems, like a grand unified theory, that could be resolved in our future.
