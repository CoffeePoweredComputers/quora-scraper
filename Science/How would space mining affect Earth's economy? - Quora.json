            "answer_text": "Getting things on and off Earth is an expensive proposition.  Space mining would likely impact very few industries.  Certain precious metals like the platinum group are comparatively common in space versus Earth's surface.  In those cases it might actually make economic sense to ship it down to the surface.  For most other materials it's just too expensive to get it down here.   We can take as an example the petroleum industry.  Oil in the Persian Gulf, parts of the southwest US and select other locations on Earth takes almost no effort to drill.  It's fairly close to the surface and has enough internal pressure to require almost no injected pressure.  And the crude that comes out takes minimal refinement.  Tar sands, on the other hand, are very poor sources of petroleum.  It's dirty, polluting, takes a number of advanced (read expensive) technologies and effort, and requires techniques like fracking to extract.  20-30 years ago, high grade crude oils were fairly plentiful and therefore cheap.  As a result, tar sands weren't considered a particularly viable resource, economically.  Now it's a different story.  Less high grade crude, more incentive for tar sands exploration. The problem is, without significant technological advancement, resources like tar sands will never really bring the price down, only stabilize it.  It acts as a ceiling, and usually a temporary one.  Minerals mined in space would have similar problems.  Certain rare materials it may actually be cheaper and it may bring their prices down.  But for most materials it would have little immediate impact.  And for the ones where the price eventually rises enough to make it a viable option, it would only act as a price ceiling. Now, as Mr. Treitel notes, none of this applies to in-space manufacturing.  The part that makes asteroid mining so expensive is Earth's gravity well.  If we never leave orbit or a Lagrange point, for instance, we don't incur that cost.  What's more, it may be significantly cheaper to mine, process and use space-derived raw materials for space operations.  And that's certainly what a lot of up-and-coming space companies are banking on.  For the moment, we're just taking very small steps in that direction.  We've never mined an asteroid or processed an ore in space.  We might have all the pieces we need, but we need to solve problems like containment in microgravity and torque exerted on spacecraft during processes that require centrifuges or other rotating processes.  Either way, we're likely a good way off from making it happen.  Possibly within a lifetime, but almost certainly not within the next 20 years. ",

The main use for materials mined and (eventually) products manufactured in space will be to make it easier and cheaper to do things in space. The least implausible major effect on Earth may turn out to be the ability to build solar power plants and beam the power to Earth, but we may end up not even needing that power.
