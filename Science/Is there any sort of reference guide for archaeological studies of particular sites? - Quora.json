            "answer_text": "There are a few out there. Some are clunky and you will have to contact and sometimes pay for the information. I will focus mainly on UK sources but some cross over to other areas as well. A bit of background here. Commercial archaeology produces reports for every single site whether there is archaeology or not as this is part of the planning process. Those reports are often not published as they are of little impact (think 1 undated ditch segment type sites)it is only the more important sites that are published in journals. Companies will create monographs though. These are sometimes area specific. This will include a selection of decent sites within the area that have been excavated by a company. As they are monographs which are published books they cost money to buy. For an example check here Thames Valley Archaeological Services (Yes I do work for the company). Publishers of Academic Archaeology also sells a variety of monographs but you will have to search around to find area specific ones. BAR Publishing; Academic Archaeology since 1974 these were invaluable when I was at university. They have time periods and areas as well as specific finds types and large sites etc. Some companies will publish their grey literature on their websites. This is becoming more common with the ease of use the internet allows. If you follow that TVAS link above and have a browse you will find a map based listing of sites. The next port of call will be the HER reference. When you write a desktop assessment in archaeology you are doing that based on the amount of archaeology that has been found in the area. The way this is done is to search in the radius of the proposed site. The more important the site the wider the area it impacts, you will also get all of the small sites that are closer. For this you want to be using something like this HeritageGateway - Historic Environment Records. The amount of work that we do and the information that we gather as a company means we have to pay but I don\u2019t know the level of detail that can be gathered without that access. You can do this in a roundabout way though. You can find a close by site that is relatively recent and read the archaeological background in the report. You will be able to glean a lot of information from that. Either way an HER search will do exactly what you describe in the UK, well England at least. Next you get OASIS. As archaeologists we submit our information to these databases. OASIS: Main. This is a project to do exactly what you want. It has been going for a long time now and I know we submit information to them. Again this is a resource that has a lot of information and if you want to do searches then going through to ADS Archaeology Data Service, which is linked to the OASIS project, will give you a ton of information. As far as information gathering in other countries there are likely to be similar systems in place. A lot of the systems for this gathering are set up by archaeologists and are often linked to universities. This means that the global archaeological community will know of these ideas. As the reporting is not compulsory (well sort of but that isn\u2019t relevant here) the emphasis is on the archaeologist to disseminate the work. Even with all of this information one of the best methods is to read the reports. In reports you will have references you can chase and from there you can look at those site reports and again follow references. While such resources are useful there is no getting around the having to study, gather and create your own database. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak to how British archaeologists deal with the matter. In the US, if you are an accredited archaeologist and you are conducting legitimate research many states have information systems operated by the Office of Historic Preservation. You can acquire information regarding specific archaeological sites and any related reports that have been indexed by the office. That is highly likely to be far from a complete list. The traditional approach has been to read reports, take notes on citations, the chase those down, rinse and repeat. There are several initiatives to implement more comprehensively useful databases, e.g. National Archeological Database, but none of these are remotely near \u201ccomplete\u201d sources. ",
