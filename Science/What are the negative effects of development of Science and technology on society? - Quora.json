            "answer_text": "The following is the final paragraph of a piece I wrote in response to the question: \u201cHow did the production of goods change during the Industrial Revolution\u201d. This is it: \u201cFinally, apart from the down-side I mentioned above, there was one other even more dreadful consequence of the Industrial Revolution. It was not only luxuries and everyday items which were being produced to an enormous extent, but also the \u2018tools\u2019 of war. The War between the States is perhaps regarded as the first conflict in which mass produced weapons - together with mechanized transport - resulted in killing on an industrial scale. With estimates of up to a million dead in that conflict alone, the Industrial Revolution cannot be said to have benefited everyone.\u201d I will now add, that perhaps the greatest negative effect of science and technology, has been the development of nuclear weapons. However, with the invention of these weapons, also came nuclear power. This latter, if managed properly and with all due safeguards in place, can be a great advantage for humanity. Leaving science aside for the moment, it is difficult to call to mind any technology which has had no negative effects. Even the innocent automobile can be a killer. When humans invented the stone hand ax, and the sling, not only were they used to bring down their food, but also to bring down each other...which in some instances was probably exactly the same thing. When tools and weapons are interchangeable, the latter, in so far as human beings as a whole is concerned, will always be a negative aspect. ",
