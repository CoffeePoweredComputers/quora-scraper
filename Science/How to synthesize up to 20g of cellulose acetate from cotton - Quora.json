            "answer_text": "I have to wonder why you want to do this as cellulose acetate is commercially available, you can even buy it as clear film from office or graphic supply shops. I notice from your other questions that you are interested in creating a polymer membrane for extraction of CO2 from flue gas. Chemically, the polymer is made by first complete acetylation to give the triacetate, which is then partly hydrolysed to the diacetate.  (This diagram shows sulphate as a major product of the first stage, when it is in fact a temporary intermediate which is converted to the triacetate.) Note that the 2 main synthetic methods use solvents (acetic acid or methylene chloride) which fully dissolve the product, so you would not preserve the fibrous properties of cotton, see Cellulose acetate - Wikipedia: The anhydroglucose unit is the fundamental repeating structure of cellulose and has three hydroxyl groups which can react to form acetate esters. The most common form of cellulose acetate fiber has an acetate group on approximately two of every three hydroxyls. This cellulose diacetate is known as secondary acetate, or simply as \"acetate\". Acetylating the cellulose: In the commercial production of cellulose acetates, the acetic acid process or the methylene chloride process are usually used for acetylation. In acetic acid processes, the pre-treated cellulose mass is reacted in an acetylation mixture of the solvent acetic acid with an excess of acetic anhydride, which serves as an esterification agent, and with sulphuric acid as a catalyst under vigorous mechanical mixing. The reaction is highly exothermic and therefore intensive cooling of the reaction vessels is required. The esterification process is terminated by adding water when a highly viscous clear reaction mixture has formed from the fibrous pulp. This solution must be gel-free and have the desired viscosity. In the methylene chloride process, methylene chloride is used in the acetylation mixture as a solvent instead of acetic acid. Since the low-boiling methylene chloride can be easily removed by distillation, process control is achieved even with highly viscous solutions. Even at low temperatures it can dissolve cellulose triacetate very well. A small amount of sulfuric acid can used as a catalyst, but often also perchloric acid. However, acetic acid is usually also formed as a by-product of the reaction, so that the solvent is ultimately a mixture of methylene chloride, acetic anhydride and acetic acid. A very rare heterogeneous process is the fiber acetate process, which is only used for the production of cellulose triacetate as an end product. In this process, the cellulose is suspended in a non-solvent (such as benzene) and esterified with acetic anhydride in the presence of perchloric acid as catalyst. I tried searching for cellulose acetate fabric, as this was once popular in the 1950s, but it seems it has been replaced with stronger semi-synthetic fibres like rayon and viscose. You could buy cellulose acetate fibre,[1] used today as cigarette filters, and attempt to form it into a membrane, perhaps by glueing sheets together. If you want to create a polymer membrane with a precise structure I guess you could buy some kind of extrusion machine, then load it with a solution of commercial cellulose acetate film. Suitable solvents might be acetone, methylene chloride or ethyl acetate, though information on solvents is somewhat contradictory, you might need to experiment with mixtures.[2,3] Refs.
