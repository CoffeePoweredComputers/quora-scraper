            "answer_text": "All systems are against human nature\u2026 Not only communism. As systems didn\u2019t exist before us. And those who created them were those interested in gaining power by controlling the system into which peoples had to evolve in.The problem with Communism is that its premise is trying to go against that trend, but while it sounds great on paper, once you try to apply it, the weak still try to use it to their advantage and gain power from it\u2026 In other words, true communism never existed\u2026But that doesn\u2019t mean market economy is any better. As there again, who controls the system, controls the world. No wonder during the last economic crisis we heard for the first time, the term: Too big to fail, applying to industries who make that system tick\u2026 As all systems must follow a thermodynamic law that states that every system who works to create order out of chaos must spend more and more energy to continue doing so, at which point energy may come to lack and trigger a return to chaos\u2026 It\u2019s actually how Rome civilization has fallen, spreading too thin and having no means to expend its institutions around its empire\u2026 But with market state, it's not only around an empire that the economic system has spread, but around the world. Thanks to globalization\u2026 So you can bet that if systems all go against nature (its laws at least), they also go against our own nature, as we come from it\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I admire the \u201cpure\u201d communist theory. But I do think it is incomplete and that is its fundamental weakness and why it cannot sustain itself for too long. The more risk-averse the population is and the more common cultured with common values like teamwork, etc., the greater the possibility it could be marginally self sustaining. But humans have a spectrum from very low risk averse to extremely high risk averse. Communism really only applies to the higher risk averse folks. Free enterprise and capitalism gives a place for the low risk averse to thrive and drive material progress but struggles with addressing the very high risk averse. Communism has no tolerance for the low risk averse folks. But in a voluntary utopian communal sense, communism seems like a good option for the highly risk averse. ",
