            "answer_text": "We do not all have ALL the same ancestors but pretty close since the world population used to be under 20,000 people (or even fewer) due to a population crash in the 70,000 BC range, and some people had no kids so if you are alive now you share ancestry with virtually everyone alive. But there are some contributions from other human species we don\u2019t all share. \u201cDenisovans\u201d mated at least twice in (probably) Asia with our species and people in Melanesia show it in their DNA the most and Europeans and Africans not at all. But this doesn\u2019t mean it affects how they look necessarily. Neanderthals mated at least twice (probably in West Asia) with our species and everyone outside Africa and many in Africa show it in their DNA (our species migrated back to Africa after leaving). I don\u2019t know if every tribal group in Africa has been tested for it yet to see how far their genes spread after re-introduction in Africa. It is believed that in 300,000 BC our species only lived in Africa and nowhere else. Currently it is thought that we had various populations spread out in various places in Africa at some time between 300,000 and 70,000 BC when, as noted, our population fell. Where we lived at that time is unknown but South Africa is suspected (maybe in caves). When exactly our species first left Africa is unknown since arguments about finds are still the subject of dispute as to date; it might have been before this point or afterward. Nor do we know when the look of modern \u201craces\u201d emerged in time nor by place on the planet, only suspicions. Europeans definitely share a common ancestor with Native Amerindians and maybe somewhere between Siberia and Ukraine is where they lived. East Asians appear to have replaced earlier people as did South Asians. Andaman Islanders are pretty old and despite their looks are not closely related to west Africans, as are Australian Aborigines and Papuans. Khoisan, Twa (pygmies) and some people in Tanzania are thought to be the oldest still-existing groups known. Khoisan have epicanthic eyefolds so maybe they were carried out of of Africa. Mitochondrial DNA and non-mitochondrial DNA and models of mutation rates and lack of diversity in our species at the DNA level do support the theory that we have a common male and (at a different time) common female ancestor in all our lines. But you also have ancestors I don\u2019t have and vice versa. It wasn\u2019t two people that had kids who intermarried in an endless line but 20,000 people who did so, some not having any kids, some having kids that moved away and had kids elsewhere, some having new mutations their great-grandparents didn\u2019t have etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s complicated, but yes, all humans share common ancestors. It goes something like this: there are individual common ancestors to all humans, sometimes referred to as \u201cmitochondrial Eve\u201d and \u201cY-chromosome Adam.\u201d That is, all humans are direct descendants of a particular woman who lived about 150,000 years ago, while all men are direct descendants of a man who lived about 200,000 years ago. There were other humans around who contributed other genes to the species, but because mitochondria and the Y chromosome have unique properties which make them traceable through specific male and female lines, we can trace those specific batches of genes back to particular individuals. Beyond that, all significant populations outside of Africa can be traced back to an initial wave of expansion out of Africa dating back to somewhere around 60,000 years ago. \u201cRace\u201d is a pseudoscientific concept which is thoroughly rejected as a biological category by modern anthropology, but everybody\u2014white people, Indians, East Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans\u2014from outside of Africa is descended from that particular subset of Africans which, for whatever reason, left Africa at that time. There\u2019s also a modest admixture of genes from related species to those outside-of-Africa populations. All of those outside-of-Africa populations have some Neanderthal genes kicking around (that wave of Homo sapiens leaving Africa encountered and interbred with Neanderthals in the Middle East on their way out to the rest of the world), and populations to the far east have additional genes from Denisovans, another closely related species. However, those genes have very little to do with the characteristics associated with race. Most of those traits like skin color and hair texture are a result of adaptations which arose long after those related near-human species were dead and gone or of genetic drift as founder populations of humans multiplied through new regions.

The idea that each of the \u201craces\u201d evolved in a separate geographical location and then interbred to form a single species is called Multiregional Hypothesis. Mongoloids evolved in eastern Asia, whites in Europe, and blacks in Africa. That would be the only instance in evolution I am aware of where something like that happened. All the rest of evolution shows species evolving in one locality, then expanding their range and replacing closely related species. However, the genetic data is overwhelming. Comparing DNA sequences from genomes of people all over the globe conclusively shows that all humans come from an ancestral population in Africa.

The last male common ancestor of all extant human populations likely lived between 160,000 and 300,000 years ago, in Africa: Y-chromosomal Adam - Wikipedia The last female common ancestor of all extant human populations likely lived about 150,000 years ago, in Africa: Mitochondrial Eve - Wikipedia (Note that there is no requirement, nor do anthropologists think, that both existed in the same population at the same time.) However, recent statistical work places the most recent common ancestor (sex unknown) much closer to us in time, perhaps as little as 1,000 to 5,000 years ago, somewhere in the Middle East or greater Eurasia: 'Most recent common ancestor' of all living humans surprisingly recent (That does not mean that their ancestors weren\u2019t human- it means that that person\u2019s genetic line continued while all others died out.) \u201c\u2026or do different groups of human share different ancestors with different origins?\u201d No. That is polygenism: Polygenism - Wikipedia It is inherently racist. The concept is often found in the creation myths of isolated cultures like the Mbuti pygmies of Congo, who believed a deity created different kinds of humans from black, red, and white clay. More recently it was popular among certain groups to promote the enslavement and slaughter of the inhabitants of Roman, and later European colonies on the grounds that people who don\u2019t look like you were separate creations by the Gods, or not descended from the Biblical Adam and Eve and were therefore not humans at all. Modern genetics falsifies polygenism. We know that Neanderthals and Denisovans have a common ancestor (Heidelbergensis) who left Africa between 600,000 and 744,000 years ago, and that they diverged from each other about 200,000 years later. Denisovan - Wikipedia The ancestors of modern humans left Africa later and interbred with both groups. Africa is the common origin not just of modern humans of all kinds but also of those extinct members of genus Homo, some of whose genes we still carry within us. It is also the home of the descendants of those who never migrated out of Africa, and they are interfertile with all existing human populations outside Africa. We are all the same species. We are all humans. ",

There\u2019s other points, such as last common mitochondrial ancestor. Since mitochondria only pass down through the female line we can track it and estimate how far back you have to go to reach a point where there\u2019s one common female ancestor. There were other women alive at the time but their daughters or granddaughters died or they failed to have daughters.  The matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans, i.e., the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers. This was probably some time around about 150,000 years ago. You can look at the Y chromosome the same way since it only passes from father to son. The last common male ancestor was probably around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. The most recent common human ancestors would probably have been somewhere in africa.  ",

Our Y chromosomes and mitochondria are all descended from these single people, to be sure, but there were many others alive at the time and our autosomal DNA came from them as well. But we all do share common ancestors, as people didn\u2019t just appear out of thin air! It was believed for some time that our development was rather straightforward \u2014 you had the first Homo sapiens in Africa, and then later, you had the group that emigrated from Africa and populated the rest of the world. We now know that what actually happened was far more complex. Groups developed and people emigrated and doubled back and crossbred. At one point, we even mated with a closely-related species, Neanderthals, and all people outside of Africa have some DNA from Neanderthals and in the case of Asians their cousins the Denisovans, while some Africans do. In a way, the prehistoric world was much like our own, in that groups developed, migrated, and interbred, but at a more gradual pace than we do today! ",

We all derive from Homo heidelbergensis, who evolved first in Africa. Some moved to Europe and gave rise to the Neanderthals, Denisovans and another group we haven\u2019t named yet, who then spread worldwide. Some remained in Africa and gave rise to Homo sapiens and another shadow group we haven\u2019t named yet. Some H. sapiens then left Africa and interbred with existing colonies of Neanderthals, Denisovans etc in the rest of the world, giving rise to the hybrid population which makes up most of modern humanity. Before Homo hedielbergensis, there was an earlier wave of Homo erectus migrants who left Africa and settled in many different countries - but so far as we know their colonies just died out and din\u2019t interbreed with later settlers. The ones who stayed behind in Africa evolved into H. heidelbergensis. ",

Hands with opposable thumbs that allow us to make and use tools, including writing tools for even broader communication of our thoughts. An erect posture and springy, energy-efficient feet that allowed our ancestors to jog after large animals until they collapsed from exhaustion, thus providing food for our large brains. These are all major evolutionary changes (there are others) that distinguish us from other animals, even other primates, our closest relatives. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be human.

I don\u2019t think anybody but cranks buys this idea any more. It would be awfully hard to square with the DNA and fossil evidence. The theory was more defensible back in the 50s and 60s of the last century, but even then it suffered from a rather mystical notion of what counts as fully human. I remembering thinking back then that Coon was really proposing a compromise solution to the old argument among racists about whether negroes were in the same species as Asians and Europeans. That may have been unfair to him\u2014I know very little about his politics, though I did read one of his books umpteen years ago.

If we go back a few million years, humans and chimpanzees share common ancestors and the further back we wind the process of evolution the more other species have common ancestors with us. ",
