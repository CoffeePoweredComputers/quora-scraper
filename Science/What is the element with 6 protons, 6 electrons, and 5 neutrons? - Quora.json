            "answer_text": "The number of protons says it is carbon. To be exact, it is Carbon-11 (sum of protons and neutrons), which is a highly radioactive isotope with a half-life of only 20 minutes (so it does not occur naturally). It decays to Boron-11 (5 protons, 6 neutrons) usually by emitting a positron, occasionally by capturing an electron. ",
