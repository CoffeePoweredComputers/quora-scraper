Prior to 1842, marijuana and hashish extracts were the most widely used medicines in the world.  Benjamin Franklin started one of America's first paper mills with cannabis, allowing a colonial press free from English control.  The U.S. Government distributed 400,000 pounds of cannabis seeds to American farmers in 1942 to aid the war effort.  Archaeologists agree that cannabis was among the first crops purposely cultivated by human beings at least over 6,000 years ago, and perhaps more than 12,000 years ago.  Hemp has been grown for at least the last 12,000 years for fiber (textiles and paper) and food. It has been effectively prohibited in the United States since the 1950s.  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both grew hemp. Ben Franklin owned a mill that made hemp paper. Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper.  Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag from hemp.  The first report of marijuana as medicine was 2727 B.C. in China.  In the U.S.A. hemp was used as medicine began in 1840 with the introduction of stronger varieties of marijuana and was used for almost 100 years. Some 360,000 acres of marijuana was grown annually during World War II, the seed crop grown by the 4H kids in Kentucky.  Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wife, Mary Todd, came from the richest hemp-growing family in Kentucky.  The Volstead Act of 1920, which raised the price of alcohol in the United States, positioned marijuana as an attractive alternative and led to an increase in use of the drug. \"Tea pads,\" where a person could purchase marijuana for 25 cents or less, began appearing in cities across the United States, particularly as part of the black \"hepster\" jazz culture.  By 1930 it was reported that there were at least 500 of these \"tea pads\" in New York City alone. During the Great Depression as unemployment increased, resentment and fear of the Mexican immigrants became connected to marijuana use. Numerous research studies linked marijuana use by lower class communities with crime and violence. In 1937, Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act which criminalized the drug. From 1951 to 1956 stricter sentencing laws set mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses. In the 1950s the beatniks appropriated the use of marijuana from the black hepsters and the drug moved into middle-class white America in the 1960s.  Refusing to grow Hemp in America during the 17th and 18th Centuries was against the law! You could be jailed in Virginia for refusing to grow hemp from 1763 to 1769.  Jefferson smuggled hemp seeds from China to France then to America.  The War of 1812 was fought over hemp. Napoleon wanted to cut off Moscow's export to England. ",
