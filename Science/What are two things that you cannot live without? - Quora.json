            "answer_text": "My parents and my sister, my biggest weakness of life. My world surrounds around my parents and my sister. My parents are my best friend forever #bff \u2764, I never step away from sharing the smallest things with them, never, I cannot resist, neither want to. Since the day I was born till date, they never beat me or scold, strictness in time is obvious and I adore it. I need not take their permission for small things but even before buying a pen, I take, that's how I show them they mean a lot to me and that they are my life. I always want to stay as their small baby girl. We are too possesive of each other equally, so possesive that we can kill the person who shows hints of harming any of us in minor manner. I was in the 9th standard, and my senior, in my absence told my dad is bald. When I got to know, I went to him and beat him up in front of teachers and students present there, so bad that he was hospitalised and couldn't give his 10th boards. That's how possesive I'm of my parents. I did the same when my classmate commented on my mums appearance in my absence, he too got bad injuries and was hospitalized too, this is when I was in 11th. I'm still the same. And I'm not changing, at least this character of mine!!! Coming to my sister, I was 9 yrs old when this little angel took birth in our family and our family got more blissful. Starting from cleaning her poopie, throwing diapers, playing with her, cleaning her, dressing her, making her sleep, feeding her, looking after her like her mother when she wasn't well, I used to do that all out of too much excitement and my mum used to help me too with it. Rather than sister, I feel like she's my own child, looking after her, mentoring her, made us very close, that we can't stay without each other. Too possesive just the way with my parents and she toois the same. Please do follow me for more such and beyond. Kristy Bhowal ",
