            "answer_text": "Why is cell theory still just called \u201ctheory\u201d when it's observed to be true? Bob Myers is strictly correct that if we know of information that unambiguously contradicts something called a theory, then it shouldn't be called a theory. However, there is some subtlety in the semantics used in science to describe the current state of understanding, and \u201ctheory\u201d is a case in point. General relativity and quantum electrodynamics are examples of what I think of as \u201chard\u201d theories, because their basis is entirely mathematical in origin, and thus very concrete and precise predictions can be made via the math involved that serve as explicit tests of the theory in question. General relativity has survived more than 100y of such tests, stretching from what can be measured in a lab to observations of how matter in the cosmos interacts in all sorts of extreme length scales, densities, etc. QED is sometimes refered to as the most accurate scientific theory of all time because of the ridiculous precision of its predictions. Interestingly, the pretty amazing mathematical construct that describes matter at a subatomic scale, the so-called Standard Model, is not a model because it isn\u2019t accurate--its math predicts particles, people invent probes to look for them, and they are inevitably discovered--but because it involves a mathematical trick termed renormalization that cancels out factors that would otherwise tend to infinity. This might be how the math of the universe works, but it isn't a very attractive math. Back to theories\u2026at the other end of the spectrum are theories based on concrete statements or premises, but those statements or premises are adaptable to new information without wrecking agreement with what is already known and accounted for very well by the theory. I think of these as soft theories--they still must explain everything that is known, but they adjust subtlely to accommodate new information while remaining true to their core premises. Evolution is a classic example: in its current form, its basic premise is roughly that species undergo random mutations over time, and mutations that result in advantages for an organism in its current environment will be selected via genetic inheritance over those that confer no advantage or disadvantage. This doesn't mean that bad mutations won't be passed on. It doesn't mean that all traits passed on will be advantageous. It means that over time, the genetic traits that persist will be those that confer advantage. Did Darwin express it this way? No. Would he have largely agreed with this? Yes, with a little help regarding terminology. Did he envision catastrophic extinctions? No, but as written above, that's okay: species with inherited traits that allow them to rapidly adapt to sudden changes in environment survive while others perish. Is there a solid mathematical underpining to evolutionary theory? Nope. But can it make predictions--albeit soft predictions--that survive rigorous testing? Yes it can, and has. The difference in hard and soft theories as I've defined them is one of precision. Hard theories are based entirely on math, and the math is either right or wrong to some experimentally determined degree of precision. Soft theories are not based on math (though math certainly plays a role in how they are deployed or tested), but consist of core premises that prove adaptable and durable against any challenges, and provide predictions that, if not quantitative, are nevertheless accurate with respect to the underlying premises. So to your question: cell theory hinges on the question of how one defines life. Entities such as viruses and prions that exhibit some, or even many, of the attributes of life get voted off the \u201clife\" island by tightening what we mean by life, which itself is described of being composed of one or more cells. So are viruses alive or not? Well, the fact that this is a murky topic both philosophically and biologically, settled entirely by very specific definitions, is why cell \u201ctheory\u201d is often called a doctrine rather than a theory. It is like stating 4 is an integer, whereas 4.0 is a real number. They are exactly the same value, but the decimal point in 4.0 admits a fractional value of zero, which makes it a real, no-kidding, real number. Anyway, whether hard or soft, the underpinnings of a true scientific theory should withstand any test--note that this is different than being \u201ctrue\u201d. A model might well withstand any test, but be objectionable for other reasons, such as the vital but arguably objectionable renormalizations required in the standard model. There are ideas called theories that hinge on particular definitions that are intrinsically axiomatic, and therefore cannot be subject to test, cell theory being of a kind. This doesn't mean that they are wrong, nor that we will ever discover something that disagrees with them. As is typical in any scientific query, an honest answer is often murky in detail, but I hope this is useful. ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u201ctheory\u201d as used in science doesn\u2019t mean something along the lines of a guess - a theory is an explanation for how something works that HAS been tested and found to be in agreement with the observed evidence, such that it is a valid model to use for predicting the behavior of a given phenomenon. \u201cTheory\u201d is as good as it gets in science; \u201cfacts\u201d are the observed evidence itself, and the \u201ctheory\u201d is the currently-accepted model that explains that evidence. Theories are NEVER considered to be 100% \u201cproven,\u201d by the way; a theory is always open to question and to additional testing, and if the theory is ever found to be at odds with the evidence, it must be revised or possibly even abandoned altogether. Here\u2019s an example. Isaac Newton came up with several theories that attempted to describe the motion of objects and how forces affects these motions, and these theories agreed very well what what we observed for a long, long time. But around the end of the 19th century, it became apparent that what Newton\u2019s theories predicted and what was actually observed were not in agreement in the case of very large, very fast, or very, very small objects. This discrepancy wasn\u2019t resolved until Einstein proposed his theories of relativity and the entire field of quantum mechanics was developed. Now, we still teach and use Newton\u2019s theories to this day, because they still apply perfectly well in \u201cnormal\u201d-scale situations. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve found them to be incomplete, and have to turn to these more complete descriptions when we\u2019re working at the range of sizes and speeds that require them. ",
