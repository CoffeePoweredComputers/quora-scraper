            "answer_text": "IDK if reality is an illusion or not but this was my paranoid life experience\u2026 As a kid I was very inquisitive about intrinsic details and the reasons behind why things happen. A number of 'why\u2019s' led me to believe that the reality I was in might in fact be an illusion. I started asking myself questions like, \u2018What if I was abducted by aliens and in a trance?\u2019 or like, 'What if this is an illusion created by God?\u2019 and I realized I was going crazy over this. So I pulled myself from these misconceptions. Another explanation comes a few years later. People bide by what they deem as true and false, good and bad. What is good to one is bad to another. Take Thanos for example, he did what he thought was ethically right and so did the Avengers. Now who's to say what Thanos did was right or wrong but society. Society tells us what it deems as right and wrong. We choose to abide by these rules called the law. But in our minds we are free to choose what is an illusion and what we define as reality. Unfortunately most people don't think this deep. Maybe it's for their best. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote an article about this on my blog. When I was asked if there was anything that could prove if life was a dream, the only ways I felt could prove this was hypnosis and halucigenic drugs like DMT. Hypnosis basically is putting someone in a deep trance and giving the subject suggestions. Kind of like a hacker hacking into a computer program and changing the code to make it perform differently. Now, I've seen hypnosis shows where the hypnotist has made voulanteers see things that are not there. One hypnotist even convinced a guy that a pencil was a lit cigarette and that the flat end was the lit part. When he put the flat end of the pencil on the arm of this person, a blister appeared. Put it this way. Since childhood, every story we've been told, everything we've seen and believed has formed our perceptions of life. Richard Bach explains it well in his book Hypnotising Maria. We still hypnotise ourselves now by things we choose to believe from others, books, TV etc and what we say to ourselves\u2026I feel tired, stressed, angry\u2026I am hungry, horny, happy. All of that is suggestions accepted and form our perceptions of reality and life experience. But I ask could it also prove that reality is an illusion? I can't say that I know much about halucigenic drugs but could halucigenic drugs actually stimulate our brains to create large doses of DMT and does the distorted views of reality, the vivid colours and shapes we experience when tripping out actually exposes the illusion that is reality? That would be like operating a computer program and then suddenly all the fancy graphics and interface that we see from the program is suddenly replaced by the code that was used to write the program. I'm not saying that we should drug ourselves with Lsd or eat platefuls of Shrooms to find out. But its interesting nevertheless. ",
