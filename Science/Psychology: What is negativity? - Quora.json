            "answer_text": "The term Negativity is being used only for human being, therefore it is clear that negativity has something to do with human condition whether it is negative thinking, negative behaviour, negative aura or negative presence. We don't say that, for example, a dog has so much of negativity or a lion has that negativity. Negativity has to do with the state of your consciousness, if consciousness is perverted and directed towards wrong forces or being under the influence of malevolent forces which always try to falsify or retard upward movement of consciousness towards the divine (Truth) then negativity sets in. That's why you instinctively feel uncomfortable when you come near a person who harbour some cold blooded intention or have some ugly deep rooted perversions. Sometimes animal too becomes contaminated by such malevolent forces but animal consciousness is not so much developed therefore we do not perceive such negative impact as we perceive negativity of some human being.

            "answer_text": "Negativity is the tendency to be downbeat, disagreeable and skeptical. It is a pessimistic attitude that always expects the worst.   \u200bIt seems easier at times to be negative and criticising towards things or people. But contentment is something which cannot be earned that way.   \u200b ",
