            "answer_text": "We were well on our way to speciation and then we messed it up by inventing the Age of Exploration, traveling around the globe and screwing every other population we came in contact with. The aboriginal people of Australia are the most distant branch of humanity. More seriously, however, given humanity\u2019s history of killing even our most closely related tribes, it is not a good idea to refer to even other races as distinct entities, never mind as other species. With the relaxation of many taboos about interracial marriage and interracial children, we are moving closer and closer to becoming a single race and species. Within a couple more generations it would not be surprising for people with known multiracial ancestors to be as common as people who believe they are of a single race. ",

As far as we can tell from genetic analysis, humanity has gone through one or more near-extinction events where perhaps fewer than several thousand survivors in the entire world repopulated the planet. If one of these was the Toba catastrophe, then the button on human variation was reset 75,000 years ago- an eyeblink in evolutionary terms. ",
