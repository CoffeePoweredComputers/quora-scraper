            "answer_text": "There are 25- isotopes of Chlorine with the Atomic Mass ranging from 26 to 52. But only 2-isotopes of Chlorine with Atomic Mass of 35 and 37 are prominent with the relative abundance of 74% and 26% respectively. Hence the atomic Mass of Chlorine Atom is [(35 x 0.74) + (37 x 0.24)]\u00f7100= 35.457. So the relative abundance Cl-35 and Cl-37 are in the ratio of 0.74:0.24= 3:1 Among the various isotopes of Chlorine, Cl-36, is relatively stable with an half- life of 3.08 x 10^5 years. All other isotopes of Chlorine are radio active with very very short Half-Life. ",
