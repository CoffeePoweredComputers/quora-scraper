            "answer_text": "They all believe in gravity, the evidence for it is pretty overwhelming considering everything is stuck to the surface of the earth.  It's just the mechanism that transmits the force of gravity that is open to more research and discussion. In Einstein's general relativity gravity is the result of the curvature of space-time. But some scientists suspect that gravity can be quantized into particles called gravitons which carry the force of gravity ",

            "answer_text": "A scientist should not base their understanding of the physical world on beliefs. A scientist should base his or her worldview on hard demonstrated facts, derived from repeated observation of the physical world. A scientist who rejects gravity has the obligation to falsify its existence experimentally. Good luck with that. ",
