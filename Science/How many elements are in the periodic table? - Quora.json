            "answer_text": "There are 92 natural elements in the period table from hydrogen to uranium and currently 26 transuranic elements have been created/observed. The natural elements (hydrogen to uranium) mostly have stable isotopes (see below) and they all exist in nature. Each element is characterized by the number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms. Protons are large particles with positive charge. Hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and all uranium atoms have 92 protons. The nuclei of atoms as well as containing protons also contain neutrons. These are like protons but have no charge. Most hydrogen atoms have no neutrons and a few have 1 neutron and fewer still have 2 neutrons. These different versions of hydrogen atoms are known as isotopes. Some of these isotopes are radioactive which means the neclei can change to different nuclei be emitting radiation and in doing so change the number of protons in their nuclei (radioactive decay). These are known as unstable isotopes. Other isotopes can't do this and they are known as stable isotopes. Most elements from hydrogen to uranium have one or more stable isotopes. These persist for ever or until they are hit by very energetic radiation capable of changing their nuclei. Some of these have no stable isotopes but they decay so slowly they still exist millions of years after they were first created so they exit in nature. Elements heavier than lead (bismuth to oganessum) have no stable isotopes and over time they all change into a different element while emitting radiation. This is one reason why elements heavier than lead tend to be rarer. The elements heavier than helium were created in supernovae which are hot enough to slam nuclei together hard enough to make them fuse into larger nuclei with more protons and neutrons. The main reason why elements heavier than uranium are not found on earth is that the supernova which created the elements in our solar system was not hot enough to create them. Planets elsewhere in the universe may have naturally occurring elements heavier than uranium if the supernova which created their elements was hot enough. Thanks to Stuart Herring for information about unstable elements lighter than uranium. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is 118 but \u2026 The periodic table is a tool for chemists. It started as a way to organise elements by their atomic weights which revealed clues as why certain chemical properties were shared by different elements, it has been immensely powerful, and it has driven discoveries in physics and chemistry for over 100 years including the discovery of unknown elements, but no longer. Elements are not found by their chemistry now, the new elements do not exist for long enough to have any meaningful chemistry. There are still a few new clues to be gained from these superheavy elements but by and large the heaviest elements are showing chemistry that differs from their earlier congeners far more than any other row, even the first. If an element has a half life in the milliseconds it probably doesn\u2019t belong in the periodic table at all, if has no characteristic chemical properties, it cannot be isolated chemically and it will not assist in any chemical reactions. It certainly belongs in a list of elements but the interesting part of it isn\u2019t its electronic structure it is the structure of the nucleus and for that a completely different table is needed where things are not organised by filling shells with numbers of electrons but stabilities and interactions between neutrons and protons and their constituent quarks give the table its shape. Maybe there is a new Mendeleev waiting to spring an invaluable insight upon us, I hope so. ",
