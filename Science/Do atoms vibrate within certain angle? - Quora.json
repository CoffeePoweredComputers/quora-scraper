            "answer_text": "molecular vibration occurs when atoms in a molecule are in periodic motion while the molecule as a whole has constant translational and rotational motion. The frequency of the periodic motion is known as a vibration frequency, and the typical frequencies of molecular vibrations range from less than 10 to12 to approximately 10 to14 Hz. In general, a molecule with N atoms has 3N \u2013 6 normal modes of vibration, but a linearmolecule has 3N \u2013 5 such modes, because rotation about its molecular axis cannot be observed. A diatomic molecule has one normal mode of vibration. The normal modes of vibration of polyatomic molecules are independent of each other but each normal mode will involve simultaneous vibrations of different parts of the molecule such as different chemical bonds. A molecular vibration is excited when the molecule absorbs a quantum of energy, E, corresponding to the vibration's frequency, \u03bd, according to the relation E = h\u03bd (where h isPlanck's constant). A fundamental vibration is excited when one such quantum of energy is absorbed by the molecule in its ground state. When two quanta are absorbed the firstovertone is excited, and so on to higher overtones. ",
