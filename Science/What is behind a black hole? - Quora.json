Biggest questions what's behind a black hole roll clip star more than three times the size of our Sun or to end its life with a collapse before the curious among who that scene was from the incredible 2014 biopic of the legendary Stephen Hawking's life and work the theory of everything where a young Hawking had just put two and two together based upon the theory of Sir Roger Penrose and first began his Eureka moment about the relationship between space time black holes the universe and well everything and while it's important to note that while we've covered quite a few black hole escapades already we're going to initially be paying a dues to some of the greatest minds that physics has gifted us so far and answer this question with a very brief proposition what's behind a black hole while based on our current understanding of physics nothing at all no time no space just the singularity the end of all things but asis the case with many things there may be something more to it and theoretically speaking what lies beneath these cosmic enigmas are the root of some of the greatest mysteries in our universe now obviously you may be thinking behind a black hole as in physically behind that's ridiculous how could you go behind a literal puncture hole in the fabric of time and space and well the quick answer is you're doing it right now.

            "answer_text": "Well you may get different answers on different websites but this is how I understand black holes. As we all know according to Albert Einstein space is actually a like cloth made up of space and time. Now different planets and stars on this cloth bend it with their density this bend or depression in spacetime cloth (let's give it an acronym \u201cstc\") and this depression is what we call gravity. Anything that's within this depression created by a particular body is said to be attracted by that body ( Gravitational force of attraction ). The greater the density of a body greater is the depression formed by it and greater is the gravitational pull.   Well this is just a two dimensional representation of spacetime cloth (curvature). Below is how it looks is 3-D.  So now we have understood the concept of stc, gravity, and how any body creates its own gravity. Moving further with this, when an old star is about to die it's volume goes on shrinking keeping the mass the same which increases its density. Now this creates a very large depression in the stc creating a very strong gravitational pull. And when the star eventually dies giving out massive amount of energy, and forming a black hole. In a black hole millions and billions of tons of mass is packed in a relatively small volume which creates a point of almost infinite density leaving a \u201chole\u201d in the stc.  Just like this but in 3-D. This depression is so deep that its gravitational pull is also almost infinite. This force of gravitation is so strong that the escape velocity even exceeds the velocity of light. Thus, a black hole is a point of infinite density on the space time curvature formed due to a dieing star giving rise to so much gravity that even light cannot escape it. And also this is the reason why time slows down to massive amount near a black hole(that concept is very interesting trust me .. feel free to ask in comments or request and answer) And also there are other causes for formation of black hole like two small neutron stars collapsing etc. but they all come down to formation of massive depression in stc creating a black hole. Black holes are also said to be getway between different dimensions (I can explain that too feel free to ask!) Thankyou! Upvote if you understood and comment if you have any other theory. ",
