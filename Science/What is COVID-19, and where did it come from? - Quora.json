            "answer_text": "Bats (which comprise about 1800 different species) harbor an amazing number of different viruses such as Ebola, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and many others. For some reason bats do not develop illness with these viruses but do act as a reservoir. Occasionally these bat harbored viruses pass to other species usually other mammals. Sometimes the virus requires a small mutation to leap to other species but sometimes the same virus can leap to other species. This is called zoonotic infection from one species to another. It appears that the coronaviruses SARS and SARS-CoV-2 have passed from bats to an intermediate mammal and then to humans. It is hypothesized that wet markets where live wild animals are stored for human consumption allow the intermediate animals to have exposure to humans. Zoonotic infections are likely to continue to occur and thus a good idea is to surveal bats for what viruses they are carrying. Some degree of pre-emptive work could be done on these bat viruses. The rumor that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) escaped from a lab either in Wuhan or the reciprocal and even more silly accusation that it came from USA Ft Detrick is false. There are viruses in bats that are nearly identical to the Covid-19 virus and as we are seeing currently across the world no one understands all the mechanisms of the virus mechanisms of illness. To think someone could design this in advance is not possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. CO\u2019 stands for corona, \u2018VI\u2019 for virus, and \u2018D\u2019 for disease This virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for a few hours to several days, but simple disinfectants can kill it. Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Corona Virus is come from China Here are some precautions you and your family can take to help avoid infection:     ",
