            "answer_text": "The abundance of a chemical element is a measure of the occurrence of the element relative to all other elements in a given environment. Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by the mass-fraction (the same as weight fraction); by the mole-fraction (fraction of atoms by numerical count, or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases); or by the volume-fraction. Volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole-fraction for gas mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and ideal gas mixtures. Most abundance values in this article are given as mass-fractions. For example, the abundance of oxygen in pure water can be measured in two ways: the mass fraction is about 89%, because that is the fraction of water's mass which is oxygen. However, the mole-fraction is 33.3333...% because only 1 atom of 3 in water, H ",

Other answers claim that dark matter is more abundant, but we currently don't know that dark matter definitely is matter. It appears to be some kind of \u201cstuff\u201d that isn't directly proportional to visible matter, and it has an effect on space that looks to be the same as that of mass. There is a reason it's categorised separately from regular matter. ",

(In beta decay, a 'down' quark of a neutron emits an antineutrino and an electron to become an 'up' quark, transmuting the neutron into a proton.) Carbon just makes great polymers and that is required to make bodies of organisms. Who taught you that? ",

The surface charge is negative and the concentrated charge at center is positive. When the particle move at velocity incrementaly greater than \u2018c\u2019 or tends to move at velocity greater than c, its charge appears , its negative charge appears in space prducing magnetic field to oppose the increase of motion beyond ,c,. When such two paticles collide against each other, gluon comes out it and the prticles gue with each other collectively forming Quarks. Scietist can detect these particles physically only when they can detect electrical-gravitational frequencies of the order of 10^60 Hz. It is derived from Planks Energy Relation, mass energy transformation energy relation and the Plank\u2019s constants. ",
