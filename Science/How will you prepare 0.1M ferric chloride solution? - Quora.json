            "answer_text": "That depends in part on how much of the solution need. Start with the volume of the solution to determine the moles of FeCl3 and from that the mass of FeCl3. Dissolve it in some water and then dilute the solution to the final volume in a volumetric flask or graduated cylinder. Since you only specified one significant digit, then the volume won\u2019t be problematic. We\u2019re going go with three significant digits to be able to calculate a reasonable mass. Suppose you want 500.0 mL of the solution.0.500L x (0.100 mol FeCl3 / 1L) x (162.204 g FeCl3 / 1mol FeCl3) = 8.11g FeCl3 (anhydrous) Dissolve 8.11g anhydrous FeCl3 in some water and then dilute to 500 mL either in a volumetric flask or a graduated cylinder \u2026. in order to make 500 mL of 0.1M FeCl3. For the hexahydrate, FeCl3\u20226H2O, you will need a greater mass: 13.51g, instead of 8.11g (270.295 g/mol). ",
