            "answer_text": "Are you asking about piezoelectric materials needed for the project or common materials that are required throughout the project ? Be specific. If your concern is about piezoelectric materials then a number of piezoelectric materials are available. Most widely used are- QuartzRochelle saltTopazTourmalinePZT-5APZT-5HZNOAll of them has different advantages and disadvantages. 1\u20134 are natural materials with piezoelectric properties. PZTs are dielectric in nature where as ZNO is a semiconductor. So from electronics point of view ZNO is more interesting. And if you are asking about common materials needed for a project then it will depend on where and how you are going to implement it, If it is an academic project or industrial and are you going to implement the hardware or you are interested in simulation.
