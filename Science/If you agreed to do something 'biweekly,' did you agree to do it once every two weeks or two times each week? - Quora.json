            "answer_text": "The English language needs a little help here. I propose that from now on, we use \"bi\" and \"di\" in a new way, \"Bi-weekly\" would mean twice weekly. \"Di-weekly\" would mean every other week. You protest that it's an innovation. But linguistic innovation happens all the time. This would finally be a good innovation for a change. PS; This would work with \"monthly\", \"yearly\" \"centenially\", etc. ",
