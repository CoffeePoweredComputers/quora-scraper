            "answer_text": "Human cells and bacterial cells are roughly the same size. The reason humans are larger than bacteria is because humans are composed of billions of cells and bacteria are unicellular. If you take a bacterial cell and blown it up to the size of human being, the cell would likely not be able to sustain itself and would lyse. But assuming we could shrink down to microbial size and actually touch a bacterial cell what we feel would depend on the type of bacteria. Gram negative bacteria have an outer layer composed of a lipopolysaccharide cellular membrane. This membrane sits on top of a firmer peptidoglycan cell wall. Touching the outer surface of gram negative bacteria might feel like to touching a slimy, fatty jelly sitting on a firm backboard. Gram positive bacteria have an outer layer composed of that peptidoglycan cell wall. Touching the surface may feel like touching a rough, firm wall. ",
