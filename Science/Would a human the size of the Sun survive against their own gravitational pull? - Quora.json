            "answer_text": "No. A human the size of the sun would be well above the mass at which objects are made approximately spherical by their own gravity. Let\u2019s assume for these purposes, that this person\u2019s height is equal to the diameter of the sun. Assuming this is a scaled up version of a 1.6-m-tall, 70 kg person, we get a mass about 2.3% the mass of the sun. This is in the mass range of a brown dwarf. Our giant human would be crushed by gravity into dense sphere a little bit larger than Jupiter. This compression is going to make this strange new object very hot, especially at the core, where temperatures may reach as high as 3 million degrees, hot enough to ignite some nuclear fusion of deuterium (hydrogen-2), but not of protium (hydrogen-1).

The number I believe is about 1.4 sun mass. Whether you still need a collision impact to trigger this implosion/explosion is not clear. ",
