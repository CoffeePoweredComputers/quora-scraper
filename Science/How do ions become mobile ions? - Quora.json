            "answer_text": "Ions become mobile ions in water. Ions are used in electrolytes which are solutions containing ions during electrolysis. Also melting compounds like sodium chloride release the ions from the ionic lattice. These molten ions can also move and conduct electricity. Molten solutions of ions can also be used to conduct electricity during electrolysis. Remember 2 electrodes are involved in electrolysis (an anode (+) and a cathode(-). Actual products are produced at these electrodes such as hydrogen and chlorine on a large scale in chemical organisations, depending on the electrolyte used. Brent Walton ",

            "answer_text": "You can find ions in an aqueous solution or in the gaseous state. Atoms are in constant random motion and therefore, their ions are also in constant random motion (i.e. \u201cmobile\u201d). That\u2019s part of the kinetic molecular theory. Atoms locked into a network solid are not mobile. ",
