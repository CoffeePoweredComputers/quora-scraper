It is not sterile or pure, and it would not pass the health criteria needed. It would also clogged up the needle! Menstruation blood is contaminated with a mix of dead and live blood cells, unwelcome bacteria from the vagina flora, blood clots, and dead epithelial skin cells sloughed off from the lining of the uterus. Menstrual blood could not be cleansed for use in a blood transfusion. So, no it would not be possible to use this type of blood in a transfusion (if nothing else, it could kill the patient, and it would be far too thick to go through the needle!) \u2014 unless you were some cruel Nazi \u201cdoctor\u201d back in the Holocaust who might even have tried to do the same thing on concentration camp prisoners/victims as one of their many evil \u201cmedical experiments.\u201d I coordinate blood drives for the American Red Cross, and have donated over 14 gallons of whole blood over the years. Blood collectors\u2019 standards for cleanliness are superb, but this type of blood product doesn\u2019t begin to reach the sanity or sanitation needed for blood collection and transfusions. \u2014Sarah M., posted 15 March 2019 (updated 2 August 2020)  ORIGINAL QUESTION: Not that anyone would, but is it possible to use menstruation blood in a transfusion, or is that blood \u201cdead\u201d? MERGED INTO: Can menstrual blood be collected and used for blood transfusion? (asked 5 February 2017) ",

Fluid includes vaginal secretions, cervical and endometrial mucus, also endometrium tissues. the blood is rich in ions which makes it heavier than flowing blood in body. During blood transfusion the pressure, temperature and respiratory rate is been checked.The color of menstrual blood is different as oxygen present in uterus reacts along with bacterias, as it stays for longer time which makes it look darker ! shredded tissues and decayed bacterias which makes typical odour which smells of sometimes like rotten fish or little bit of metallic as menstrual blood is rich in iron.For transfusion, the blood must contain platelets, plasma and haemoglobin rich in oxygen whereas the menstrual blood has less number of platelets than ordinary blood, also during transfusion antigens and antibodies are checked before use.So, menstrual blood can't be collected and used for transfusion or else if done it may kill patient.
