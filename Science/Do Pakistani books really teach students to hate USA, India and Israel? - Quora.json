            "answer_text": "yes it does A new study released Tuesday found that Pakistan\u2019s public school textbooks negatively portray the country\u2019s religious minorities, including Hindus, Christians and Ahmadis, as \u201cuntrustworthy, religiously inferior, and ideologically scheming.\u201d The report, \u201cTeaching Intolerance in Pakistan: Religious Bias in Public School Textbooks,\u201d analyzed 78 textbooks from all four provinces covering grades five through 10. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) sponsored the study, which was conducted by the Pakistan-based NGO Peace and Education Foundation (PEF). The study found 70 new instances of bias in addition to finding that some problematic content found in a 2011 study conducted by USCIRF had remained and even been expanded upon. \u201cPakistan\u2019s public school textbooks contain deeply troubling content that portrays non-Muslim citizens as outsiders, unpatriotic, and inferior; are filled with errors; and present widely-disputed historical \u2018facts\u2019 as settled history,\u201d USCIRF Chairman Robert P. George said in a statement on the report\u2019s release. \u201cMissing from these textbooks are any references to the rights of religious minorities and their positive contributions to Pakistan\u2019s development.\u201d \u201cThese textbooks sadly reflect the alarming state today of religious freedom in Pakistan,\u201d he concluded. \u201cA country\u2019s education system, including its textbooks, should promote religious tolerance, not close the door to cooperation and coexistence.\u201d The 52-page report contains many examples of a troubling portrayal of religious minorities in the public school textbooks. case1: A passage in an eighth grade Islamic Studies book published in 2015 as part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Curriculum describes jihad in a positive light. \u201cProphet (PBUH) said that \u2018Jihad will continue till the end of times\u2019. Jihad is going on in different parts of the world. Many Mujahidins of Islam are participating in Jihad for sake of Allah, for protection of their religion, to help their oppressed brothers, and to get freedom from tyranny,\u201d it read. \u201cAs a student if you cannot practically participate in Jihad you can at least financially help in preparation of Jihad.\u201d case2: A passage from a tenth grade Punjab textbook, also published in 2015, states, \u201cBecause the Muslim religion, culture and social system are different from non-Muslims, it is impossible to cooperate with Hindus.\u201d case3: Another Punjab curriculum textbook for sixth grade Islamic studies reads, \u201cChristians learned tolerance and kind bigheartedness from Muslims. The fair treatment and good governance of Muslims improved the living standard of the region. They started to live prosperous and peaceful lives under the patronage of Muslims.\u201d case4: ''Hindus are repeatedly described as extremists and eternal enemies of Islam whose culture and society is based on injustice and cruelty, while Islam delivers a message of peace and brotherhood, concepts portrayed as alien to the Hindu.'' case5: ''The anti-Islamic forces are always trying to finish the Islamic domination of the world,'' read one passage from social studies text being taught to Grade 4 students in Punjab province, the country's most populated. The report\u2019s recommendations call for textbooks that \u201creflect that religious freedom is a constitutional protection provided to all Pakistanis\u201d and ask that \u201chistorical omissions and misrepresentations of different events should be eliminated, and diverse viewpoints should be included.\u201d At a National Press Club event Tuesday USCIRF Commissioner Katrina Lantos Swett discussed the report\u2019s findings as well as Pakistan\u2019s harsh blasphemy laws used to target its religious minorities. \u201cEvery year since 2002, USCIRF has continued to call on our State Department to designate Pakistan a country of particular concern or a CPC, marking it as one of the world\u2019s worst violators of freedom of religion or belief. We believe such action is long overdue,\u201d Swett emphasized. Azhar Hussain, president and founder of PEF, reflected on the words of Pakistan\u2019s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, \u201cYou are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this State of Pakistan.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very sad for us, for Pakistan, to see that very founding mission of Pakistan that anybody can come and live and pray and practice their religion to be not true,\u201d Hussain said.here is video shared by siddhesh chaudhari which sums up all  Study: Public School Textbooks in Pakistan Teach Intolerance of Non-Muslims\u2018Pakistan schools teach Hindu hatred\u2019Textbooks In Pakistani Government Schools Teaching Hate Against Christians And Hindus, Jihad And Martyrdom To Young Students ",

Its whole idea is based on the hatred against India and Indians. Pakistani schools are bound to teach what it's government tells\u200b them to teach and its army tells it's government to create a syllabus which spread hatred against India and its allies. When we ask these questions about Pakistan we forget that it's a rogue state which does not think about it's people it's development etc and we expect Pakistan to behave like a civilised Nation. Even election in Pakistan is based on Hatred against India, and Annexation of Kashmir. Fun fact : If you want to win an election in Pakistan. Say these things : \u201cHamari hukumat aayegi to inshallah hum Kashmir le lenge\u201d. \u201cIndia ko khuda kasam uske ghutno pe khada kr denge\u201d. And kill some of our people by organising a terrorist attack, you'll WIN!! I mean in a country where a terrorist like Osama Bin Laden was found and killed by Americans. Hafiz Saeed still roaming around freely in Pakistan. Do you really expect them to teach their student something sane. No Offence : I don't understand why Pakistan is a nation!! I mean, their army is a joke, their currency is a joke. And even their prime minister \"Nawaz Sharif\". Nobody takes him seriously. They always be like, \"Hindustan jaan le, Janab hamare paas bhi Nuclear Bomb hai\" :D ",

I am quoting few references with regards to distorted history published in Dawn News Pakistan A Textbook of Pakistan Studies by M. D. Zafar.\u201cPakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad bin Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.\u201d \u201cDuring the 11th century the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan\u201d.The following excerpt regarding the 1965 war is taken from fifth grade reading material published by the NWFP Textbook Board, Peshawar in 2002 \u2014 \u201cThe Pakistan Army conquered several areas of India, and when India was at the verge of being defeated she ran to the United Nations to beg for a cease-fire. Magnanimously, thereafter, Pakistan returned all the conquered territories to India.\u201dThe Punjab Textbook Board published the following text on the causes for the separation of East Pakistan in 1993 for secondary classes \u2014 \u201cThere were a large number of Hindus in East Pakistan. They had never truly accepted Pakistan. A large number of them were teachers in schools and collegesAgain I am not sure how much of it is still part of curiculum but ofcourse distortion and propogation of an ideology that is anti India happens right from the school curriculum. Ofcourse in this age of internet people do open up to bitter realities and Pakistani's are no exception. In fact if you look at our own history especially post independence there is distortion to only glorify the the Nehru Gandhi legacy. Not that everypne falls for it. ",
