            "answer_text": "Deanna, when I lived in Japan, the beauty of Dark hair and dark eyes was a normal everyday look on the population there. It\u2019s when someone is different that it becomes Exotic or Sensual or sexy\u2026 and pretty or handsome, I worked with a beautiful girl from Russia when I lived in Japan, Tall Blond hair blue eyes and a beautiful accent. Galena was exotic to the Japanese men\u2026 but Japanese men do not stare and act goofy like American people do when there is a beautiful person around them. The beauty is respected. But, I was invited to a tea ceremony, we fortunately had a Geisha, dark hair so dark it had a blue hue to it naturally and dark eyes, in our presence\u2026. to me she was exotic and beautiful. So, it depends on the culture in many places\u2026as for me, I see exotic beauty and natural beauty as part of life. Plan Jane appearance is usually not based on a persons looks so much as it means a person who doesn\u2019t care to keep their appearance updated or use makeup or pluck their eyebrows or do their nails\u2026 a little maintenance is what we all need once in a while\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The only place I know of, and I\u2019m sure there are many other countries, where black hair is exotic is Finland because just about everyone has blonde hair which is naturally blonde, not out of a bottle. These days every third woman\u2019s hair is blonde because it is easy to colour it. When I was young, natural blondes were not prevalent here in Canada either, and when walking down the street, I was always whistled at because the people who did labour outdoors were from Italy and Portugal and they were not used to blondes. Or, perhaps they just liked to whistle\u2026 ",
