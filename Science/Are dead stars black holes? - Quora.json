            "answer_text": "Not all dead stars end up as black holes. It really comes down to the size of the star in question Stars like the Sun : When the core runs out of hydrogen fuel, it will contract under the weight of gravity. However, some hydrogen fusion will occur in the upper layers. As the core contracts, it heats up. This heats the upper layers, causing them to expand. As the outer layers expand, the radius of the star will increase and it will become a red giant. The radius of the red giant sun will be just beyond the Earth's orbit. At some point after this, the core will become hot enough to cause the helium to fuse into carbon. When the helium fuel runs out, the core will expand and cool. The upper layers will expand and eject material that will collect around the dying star to form a planetary nebula. Finally, the core will cool into a white dwarf and then eventually into a black dwarf. This entire process will take a few billion years.Stars more massive then the Sun : When the core runs out of hydrogen, these stars fuse helium into carbon just like the Sun. However, after the helium is gone, their mass is enough to fuse carbon into heavier elements such as oxygen, neon, silicon, magnesium, sulfur and iron. Once the core has turned to iron, it can burn no longer. The star collapses by its own gravity and the iron core heats up. The core becomes so tightly packed that protons and electrons merge to form neutrons. In less than a second, the iron core, which is about the size of the Earth, shrinks to a neutron core with a radius of about 6 miles (10 kilometers). The outer layers of the star fall inward on the neutron core, thereby crushing it further. The core heats to billions of degrees and explodes (supernova), thereby releasing large amounts of energy and material into space. The shock wave from the supernova can initiate star formation in other interstellar clouds. The remains of the core can form a neutron star or a black hole depending upon the mass of the original star.",

            "answer_text": "Dead stars must achieve a state called \"Pulsars\" where its mass is increased but its size reduces improportionately. this causes the energy of the system to go haywire.. being a star it has its own gravity which under lower size cause the gravity to act like super gravity pulling everything around it into the even horizon (the area around the centre of the blackhole). This area of the event horizon and the centre constitute for the black hole. But for the star to reach the pulsar state it must reach supernova energy state giving the energy for pulsars to stabilise.. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity does the work. When you have enough material together, gravity can be very strong. And the more mass you have, the lower the density needs to be in order to make a black hole. If all nuclear burning in a star greater than about 1.4 solar masses were to stop, and the star allowed to cool and solidify, the solidified material would not be strong enough to support its own weight, and it would collapse as the electrons were pushed into the protons to make neutrons. This neutron star material is stronger, but the star would be only about 20 km in diameter. If you piled on more material, you would eventually get to the point where there is so much gravity that not even the neutrons could hold it up, and the star would collapse into a black hole ",
