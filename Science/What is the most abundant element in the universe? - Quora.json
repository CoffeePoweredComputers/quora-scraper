            "answer_text": "After the big bang, the vast majority of baryonic matter was hydrogen (I am stating baryonic matter here to differentiate the matter which we would consider as chemical elements against dark matter - which it seems that most of the universe is made of). Over time, this hydrogen collected in the first stars where fusion allowed for the creation of heavier elements. Hydrogen is still the main fuel for stars during their main sequence. Most of the baryonic matter in the universe seems to be main sequence stars. Therefore, most of the baryonic matter in the universe is still hydrogen. ",
