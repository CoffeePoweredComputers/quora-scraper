            "answer_text": "The phosphorus cycle is a bit unusual in the sense it is not completely closed. whilst the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon have gaseous, dissolved and solide compounds allowing them to return the atmosphere, phosphorus only has solid and dissolved compound. this mean that phosphorus that ends up in the ocean can only be returned to land through land animals eating sea animal. this means their is a small loss as phosphorus falls to the bottom of the ocean.
