            "answer_text": "In nth shell the total no. Of subshells are n eg 4th shell has 4 subshells-s(l=0),p(l=1),d(l=2),f(l=3) (here l is azimuthal quantam no.) Total no of orbitals in a subshell with value of l=n are 2n+1 .. Ex if l=3 then magnetic quantam no. Can have values from -3 to +3 (incld 0) that makes 7 orbitals in a subshell for l=3 \u2026 (now u can figure out why its 2n+1) So lets begin with the ques.. 4th shell has how many subshells? (Ans is 4) Which subshells? S,p,d,f which have values of l as 0,1,2,3 Now for subshell s , how many orbitals are there ? (Use 2l+1 , here l=0 so total orbitals are 1 ) For subshell p there are 3 orbitals For subshell d there are 5 orbitals For subshell f there are 7 orbitals Now add them up - u will get 16 orbitals Now u r wondering then how came n^2..how it can give the desired result ..u can observe that the total orbitals (in the above ques) are given by : 1+3+5+7 (sum of first four odd nos) U can simplify this result as total orbitals in nth shell is equal to sum of first n odd nos. Now , if u know arithmetic progression u can figure it out that sum of first n odd nos is n^2.. If u still dont get the ans let me know! ",

            "answer_text": "Fourth energy level has n=4. This shell can have values of orbital angular momentum l = 0,1,2,3 (quantum mechanics found that) now 0 orbital angular momentum can have only 1 orbital,i.e. s orbital. Soherically Symmetric. (Again quantum mechanics stuff). l=1 can has 3 fold symmetry, i.e. 3 orbitals p. l=2 can have 5 fold and l= 3 can have 7 fold symmetry. The total comes out to be 16 i.e. 4^2. Please bear with what quantum mechanics did to all of us. And if you are too keen to know the details, please read a book by Zettili on qm. ",
