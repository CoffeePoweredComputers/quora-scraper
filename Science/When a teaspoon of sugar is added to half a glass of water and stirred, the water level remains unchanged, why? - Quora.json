            "answer_text": "It does change; the observation was not done precisely enough. Were you to add 20 teaspoons of sugar would you notice? nothing magical about one teaspoon. In doing any research one must ascertain that you are measuring what you purport to be measuring and you must establish detection limits and accuracy limits. You seem to have succeeded in none of the basic requirements. First accurately measure the water volume this alone could be difficult as the water is slowly evaporating and if fairly warm contracting as it cools; this means the volume is slowly decreasing so there is a minimum amount of sugar that if added maintains a constant volume. This is your detection limit. Now add the teaspoon etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes..good question\u2026but wrong on coming to the conclusion that the volume remains unchanged. The increase in volume is very very slight\u2026but it does increase. You can prove this by going to the saturation point and checking for visual conformation that i am hoping can be seen. I had the same question many years ago but i accepted the answer w/o checking to see the proof for myself. ",
