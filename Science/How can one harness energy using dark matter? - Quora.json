            "answer_text": "It cannot be harnessed at this time and perhaps never.  Dark Matter is a place holder  for our ignorance  of certain gravitational effects.  It is a hypothesis that accounts for the non-Keplerian motion of stars in the far outer parts of galaxies and which accounts for some gravitational lensing of light.   Until we can say what Dark Matter is made of (if it exists) we are in the realm of the hypothetical. ",

            "answer_text": "Dark matter doesn't interact with normal matter, the only effect it has on us is through gravity. As of now it seems we can't use dark matter as energy. However our knowledge on dark matter is extremely limited, until we get any breakthroughs in this field we can only make assumptions. ",
