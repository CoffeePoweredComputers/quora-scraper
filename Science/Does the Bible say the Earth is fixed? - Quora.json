            "answer_text": "After some research, the only place I can find Bible passages with the word \"fixed\" (in regards to the Earth or the world) are websites that talk about the flat Earth (like this one[1]). They say they are using the \"New English Bible\" for these verses: 1 Chronicles 16:30 - \"He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.\"Psalm 93:1 - \"Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm.\"Psalm 96:10 - \"He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.\"Psalm 104:5 -\"Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken.\"But when I look up the passages on BibleHub[2] there is no mention of \"fixed\" in the many different Bible versions it lists. For example, here are the same verses from the King James Version: 1 Chronicles 16:30 - \u201cFear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.\u201dPsalm 93:1 - \"The world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.\u201dPsalm 96:10 - \" The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved.\"Psalm 104:5 - \u201cWho laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.\u201dAnd the other Bible versions I looked at also use \"moved\" phrasing instead of \"fixed\". I guess it's a matter of interpretation. But one thing is for sure: I can't find anywhere in the Bible that says the Earth is an oblate spheroid (or any kind of rotating ball orbiting the Sun) or that the Earth is just one of several planets in a heliocentric solar system (and not the center of everything).

            "answer_text": "Ah, this is one of those questions that invite \u201canswers\u201d from out on the fringe, which, when you look at them, are non-answers, really. They\u2019re just circular and teleological perorations. You seek actual information. You want to know if the Bible says the Earth is fixed in the universe. For starters, the term Earth (ha-aretz), at least in the Hebrew Scriptures, did not mean what it means now. It meant the land under their feet as distinct from the sea and the sky. English has the two words sky and heaven, but Biblical Hebrew has only one: shamayim. It is inaccurate to say that shamayim means both sky and heaven; rather, in Biblical Hebrew the differentiation between the visible sky and some unseen supernatural location was vague and imprecise. Furthermore, modern readers of English translations of the Bible with no knowledge of Hebrew don\u2019t realize that traditional Biblical translations get an awful lot wrong. For example, Genesis begins, \u201cIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\u201d \u201cHeaven and earth\u201d is a merism. It does not mean literally the heaven and the earth. It is using 2 opposite things to create a third thing. Like \u201cblack-and-white\u201d photography. Here black and white is a merism that actually means \u201cblack and white and all shades of gray in between.\u201d So what the first verse of Genesis really says is, \u201cIn the beginning God created the worldly realm\u201d because the ancient Hebrew had no word for \u201cuniverse.\u201d The ancients, even if they thought the Earth was round (reference Eratosthenes), did not know they lived on a planet. To them, in the sky were the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. All the stars were fixed against the background of the sky, except for five: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They moved with respect to the other stars, so they were called \u201cwandering stars\u201d by the Greeks; the word for wanderers in Greek was planetes. In the Bible, \u201cearth\u201d is a term with a definite center but no definite outer boundaries; beyond the lands they knew was unknown territory, about which there were only myths and legends. So to answer your question: The Bible does not say anything about whether the Earth is fixed, because the concept of Earth as something that could move didn\u2019t exist. For their cosmology, the early Church adopted the Ptolemaic scheme of the universe (reference the Almagest). So the Church doctrine that got Galileo put under house arrest for the last years of his life was not Christian at all, or even Biblical. It was Hellenistic Greek. The arrogance of power. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\u201d Genesis\u202c 1:1-31\u202c KJV\u202c\u202c A couple of millenia later, man wrote the following observation of this long-time occurrence: \u201cThy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.\u201d Psalms\u202c 119:90\u202c KJV\u202c\u202c Today, even more millennia later, and considering all things on the list presented at the beginning of this answer, I\u2019d say that man\u2019s long-time assessment remains valid.

We can observe this from gravitational data. The earth is rotating on a fixed axis if that is what you are referring to here. The season's will not fail and the rotation will continue. ",
