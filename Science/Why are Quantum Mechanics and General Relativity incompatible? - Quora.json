            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics and general relativity are incompatible because they define space in different ways. Quantum mechanics defines space with an absolute, fixed, Cartesian, Galilean coordinate system against which matter moves. It is a snapshot that tells you the state of something in a given instant. General relativity defines space with a relative, flexible, Riemannian, Lorentzian coordinate system that changes when matter moves. It is a blurred video that tells you the state of something over a timestep. One way to bridge the gap between the two coordinate systems is to surround each quantum particle with a quantum of space which changes in size in proportion to the mass and movement of the particle it surrounds. This unmeasurable quantum of space acts as a dynamic conversion factor between the coordinate systems and it might be thought of as a type of \u2018particle\u2019. Such a dynamic conversion factor is typically given by a somewhat unconventional interpretation of the uncertainty principle - the more momentum a particle has, the bigger the steps it takes in space, and the bigger the steps that are taken by a group of particles, the more massive they will act, warping or increasing the turbulence of the space around them. A critical mistake is made in estimates of this conversion or scaling factor when we create a model consisting of stationary particles within a gravitational well. This is a mistake because a more sensible interpretation of the heuristics of quantum mechanics or the heuristics of gravity tells us that quantum particles in a gravitational field are never stationary and if you model them as such, you will end up with sloppy mathematical estimates full of infinities. Heuristically, the reason for this is clear: the uncertainty principle tells us that the smallest step sizes correspond to almost infinite momentum or energy changes if the particle exists in a rapidly oscillating, accelerating reference frame. This mistake is the reason for the common, pop-sci lamentation that quantum mechanics doesn\u2019t fit with general relativity because it leads to \u2018infinities\u2019 when an attempt is made to scale the space around the particles to bring the absolute and relative coordinate systems into agreement. You would learn this from a high-quality physics classroom, but I\u2019m not sure how prevalent those are these days. Instead, students are often encouraged to gape at the vastness of the difference in the estimates of the energy density of free space made by the two frameworks. General relativity estimates 10^9 Joules per cubic meter and quantum mechanics estimates 10^113 Joules per cubic meter, but this discrepancy might be bridged with a spatial conversion which ties the cosmos to an absolute coordinate system and makes the general relativity cubic meter considerably smaller than the quantum mechanics cubic meter, thus dramatically shrinking the size of the cosmos. Of course, such an approximation might be terribly ill-conceived if the energy density of space varies across the starry night sky. Nevertheless, since quantum mechanics and general relativity can be viewed as static approximations of a more dynamic, Eulerian, fluid, underlying system, this establishment of a conversion factor between general relativity and quantum mechanics will not eliminate the errors general relativity makes when attempting to describe galaxies. One could invent an additional, unmeasurable, invisible, \u2018dark matter\u2019 particle to bridge this gap, but I don't think that ad hoc solutions like that are terribly satisfying. That is why I am drawn to the appeal of absolute space, Galilean Maxwell\u2019s equations, gravitoelectromagnetism, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, etc.. as a depiction of nature that is less of an approximation. I am, of course, not blind to the appeal and utility of approximations. Even though we know that the Navier Stokes equation does a better job of describing dynamic systems, it takes a ridiculous amount of computing resources. This makes static approximations indispensable. Nevertheless, I could do without the mathematical mysticism of those pop-scientists who fall in love with their approximations. I could also do without the physical fanaticism of those who search for unmeasurable particles. There is plenty of room at the bottom of the scientific hierarchy for those who will happily slave away on behalf of cargo cult science. Here I go again down the rabbit hole - I\u2019m using physics to distract myself from my hopes and fears while trying to peek underneath the surfaces defined by the mathematicians. It is good medicine sometimes, but as with all medicines, the poison is in the dose! The purpose of this heuristic investigation of general relativity and quantum mechanics is to create new hypotheses and, based on what I wrote above, I am now wondering about the following hypothesis: if general relativity makes an error in describing galaxies because it is a static approximation of a more dynamic system, does quantum mechanics make a similar error when it describes a particle? Do fundamental particles similarly experience a rotational drag which would be consistent with tired light physics? The quantum thermodynamic behavior of positive entropy might be viewed as an approximation of fluid processes such as - the drag crisis. ",

            "answer_text": "The general relativity does not have an propagator of force.  As such gravity is not quantized.   All other forces are quantized.  Electromagnetism is quantized by  the photon.  The weak force is quantized by the W+, W-, and Z boson.  The strong force is quantized by gluons.   All of these quatizations involving integrating over space and time. If you don't quantized general relativity then you run into contradictions with quantum mechanics.   The easiest one to understand is the infinite universe problem: Observations indicate that the universe is probably infinite, even though the observed universe is finite.   General relativity has absolutely no problem describing a universe with only mass and gravity and how it could evolve from a single point to an infinite universe.   The expansion rate of the universe has varied over time.  But if you pick any time where the universe was a finite size, the expansion rate has also been finite.   Say for example, I ask how many times the universe doubled in size of the last 11 billion years, I will get a finite answer.    A problem that inspired the Eternal inflation  model:  Quantum mechanics tells us the minimum size for any object, including the universe is a finite size.   e.g. The minimum diameter is one plank unit.   General relativity tells us the universe only doubled a finite number of times since it was one plank unit in size.   So, how can we have an infinite universe?   You can't say the beginning of the universe must have been larger, because then it means further contraction was possible by going back further in time, so it wasn't the beginning of the universe.   We are left we to conflicting predictions.  Quantum mechanics tells us the universe must be finite, and general relativity tells us it can be infinite. This is just the simplest example I could think of as a contradiction...  There are many more such examples that become apparent with black holes.  The information paradox is one such paradox, but it is much harder for me to explain why it is a paradox.   I personally don't understand why information can't be destroyed, but I accept it on faith. So if we want a consistent results, gravity needs be quantized.   At first that seems easy.   Just add graviton to the model, that acts like a photon.   The problem comes gravitons have to do something different than deliver a force to be consistent with general relativity.  Gravitons need to curve space.   But how do you integrate over space-time to calculate the effects of gravitons if the gravitons themselves are changing the condition of the integration?  Each graviton is transferring energy, so gravitons themselves would need to interact with other gravitons, cascading into an infinite number of gravitons for ever single event.  This is known as the Graviton and renormizationn  problem. There are of course solutions to this problem.  One of them is quantum loop gravity M-theory.   But many other solutions are possible, all that fit within the realm of actual observations.  Without a single unique solution, or even one that is clearly much simpler than all the others, then we have a challenging problems to test and find-out which is correct (if any). ",
