            "answer_text": "I have read all the answers to this question so far and they are all really good and true but I feel that they are piecework. Everyone features one aspect of the question but I felt slightly uncomfortable with the arguments. One answer stated quantum mechanics as a reason, one a divergence law, several talked about space time topology. All true but not also to some degree not. So let me try my own answer. In my opinion relativity is the cause for the similarity. Coulombs and Newtons law of gravitation both state that the field strength drops with [math]1/r[/math] and the force is [math]1/r^2[/math]. In one case masses appear as constants and in the other there are electrical charges. Why is that so and what is the fundamental reason for it? One basic ingredient of both laws is that the force[math] F[/math] is the gradient i.e. the first derivative of a potential [math]\\phi[/math]. [math]F(x) = \\nabla \\phi (x)[/math] This is nothing else then both being a conservative force. It means that no matter how you move out of a gravitational or electric field, you need the same energy. The energy needed doesn\u2019t depend on the path you take. The second basic ingredient is the Poisson equation [math]\\nabla F (x) = \\nabla \\nabla \\phi (x) = \\rho (x)[/math] that both forces fulfil. It says, in simple words, that the cause of the force is a localised charge or mass distribution [math]\\rho[/math]. Wherever the is mass or charge, the potential curves. Where there is no mass or charge, means \\rho = 0, there is no curvature of the potential. Remember that [math]\\nabla \\nabla \\phi[/math] is a second (vector) derivative and second derivative are curvatures. The truth behind the Poisson equation is in simple words the following statement: the force is conservative and created by a source that is localised in space. Outside that localised source of the potential there is nothing to change it and it becomes constant gradually. This is commonality of the Coulomb and Newton potential. Charge causes the electric field to curve. Mass causes the gravitational field to curve. Outside of charge or mass, no curvature. It take a only bit of math to show that the solution of the Poisson equation in 3 spatial dimensions is a [math]1/r [/math]force outside the mass or charge. It is an interesting exercise to do this in 2 or 1 dimension. Weird force laws emerge. In one dimensions the force get stronger linear with the distance. That\u2019s why electromagnetism in 1-d is a confined force just like QCD in 3-d. A nice paper on this would be http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/2dem.pdf What is the origin of the commonality of Coulomb and Newton? The deeper reason can be seen walking through the derivation of both laws [1]. I don\u2019t copy the proofs here because they are lengthy and just summarise a bold and basic statement. The only way interaction in relativistic systems can be described is through laws that lead to a Poisson equation in the non relativistic limit. To be Lorentz invariant an interaction has to have the property of cause by a source localised in space that curves a field. Outside the origin on that source, may it be a mass or a charge, the curvature of the field must be zero. This means that the Poisson law is a property of space-time itself. One answer stated that quantum mechanics and the exchange of massless particles is the cause for the shape of the laws. While it is of course true, it turns the true reason around. The properties of space-time cause interactions to be massless gauge bosons. It is the only way interaction can work and be Lorentz invariant. I state this also to demonstrate, how deep Einstein\u2019s relativity really goes. It is extremely fundamental.

            "answer_text": "Gilberto Mertins has provided the answer, but failed to provide any references to confirm his statement. His background in physics negates the need, as his knowledge obviously outweighs mine by several factors of 10. Here is a reference that might confirm Gilberto's statement in hard copy: Electric forces from HyperPhysics.phy at Georgia State University You will have to go to that source to get the context of the following quote from that site, but just to hold a carrot out: \"Note that this satisfies Newton's third law because it implies that exactly the same magnitude of force acts on  q2. Coulomb's law is a vector equation and includes the fact that the force acts along the line joining the charges. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Coulomb's law describes a force of infinite range which obeys the inverse square law, and is of the same form as the gravity force.\" In fact Coulomb's Law seems to confirm two of Newton's Laws, since this reference talks of the relation to Newton's Third Law of Motion as well as Newton's Law of universal gravitation. The inverse square rule applies to gravity.The Third Law of Motion talks of the fundamental symmetry principles of the universe, which mirrors Coulomb's field of study whereby two unlike charges attract one another.In fact all field theory is affected by the inverse square rule, unless I'm mistaken, in which case I know I will be corrected very soon. Coulomb's Law expressed in mathematical notation seems to be in the same form as Newton's Second Law of Motion. Therefore, Coulomb's Law may also confirm Newton's Second Law of Motion as well, although that may be just a coincidence of mathematical notation. At any rate, it's something that makes you go \"hmmm\". ",
