            "answer_text": "Police investigation has only one goal: identifying and arresting people who have committed crimes. It starts with the endpoint\u2014the crime committed and works backward. It is a very limited enquiry and police often stop investigating when they have identified a suspect. This can sometimes lead to the wrong person being prosecuted. Scientific investigations do not have a predetermined outcome. Or, to put it another way it starts with a premise, say \u201cdoes drug X treat Y disease effectively.\u201d The scientist tests the hypothesis without knowing the end result. ",
