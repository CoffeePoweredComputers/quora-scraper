            "answer_text": "Elevation in boiling point of liquid due to any soluble solid is governed by the colligative property (a property that will depend on the no of particals present not their chemical or physical properties ) as sugar is soluble in water it can be no exception so it must elevate the boiling point of water . But the amount of elevation is too low aslow as 0.1 to 0.3 for sugar as it doesnot ionize to produce more no of particles upon dissolution but the other ionic salts do so they will have much larger elevation in boiling point The elevation in boiling point is directly proportional to the molality of solution formed ie no of moles of solute dissolved in each kg of solvent and is given by  ",

            "answer_text": "Because you\u2019re not just boiling water anymore. You\u2019re augmenting the contents in something like a pot, so when you boil contents that are not water, the boiling point changes. Sugar also bonds to the water molecules very well - something that isn\u2019t always the case when combining liquid substances. If that doesn\u2019t seem like something easy to follow then just keep it simple: you\u2019re not boiling water anymore, you\u2019re boiling something else. The boiling point of two unequal substances will never be exactly the same. The more dense the liquid, the harder it is to heat up and boil. ",
