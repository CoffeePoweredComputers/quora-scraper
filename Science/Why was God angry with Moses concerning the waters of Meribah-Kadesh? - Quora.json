            "answer_text": "In Numbers 20:11, we are told that Moses struck the rock, because he had already struck the same rock once on a previous occasion years earlier (Exodus 17:6). On the first occasion, he had been instructed by God to strike the rock, but on the second occasion only to speak to it. By striking it twice, Moses was being doubly disobedient. God is easily angered, so he told Moses that because he did not obey the command merely to speak to the rock, he would not lead the Israelites into Canaan. The story needed a reason for Moses to be denied the chance to lead the Israelites into Canaan, and this was it. ",

            "answer_text": "Instead, Moses struck the rock with his staff. We read that God commanded Moses to speak to the rock at Meribah so that water could flow out of it. ... But Moses was angry since the people he was leading had been complaining. So in his anger instead of going what God asked him to do .. he struck the rock with his rod but this is not true. God never got annoyed with Moses. He was beloved Prophet and known as Kaleem Allah, one who spoke to God ",
