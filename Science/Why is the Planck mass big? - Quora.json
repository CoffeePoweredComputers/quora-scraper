            "answer_text": "That question means nothing by itself. Any mass is the size it is, numerically, because of how we\u2019ve chosen our units. A better way to ask the question is to ask, \u201cWhy is the Planck mass significant in day-to-day mass units while the Planck length and the Planck time are unbelievably tiny?\u201d Physicists often choose units where they define the speed of light and the Planck constant as \u201c1.\u201d That\u2019s just 1, with no units. This is actually the most natural and logical way to define units, but it has little to do with our day-to-day experiences. To some extent the Planck mass is big because we measure length and time and mass and force in units that are reasonable for our day-to-day lives, and that\u2019s just how it works out. In these \u201cPlanck units,\u201d each of the four universal constants listed here are defined as 1: the speed of light cthe gravitational constant gthe reduced Planck constant h-barBoltzmann\u2019s constant k<sub B>This leads to a Planck mass of 1 as well. So in natural units the Planck mass is in the same \u201caround 1\u201d range as the other Planck units. Of course, the problem with using these units in day-to-day life is that the myriad things we need to measure would have very strange values. The speedometer of your car, for instance, would indicate very tiny numbers, etc. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "This is firmly in the \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d category. This is one of the many ways of asking why the force of gravity is so weak. More precisely, why is the scale where gravity gets important so much bigger than any other scale in particle physics. For this we would need a theory giving us clues about where the patameters of the current model comes from. ",
