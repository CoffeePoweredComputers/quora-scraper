            "answer_text": "Well, the aircraft bump or shake in the air is not because of the clouds but mostly due to the turbulence or a high speed wind in the atmosphere at higher altitudes. This is a very common phenomenon in the atmosphere and most of us have experienced it atleast once in our life time travelled by plane.  Turbulence is simply defined as a high speed mass of air travelling from one place to another place meet with an another high speed mass of air or object traveling its opposite direction.  We know that aircraft travel at very high speed also create a high speed air pushed away. When the airplane meet the high speed mass of air ,there will be a swirling of air which will shake the airplane, which may give a feeling of vibration to the aircraft that is often felt by the passengers inside leaving a scary experience.  Having said that, there is no big harm caused by such turbulence to the aircraft and it often leave the aircraft without much damage. However , worst turbulence with unprecedented situation can lead to disaster as well. But most of the cases aircraft will be able to get over such a turbulence as aircraft is a very heavy and fast moving object.

            "answer_text": "An aeroplane reacts to those updrafts and downdrafts by encountering more prominent or lesser lift on its wings, and that differential is the thing that causes a disturbance, the juddering and knocking that travellers feel inside the aeroplane. Pilots try to maintain a strategic distance from mists for clear blue sky however that is not generally conceivable ",
