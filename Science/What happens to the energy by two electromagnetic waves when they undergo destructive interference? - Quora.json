            "answer_text": "In Classical Physics, energy must be conserved. However, when 2 waves meet up in a head-on collision, and when they are exactly the opposite in frequency and amplitude, they can cancel each other out to form a Null Point, or Nothingness. And Nothingness = 0. But wait\u2026, since energy can neither be created or destroyed how is this possible. Well, since it happens over such a brief time period then the energy of a (+) wave and energy of a (-) wave = 0 = Nothingness, and which is briefly stored as Nothingness and is indicated by \u201cA\u201d the flat line in destructive interference - see diagram below. And then created back to their original waveforms where Nothingness = 0 = (+) wave and a (-) wave and the 2 waves continue on uninterrupted like nothing happened. That way the total energy of the system is conserved. Now the problem with that theory, is that there is no such thing as, The Law of Nothingness being able to store energy. But yet Nothingness = 0 = (+1) and (-1) for whatever amount of time that you want to assign.. And when looking at the diagrams below, the 2 waves pass each other head-on in a destructive pattern but continue on unaffected. How can this be. Maybe this is similar to quantum mechanics, where particles pop into and out of existence from Nothingness.  And now comes the most interest phenomena, Tears in the Space-Time Continuum caused by this brief cancellation (a rift of Nothingness) to allow an opening into a Cosmos of Nothingness, also referred to as Subspace, Voids, or Wormholes in Sci-Fi adventures. For example, the Bermuda Triangle where boats, planes, and people just disappeared without a trace. Could it be that they\u2019re still alive but in a different universe? Scientists Detect Rip in Space-Time Continuum And although impossible imagine, the Concept of Nothingness is what gave rise to our universe and its anti-universe partner Dark Matter/Energy. And most likely this Nothingness still exists but is protected by the Fabric of the Space-Time Continuum. But just like EM waves can cancel in destructive interference, so too could waves of this Space-Time Fabric cause a cancellation resulting is a tear and an opening into a Cosmos of Nothingness where countless other universes exist. Even Einstein believed that The Space-Time Fabric could tear. See the following article for a description of Nothingness and the Binary Universe System: George Davros's answer to Is it possible for nothingness to exist in/outside the universe? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question I once wrote about extensively in another forum. I don\u2019t recall where it was, but I bet Google does\u2026 ah, here we go: What happens to the energy when waves perfectly cancel each other? The bottom line is this: If you look at the full context \u2014 the broader surrounding region in space \u2014 of any example of destructive interference, you will find that what is really happening is that energy is being reflected away from the region of destructive interference. The energy is not destroyed; you have simply built a mirror! In fact, that is how real mirrors work. The interaction of electromagnetic waves with the free (\u201cFermi surface\u201d) electrons of the metal creates reciprocal fields, a sort of rebound effect, that cancel out the waves of the light itself. At a first level of analysis, especially if you focus only on the thin layer of metal in which these fields cancel each other out, it looks like destructive interference has destroyed the photon, violating conservation of energy. But as soon as you pull out to the broader perspective, you realize that all these self-canceling wave really did was create a barrier through which the photons cannot travel. So they instead reflect, forming a mirror. This is always true in cases of destructive interference; the energy is always reflected away from the region of destructive interference, and into some other region of space. Energy conservation is not tricked this easily! ",
