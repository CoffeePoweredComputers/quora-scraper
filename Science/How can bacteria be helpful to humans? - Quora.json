            "answer_text": "On and inside the human body, bacteria create huge benefits, most of which are essential for life. For example in the digestive system , they help us break down food, like plant fibers or milk, that we're not so good a handling ourselves. Bacteria in the digestive system also supply us with needed vitamins like biotin and vitamin K, and are our primary source for some of these nutrients. Experiments done on guinea pigs have shown that animals raised in a sterile environment without any bacteria are malnourished and die young. Outside the body, the forest of bacteria on the skin (almost 200 separate species on a normal person) dominates the environment of the skin and its resources, keeping other bacteria from being able to establish a foothold. And in or out, exposure to bacteria has been shown to be an important part of the development of our immune systems . Exposure to bacteria, both benign and harmful, is what primes the immune system to respond to pathogenic invaders later in life. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, for instance, has also shown that children who are sheltered from bacteria have a higher chance of developing asthma and allergies. This is not to say beneficial bacteria can't also be dangerous. Usually, helpful bacteria and harmful bacteria are mutually exclusive. But there is a overlap, notably in the bacteria that inhabit the body. Staph bacteria is a good example, because it's all over our skin. A colony of Staphylococcus aureus living on the arm might be plugging along, crowding out intruders without harming the body, but if you get a cut or your immune system is compromised , those bacteria can run amok causing an infection. The number of bacterial cells in the body is commonly estimated at 10 times the number of human cells. That's caused a lot of scientists to describe us as more bacteria than human. It's a little creepy, but it helps you visualize how large a role these organisms play. ",

            "answer_text": "Without bacteria, most other, if not all, life forms could not exist. Bacteria are the ultimate recyclers. In a single teaspoon of soil, over a billion bacteria can be found. Plants need nitrogen for growth and for proteins. But they can't use nitrogen in air. Soil bacteria though, through their own cellular metabolism can use gasous nitrogen converting to nitrates and nitrites as part of their waste, forms which can then be absorbed by plant roots. Other bacteria (and fungi) also break down organic matter (dead plants and animals) into forms absorbed by plant roots. Thus bacteria aid in converting abiotic matter into biotic forms. Plants feed herbivores and omnivores and in turn, other omnivores and carnivores eat those animals. Without bacteria, the wastes produced by animals and the bodies of dead animals, from tiny nematodes to insects to larger animals would remain intact. Bacteria recycles all this. Besides yogurt and keffir mentioned by John J. Peloquin, bacteria are responsible for the fermentation of many foods from sauerkraut to certain soy sauces to black tea and much more. Ruminants (such as cows) with multiple stomach chambers are able to break down indigestible cellulose into absorbable carbohydrates through the action of their gut bacteria. Because the many billions of bacteria in their gut have a very short lifespan, the dead bacterial cells are an invaluable source of protein for ruminants. In biotechnology, bacteria are used to produce human insulin and human growth factors as well as antibiotics. I remember how excited the medical world was able to offer diabetics actual human insulin. The human insulin comes from the gene that produces insulin in humans, which has been spliced into a bacterial genome using recombinant DNA technology. The bacterium produces the insulin, which is then purified for human use. Before there was genetically engineered human insulin, diabetics were given insulin extracted from pig pancreases, which was similar to, but not exactly like, human insulin. Because it was not exactly like human insulin, the pig insulin caused complications in some diabetic patients. from  10.2 Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture Too often people think of the negative aspects when they hear the word bacteria but bacteria do a huge amount of good for our world. The disease causing bacteria, while seemingly to be a large number, are very few compared to bacteria that benefit life.   ",

They also produce some vitamins which are helpful for the human body. E. coli is the specie which resides in the digestive tract of humans and help in breaking down the lactose. The new born babies do not suffer or have fewer chances of suffering from diarrhea if they are administered with the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri or Bifidobacterium. The process of fermentation takes place with the help of bacteria. If the milk is fermented and contains live bacteria Lactobacillus casei, it removes the harmful bacteria Helicobacter pylori from children's body. Similarly, Saccharomyces boulardii also helps to reduce the risk of antibiotic associated diarrhea from the children. Some bacterial species live on our skin and protect it from getting fungal infections. If the DNA molecule undergoes some internal damage in its structure or function, six strains or bacteria help to reduce the damage. It can be said that human body is just like a home to bacteria. They live within almost every part of the body as well as outside the body. There are many bacteria which live inside mouth, throat, nose and intestines and perform various useful functions. They also do not let the harmful microorganisms live inside or on the human body and in return provide benefit to the human body. Various species of bacteria live in the humans' intestine and work with the immune system to protect the body against various diseases. Some intestinal bacteria are able to produce Vitamin A and K. the main function of bacteria residing in the stomach is to maintain the ph and acidity level in the stomach.

These are as follows : Some breads and dough are made to rise by fermentation, with a leaven that consists of bacteria, often combined with yeasts.The milk-souring bacterium Lactobacillus is used to make yogurt and cheese. Bacteria are used, too, to form organic acids in pickles and vinegar.Bacteria are extensively used in the chemical manufacturing of ethanol, acetone, organic acid, enzymes, and perfumes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of pharmaceuticals.Bacteria play many roles in agriculture from bio-degradation to food production. Bacteria are often employed in the dairy industry for making yogurt, ripening cheese and giving certain dairy products a specific aroma. Bacteria including Bacillus aceti convert wine or beer into vinegar easily.Using biotechnology techniques, or biomedical technology bacteria can also be bio-engineered for the production of therapeutic proteins.The Escherichia coli (E-coli) that lives in the human large intestine synthesizes vitamin B and releases it for human use. Similarly, Clostridium butyclicum is used for commercial preparation of riboflavin(vit. B2), and vitamin B & vitamin K.Bacteria can also be used in the place of pesticides in biological pest control. This commonly uses Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environment friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators, and most other beneficial insects.The bacteria present in the stomach of cattle helps in the digestion of cellulose.Bacteria are used to separate fibers of jute, hemp and flax in the process of fiber retting.With the aid of gene therapy, transfer of normal genes to human cells can also be engineered.",

Repeated research using murine models show that \u201csterile\u201d born and raised mouse pups have reduced immunity later in life and have increased incidence of autoimmunity when compared to pups born in a \u201cnormal\u201d environment. Human studies mirror this. The increasing use of fecal transplantation has helped patients restore immune function and reduce infection. This is especially important in view of the overuse of antimicrobial drugs. Clostridium difficile is a spore forming anaerobe that easily survives antimicrobial regimens and causes pseudomembranous colitis, a serious life threatening infection in the very and young and very old. Many of our commensal MOs occupy environmental niches that inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria, espcially in the GI tract and skin. Lactobacilli produces acids in the GI and vaginal tract. Various Gram negatives process Vitamin K which is needed for coagulation. ",

            "answer_text": "How are bacteria beneficial to us? I can think of a few ways\u2026 Some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, produce metabolic byproducts that are actually useful or even beneficial to us. E. coli produces vitamin K, our major source of the vitamin, in case you didn\u2019t know.Bacteria tend to outcompete parasites and other pathogens for space. And if the pathogens can\u2019t find a place to reside, they can\u2019t infect the host.Some bacteria produce bacteriocins, which restrict or kill bacteria of similar species. So the E. coli in your gut probably killed the E. coli you ingested when you ate that meat that was not prepared properly first.An argument can be made that gut flora actually teaches the immune system to recognize pathogenic bacteria, and that teaching helps you to fight off infections even faster. So the E. coli in your gut that you very likely got either from birth or breast milk taught your immune system to recognize E. coli, and as soon as it enters your body from an external source your immune system recognizes and attacks it with a much stronger immune system than if it were the first infection.I\u2019m just sticking to inside the host\u2019s body. There are other uses for bacteria outside of the host\u2019s body as well, such as understanding antibiotic resistance and getting to explore virus replication. That may sound useless to you, but these things must be done to tackle bacterial and viral infections efficiently and with the least damage done to the host. ",

Do you know that human guts and intestines are the natural habitat for bacterial species. There is common term in biology for that \u201c human microbiota\u201d - it is the aggregate of microorganism that lives in the human tissue and bio-fluids which includes skin, mammary glands, uterus, ovarian follicles, saliva, oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tracts. These aggregates includes bacteria fungi protists and viruses, but here we talked about only bacteria. These bacteria are responsible for fortifying the immune system. They help in digestive system of the humans, safeguards to our skins. 2. They are efficient recyclers ; They are responsible for the decomposition of organic matter in soils and oceans. Some of bacterial groups can even chelate heavy metals from the soil and protect the environment from heavy metal contamination. 3. Plants and animals are not able to uptake the nitrogen without the help of bacteria.

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the most important function of bacteria in the body is that of your gut bacteria.  Your gut bacteria (also known as your gut microbiota) is made up of the ecosystem inside of your large intestine.  There are over 1000 species of bacteria that can be found in your large intestine.  Everyone shares 1/3 of their gut bacteria with most people on Earth, but 2/3 of our gut bacteria is unique to us.  This bacteria allows us to digest foods that our own digestive systems cannot (beans, for example) and also plays a role in immune regulation and vitamin production.   Our gut microbiota develops from after we are born to around the age of three and continues to develop throughout our lives.  Gut bacteria is formed as a result of everything we eat.  Babies start growing their microbiota from their mother's breast milk, and throughout their lives, everything that spends time in their intestine leaves some bacteria behind.  Thus, people who eat different foods have different gut bacteria.  Your gut bacteria is damaged by antibiotics, which is why doctors hesitate to prescribe too many antibiotics in a short period of time.  On the other hand, if you're interested in improving the state of your gut bacteria, it would be good to consume probiotics in the form of supplements or foods like yogurt or sauerkraut.   When people have severe issues with their gut bacteria, they may be advised to undergo a fecal transplant, which, like it sounds, is when the fecal matter (poop) of a healthy person is transferred into the large intestine of a sick person with the objective of introducing a healthy gut microbiota into an unhealthy system. That's all I know about it, hope this interested you!   ",

Those who are not familiar with the elementary rudiments of bacteriology have an erroneous concept of the role of bacteria in nature - that the some purpose of bacteria in this earth is to cause illness to humans. Plants and animals owe their existence to the fertility of the soil, and this in turn depends upon the activity of the soil population. Posts absorb their nutrients from the soil in the form of minerals. They cannot utilise organic compounds such as fat, carbohydrates and proteins. The soul soil organisms attack the human and animal carcasses and mineralise the organic constituents, making them available to plants. A few species of soul bacteria are capable of invading the roots of certain plays, where they take free nitrogen from the air and convert it into organic compounds which ate utilized btly plants. The bacteria, in torn, derive their nutrients from the sap of the plants. This may be cited as an excellent example of a symbiotic relationship occuring in nature between 2 different species. Bacteria are necessary for disposal of sewage. The convert the insoluble proteins, fats and cellulose into soluble, odourless compounds. The souring of milk is the result of bacterial action. This is the first step in the preparation of butter. Various types of industrial fermentations are produced by the action of bacteria. Butyric acid, acetone, butyl alcohol, lactic acid and propionic acid are produced by bacterial action. ",

Studies have revealed that human microbiome of every healthy individual differs remarkably in the matter of different varieties of microbes. In the body, these microbes are present in different parts such as skin, nasal cavity, oral cavity, gut and vagina and therefore stay in different habitats. Some microbes that colonize humans are commensal, whereas others have a mutualistic relationship with the host. These interactions are important for human to grow and stay healthy. Microbiome is an essential component of immunity and a functional entity that influences metabolism and modulates drug interactions. It has been known since long time that microorganisms in the human body play an important role in maintaining human health. ",
