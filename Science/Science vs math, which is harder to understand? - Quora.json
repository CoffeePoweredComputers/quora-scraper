            "answer_text": "No subject is hard provided if right way of learning and interest is created . Day -to- day application of principles of maths and science is incorporated in teaching- learning stratigies then learning becomes easier for the learner. I personally feel that the subject itself is not hard but the way in which it was taught that makes its difficult . What is familiar or known that becomes easy. What is unfamiliar or unknown becomes difficult. To internalise what is taught it should be in application and in its usage Personally what I feel hard or easy lies only the way in which it was taught not in the subject The teaching is an art and skill . If we rationalizes things what was taught then learning becones easier. For example we use to teach the value of \u03c0 as 22/7 .But never we try to explain about what 22 refers and what 7 refers and why it remains constant . We fail to teach them that 22 refers only the value of circumference and 7 refers diameter . Whatever may be the size of the circle the relationship between circumberance and diameter ratio remains 22/7. Did we ever teaught the students . Once I asked a question to a B.Ed examinee in aviva voce \u201cCould you define diameter in terms of cord \u201c.The student didn\u2019t answer .It Doesn't mean that he doesn't know the answer.He has not correlated the two concepts in his learning process .Correlation is most important in learning style. I will explain it by another example from a topic in science . Once the teacher teaught about electromagnets that e.ms are temporary magnets but never he explained about what happens when that become permanent magnet .If the magnet is not temporary magenet we could not use it in crane for lifting heavy metals .It is also not possible to use this principle in electric bell .Uless the magnet is electro magnet that is temporary the bell will not work. The teacher use to teach about non conductors of Electricity but not try to explain the importance of the chracterstic of nonconductivity of insulators only helps to make use of electrocity .Usually never explain the relationship between the two characterstics The importance characterstics of non- conductivity is only useful in insulators to appreciate the varied characterstics and their usage in relation with one another. Usually teacher explains about the status of matter .For example water remains in liquid state at room temperature but if the temperature raised above 100\u2103 water transform into the gasious state and when water condense that is cooled to 0\u2103 it becomes solid . Petrol is in liquid state at room temperature but when it is exposed to air it becomes gasious state . Teacher use to explains about flying of insects and birds but never he explains the difference between flying mechanism of insect and birds in relation to is anatomical structure. Once I posed a question to one of my student while explaining about insectivorous plant I asked what is the mechanism by which the skeleton of the insect eliminated by the insectivorous plant No student was able to gave correct answer. No student answered correctly that insects don't have skeleton system as they belong to invertebrates . Doesn't mean that students are not knowing tha answer but not able to correlate the two concepts . So hard or easy of anything lies only in the learning process not in the subject itself Once Eienstein able to explain the theory of relativity in a simplified wsy by quoting live example .He explained the concept as follows Talking with girls for five hours gives only the impression of five minutes of time whereas hearing a lecture by the teacher for five minutes appears as 5 hours Visualization and logical thinking is important in learning science and Maths .This is where we fail to trasnact So difficult or easy of any subject lies only in teaching and learning process not in the subject itself Usually extension of work of what we learnt in the classroom is to be given to elaborate and to experiment what is learnt inside the class room. Did we teach why shape of the triangle structure is used to support bridge construction and aso structuring the roof of the building .The triangle shape will not be changed by any pressure or heat Thomas Alva Edison was a school pushed out of the school since he ws a dyslexia patient. But his mother was able to educate him to become a scientist. Even the learning of History and Geography also become difficult if not properly taught. .So easy or difficulty in learning lies only in teaching . In Geography and history We ask the students to draw maps .Are we insist the scale of proportion to its reality .The teacher never explains that from. the scale one can deduce the distance between any two place from the map easily . In my practical class my teacher insisted me to record the magnification proportion. As a foot note the digram must carry the \u2018X' that is magnified or reduced It helps to visualize the original size of the organism or object .The real size of the organism may be too small or too big but to visualize the real size in the diagram one should mention its scale like writing units in mathematics in the practical record book. Maths is mother of all sciences Without mathematical approach we could not resolve any problem in science .So both science and mathematics are interrelated.If one feels science is easy, then mathematics also easy vice versa . The way of teaching and the way of learning only decides whether a subject easier or difficult ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm.. An interesting question. Maths and science. When I was a school kid, maybe in 6th or so, science was the way the world would work, the body would function or how the entire universe is stabe. And maths was PROBLEMS :D. Mere practice and by hearting is enough. But for science a practical understanding was needed. When i came to 10th and later 12th, it was like our thinking was how to score marks. Now coming to Maths, A lot of practice is enough for scoring cent. But Science, our teachers are under-qualified to teach a science concept. A practical science application approach would be best. Since this was lacking, obviously, Maths was easy. Now, after coming to engineering, after digging little deeper into science, i realized that Maths is entirely basis for science. Without Maths, science is inexistant. Take any concept, any derivation, and any metrics, you will find maths. Even to estimate the electron position with uncertainity you need maths. CONCLUSION: Maths is a part of science only, if you study Science, its like you are studying Maths. In terms of easiness, a person with practical approach will feel Science easy and person with hardworking approach wlll find Maths interesting. In terms of marks, Maths is easier, science is difficult. As in science, you will have to explain a logic to another person whose thinking may not match with that of yours. ",
