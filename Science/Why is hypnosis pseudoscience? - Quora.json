            "answer_text": "Why would you think it is? Hypnosis is the artificial induction of trance, followed by suggestion. These are things that occur naturally. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself involved in a novel, you\u2019ve experienced trance. If you\u2019ve ever been inspired by a speaker, you\u2019ve experienced suggestion. All hypnosis does is formalize that process. Upon seeing a patient for the first time, hypnotherapists routinely give them a suggestion \u2014 your arm will rise, or something like that \u2014 so that they know they\u2019ve been hypnotized. That overcomes their natural skepticism. Popular beliefs notwithstanding, hypnosis is actually a state in which the mind is unusually active. And because it gives us access to the subconscious mind, it can teach us much about how our minds work, while at the same time opening up behavioral possibilities that were previously hidden and closed.

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is the process of being placed in a suggestible trance. This is well known to science and does have some solid scientific uses However, like other things it can also be misused. If you are referring to the use of hypnotism in past lives regression or suppressed memories, then it becomes highly questionable as the person who has been hypnotized is very willing to give the answers that are being looked for, and may thus produce false memories which can take on a life of their own and become quite harmful.
