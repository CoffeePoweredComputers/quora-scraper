            "answer_text": "The Pauli exclusion principle means that two or more particles with half-integer spin cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state. Particles which are spinning in the same direction by the same amount are excluded from occupying the same space at the same time in the same way. It could also mean that if you write your physics with enough jargon, you will exclude most people from being able to understand it. Take one glance at the Lie algebra and ask yourself how many people it excludes. Do we know if there is an origin to the Pauli exclusion principle? If so, what is an intuitive explanation for it? ",

            "answer_text": "\"No two particles, fermions (electrons) can ever be in the same quantum state.\" As the principle suggests, if any two particles (electrons) are found to be sharing the same state, any one particle will be excluded from sharing that state. If it isn't, their combined wave-function will become zero. Think it like this: Two electrons meet each other. They have the same address (l, m, n). Now, as one will be in spin-up state, other will be excluded. That other electron will be excluded from having spin-up, it has to be spin-down. It is mandatory. ",

            "answer_text": "It means that there is a class of particles (called fermions) for which it is impossible to have two (or more) with the same quantum state (in all respects: energy, spin, etc.) at the same place. So one fermion excludes another. Another class of particles called bosons don\u2019t bother with that, they are happy together. The most famous boson is the photon. Fermions have spin 1/2 (or 3/2 etc). So for example in the lowest energy state in an atom that has only one spatial orientation (spherically symmetric) there can be two electrons: one with spin up and one with spin down. ",

Thus Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle point out that an orbital can not posses more than two electrons and moreover ,the two electrons can only be in the same orbital when their spins are opposite. Such electrons are called paired. Electrons of like spins tend to get as far apart from each other as possible.This tendency is the most important among all factors that determine the shapes and properties of molecules. ",
