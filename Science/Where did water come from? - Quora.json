            "answer_text": " Unlike all the planets in our solar system, Earth\u2019s surface is about 70% liquid water, which while favorable for life, is also kind of weird, because all we know about how and when our planet was created says Earth\u2019s surface should be dry as a bone. So, where did water come from? The story goes like this:Our solar system was created from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense ball of gas at the center ignited to create the sun, which as a young, unstable star discharged a fierce solar wind. In time this stream of charged particles pushed the leftover gas cloud farther and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to group together into rocks, planetesimals, and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know and love today. And here is the problem:Water, in the form of ice, couldn\u2019t have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the beginning of the inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water to survive, and any water vapor would have been shot away by the same solar wind. If Earth didn\u2019t begin it\u2019s life with H2O, how did we end up with such vast and beautiful oceans? Where did water come from? We know it wasn\u2019t created here over the ages, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis manufacture and destroy roughly equal volumes of water \u2013 and either way, the amounts in question are so tiny that they can\u2019t account for all the riches of the stuff on the planet today.Since Earth\u2019s H2O was neither part of the original package nor created here, it must have came in from far away, on meteoroids or comets or other bodies made in the outer solar system where they were far enough from that ball of fire, so frozen water can exist. The dirty iceballs, we call comets, are a valid candidate for the source of our water, but they were ruled out when we discovered that they are far too abundant in heavy hydrogen then Earth water.Heavy hydrogen has a neutron as well as a proton in its nucleus. ( Just to let you guys know. ) And for every million hydrogen atoms in our water, about 150 are heavy ones, while common comet water has twice that many. These different chemical signatures point that Earth\u2019s water could not have arrived on comets. Carbonaceous Chondrite It looks like that the most likely candidate for the water on our planet is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. \u201cChondrite\u201d is just the label given to the class of stony meteoroids that most regularly bombard the Earth. But only carbonaceous chondrites have water \u2013 and lots of carbon, if you couldn\u2019t figure out that from their name.They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun\u2019s \u201cfrost line\u201c, and their water has levels of heavy hydrogen identical to that of earth H2O, strongly indicating that these earth-crashers are the source or our rivers,lakes, clouds, oceans and ice caps.

            "answer_text": "Among raw substances in the Universe there are bases and acids. When they come together, they release energy, water and salt.Note that the ocean is salty! This is a basic chemical explanation, but water is also a very stable substance, and may be very abundant in universe.Water (H-O-H) is in the same time a base (has an O-H), an acid (has an H) and an oxide (has an O) and is nothing of all those in the same time: to be produced either by neutralization of acid/base (from rocks) reaction or by oxidation of hydrogen, a lot of energy has been released - water is very stable! This is why we cannot burn water (or salt) as we can not burn ashes or rusts! (Other abundant substances in Universe may be Methane and Oil! The native hydrogen combines with many elements, but other elements are not so native: they form in the explosion of supernovae. In these explosions most or all of the chemical elements are formed, but with different probabilities; elements around Carbon (Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen) have the higher probability.)  The Bible says that God has separated the the waters above from the waters bellow (with the firmament) and while this seems quit vague, the Sumerians have the same story in their 7-chaptered creation book, however they refer to planets and Asteroid belt (the firmament!)According to them Firmament (hammer kick) is a result of a cosmic collision between an astral body and the planet Tiamat - a quite big planet composed mainly of water and full of life. The result of this collision was Earth, Moon, Asteroid Belt and comets. But disregarding their story about the source of water on Earth from Tiamat, they still name the other planets - waters, and this seems to be consistent with the actual science, which observes that water is present in all planets in the Solar System, including on Mercury...
