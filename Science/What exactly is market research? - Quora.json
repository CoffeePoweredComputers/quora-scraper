            "answer_text": "Market Research Market research is the process of collecting valuable information to help you find out if there is a market for your proposed product or service. The information gathered from market research helps budding entrepreneurs make wise and profitable business decisions.The key to any successful business is to understand what it is that your customers want and giving this to them in a way that is profitable for you. Many entrepreneurs make the mistake early on of thinking that they know what their customers want without ever asking them. This can result in some very expensive mistakes later on. In order to find out what exactly it is that your customers want you must undertake a process called \u2018Market Research\u2019. This module will give you a basic understanding of the concept of market research, its various uses and provide guidance on how you can design your own market research questionnaire for your mini-company. Types Of Market Research There are two main types of market research you can carry out for your business: Primary Research (otherwise known as \u2018Field Research\u2019): this is information you gather first hand yourself through exercises like customer questionnaires or polls.Secondary Research (otherwise known as \u2018Desk Research\u2019): this means collecting and analysing information that is already available and has been collected by someone else e.g. reports, statistics, websites etc\u2026It is important that you carry out both types of research to help you decide if your business idea is viable. Market Research Activities You Can Do Examine existing products / services Look at other similar products / services on the market: Can you learn from them?What do they do well?What do they do badly?How is your product going to be better than everything else that is available?Examine your target audience Look at your target customers: What are their needs? A questionnaire is a good way of finding out what your customers want.You could also talk to someone who is an expert in this area. For example, if you are producing a piece of craft, how about talking to a successful craftsperson in your area? You might learn many valuable lessons.Carry out a product demonstration You could show your product to some of your target customers and ask them for feedback before you start selling it. Keep an eye on the market Even after you begin selling, keep an eye on what is selling well and what is not selling for you. Perhaps you should drop the products that are not selling and concentrate on the ones that are?Ask your existing customers if there is anything else that they would like to buy from you.Hope you liked it\u2026.

            "answer_text": "What Is Market Research?  *Market research is the process of determining the viability of a new service or product through research conducted directly with potential customers. * Market research allows a company to discover the target market and get opinions and other feedback from consumers about their interest in the product or service. This type of research can be conducted in house, by the company itself, or by a third-party company that specializes in market research. Market Research Understanding Market Research *The purpose of market research is to look at the market associated with a particular good or service to ascertain how the audience will receive it. *This can include information gathering for the purpose of market segmentation and product differentiation * which can be used to tailor advertising efforts or determine which features are seen as a priority to the consumer. *A business must engage in a variety of tasks to complete the market research process. It needs to gather information based on the market sector being examined. How Market Research Works *Market research consists of a combination of primary information, or what has been gathered by the company or by a person hired by the company, and secondary information, or what has been gathered by an outside source. *Primary information is the data that the company has collected directly or that has been collected by a person or business hired to conduct the research. * This type of information generally falls into two categories: exploratory and specific research. Example of Market Research *Many companies use market research to test out new products or to get information from consumers about what kinds of products or services they need and don't currently have. *For example, a company that was considering going into business might conduct market research to test the viability of its product or service. *If the market research confirms consumer interest, the business can proceed confidently with the business plan. * If not, the company should use the results of the market research to make adjustments to the product to bring it in line with customer desires. *Data collected from these interviews were compared to the circulation of the publication in order to see how effective those ads were. Market research and surveys were adapted from these early techniques. *Within the last 10 to 15 years, market research started to make a shift online. *While the platform may have changed, data collection is still mainly done in a survey-style form. *But instead of companies actively seeking participants by finding them on the street or by cold calling them on the phone, people can choose to sign up and take surveys and offer opinions when they have time. *This makes the process far less intrusive and less rushed since people can do so on their own time and by their own volition.

            "answer_text": "Here are 6 Example of Market Research1. Secondary Market Research \u2014 Secondary research is typically known as desk research and involves seeking out existing research and data. This may be government census information, market reports, whitepapers, journals, news stories and articles, Twitter comments, and more. In a nutshell, it means using the internet to find out information about your market and industry from trade bodies, existing research and official government organisations such as the Office of National Statistics. 2. Market Research Surveys\u2014 When most people think of market research, they tend to think of customer surveys. The most common market research method, surveys come in all shapes and sizes. Surveys can be conducted in all sorts of ways, including telephone surveys, hosting a survey on a website, using social media polls, asking questions face-to-face with customers, using SMS text messages, or simply filling in a survey card in a restaurant or when leaving a shop. Surveys can be self-administered, where the person being surveyed answers the questions alone \u2013 such as filling in an online survey using a computer at home \u2013 or they can be administered by a person who reads out the questions and records the responses, which are typically used in telephone surveys. 3. Focus group \u2014 Unlike surveys, focus groups are a form of market research where you ask open-ended questions to a small group of people. The idea is to record their responses, giving space for more detailed and in-depth answers that help you understand customer thinking and how they feel about an idea. Focus groups can be used following survey research. They can be used to present several versions of a product idea, for example, asking customers what they like or dislike about it, what they\u2019d change, and the reasons for their responses. 4. One to One interviews \u2014 One-to-one interviews are one of the oldest and most widely used forms of market research. They typically involve a structured conversation or questionnaire designed to find out what people think, need and want. Advantages of one-to-one interviews \u2013 One-to-one interviews generate rich data. The use of visual aids and the detection of social cues and body language allows the interviewer to gain a deeper insight to specific questions and answers, as well as deducing the validity of each response. Disadvantages of one-to-one interviews \u2013 They\u2019re expensive due to the cost of interviewer and the time required to capture data and bias can creep in on both sides. Also, the interviewee may not fully represent the breadth of opinions of the target market. 5. Observation \u2014 Watching how customers use your products or services is a quick way to spot potential problems, such as how difficult it is for customers to navigate your online store. Observation spans a huge range of applications \u2013 from browsing habits on a website to watching the flow of traffic into and out of a car park. Advantages of observation \u2013 While you always need permission and full consent from a subject, if you\u2019re able to watch them covertly subjects often behave more naturally and show their true actions, rather than their \u2018ideal selves\u2019 that they typically show to strangers. Disadvantages of observation \u2013 Observation is time-consuming and expensive. Researchers have little control over the situations and environments typically used in observational research, and sometimes the act of observing can bias results or influence the situation. Someone who knows they\u2019re being observed may act less naturally. 6. Testing \u2014- Testing focuses on learning about people experiences. Often used in later stages of product development , it\u2019s a chance for potential customer to test out your product service. It can be used to ensure a products is fit for market- such as being robust enough when handled\u2014 to getting feedback on how product works. Advantage of Testing \u2014 testing can result in a specific feedback that can help hone a product. By letting customer test a product, any rough edges can be refined before rolling it out on a larger scale. Testing also puts the product in a real world environment, which can throw up usability issues that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been spotted. Disadvantage of Testing \u2014 it can sometimes be expensive and time-consuming and some companies can often overlook this stage because it happens quite far into the development cycle. ",

            "answer_text": "This chart is a good representation of the overall goals of market research. Basically, you want to be able to come away knowing who you\u2019re marketing to, what they need in order to buy your product, and how you\u2019re going to convince them to buy it.  As you can probably tell from this, market research is a huge undertaking. For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019ll explain how I break up the process into different research types: General market research, which includes looking at the size of the industry/field/niche you want to target and taking notes on its current state. You\u2019ll want to know:How large is the market?Is the market growing, shrinking or staying the same?If it\u2019s growing or shrinking, by what percentage?What federal regulations is it governed by?How is affected by current events, societal values and economic issues ?Target audience research, which includes learning about the type of person you want to target. Sometimes this involves working directly with people in focus groups or through surveys. Other times it involves conducting secondary research online. You\u2019ll want to know:What is the age, gender, location and life status of my target customer? Life status could be anything from education level to marital status to family size.What are their hobbies, likes and dislikes?What are their struggles? What are their vices?What is their relationship with the product or category of product I\u2019m offering?Competitor research, which includes looking at the most popular and profitable brands in your market, along with any \u201crising stars.\u201d This is referred to as a competitive analysis. You\u2019ll want to know:Who is leading the market right now? By how much?Have there been any recent changes to the key players in this market? Has anyone dropped out or been added?How are my competitors allocating their budget? How much is spent on which media, and how often?What is their brand strategy? What is the tone of their messaging? How does it resonate their target audience?This is just a few of the many, many questions you could ask during market research. The breadth and depth of your research is completely up to the marketer \u2014 or the marketing team, director, CMO, etc. Whoever is in charge. Audience research is personally one of my favorite topics in marketing. It\u2019s the foundation of everything you do, and it requires a range of skillsets to do right (If you\u2019re interested in learning a bit more about audience research specifically, I recommend this article: What You Need to Know About Audience Market Data). Even after your preliminary research is done, you never really stop getting to know your audience. Customer Intelligence (CI) is the next step, and it\u2019s pretty similar to audience research except that you\u2019re using data from your actual customers, as opposed to the world at large. This graphic demonstrates what I mean:  I hope I answered your question! Feel free to follow up for clarification on any of the concepts or terms I mentioned. ",

They build longstanding partnerships with employers looking to hire local, qualified talent. The professional driver industry is growing steadily and rapidly in the USA, with 6% annual projected growth over the next five years. These companies are also facing challenges attracting and retaining qualified drivers, which makes them a potential fit for our client. The overall goal was to use this analysis as part of a broader effort to obtain further funding to support the company\u2019s growth. Business Challenge Summary With a leadership team preparing the company for expansion, our client partner looked to conduct a market sizing and opportunity analysis for the hiring market for professional drivers in the United States. They faced a lack of empirical knowledge and internal resources to conduct the analysis, so they turned to &Marketing for resources, intelligence and strategic tools to help make an informed decision to how to grow within the hiring market for drivers, which faced strict regulatory requirements, high turnover, and a myriad of new entrants. &Marketing\u2019s Approach Through a data-driven approach, &Marketing was able to provide an insightful analysis of the transportation sector in order to empower this client to better understand which pockets of the industry were growing, what types of companies made up the industry, examples of companies in each sub-sector, and the basic needs of each group of potential employees. The &Marketing team conducted internal client interviews, mined publicly available data sources, and searched through the subscription-based service Statista to gather data and create a revenue model. The goals were to showcase: The overall size of the market (number of drivers)How the market subdivided itself based on the need for driver certifications & qualifications, types of drivers, and other factorsThe distinct composition and unique needs of each segment of driversThis analysis also included customer lists for each segment, major trends surrounding them, and a revenue model to calculate potential client opportunity. &Marketing concluded this market research and analysis by delivering a recommended pilot program for a specific business unit, displaying the market potential and paving the way for the rest of the business units. Results The comprehensive data and segmentation &Marketing provided equipped the client partner with the research results and confidence they needed to present this market opportunity to their investors. In parallel, our client partner is in the process of rolling out a go-to-market strategy in the transportation industry uncovered through this analysis and is specifically approaching the companies most likely to benefit from their unique offer. Further, &Marketing assisted in improving their investor presentation so it told a clear story and was visually impactful.

            "answer_text": "So, market research is a diverse subject, and depending on which age you studied marketing in, your expectations might differ. There was a time when focus groups were the norm to conduct market research. Every company that could afford one was hosting a collection of their target customers to test their products and one of the interesting stories is of how Campbell soups came about becoming one of the biggest brands of canned foods. One of my absolute favorite heroes of market research is Howard Moskowitz - His stories and insights are absolutely fascinating.  Howard Moskowitz - I\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Think \u2013 Here\u2019s one of his most famous experiments. Sometime in the 1970s, Campbell soups hired him to discover the perfect flavor for their spaghetti sauce. Until then, they only had one flavor of spaghetti sauce. He developed more than 45 different types of sauce, and after the hundreds of tests with them, he was able to create three specific clusters of customer preferences. Those that like plain spaghetti sauceThose that like chunky spaghetti sauceThose that like spicy spaghetti sauceNotice #2 above. Until then, spaghetti sauce was only about flavor and nothing more. They were aiming to taste for garlic, level of sweetness, etc. As it turns out, they discovered that nearly 1/3rd of all Americans preferred their sauce with thick chunks.  (Image from Paleo Chunky Spaghetti Sauce) This led to nearly $600 million in sales over the next 10 years. Does that answer your question on why is market research important? Now, here\u2019s a little extra bit of contrarian viewpoint for you. Most companies that I speak with have a convoluted method of market research (that we help them simplify, of course :-) ). It would have been naive of you to think a plug wasn\u2019t coming\u2026 Anyways, I digress\u2026 Steve Jobs repeatedly drove home the point in his presentations, speeches, and any other way he could communicate. His disdain for focus groups is well known. According to Jobs, people don't know what they want until you show it to them. Another one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the twentieth century, Henry Ford famously said - If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said \u201ca faster horse\u201d So, what\u2019s the verdict then? Well, that\u2019s the subject for another post. We have a detailed research whitepaper on this subject in our archives. It covers how to create market research that simplifies your business instead of confusing your team. Hit me up if you\u2019d like a free copy mailed to you. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "These answers are all provided by college educated folks who work for large businesses. They are all correct BUT they have very little to do with the world of solopreneurs or micro-enterprises. These business models represent 95 out of every 100 businesses in the US and I believe that it\u2019s much the same outside the US. The reason why over 9 out of every 10 startup businesses don\u2019t make it past their first 18 months is because the people who start them have no idea how to do even basic market research. They get an idea, they talk with their friends and relatives, who all want to be supportive, but also have no idea of how to start a business. The fantastic idea sounds great but it\u2019s rarely checked out by the person starting the business. They rarely even sit down and talk with people who they want as customers to VALIDATE their assumptions. Do these possible customers actually want what we think they want? By the way there is a huge gap between what they WANT and what we think they NEED. Given the limited resources all small business are faced with don\u2019t try to move a market from perceived need to wanting to purchase. The cost is prohibitive.What are they doing or buying to solve this problem currently?Who are they buying from?How much are they willing to pay?How often will they purchase this product or service?How many potential customers are in your market area? Are their enough for you to make a living selling these proposed products or services?Without the people (skill specialists) or the money that \u201corganizational\u201d approaches require trying to do any kind of marketing or initial research are not just frustrating but can often take you financially right off the cliff. Some of the best books I\u2019ve read focus on the use of Guerrilla Techniques. Jay Conrad Levinson and his associates wrote a series of books on various topics including market research. I highly recommend reading them for ideas, techniques and a micro-enterprise perspective. Good Luck & Godspeed! ",

You can collect data from social media, your website (or a platform that hosts your website), focus groups, online surveys, public data that\u2019s free to access, and more! In order to properly utilize your market research, it has to be reliable. Most businesses ideally want to learn simple things like customers\u2019 ages, sex, occupation, location, etc. And other brands want deeper insights that show things like what a person values, what their beliefs are, or the actions that they make on a website. There are 4 main types of market segmentation that businesses use: Demographic Segmentation takes into account things like age, sex, income, occupation, education, etc.Geographic Segmentation focuses on location, urbanicity, climate, culture & language.Psychographic Segmentation is more intricate, taking a deeper look at the values, opinions, lifestyles, attitudes, likes & dislikes, etc. of consumers.Behavioral Segmentation solely focuses on the actions of consumers, which are multiple. Usually referring to digital behavior like on a website, so bounce rate, new vs. returning users, whether or not a user purchased a product or abandoned their cart, which parts of your website they interacted with, etc.Each of these market segmentation types can be used to learn different things and to help businesses gain market research and target specific markets.

            "answer_text": "Let me take the question a little furthur by comparing market research & analytics. How to differentiate between the market research and analytics? McKinsey & Co. suggests that companies can be a part of the research revolution by paying attention to four key areas: 1) Leverage the Internet to rapidly obtain details about consumers; 2) Keep the limitations of focus groups in mind; 3) Learn how people shop; and 4) Link consumer attitudinal and behavioral data. Based on the above, certain questions related to differentiation between market research from market analytics arise. How is the value derived from big data?How is data integrated to gain actionable insights?How to link consumer attitudinal and behavioral data?How is the immensely vast internet leveraged for real-time data and analysis?Market research with its traditional methodologies has limitations and is unable to answer the challenges posed by the rapidly burgeoning data and the need to integrate customer data from various data sources and to analyze it in real time. Traditional Market Research Approach Traditional Market Research primarily consists of getting an overall feel of the customers by addressing strategic questions broadly raised by the management. The research, in that sense, is largely driven by what you already know. Market research broadly answers questions related to business aspects like product awareness, availability, packaging, placement, pricing, competition within the market, general sentiment of the customers within the target audience, brand loyalty, brand positioning, customer satisfaction aggregate and segment awareness, message effectiveness, and advertising recall among others. Thus, market research helps in painting a broad, holistic picture of the customers and the marketplace. This is done by studying a sample from the universe. This study is time bound, and analysis done using statistical packages like SPSS and SAS. The findings of the study are presented to the management with or without strategic recommendations based on objectives. Technology-Driven Market Analytics The lives of people are increasingly being shifted to the virtual world. Online Media reveals anything and everything that a company needs to know about its consumers and the market. People discuss, comment, critique and post about products, services and provide details based on their general experience. They also rely more on the publicly shared opinion than a company\u2019s advertised claims. This makes online media the most powerful platform for businesses to leverage their immense potential. However, to tap into the vast resource base, the traditional research techniques prove to be incompetent. This is exactly where the strength of analytics comes into the picture. Companies need advanced market analytics capable of transcending the confines of primary marketing research. ",

            "answer_text": "By \u201ctypes of research\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily mean how you\u2019re collecting data. Instead I mean the procedures and methodology used to analyze the data collected. These procedures include market segmentation, product testing, advertising testing, key driver analysis for satisfaction and loyalty, usability testing, awareness and usage research, and pricing research (using techniques such as conjoint analysis), among others. Market Segmentation When conducting market segmentation studies we\u2019re generally asking survey questions aimed at capturing needs, values, attitudes, behaviors and demographics. A B2B company might also want to investigate firmographic data such as company size, revenues, and product category that are relevant to the industry in question. Marketing can\u2019t effectively speak to every type of person or business at the same time, so one of the main goals of market segmentation is to allow for more efficient and effective marketing tactics. Without market segmentation companies are shooting in the dark and wasting valuable bullets. They may hit a customer by accident, but they would miss a lot of others. Product Testing A detailed understanding of how your product meets (or doesn\u2019t meet) your customer\u2019s needs is crucial both to product development and marketing, so these types of market research studies need to be conducted throughout a product\u2019s life. Ultimately you should be able to make informed \u201cgo\u201d or \u201cnot go\u201d decisions about new features and products before launch, and thus save capital, time and effort. Successful product testing should: Give insight into product/service viability by investigating competing and substitute alternatives along side customers\u2019 willingness to embrace new products/services.Determine competitive advantage as well as possible threats from similar products/services.Identify the products with the highest revenue potential.Clarify what improvements should be prioritized before a product launch (or re-launch).Pinpoint which product features (both existing and potential) are most important to your target audience.Help produce marketing messages to change or enhance existing perceptions about your products/services.Advertising Testing Like product testing, tests of your advertising campaigns can save you valuable time and resources. By taking potential campaigns directly to your audience and gauging their response you can focus on creating truly impactful advertising. Satisfaction and Loyalty Analysis Satisfied customers aren\u2019t necessarily loyal customers, but consistently measuring customer satisfaction is a great way to increase customer retention. This type of research is aimed at identifying key drivers of satisfaction and measuring the likelihood of customers to continue using a company\u2019s products and services. The goals of these kinds of studies are: Determine what factors influence loyalty, advocacy, and repeat purchases, including product/service attributes, company operation, customer service, price, etc.Carefully monitor overall satisfaction, recommendation likelihood, and defection likelihood over time.Provide early warnings about emerging gaps in product/service performance, customer service, and processes that might lead to customer defection.Help identify areas of the product or service that need improvement to meet changing needs.Guide the creation and/or ongoing development of customer loyalty and retention programs.Signal when organizational changes need to be made to improve operations and customer retention.Brand Awareness and Reach By conducting regular, well-designed brand awareness surveys you can keep tabs on how effective your marketing campaigns really are. When done right, a brand awareness survey can help you measure: Brand Recall: Can a customer spontaneously recall your brand, or do they think first of a competitor?Brand Recognition: When presented with a list of brands, does your audience recognize yours as a reputable option?Brand Identity: Brand identity is what you as a marketing team create. It\u2019s important to determine whether these efforts are being successful.Brand Image: While brand identity is created by the brand itself, a brand\u2019s image is based in the customer\u2019s perception alone. Tracking disparities in these two can reveal gaps in your marketing efforts.Brand Trust: In an era of data breaches, keeping tabs on your levels of brand trust is key. If your brand doesn\u2019t appear trustworthy, you will have difficulty retaining customers.Brand Loyalty: Loyal customers can become evangelists, but you need to consistently track loyalty levels to determine how often this transformation is happening.Customer Profile: Changes in your core customer base may signal the need for a pivot, either in the product or your marketing messages (or both).For more on starting your own brand awareness initiative, see our guide on these critical marketing surveys. Pricing Research Surveys that ask customers to choose between different products with unique features and price points, typically done via conjoint analysis, can help you identify what features are most valuable to your audience and what they\u2019d be willing to pay for them. Combined with some basic research on your competitors\u2019 pricing, these insights can give you a distinct advantage in pricing your products and services. Knowing Which Type of Research to Use When to use each of these different types of market research data collection methods and types of research depends on the business issues we are dealing with in one or more of four key areas: Awareness: let the market know that the product or service existsTargeting: reach the target segments with the highest profit potentialAcquisition: optimize the marketing message, offer, and price that will close the saleRetention: generate repeat purchases from current customersThe chart below, which we call the Relevant Wheel, shows when it is most appropriate and relevant to conduct different types of research.  Our clients at Relevant Insights often use this chart as a reference to determine when a particular type of research is needed. Once this is defined, we then discuss the most appropriate qualitative or quantitative data collection methods. Data Collection and Analysis Methods Here we need to make a distinction between data collection methods and market research types based on analytical approach, which are often confused. Data collection methods differ based on whether we want to conduct quantitative or qualitative research. Qualitative research, which is exploratory in nature, usually uses data collection methods such as focus groups, triads, dyads, in-depth interviews, uninterrupted observation, bulletin boards, and ethnographic participation/observation. Quantitative research, which looks to quantify a problem, collects data through surveys in different modalities (online, phone, paper), audits, points of purchase (purchase transactions), and click-streams. Choose the Market Research Type that Meets Your Needs Next time you wonder what type of market research to conduct, I invite you to ask yourself where the particular problem at hand belongs: Awareness, Targeting, Acquisition or Retention. Then take a look at the Relevance Wheel to find the approach that will help you answer your specific questions. If you choose your method carefully market research can give you a big advantage over your competition. Original source:Types of Market Research and Their Differences ",

You may anticipate that your customers will behave a certain way, when in fact they go in a completely different direction. It's essential to be prepared for this ahead of time and use the information you collect from research to plan your marketing strategy. Elliot Simmonds explains this concept below: \" A lot of people use sponsored posts and other paid advertising, and it seems that many are happy to simply pay the money and watch the views and clicks roll in - even if some of those clicks are from individuals tangential to the product or service they're promoting. Most platforms allow you to specifically target your sponsored posts and ads, and my tip is to do so following a period (even if it's only a short period) of actual research. Your gut instinct might tell you a lot about who your clients are, but you should also take the time to find out for yourself - which profiles of consumer spend the most? Who are the ones who return time and again? Where are more of your clients based?\" -Elliot Simmonds, Lead Consultant, Rippleout Marketing  ",

The weakness of past processes is we must invest a long time to get it. But, the strength of the research is we could get in a faster way. However, in market research, I think the main assumption is the customer (many times) do not know what they actually need. Here comes the digital era. Which everything and every process did by customers, could be measured. Not only in a qualitative way but will be very insightful in quantitatively. Furthermore, those digital data could be described in more insightful ways (such as through the usage of diagram or graphics). Even more, could be monitored in specific time frequently (for example a specific hour in a day, a specific day in a month, etc). So, even we only do marketing via social media, such as Instagram, facebook as in freeway, or furthermore in a paid way, via IG ads or FB ads, then we would obtain a small amount of data that we could generate insight further from them.
