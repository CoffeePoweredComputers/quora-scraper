            "answer_text": "Dear concerned, Alchemy is a scientific process through which lower metals like copper, iron, brass etc can be converted into gold. In India this process has existed since time immemorial and it was earlier called \u2018Lohbhed\u2019 and later it was called \u2018Hemvati Vidya\u2019 or \u2018Hem Vidya\u2019. In earlier times this technique also travelled from India to Egypt and from there this word \u2018alchemy\u2019 came into existence. In Indian history alchemy finds mentions since Satyug and this trend continues until early twentieth century. In Satyug, it was taught by Rishi Agyast. In Dwapar Yug, Krishn gifts gold equivalent to the weight of ten men to his sister Subhadra when she comes to Indraprastha after marrying Arjun made through alchemy, it is mentioned in Mahabharat. In Kautilaya\u2019s Arthshastra, Chanakya, the writer and the Guru to Chandragupt Maurya says that the most important qualification of the royal treasurer should be the one who knows how to make gold artificially. It was Chanakya himself who made 20 million coins of gold through alchemy which he used to raise an army for Chandragupt in 500 bc. This technique was prevalent in India till the time Buddhism came into being. Buddhist kings were the first ones who banned alchemy for public. The punishment given to anyone found performing it was death. They used it only for themselves but later on even that practice was abolished. However certain people kept on practicing it clandestinely and the knowledge was transferred through generations. Alchemy finds references throughout our history until 75 years back. Now to understand how it works we first need to understand what are metals and what is their origin? As per Indian history the metals came into existence when Agni, the lord of fire asked the river Ganga to have sex with him. Ganga agreed but when Agni entered into Ganga, his semen started flowing into her through every part of his body. His semen had so much energy that Ganga couldn't take it and asked him that what should she do as she can not handle it anymore. Agni asked Ganga to flow it over the land, Ganga did so. From different parts of Agni\u2019s semen different metals came into existence. Now because the source is the same, the metals can be converted into each other. Gold was formed from the best part of Agni\u2019s semen hence in order to convert other lower metals in gold one needed an even higher energy substance. The only substance which had more energy was mercury because mercury is Shiv\u2019s semen. This is why in alchemy mercury is used to convert other metals in gold. Does alchemy exists today? Yes, it does. But can you get your hands on it? Impossible and there are reasons for it. First and foremost is, it was never available to commoners. All the teachers of this particular crafts were Rishis, Siddhs, Naaths and Aghoris only. It is alive in these traditions only. And none of them ever uses it for commercial purposes or public demonstrations. Later many writers have written books over this craft and there are hundreds of these books available. Still no one has been able to make gold using techniques described in them. The reason for this is, it is all a part of tantra and it is prohibited to reveal tantra to public. So the writer even if he knew something has deliberately concealed some vital information about the process without which it is useless. Secondly, even if you spend decades in the company of aghoris and get to know the technique, still it is almost impossible today to get all the things needed for it. See, it is an ancient art and it requires some unusual ingredients. Let me give you one example. You need a woman who should be extremely beautiful, who should be having curly hair, whose thighs should be wide, whose breast should be very big, who should have a flawless skin and who should be having her mensural cycles only during waning moon or Krishnpaksh only. Now you may keep on finding such a girl for your life but I don't think you\u2019ll succeed in this. Another method is converting a beautiful girl into such a girl but that is even more tedious. It is only one example, all the other requirements are also almost impossible to find for a commoner. Since the persecution started for anyone found practising this technique, teachers asked their students to never reveal it. Some however did reveal and they paid for it. One guy performed it for Madan Mohan Malviya twice in 1940\u2019s but soon he was poisoned and killed by someone who wanted to know it from him. Science as we know it today is only a tiny drop of water in the vast ocean of knowledge that was available to us in the past. Some of the readers may not agree with me but then it is not their fault as they have never been taught these things. Let me quote you another example with verifiable evidence about how advanced our science was in those days. We all know that when we heat metals at high temperatures they melt and take form of liquid. But when the temperature goes down, these metals again solidify. Now our ancestors knew of a technique through which they used to liquify precious metals, even gems life topaz, ruby etc and these metals used to retain their liquid form even after cooling down. Our ancestors used these liquified metals and gems to write certain books. five six of such books are still available at Khuda Bakhsh library at Patna, India. You can go yourself and check. I can give you many other such examples but may be some other time. In Indian tradition everything we did had a spiritual connect in the past. Alchemy was primarily used for spiritual enhancement. Even the process of learning alchemy is highly spiritual. With time we started giving more importance to physical pleasures and it all got lost. Interesting question it was, will write more about our history, ancient science and traditions whenever time permits. Regards Aghor Bhadra ",

            "answer_text": "Oooo, a question that can go multiple ways, I like it! Alchemy is a reference to an Arabic Phrase, Al-Khem, which translates to \u2018From the Black Land.\u2019 Scary right? \u2018Black Land' is actually a nickname for Egypt. This is because the land around the Nile tends to get dark when it floods. Oh, you're still here? Ahhhh then perhaps you are looking for a deeper answer, yes? If you are thinking \u201cyes\u201d then you are my kind of person. The answer can be found in the previous answer. \u201cAlchemy is a forerunner to Chemistry\u201d is\u2026 Not the answer. This is a general falsehood that had been drilled into our minds through history. Essentially, the concept of Alchemy being pre-chemistry is more propaganda from old scientists. When Science was gaining ground, Alchemy was its biggest competition. Some of the highest regarded scientists, including Issac Newton, were devout alchemists. Saying Alchemy was a worthless pseudoscience was the best bet in pushing it out of the way. Note: I am not discrediting science at all. It is an amazing thing that we owe a lot of advances to. Neither am I saying Alchemy is better. In the end, Alchemy and Science have little in common an cannot be compared. Okay\u2026. What about \u201cThe Alchemist?\u201d This is a great read, and does hint at some points in Alchemical History, but still does not provide the answer you are looking for. Like I previously stated, the answer can be found in the previous answer. Take a moment to scan it closely. Any ideas? Anything at all? Hint: It's one word. Give up? Have an idea? Here you go: Fascinated Fascinated means Fascination. Fascination means Wonder. Wonder leads to Curiosity. Curiosity leads to Learning. And Learning is the path to Alchemy. Alchemy is truly a lost art. The lost art of the Mind. And not simply filling your mind with information, but conforming your mind to be \u2018you'. Creating Memory Palaces, finding your \u201cself,\u201d meditation, practicing the seven processes, understanding the Great Work. It all starts with your mind, what you think, and what you choose to learn. And in the end, the meaning of Alchemy is \u2018you.\u2019 ",
