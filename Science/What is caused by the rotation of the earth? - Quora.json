            "answer_text": "The Earth rotates counterclockwise; this is why the Sun \u201crises\" in the East and \u201csets\" in the West. It is not the Sun\u2019s movement that causes days, but rather the Earth turning around in front of the Sun. Earth's graceful 24-hour rotation rate is one of the traits that make our planet so friendly to life, allowing most parts of Earth to stay a nice, comfortable temperature as they are bathed in sunlight during the day and darkness at night. The Earth rotates from the west towards east. This rotation causes both the wind and ocean currents to move from east to west. Thus, the wind movement and ocean current in the northern hemisphere goes clockwise and counter clockwise in the southern hemisphere. If Earth did not rotate on its axis, winds would blow from the north toward the south and from the south toward the north. Because Earth rotates on its axis from west towards the east, air near the surface from the tropics is moved toward a westerly direction (toward the right as it is often called) in the northern hemisphere. The Coriolis Effect is caused by a combination of the inertia of moving air and the rotation of the Earth. The Coriolis Effect determines/predicts the direction of the global atmospheric circulation currents like the westerlies, the polar winds or trade winds The Coriolis Effect also affects the directions of the ocean currents. Both of these have tremendous effects on climate. Coriolis Effect below:  To clearly see what is caused by the rotation of the Earth is to imagine if the Earth was not rotating at all. This is what would happen if the Earth stopped spinning on its axis to give you the idea on the friendly causes the spinning of the Earth gives us: First of all you can probably guess that it would not result in anything good, in fact, it would be disastrous. All of the land masses would be worn away of anything not attached to bedrock. This means rocks, topsoil, trees, and buildings, people and so on, would be swept away into the atmosphere. Half of the planet would almost continuously face the heat of the Sun, while half would face the cold of space. The weather would become extremely predictable, as it would be controlled only by the sun. The Earth\u2019s tilt is defined by how the planet is rotating compared to the Sun. This axis of rotation defines the Earth\u2019s seasons. But without any rotation, there would no longer be seasons.  ",

            "answer_text": "Almost five billion years ago, our solar system had its beginnings as a vast cloud of dust and gas. The cloud began to collapse, flattening into a giant disk that rotated faster and faster, just as an ice skater spins faster as she brings her arms in. The Sun formed at the center, and the swirling gas and dust in the rest of the spinning disk clumped together to produce the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The reason so many objects orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane (called the ecliptic) and in the same direction is that they all formed from this same disk. While the planets were forming, there was not much peace in our solar system. Clumps of matter of all sizes often collided, and either stuck together or side-swiped each other, knocking off pieces and sending each other spinning. Sometimes the gravity of big objects would capture smaller ones in orbit. This could be one way the planets acquired their moons.  Scientists think that a large object, perhaps the size of Mars, impacted our young planet, knocking out a chunk of material that eventually became our Moon. This collision set Earth spinning at a faster rate. Scientists estimate that a day in the life of early Earth was only about 6 hours long. The Moon formed much closer to Earth than it is today. As Earth rotates, the Moon's gravity causes the oceans to seem to rise and fall. (The Sun also does this, but not as much.) There is a little bit of friction between the tides and the turning Earth, causing the rotation to slow down just a little. As Earth slows, it lets the Moon creep away.  We can use extremely accurate atomic clocks to measure exactly how much the rotation is slowing down. One hundred years from now, a day will be about 2 milliseconds longer than today. Two milliseconds is 1/500th of a second, or how long it takes a car going 55 mph to travel only 2 inches--in other words, much less than the blink of an eye. So, if you live to be 100, you can't complain that the days are getting shorter! At this rate, though, you don't have to worry about the days getting enough longer to change things very much ",
