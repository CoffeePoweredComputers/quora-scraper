Now each of us is ready to undertake the study to know the unknown and it is one's mental world here adoption of utter reality is a scale and in an essence we may say that here adoption of reality is dependent of omission of what is un-real and yes a mentor will join you as &when you and each of us get really real, till we are well equipped with our Conscience as fully empowered by us only to mentor us\u2026 So definitely in light of above we are lacking behind to revamp our set disciplines of socialogy b'coz presently we are nor following our families' set disciplines nor societies' as we have scattered and are not being controlled to flock together socially, so evidently a huge work of reformation of the same is needed at war front\u2026 and hence I have preferred to make this preface only in stead of putting a list for !

            "answer_text": "First there is the structuralist perspective that handles the society as a whole. Functionalism and conflict theories can be counted to that perspective.

The sociology of Max Weber, symbolic interactionism and phenomenology are counted to that perspective. Ethnomethodology is also related to phenomenology. Besides there are also gender-based theories.
