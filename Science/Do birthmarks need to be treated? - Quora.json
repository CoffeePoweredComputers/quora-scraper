            "answer_text": "No, I had a birthmark on my right cheek of my face when a child. Of course I got teased continually in school about it so my parents brought me to a doctor. This was decades ago, but I remember the doctor saying it would hurt a lot afterwards, may come back, or leave a scar. Being a young kid ( it\u2019s funny how some things people remember in their youth) it scared the hell out of me , so I never had it done. I don\u2019t remember when, but several years later it just faded away, and then I was happy . ",
