            "answer_text": "I once stumbled on this website, an old one back during the young age of Internet; 2003. It was titled \u201cWorld of Dubia\" and it's about how would the world look like in the next 1000 years had all of the ice had melted and the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.  This is the physical image of what the Earth would look like in the next 1000 years. You can see how different it looks compare to what our current world look like. For example: the Persian Gulf expands, there are seas in the middle of Siberia, Great Britain doesn't look great anymore.  This is an another image from the other side of the planet. As you can see, almost all the ice caps on Antarctica gone, melted into water which would rise up the sea level to a historical 100 metres. Amazon is now a sea, Buenos Aires doesn't exist anymore, so does the whole Uruguay. You can read more at DUBIA, A GREENHOUSE EARTH and you can see how different our world would look like in the next future. ",

First \u201cicebergs\u201d are floating ice If they melt the effect on the sea level will be - drum-roll - NOTHING - not a sausage The problem is that the floating ice sheets are damning the ice that is on land and stopping it from flowing into the sea So if the ice at sea melts it makes no direct difference BUT it allows the ice on land to flow into the sea - and THAT is what will raise the sea level If all of the ice in Antarctica melts the sea level will rise by about 200 ft What the World Would Look Like if All the Ice Melted ",
