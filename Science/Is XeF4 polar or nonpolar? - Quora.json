            "answer_text": "Well, while the individual [math]Xe-F[/math] bonds ARE clearly polar\u2026given the difference in electronegativity of fluorine compared to that of xenon, BUT molecular polarity is the VECTOR SUM of the individual bond dipoles. And around the xenon atom, there are 8 native electrons, PLUS 4 electrons from the fluorine atoms\u2026and thus AROUND xenon there are 12 electrons, of which FOUR are non-bonding, and are localized in two non-bonding pairs. And thus we got [math]MX_{4}E_{2}[/math]. Electronic geometry is octahedral, a simple consequence of VESPER, BUT MOLECULAR GEOMETRY is SQUARE PLANAR, i.e. [math]\u2220F-Xe-F=90\u00b0[/math], i.e. [math]D_{4h}[/math] symmetry\u2026 And since the [math]Xe-F[/math] bond dipoles are all mutually in opposition, and their vector sum leads to a ZERO resultant; as also occurs for the xenon lone pairs of electrons. And so [math]XeF_{4}[/math] is NON-POLAR. Capisce? ",

            "answer_text": "Step 1: Draw the Lewis Dot Structure  Step 2: Determine the Molecular Geometry Since there are 4 bonds to the central atom and 2 lone pairs, the geometry is square planar.  Step 3: Is there a plane of symmetry? If yes, than polar. If no, then non-polar. For XeF4 , there is a plane of symmetry so it is non-polar.
