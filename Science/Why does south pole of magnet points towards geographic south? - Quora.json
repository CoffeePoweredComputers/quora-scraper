            "answer_text": " The reason is that at the geographic south, we have earth\u2019s magnetic north. All magnets have a north-seeking pole (abbreviated to just north pole or N). It is the end that points north. This is often coloured red on a magnet or compass. The opposite poles of two magnets attract. Therefore, when the red end of a magnet or compass is pointing north, it is because it is being attracted in that direction by the south end of another magnet (often coloured blue) \u2013 this is the imaginary magnet inside the Earth. So, when we think of the Earth as a big magnet, it is the blue south pole of the magnet that is underneath the North Pole of the Earth (note the use of capitals for the place and lowercase letters for the magnetisation). So you have heard about magnetic compass. What would be its working priciple: A magnetic compass does not point to the geographic north pole. A magnetic compass points to the earth's magnetic poles, which are not the same as earth's geographic poles. Furthermore, the magnetic pole near earth's geographic north pole is actually the south magnetic pole. When it comes to magnets, opposites attract. This fact means that the north end of a magnet in a compass is attracted to the south magnetic pole, which lies close to the geographic north pole. Magnetic field lines outside of a permanent magnet always run from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole. Therefore, the magnetic field lines of the earth run from the southern geographic hemisphere towards the northern geographic hemisphere. The geographic north and south poles indicate the points where the earth's rotation axis intercepts earth's surface. Consider holding a tennis ball between your thumb and forefinger and pushing on the side to make it spin. The points where your thumb and finger make contact are the geographic north and south poles of the tennis ball's spin. A person standing on the equator is moving the fastest due to earth's rotation, while a person standing on a geographic pole does not move at all from earth's rotation. Earth's magnetic poles designate the central location of the region where the magnetic fields lines start and finish. Earth's geographic and magnetic poles are not exactly aligned because they arise from different mechanisms. Earth's magnetic field is caused by circulating currents of liquid iron in the outer core. Furthermore, earth's magnetic poles are constantly changing location relative to earth's geographic poles. Currently, the magnetic south pole lies about ten degrees distant from the geographic north pole, and sits in the Arctic Ocean north of Alaska. The north end on a compass therefore currently points roughly towards Alaska and not exactly towards geographic north. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the magnetic south pole is actually a North pole magnetically speaking and the magnetic North pole is actually a south magnetic pole. Magnets attract to the opposite pole So therefore the North magnetic end of a compass needle will be attracted towards the North magnetic pole (which as stated is south polarity) and g the South end of the compass needle will be attracted to the South magnetic pole (which as stated is of a North polarity)The magnetic poles are not located at the geographic poles and hence the magnetic compass does not indicate true compass directions Instead it indicate magnetic compass direction. This is why when you consult a marine chart it has a magnetic Compass rose within the True compass Rose. The difference between the two is called Variation. Then of course every vessel has it\u2019s own magnetic influences that effect the ships compass. this difference is refereed to as deviation. The mariner must apply the variation and the deviation to get his true compass bearing. Then of course the ship is afloat on the Sea and the sea will have currents that cause the ship to move in a direction not always in the way the ship is pointed this is called the Set. But just in case you had that all worked out it\u2019s probably blowing lightly or strongly and this is having an effect on the Course made good as well this is called the \u201cDrift\u201d So the navigator has to apply all these factors to come out to the course to tell the helmsmen to steer so that he will arrive where he want to go That is the Course Steered. But then you never get it 100 % so he continually takes fixes which determine his position and then he can reverse engineer is path to see the Course Made Good or CMG. from this he can apply a further correction to correct for his error and to keep him on the desired course. Nowadays he just looks at his plotter sees exactly where he is and if his CMG is overlaying the desired course he had laid out on it. It\u2019s all to easy. I\u2019m afraid that we have all become very dependent on these wonderful devices. We are now \u201ca 5 cent fuse away from instant confusion\u201d. ",
