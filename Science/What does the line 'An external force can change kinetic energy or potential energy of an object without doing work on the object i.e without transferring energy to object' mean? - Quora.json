            "answer_text": "Simple, you hold a weight of say 1 kg at 1m above the ground.Now this weight has potential energy which will change to kinetic energy when you release it. Gravity will apply an external force on it and it will speed up.It will gain speed and thus the kinetic energy will rise.The external force changed the potential to kinetic energy without any change to the object. Gravity which is a force has not done any work. You can change the potential energy by lifting the weight to 2 meter.But the energy state of the object itself has not changed. It has none as it is dead weight. Only the combination of weight and height has changed thus the potential energy. ",
