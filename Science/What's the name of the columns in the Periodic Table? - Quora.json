            "answer_text": "Here are some of the names for the various groupe (columns) 1st (Li, Na,K\u2026) : alkali metals 2nd (Be, Mg, Ca\u2026): alkaline earth metals 3rd to 10th : transition metals. Usually individual groups bear the name of the lightest metal (eg Vanadium group or Cobalt group), except for: 11th (Cu, Ag, Au): coinage metals 13th (B, Al\u2026): icosagens 14th (C, Si, Ge\u2026): crystallogens 15th (N, P, As\u2026): pnictogens 16th (O,S,Se): chalcogens 17th (F, Cl, Br\u2026): halogens 18th (He,Ne,Ar\u2026 ): noble gases Note that the transition metals Pd,Pt, Rh, Ir are sometimes called \u201cPlatinum group\u201d, but it's not a\u201dReal\" group (ie not a single column). Note that the lines usually situated below are called Lanthanides and Actinides (the elements on those lines tend to behave similarly to each other, for example the most common oxidation state of all Lanthanides is +III). Lanthanides + scandium and yttrium are collectively called Rare Earths, though originally not because of their scarcity: although they are quite rare, they are not necessarily less abundant in the Earths crust than other metals (for example Cerium is about as common as Copper). The name comes from the fact that they are almost never encountered alone in minerals (for Iron, for example, you will find homogeneous iron oxides or sulfides, for rare earths, the minerals (oxides, sulfides\u2026) almost always include several elements together). Bonus fact (because why not?) the names Ytterbium, Erbium, Terbium and Yttrium all come from the name of the swedish village (Ytterby) where a mineral from which they were first extracted was discovered. The mineral is called\u2026. Gadolinite (because it also contains a lot of Gadolinium: see what I meant about them being all mixed in minerals?). Now you know a lot of useless facts, and, like an former Math teacher of mine used to say, \u201cvous allez pouvoir briller lors des soir\u00e9es mondaines !\u201d (Roughly translated :\u201dyou'll be able to shine at upper-class dinners\u201d ;-) Edit : corrected the transition metals, they only go as far as the 10th, not the 12th column as initially written. (Thanks Thomas Wright for catching that mistake!) ",

            "answer_text": "The columns are called groups or families. Mendeleev made these groups because they have similar chemical formulas (as he arranged the elements according to increasing atomic mass). For example, the first group or family is called the alkali metals. Lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium cesium, and francium make compounds with oxygen with two metal atoms per oxygen. (e.g. There's two lithium atoms per oxygen atom in lithium oxide.) This happens because the alkali metals have one valence electron. Now we know they make compounds of similar formula because the elements in a family have the same number of electrons in their outer energy sub levels. We say the elements in the same group or family have the same valence electron configurations (which differ only by the principle energy levels). ",
