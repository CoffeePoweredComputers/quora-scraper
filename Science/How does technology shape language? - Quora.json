The evolution of (semantical) language with the help of technology (thesaurus, etc.) is very high. Particularly in the past 50 - 60 years, the politically-correct expressions. Handicapped is called as alternatively-abled (I don\u2019t understand why the term handicapped is derogatory by itself) The words - progressive, paradigm, innovative, development, inclusive, betterment, constructive, strategic, tactical, integration, sustainable, supportive, consensus, collective, etc. etc. - all these are beautiful, semantically loaded, subjectively meaningful words\u2026 but in reality they mean nothing. This is reason why nowadays the pragmatics or context is more important than anything else in communication, in which language is also a part !. 1). The corporate /consultant English is one such animal. Anyone can make out such language in the Annual reports and CSR (Corporate social responsibility) brochures, documents etc. Only the language is good but in reality those semantically beautiful phrases and sentences actually don\u2019t mean anything. 2). Similarly the advertisement industry uses semantically well shaped language with the help of technology, but in reality it is just promotional material and technique. 3). Political speeches - should I say more\u2026 4). Main stream media news coverage and News documentaries ",

            "answer_text": "Mankind is a technological society - technology has always affected language and does even more so today. Our writing systems were directly designed to accommodate materials and tools we used to write. Written languages would not exist without technology, even if as fundamental as stone tablets. The history of language is also a history of technology. Technology also played a fundamental role in the spread and standardization of languages. With the spread of literacy it allowed creating standard grammar and standard dialects on a broad scale. Technology are not just computers - in particular, the invention of technology of printed books was a breakthrough. That\u2019s why in Europe in the last 200 years there seems to be minimal changes in the languages, whereas we can barely understand texts from 500 years ago, and 1000 years was plenty enough for evolving completely new (spoken) languages. With the advent of technologies capable of recording and transmitting sound in the 20th century this standardization effect transcended the written form and now equally applied to spoken languages and dialects. Before communication technologies, languages were spectrums - every next village spoke the language slightly differently until at some point it wasn\u2019t even intelligible from where you started. Today, we at best we have local dialects, but they converge and evolve with a standardized reference, the \u201cofficial language\u201d, as disseminated by technologies like TV, print, radio and Internet. The end result is an ongoing reduction of number of dialects (and even whole languages) due to language/dialect attrition directly enabled by technology. ",
