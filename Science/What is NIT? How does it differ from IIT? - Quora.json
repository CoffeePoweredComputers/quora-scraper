            "answer_text": "NIT: National Institutes of Technology IIT: Indian Institutes of Technology Both the Institutes are well-known for their outstanding standards of studies. There is a number of aspects which may be considered while showing the difference between IIT and NIT: In India, there are 23 IITs & 31 NITs which means NITs are spread in more cities than IITs. Less number of IITs offer fewer opportunities to the aspirants so they might prefer NITs instead.If we talk about Engineering Admissions, then students give IIT JEE Mains & JEE Advanced Exam. The candidates who qualify JEE Mains will be eligible for NITs but not for IITs. To become eligible for taking admission into IITs, they must also qualify JEE Advanced. If seeking the admissions in IITs for Post-Graduation Courses such as M.Sc. then the candidates must go through the IIT JAM Exam. The candidates who don\u2019t get admission in IITs through JAM Counselling must apply for CCMN counselling to reserve their seats in NITs.It is obvious to say that the educational standards of IITs are far better than NITs as they cover a course from scratch to the end.The infrastructures of IITs are wider & equipped with latest technologies. Their outstanding Classrooms & Practical Labs are enough to show how technically advanced all these IITs are!The Competition in IITs for Extra Curriculars is merely comparable to NITs. IITs & NITs both conduct the Hostel Competitions every year under the categories of Sports & Many Other Extra Curriculars!Cultural Fests are also held at large scale in these Institutes.It is quite assumable that for placements, IITs have better opportunities and salary packages in comparison to NITs.That's pretty much of it.

            "answer_text": "Nit stands National institute of technology.& IIT stands for Indian institute of technology. In my view some of nit's have no difference any any respect .if we are talking about the top nit's college in India in every aspect .like 1.placement. 2. Quality of education and exposure. 3. International relations . 4. life style . 5. faculty . 6. mind sets of students . 7.and PhD and higer degree and qualifications . Because , present nit's college are also good in every aspect like plcements statistics and start ups and every thing . 1.Placement statistics of year 16 . IIIT Hyderabad:-\u20b916,00,000 IIIT Bangalore:-\u20b914,70,000 . IIIT Allahabad:-\u20b913,00,000 Look at the static of plcements of IIIT'S in India average placement is much much better than the placement of IITs in India . Now plcements statistics of IITs :- 1.iit Kanpur:-\u20b913,00,000. 2.iit Gauhati :-\u20b913,00,000. 3. iit Kharagpur :- \u20b912,00,000. 4. IIT Bombay:-\u20b910,20,000. 5.iit Delhi :-\u20b911,00,000. 6.iit kuriki , 7.IIT BHU , 8.iit Patna . Now , you can also see that the placement of IIIT'S is much more better than the iit college in India. So,it conclude that the placement is not dependent on the college itself or name of college .but also depends on the quality of education is getting and how much you are implementeing it then only any company will offer you a higher package irrespective of the college , this is Same in nit's college also . So , don't bother about the college you are in or you are getting always do hard work you will get the success. Thank you \u2026 ",
