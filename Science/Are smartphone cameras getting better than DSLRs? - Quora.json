            "answer_text": "For most casual users, a smartphone will produce a better result in most circumstances than a digital Single Lens Reflex (dSLR) camera. The reason is that, despite the much poorer optics and dramatically smaller sensor size, the artificial intelligence built into the smart phone \u2018knows\u2019 much more than most users do, and is able to make all kinds of adjustments that a really good photographer would make when shooting with a high-end dSLR. Entry-level dSLRs have a number of automatic modes, such as \u2018portrait\u2019, \u2018landscape\u2019, and so on, which do this to some extent, but the electronics in smartphones are much more powerful\u2014the smartphone is, essentially, a computer which can apply all of its processing power to the task of taking a picture. For 70% of photographs, that\u2019s all you need. Now, consider this image. I\u2019m not suggesting this is a particularly good image, but it demonstrates a couple of things that a smartphone can\u2019t do.  First off, this is shot with a 500mm lens, manually focussed, at 1/4000. You can count the hairs, and you can also see the droplets of water frozen in time. It looks close, but it was actually out in the middle of a pond. Second, at 500mm, the depth of field is about 1 cm. Autofocus can\u2019t keep track of that on a smartphone. This is a momentary shot. On a high-end dSLR, you click the shutter and the photo is captured. On a smartphone, there is a lag. You aren\u2019t getting the shot you want. Third, this is shot with manual focus. You can\u2019t manually focus on a smartphone. Fourth, at 1/3200 on f8, you need a lot of gain. This shot is at ISO 50000. The iPhone XS Max only goes as far as 6400. Now, admittedly, the Huwai P30 Pro has been announced as going up to 409600 \u2014 twice the maximum ISO of the camera used to capture this. But, wait, it\u2019s always possible to increase the apparent ISO. In post-processing, the image shown can be taken up to an effective ISO of more than 1 million. The Huwai P30 Pro is clearly a triumph of engineering and software, but it still can\u2019t take a 500mm lens. See next point. And, that\u2019s a current camera versus a seven-year old camera (see last point). The Nikon D6 goes up to 3,280,000 ISO \u2014 eight times as much as the Huwai P30 Pro. Fifth, a dSLR is a system camera. The lens in question, a 500mm, was designed in the 1960s, and this particular example was probably from the 1970s. It still works on current Nikon cameras. In a few seconds, that lens can be swapped for a fisheye lens with a 180\u00b0 angle of view, corner to corner. Or it can be swapped again for an 85mm tilt-shift lens. It can control a studio light setup, potentially up to hundreds of lights, and it can control a set of Speedlights (portable flash) positioned in various places. Sixth, all of the controls are available to the photographer on a dSLR. If you want to drag the shutter, use rear-synchronisation, so that the flash fires at the end of the shot rather than the beginning, choose speed or aperture priority, or shoot fully manually, or take a shot of up to 30 seconds, you can. The Huwai P30 Pro can shoot in low light, but it can\u2019t shoot extended exposures. Seventh, you can charge up a dSLR and shoot on it intensively for a week. A smartphone will be dead in a matter of hours. Battery empty? Swap it out for the other one in your pocket. Finally, the camera used for this is a 2013 camera, a Nikon Df. My other camera is from 2012. The Df is still available. It can shoot with lenses built in the 1950s. Its all metal construction means that if you drop it, things that it falls onto break. The camera doesn\u2019t. You can still get a Nikon D1 repaired\u2014that\u2019s the first commercially viable dSLR, from 1999, replacing the marginally workable Kodak hybrid camera.  Smartphones are much better at being phones than dSLRs, but they are nowhere near being able to do the work of a dSLR in the hands of a proper photographer.  Here\u2019s an image shot this week with a Nikon Df and a 500mm lens:  Here\u2019s a crop of it:  Here are some things that the smartphone can\u2019t do: Interchangeable lenses. There will never be a smartphone with a 500mm lens. It is physically impossible.Ultra high ISO. To shoot at 1/4000, which is how you get 500mm lens shots sharp when cropping, you need to go to insanely high ISO.Ring bokeh. A mirror lens produces a distinctive doughnut shaped bokeh. Smartphones don\u2019t produce a particularly good bokeh anyway, but the particular delight of the mirror lens cannot be achieved on a smartphone.If ring bokeh isn\u2019t your thing, a smartphone also can\u2019t do tilt/shift photography or selective defocus, or take a polarising filter.Ergonomically, you could never shoot a sharp image on a lens of that length with a smartphone even if a smartphone could be equipped with such a lens. You need a body which is designed to be good for taking photographs, not for slipping into your back pocket.",

            "answer_text": "No, they are simply more idiot-proof. A person with no idea about photography will get better results with a smartphone than with a DSLR because in the case of a smartphone all they have to do is press the button. The software behind the camera is designed to do all the thinking for them (pumping up the ISO and removing noise afterwards in the case of night shots for example to not allow for excessive motion blur). Auto mode usually works quite poorly in DSLRs because they aren\u2019t really meant to be used in auto mode. Also, the quality of JPGs produced by DSLRs often leaves a lot to be desired. Again, ideally one would be shooting RAW when using a DSLR. Smartphones don\u2019t feature magic sensors and magic lenses that are somehow better than the DSLR ones that cost big bucks. A tiny sensor and a tiny lens will always be inferior to their larger counterparts (when comparing recent products at the same stage of sensor technology development). No, I\u2019m not talking about megapixels. Unlike what\u2019s been said in this thread, Nokia 808 doesn\u2019t have a larger sensor than a DSLR. Its sensor is about 11x8mm (that\u2019s quite sizeable for a smartphone actually, the sensor of iPhone 6 is a mere 4.89x3.67mm). A typical crop DSLR\u2019s sensor is about 24x16mm. Full frame is 36x24mm. The Nokia does have a larger resolution than most DSLRs but that\u2019s a different matter. Don\u2019t get fooled by smartphone fanboys/girls saying DSLRs are becoming obsolete because \u201clook what a cute photo of my cat my iPhone took!!!\u201d. If they were as obsessed about photography as they are about having access to Facebook wherever they go then they wouldn\u2019t mind the extra bulk carrying a camera around. If you want to go beyond pressing a button and applying a filter then you need a camera that will give you control over the picture and will provide you with quality output that you can then process to your liking. Doesn\u2019t need to be a DSLR. Doesn\u2019t need to be much more expensive than a smartphone either. ",

            "answer_text": "Yikes! Is it time for the monthly phone vs. DSLR question already? How time does fly\u2026  Here\u2019s the Nikon D1. This is a 2.7 megapixel DSLR that Nikon introduced in 1999. It was original sold at $5,580, which is about $8,450 today. If you want to feel superior with your smartphone, rest assured that your premium phone today takes an over-all better photo than this 19-year-old DSLR. Unless, of course, you need to shoot a distant object \u2014 the D1 can adapt by using a longer lens. Or unless you need to shoot a very, very close object \u2014 the D1 can adapt by using a true macro lens. Of if you need to shoot a really pleasing portrait with a naturally out-of-focus background. Some phones have secondary cameras with longer lenses, though not really ideal portrait length, and software to fake it. The D1 still does it better. And at 12-bits per color, the D1 probably has better color than your phone. But maybe surprisingly, even with an APS-C sized sensor, the D1 wasn\u2019t much good in low light. It had an ISO around 100\u2013200, while your phone can certainly shoot much, much faster, maybe to ISO3200\u20136400, though it\u2019s going be kind of a noisy mess there. Contrast that with Nikon\u2019s current high-end pro model, the D5, which has an ISO limit of 3,280,000. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a noisy mess, too, at ISO3,280,000. But at ISO6400, the Nikon D5 is pretty much just getting started. I\u2019m not sure how fast anyone can actually shoot photos on a phone\u2026 \u201cnot all that fast\u201d seems to be my experience. The D1 can shoot at 4.5 frames per second, which isn\u2019t all that fast in DSLR land, but should soundly beat your phone. But it only had buffer memory for 10 shots in raw mode. It also had very fast autofocus, but that is more important on a large sensor camera than the tiny sensors used in phones, which have all kinds of natural depth-of-field. But the typical 12 megapixels of your phone will deliver a better over-all photo as long as both cameras have good light. At least if you plan to make a print. Online, however, it just doesn\u2019t matter in most cases. The average computer user has an HD computer display, only about 2 megapixels, so you can\u2019t actually see the difference between your phone shot and the D1\u2019s lower resolution shot without zooming in. If you have a 4K monitor, you can \u2014 assuming the image is stored at a higher resolution online. If you\u2019re looking at Instagram, no dice: it stores and displays everything at 1080x1080 pixels. On Facebook, your photo may be stored at a higher resolution, but it\u2019s displayed at 476 pixels wide, no matter the actual resolution. So you can\u2019t tell here, either. Now, that D1 will have access to dramatically better lenses than anything anyone ever put on a phone. Thing is, at 2.7 megapixels, you aren\u2019t going to noice. If you hang one of those lenses on today\u2019s Nikon D850, with its 45 megapixel full-frame sensor, you\u2019ll get the advantage of Nikon\u2019s 60 years of wonderful optics. In short, yes, at the dawn of digital, every camera was something of a compromise, because humanity was just not all that good at making digital cameras yet. The quality from model to model increased pretty dramatically for years. The followup to the D1, Nikon\u2019s D1X in 2001, increased sensor resolution to 5.3 megapixels, nearly doubling it. And of course, if you go back much before 2011, smartphone cameras were just terrible. Manufacturers only really started thinking about such cameras as practical alternatives for point and shoot/compact digital cameras around 2010\u20132011. Prior to that, they were there primarily for utility value: scanning barcodes, shooting \u201cmemo\u201d photos, video conferencing, etc. But if you\u2019re comparing contemporary professional cameras to contemporary smartphone cameras, just stop. There phone camera will never compare well in quality to the professional camera in image quality. The much larger sensor of the DSLR or mirrorless camera will capture more resolution, both spatial and color. You may not take advantage of this is you treat your DSLR like a point-and-shoot, just shooting in JPEG through a kit lens and publishing straight-out-of-camera. But if you\u2019re using it correctly, shooting in raw and editing each acceptable photo to take advantage of all of the extra information you get in a raw image before publishing, you\u2019ll be making images that no smartphone can touch\u2026 technically. Of course, as Ansel Adams said, \u201cThe single most important component of a camera is the twelve inches behind it!\u201d While maybe the smartphone AI people are trying to change this, the creativity is yours, not your camera\u2019s. If you develop talents in photography, you\u2019ll get great shots with a phone camera. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, a high-end DSLR is not going to help you. Yet.

            "answer_text": "No. For some background, see Jeff Forbes's answer to How much more can smartphone cameras improve? The limitation of a camera system is from the optics and sensor - how much light they can collect, and how much detail they can resolve. If you read my answer above, you will see how far cellphone cameras have advanced since the early days of the smartphone. The very short version of it is that smartphone sensors are 5 times as large as they used to be, the lenses are larger and better, and more effort is being put in to developing them. But as car guys say, there\u2019s no replacement for displacement. In this case, smartphones are held to the same limitations as everything else - DSLRs and mirrorless cameras have sensors many times as large, with much more capable lenses attached to them. Smartphones have come a long way. These days, there can be situations that for small display sizes, such as a laptop screen or cellphone screen, there may not be a huge difference in image quality. This is limited to situations where the cellphone and SLR are using a similar equivalent focal length lens for the same perspective, a lot of light being present, and the way the picture is being displayed is a small screen. In these cases, a cellphone picture can look just as good as one from an SLR. But if there\u2019s less light, or you need to control the depth of field, or if you need more detail for a very large print, or heavily process the image, the difference will be far more apparent. Modern smartphones are now often as good as nice point and shoot cameras, and oftentimes better than them. But they are still at a disadvantage compared to an SLR. One area of note that may make cellphone pictures look better is that SLRs don\u2019t heavily post-process their images automatically. If you look at a RAW capture from an SLR. it will often look quite dull and flat. This is because the camera is simply presenting the scene as captured without significantly modifying it. Pretty much every cellphone on the market takes the base image and sharpens it, performs noise reduction on it, adjusts the color and contrast, and oftentimes automatically makes an HDR image. So comparing a cellphone picture to a RAW file directly from an SLR is rather disingenuous. One is an automatically processed image and the other is intended to be processed by the user. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes. But it depends what you are using it for. Many pros demand quality images, for this they ante up on a expensive DSLR camera to do the job. However, if you have no need to get top notch picture quality, why use a DSLR? During my time at Sony Asia Pacific 10 years ago, they told me explicitly that the rise of camera phones will eventually replace the entry level DSLR. And they didn\u2019t want to even make point and shoot digital cameras below 8 megapixels at that time. What they wanted to engineer was a higher quality DSLR product, which according to Michael Yamashita of Natgeo (who I had the pleasure to work with) would eventually make photography a gentleman\u2019s hobby. The advances in light sensitive sensors on camera phones have been extraordinary in the last 10 years. From the first generation iPhone to the newest iPhone X or Google Pixel, camera phones have evolved to replace the market segment for entry level DSLRs. I have also seen the marketshare for DSLRs decline sharply. This is nothing short of astonishing considering that it was only in the mid-2000s that mobile phones started to pack cameras. Right now, the trend is for cameras to do both still and video capture, and for this alone the smartphone is already better at doing it at far less than it cost to buy a entry level DSLR. High end DSLRs are stupidly expensive to buy these days and unless you have a booming photography business going for you, buying one for hobby use is without any justification. The demand for paid photos have also declined. In the old days, digital stock photos could only be purchased from folks like Corel who sold them on a CD. The advent of the Internet sort of changed everything. You can now buy online for as little as 1 dollar or have a monthly paid subscription to access thousands of photos. I started shooting on film back in the day, so I know this well. I use to admire conflict photographers in the analog era, and even met Eddie Adams. They made a good living shooting film and were handsomely paid. You can\u2019t say the same these days with digital photos. But the technology of DSLRs has far exceeded what film SLRs could do. There is no need to attach filters for WB controls and you can dial in the ISO speed anytime you wish (a feat that film SLRs could not do). The race now is to make a better DSLR that is cheaper. Unfortunately camera companies are not interested in the mass market because that segment competes directly with smartphone cameras. They prefer to concentrate on niche markets that people still buy cameras for, like in Sports, Commercial photography, Wedding, etc. This is the only paying segment of the photography market that makes sense for people to own a DSLR. Pros like to talk about the picture quality of DSLRs but if they ever showed a client a picture shot in daylight on an iPhone X and one that is shot on a DSLR, the difference is hard to distinguish. And smartphones like the Huawei, is fast catching up on low light capability\u2014a domain where DSLRs excel at the moment. It will only be a matter of time before technology makes it viable to replace the DSLR. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but they are getting practically close to.. in some situations. They are very good, but they won\u2019t match (assuming comparing a top end smartphone camera to a DSLR of the same year. But they don\u2019t cost as much, either. 1,000 USD is on the high end price for a phone, but that might be the entry price for a small DSLR. Just because now some phones can produce \u2018bokeh\u2019 or \u2018portrait mode\u2019 or lighting, does not mean they would have the same option. DSLR have options to control remote flashes, multiple lenses, real \u201czoom\u201d, etc.. They each have their use, smartphones are with you all the time, and carring a DSLR is not that easy for everybody. What I think is that, as time goes by, the \u201cneed\u201d to use a DSLR will be more for experts, but there is a lot of thing going on. Maybe the future would be to camera brands to provide lenses that would connect to your smartphone, and use your smartphone to store and upload your images. Maybe that would be one way to go, if you don\u2019t carry your big lenses, you would still have a good overall camera, but if you need to, maybe carry lenses, flashes, tripod and whatever tools. One of the advantages of DSLR where a phone cannot cope, I think, even with this, is that most profesional photographers shoot in raw, which provide huge files. They would fill a phone memory in no time, and it would be harder to swap cards as some cameras do, and expecting to be able to upload to a cloud is not realistical\u2026 yet. About 5 years ago there were still a lot of point and shoot cameras, now they are almost gone, I think. I don\u2019t think that it will happen to the DSLR, but I think that the market percentage of DSLR will diminish as cameras get better at it. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, totally and completely, no. This can never happen. Could a simple fireworks rocket take you to the moon and back again? Just basic sense should tell you the answer. A typical smartphone costs, say, $700. In that smartphone you've bought a multipurpose device containing more computing power than desktop computers had some years ago. It contains a powerful UHF radio transceiver for digitally-secure speech and SMS messages and dozens of apps you might want to install. In other words it's a combined pocket computer with a comms centre. AND on top if that, they toss in two cameras, on average. One rear, one front. Economics should already be telling you where this is going\u2026 When a phone gives you all those things in one combined package, is it sensible to expect those cameras to approach what a DSLR can provide? No, it's not. HOWEVER. Those cameras are, in my experience now so good that they do approach the sort of image quality obtainable from compact cameras. And some allow the recording of RAW files, which record far, far more data than do the JPG compressed equivalent. And the video quality that my Samsung S8 gives is astonishing. In that regard only, my phone is a more effective one than my DSLR cameras. But my DSLRs are all outdated models these days, and only record video up to Full HD, or 1080p whereas my S8 can do video up to full on 4K\u2026 So can the current breed of DSLRs. Where the DSLRs will still score however is in the fantastic quality of their lenses. And in their ability to shoot in low light, because they are dedicated photography specialist machines. Your smartphone for still pictures can't compete with decent DSLRs, economics dictates that the specialist machine must defeat the tiny-sensor generalist camera in the phone. But having said that, smartphones nowadays are taking shots that only a few years ago would have needed a good quality camera. But you can change the lens on a DSLR, that's not \"on\" with a phone. Where the phone will always beat the DSLR, however, is that you most likely always have it with you. Do you always have a DSLR in your pocket??? That's where the phone camera wins. The best camera is - the one you have with you. And that'll almost always be a smartphone-cam, with all its shortcomings. They are two completely different beasts, and both are valuable tools for the picshooter. A huge majority of my shots these days are phone pix, but if I want a quality landscape for fine detail or a flying bird, it's the DSLRs every time. ",

            "answer_text": "NO NO PHONE can give you the same picture quality as of DSLR, coz of simple reason as explained in image below :  Larger sensors are, in general, better sensors. They can gather more light and offer more depth of field control and with that large sensor you can get images that are practically impossible with a phone No matter how amazing technology gets, there are some fundamental limitations that will more or less always be in the way of smartphones, even in iPhones. Larger sensors are, in general, better sensors. They can gather more light and offer more depth of field control and with that large sensor you can get images that are practically impossible with a phone. Those small sensors we see inside smartphones, even with an f/1.7 lens, cannot offer great DOF control or Bokeh effect which everyone today is aware of this term was meant for DSLR only earlier.. Whatever the pictures we takes on phone like, take an example of most infamous portrait mode. Smartphones takes normal picture first and then uses software to blur the background. Here phone uses data captured by secondary camera (part of dual lens) and later this data is used by a program to blur the subject background, this is purely artificial, right. You can not compare effects generated by lens optics, sensor size and its aperture values, whereas in mobile its all kind of artificial. MEGAPIXELS: The higher megapixel doesn\u2019t guarantee you a better quality picture. The Nokia 808 had a huge 41MP camera but its sensor size was 1/1.2 inches. Where as an entry level DSLR like Nikon D3300 has 24.2 MP camera but since it has a APS-C CMOS sensor with size 23.5 x 15.6 mm, it can gather way more details than what smartphone cameras does. So you should never be under the myth of megapixels which advertisers uses now a days to attract customers. IMAGE PROCESSOR: This is most underrated functionality of DSLR which nobody talks about. This is a brain of any camera which puts together each tiny bit of information like colors, image sensor correction, dark frame subtraction, noise reduction, image sharpening, scaling and many more. Now the difference here is DSLR has a dedicated brain only for image processing, nothing else. While in smartphone a generic processor does everything, from handling your daily tasks to capture image and processing as well. So there has to be a difference in the quality of work you will get as output. Conclusion : With the rise of smartphones and technology inside it, obviously phones and its camera has come a long way. The quality of pictures is also increased drastically with many filters and in-camera processing software. Also its more portable than a bulky DSLR and images can be shared rather quickly by smartphone on social medias. But when you look closely, smartphone uses software to get the desired output like blur or in-build effects which is all artificial. Where as in DSLRs all the effects generated by optics and it depends how you used different settings. So its always better to know the actual technics on how optics sensor and setting works together rather than depending on various effects generated by mobile cameras.Still I would say, for casual shots and for fun times Smartphone is definitely your friend but when you get serious about photography then at some point you will definitely feel that your smartphone is restricting you and that day you will automatically get hundreds of reasons to upgrade yourself with DSLR Keep Clicking !!! Smartphone Cameras Vs Digital SLRs ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. They are already better in half part, ie, in video recording. New android flagships can record 8K at 30fps and 4K at 60fps with HDR and OIS, EIS and AIS with 10 bit colour. While rare nu.ber of DSLRs go beyond 1080p. DSLRs always did better with interchangeable lenses. But new smartphones has inbuilt multi cameras so even on that case, smartphones are more convenient than DSLRs. I had a Canon EOS 5D and an iPhone 7 Plus a few years ago. While my video recording was done on 7 plus, shot photos on 5D. But now everything has changed. I sold my Canon and have Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus. As new smartphone takes more pictures with the same time of charging as DSLR, and RAW capture ability, I decided not to buy a DSLR again. It is dead in my minds. If I am to buy a new camera, it will be a modern mirror less one or a Camcorder. 99% of times, DSLR takes worst images compared to a new smartphone. And when it comes to videos, smartphone are years ahead. People around my area are buying some DSLRs like 1500D just to show off. Even guys here buys Bridge cameras and says they bought an SLR. I don\u2019t know why they are referring bridge cameras as SLR. SLR is a film camera with mirror mechanism for viewfinder and interchangeable lens.I don\u2019t know why people are spending lot of money on outdated stuff just to show off or very rare photography. Before saying that smartphones are for people who don\u2019t know about camera controls, here me out. Just use the Pro mode in Xperia 1 II. You will be amazed. And coming to sensor size, this is debatable as point and shoots captured less light in low light than smartphones even though they had larger sensors, maybe DSLRs have a slight edge in it. I respect Dave Haynie and others who proved DSLRs are better than smartphones. I\u2019m not saying they are wrong or I am 100% correct. Both smartphone and DSLR are unique in their own ways. As Smartphones can never have some features as DSLRs and vice versa, It\u2019s a matter of choice. And another thing I am more biased towars smartphone is that smartphone cameras are improving a lot over the years but DSLRs are not much. A 2010 smartphone camera and 2020 smartphone canera compared will show that smartphones are improving a lot. But DSLRs from sane years, not much improvement. Can\u2019t predict now. Wait for some years to see if DSLRs will come back with features a smartphone can never do or vice versa. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There may be situations where they are easier to use or to get good results, but the limitations of camera phones are here to stay. First, the sheer adaptability of an SLR knocks any phone into a cocked hat. If you want to change the field of view on your phone, you can move or you can crop your image. Even a basic kit lens gives you infinitely more options than that. And when you can swap lenses out, you are not bound to a single perspective but can select the exact tool for the job, with the precise focal length you require. Next, there is the size of the sensor. However many teeny tiny pixels you can fit behind the teeny tiny lens on your phone, they are never going to keep up with an APSC or Full Frame sensor, especially in low light. Bigger, more accurate pixels make cleaner, sharper and more realistic pictures. And last, but not least, there's the glass. Now camera makers are very proud of the quality of their lenses, and rightly so, they are excellent at what they do. But that doesn't mean they can seriously match up to the top range glass you'll find on an SLR. Look how much a good superzoom costs. You could buy a lifetime supply of phones for the price of a top end lens. People don't pay that sort of money for nothing. They are paying for image quality that you simply cannot get any cheaper. And that's without going into things like selective autofocus, dials for manual control of shutter speed and aperture, high fps, continuous capture and all the other things a real camera can do. There's no substitute for a good camera. But. That said\u2026 You can make the exact same comparison between DSLR cameras and Medium Format cameras and the DSLR comes off second best there. The best camera is the one in your hand. The greatest limits to a modern photographer are not technical but come from not learning, understanding and developing the skills to construct a great image. Pictures I take with my phone now are often better photographs than my first attempts with a DSLR were. Not because the tech is better, but because I am. Go and take photos with whatever you have access to. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is No. Why? Because there are a lot of factors that are necessary to be considered when talking about this topic, and here are few factors that might help you out. 1.Image Sensor Size There are different sensors used in different cameras. When there are different sensors that also includes different sizes of sensors. A basic DSLR can have a crop sensor or APS-c sensor and it sizes about 23.6 x 14 mm (the size again will vary with different manufacturers). And to hold this size of sensor the smartphones has to be made bigger. Relatively there are other bigger sensors such as Full frame and it sizes about 35 X 24 mm, which is almost twice the size of the APS-C sensor. There is a Medium Format sensor and it sizes about 53 x 40 mm. It is really hard for the smartphone manufactures to build a phone to hold a sensor of this size. As the sensor size increases the light captured by the sensor is more and does a good job in low light situations.  2. The Blur (Bokeh) The smartphones actually use software to manipulate the background blurs in the image. Even the software is not so perfect to bring the blur that is produced optically (using the lens only). I tried creating a Bokehlicious image using leading smartphone and the blur is not masked well. Sometimes it cuts out the edges of the subject and gets it blurred too. 3. Interchangeable Lens This is one of the most loved features of a DSLR for all pro shooters. It is always necessary to use right lens for the right type of photography. And DSLR allows you to change lenses based on the requirements. There are almost different variety of lenses for landscape, portrait, wildlife, architecture, low-light and more. 4. Features Though smartphones capture great images, DSLR offers more flexibility over the features listed below. The below list is only a few but DSLRs offer more. - Kelvin Scale White balance adjustment - Metering Modes - Auto Focus Modes - Multiple Exposures - Shutter and Aperture Priority Modes ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion it already has but like many new technologies you will find many people fearfully clinging to their old technolgy claiming that the new technology will never compare.  I am basing this off of the end result that both cameras produce not what each machine can do.  If you take two photos and  show them side by side to random people the majority will not be able to choose the one that was taken by a dslr camera. In this side by side comparison  iPhone 6 Plus vs Galaxy Note 4 vs DSLR camera comparison: strengths and weaknesses of phone cameras vs DSLRs users were not asked to choose the photo that they thought was taken by a dslr but to choose the photo they preferred best and for the average audience they chose the smart phone.  Of course, there are things that a camera phone can't do like take a close up shot at an NBA game but a basic dslr can't do that either. You have to buy a special lens for that and when most people have trouble shelling out the few hundred bucks for the cost of a phone. I'm pretty sure they will not want to pay a few hundred for a basic dslr  then pay hundreds more for a telephoto lens or any other specialty lens they might need for a unique shot.  I personally think lenses should be out of it when comparing a camera phone to a dslr camera because those are accessories that alter the way the camera was originally intended to perform.  A more accurate comparison is grabbing an out of the box dslr and an out of the box camera phone and comparing them side by side. I also think it is useless to compare specs because that is not what the audience sees in a picture. Of course dslrs have bigger sensors, more mega pixels, and handle lighting better because of a better built in flash but the audience that sees the picture compares the end product they for the most part can't see a difference or they see the difference but like the way it comes put in a camera phone. Another advantage to a dslr is it gives you a raw image file to work with but who besides professional photographers and maybe a few hobbyists out there work with raw image files.  An analogy I think of when I think about this question is comparing a high end luxury car to a Honda. Yes the luxury car is going to beat a Honda in specs every time but when it comes down to it. What do you use a car for? To get from point A to point B and most people aren't going to notice the slight difference  in less horsepower or custom controls or in comfort either because they have never ridden in a luxury car or because they just don't care about it. They just want to get where they are going and if it is good enough then that's all they need.   ",

            "answer_text": "The primary job of a camera is collecting light. That being said, a lens is far more important than the camera itself. If you\u2019re going to spend money on a DSLR, spend more of your budget on a lens over a body. Your body will become obsolete. Your lens will not. I use my phone camera a lot more often than I use my DSLR. It\u2019s more convenient, always with me, and fits in my pocket. It takes pretty good photos and video. It also does a great job of automatically uploading my photos to the cloud (Dropbox and Google Photos). It\u2019s the perfect camera for taking daily snapshots. For most people, this is an ideal camera. If my phone camera is so great, why do I spend a fortune on a DSLR? Options and quality. My Pixel 3 phone has one of the highest rated cameras in the industry, but my retired 15 year old Nikon D50 DSLR can take better photos in a wider range of conditions. My D750 with its full frame sensor and a fast lens don\u2019t even consider my Pixel 3 to be in the same game. Consider this; I could buy a replacement camera and lens module for my Pixel 3 on eBay for $15.99. That\u2019s the entire camera and lens. I\u2019m betting that most of that price tag is for the electronics. The lens itself probably cost pennies to manufacture. Remember what I said about the primary job of a camera being a light collector, and the lens is what does that job? Even the cheapest DSLR lens is going to be a better light collector than the most expensive camera phone lens. So the lens is the primary reason why a DSLR will always win. Second is the sensor size. Digital cameras collect an array of colors and intensities called pixels. The more pixels, generally the better the image quality, generally. My D50 DSLR has 6 megapixels and my Pixel 3 has 12 megapixels. So which is better? It\u2019s hard to say because the technology is 15 years apart and the D50 has a far bigger sensor area. Each takes better photos in different conditions. Finally, the DSLR is a clear winner when you need to edit. Your camera phone is programmed to give you an ideal shot in the moment, but there\u2019s not much data left if you want to do any editing. A DSLR shooting RAW can give you miracles. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not as comfortable as using your smartphone's camera. It is very easy to take your phone out of your pocket and catch what you see right away. However, DSLRs offer much more functionality. If you want to take your photography skills to the next level, you won't even want to compare the DSLR with the smartphone. When should I switch to DSLR? To determine this, you should know the advantages of DSLR. Only those who take photographs for a hobby may be content with the capabilities of today's phones. Artificial intelligence Algorithms are now more valuable than sensors and lenses. The result is dramatically changing, as in the case of Google Pixel, which uses a single camera, especially thanks to artificial intelligence algorithms. Sharp colors, depth of field create, hair, hands and face details can now work great in portrait mode. In spite of everything, there is still a need for professional cameras in areas where the light varies and the movement is involved. However, we can say that the software has started to provide a great advantage. Now, professional software is taking advantage of this software. Still, it's not as fast as the giant competition on smartphones. The introduction of mirrorless digital cameras to make fewer mistakes when using professional cameras has started. It is now possible to get better results by identifying the objects you shoot with artificial intelligence. This can also be used in professional cameras with complex menus. In other words, cameras with interchangeable lenses are no longer just for professional users. Also smartphones with professional cameras are not always competing. Moreover, we can say that experienced photographic brands cooperate in some places. Actually this cooperation had existed from the beginning. As Nokia's Carl Zeiss collaboration. On the engineering side, we can say that the cooperation between Huawei and Leica is the most popular and the best result. In cooperation with Hasselblad and Motorola, the weight of the lens company was felt. Two Chinese; when we compare Lenovo to buy Huawei and Motorola, the Leica collaboration is a clear lead in terms of marketing, product design and sales. As a result, it is easier to measure the success of collaborations based on sales results. Multi-camera In the last five years, one of the most differentiating things in smartphone cameras is multi-camera. The race started with two cameras and now has three or even four cameras. With wide-angle, tele zooming distances, and powerful low-light sensors, many cameras are beginning to close the gap with professional cameras. Smart assistants also help you to make a difference in any situation, simplifying your work and minimizing shooting errors. The software solves which camera comes into play on smartphones focused on fast results. That's why the key task in multi-camera sensors and software. Low light champions cameras The capabilities of the cameras have been increasing for the last five years. Previously it was impossible to take good pictures with smartphones in low light. Now even the moonlight photos amaze. Apple shoots without the need for low light mode, while the night mode on Android phones is easy. Huawei claims it will succeed without even using a tripod in low light. Yes, there really are photographs he does. However, it is not easy for him to achieve the same success under all circumstances. Professional cameras don't even enjoy the portrait taken with a 50 mm lens. Although they have come a long way, they still cannot achieve the success of professional cameras. ",

            "answer_text": "There is really no comparison. Mobile has a tiny sensor (no matter how many megapixels it contains) and a single focal length lens, usually wide angle. This means that you really cannot shoot sports, wild game, deep space or other subjects which require a long lens and the image quality will start to fall apart once you start attempting to make images larger than 4x6 inches. If you are okay with these limitation, the the smartphone is for you. People who want to be able to take control of their cameras, prefer a fully adjustable camera, with at least a 4/3 sensor and one that uses interchangeable lenses. As a working pro, I have one full frame dSLR (Nikon D800e - 36mp) and one cropped sensor (APS-C) camera which is specifically designed for shooting in low light, the kind of light found at night field games or indoor games or other sports. That camera is a Nikon D500, 20 mp). I also have some specialty cameras like the underwater Nikonos and a Nikon D300 set up as an astrophotography camera I have lenses from as wide as a fisheye to as long as 500 mm. If you want to see what kind of fields of view these lenses have on both cameras, here is a link. NIKKOR Lens Simulator I can use any of the lenses, DX or FX on both cameras, so that is a plus. Only you can decide which type camera is best for your kind of shooting style and subject. I find that when using a mobile, much time is spent in some kind of image processing app to enhance the images. With a fully adjustable camera, all the exposure and composition done in the camera reduces the amount of time necessary to process the images. I always shoot in RAW so that I have the most image data possible when processing each image. You can start out using your mobile to practice your composition and before you start spending money on a dSLR camera system, do a ton of research. Once you pick a specific brand, you will be married to it for a decade or so, unless you have a whole lot of spare cash laying around. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is: They already have. Many folks have replaced their use of proper cameras including DSLRs with smartphones. Good for them. I know that for most people who take pictures, a smartphone is a great tool that will satisfy them. In the meantime, proper cameras including point-and-shoot, compact, mirrorless, and DSLRs still have a legitimate place in photography. For many, a smartphone can never replace DSLR. As one who shoots just as many photographs on a smartphone as on other cameras, I find I can produce excellent images with my phone. However, I know I will bump into a smartphone\u2019s limitations on professional and personal assignments. Experienced photographers want far more control and capability in their cameras than any smartphone can deliver. Moreover, whatever a smartphone can do, a DSLR can do better regardless of how digital imagery technology advances. Here are the inherent advantages of a DSLR over a smartphone.1. Superior ergonomics - it\u2019s easier to handle a DSLR.2. Larger sensor - you can fit more and larger pixels (technically \u201cphoto sites\u201d) which allows more resolution and superior low-light performance. Like the car enthusiast adage goes - Ain\u2019t no replacement for displacement.3. Larger lenses - Larger lenses allow more light and greater depth of field control. A DSLR allows superior lens design because there\u2019s more physical room to work with.4. A large range of lenses - allows more compositional choices.5. Higher capacity and replaceable batteries - allow more images to be shot and can simply be replaced for uninterrupted shooting.6. Faster response - dedicated circuitry allows faster focusing.7. Dedicated digital circuitry - allows superior image and file processing.\u201d8. Removable media - allows uninterrupted shooting of large files and thousands of images. Many DSLRs have two media slots that expands capability.9. Wireless photo sharing - nearly all new DSLRs can automatically and wirelessly transfer images to a smartphone for instant sharing. I rarely shoot professionally anymore but I\u2019m holding on to and probably continuing to buy into large sensor camera systems simply because I want as much control in my images as possible. Many other folks believe the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. When I was younger, my first camera was a cheap Kodak Instamatic that shot 126 film. My family had a somewhat better camera that shot 126 film while I was growing up, and we later upgraded to one of the Kodak disk film cameras (we also briefly had a Kodak Trimprint until Polaroid won a lawsuit and Kodak had to stop making film for them). For a few decades, these point-and-shoot one-click cameras were fairly common for casual users. You\u2019d buy a roll of film, usually about 24 shots or so, snap away, then take them to Photo-Mat or somewhere to get them developed. SLR cameras at the time were a bit more complex and not ideal for the average casual user. I bought my first (used) 35mm SLR around 1992 and used it up until the early 2000\u2019s. It didn\u2019t have auto focus, but did have an auto exposure setting for shutter speed along with a built-in light meter. While it wasn\u2019t too difficult to learn, cameras like this required some extra skill to use: you had to consider the aperture, the depth of field, the shutter speed, whether or not to use a flash, etc\u2026 For casual use, most people preferred the point-and shoot variety. In the 2000\u2019s, digital cameras started to become the norm. While they had been around for a little while already, they were typically too expensive for the casual and even many serious users. Additionally, personal computer technology wasn\u2019t advanced enough to make them practical for the average user. Software to read the images from the camera memory or import from a card was slow, image rendering was slow, and image manipulation was rudimentary. A lot of people didn\u2019t have a computer at home yet, and most people who had internet access till had dial-up access. As the 2000\u2019s progressed, however, several things came together. Computer speeds increased and the usability of Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh OSX increased (though Apple had been pretty easy to use for a while). In the mid 90\u2019s, transferring a 800x600 pixel JPG might have taken several minutes. In the mid 2000\u2019s, higher speed internet access dropped that to seconds. Rendering time went from a minute or two in the early to mid 90\u2019s to seconds. And the cost of digital cameras dropped dramatically with advances in manufacturing and the increasing popularity of CMOS imaging sensors. The advances in on-board processing capability started to narrow the usability gap between point-and-shoot cameras and DSLRs. The price of a DSLR was typically higher, but most DSLR cameras could now be used almost as easily as the less-advanced cousins. This made them a bit more attractive to casual users who could afford them. They tended to offer advanced functions for those who wanted them, but could also be used almost as easy as a point-and-shoot camera. At this point, the main difference for the bulk of consumers was price. And at right about this same time, cell phones started taking off. Sometime in the early to mid 2000\u2019s, cameras became standard features on cell phones. With the advent of smartphones. Suddenly, everyone had a camera in their pocket. As smart phone technology advanced and, along with it, wireless and WiFi internet speeds, the gap between point and shoot cameras and cell phones rapidly decreased. There are still dedicated point and shoot cameras available today, but most smartphones these days can take pictures as good or better - or at least good enough for most average users - than the dedicated point and shoot variety. And the technology and capability of cell phone cameras, which is a major selling point for many phones, has pretty much entirely caught up with point-and-shoot cameras. Some people still prefer them, and some provide some additional features that aren\u2019t practical in cell phones (such as extended optical zoom capabilities), but for the average casual user, their cell phone camera is as good as they need for most casual photography: capturing selfies, images of friends and family, unusual events or occurrences - and they don\u2019t have to carry around a separate device: they have their phone with them anyway. So, as far as casual photography goes, yes, a cell phone can replace a DSLR for most casual users. But DSLR and now mirrorless cameras have features and benefits not yet available (and probably never to be available) in a cell phone. One such difference is image sensor size. The image sensor of a cell phone camera is typically very small, measured in a few millimeters. DSLRs typically have two sensor sizes: full-frame - meaning image sensors roughly the same size as a frame of 35 mm film - and APS-C, which are typically somewhat smaller, but still much larger than cell phone camera sensors. Larger sensors often (though not always) have more pixels, offering deeper resolution, and typically capture more light with a larger surface area (important in some applications such as low-light photography). DSLR cameras also typically offer a significantly greater amount of control over the image capture process. While some cell phone apps do offer some extended features, the amount of control a photographer has over shutter speed, exposure level, aperture control, depth of field, color balance, and more allow a trained user to capture better images. Though at least some cell phone cameras do allow for higher-quality image files, DSLR cameras commonly shoot in a raw, \u201clossless,\u201d image format. Most cell phones by default save files in JPG image format, which compresses data and, in doing so, loses dynamic range and image quality. While some DSLR users choose to shoot JPG, most who are making use of the extended capability of the camera shoot a raw format and convert as needed. The raw format allows them far more capability when processing in programs like Photoshop. Most cell phones also are stuck with their built-in flash. While this is fine for casual use, an experienced photographer can make use of a DSLR flash unit that provides superior control over lighting, allowing him/her to produce better effects, reduce the effects of \u201cred-eye,\u201d and overall get better lighting of the subject. And, of course, there is the ability to change lenses for different needs. With all of this capability, much of which is not practical to add to a cell phone, It\u2019s unlikely DSLR or the recent development in mirrorless cameras will be replaced outright by cell phones. Rather, cell phones will continue for some time to be the main tool of casual photographers and the more advanced cameras will be the working tools of more serious photographers. Speaking personally, I have two DSLRs (one of which is specially modified for astrophotography) as well as my cell phone. Lately, the DSLRs are only used for astrophotography and everything else is done with my iPhone. However, since my girlfriend and I are considering doing some travelling in the next few years, I may look into a new lens or two and some additions for my DSLR that will give me the ability to capture better images on travel. For example, one of the reasons I bought a film SLR in the first place was to take pictures of objects in museums that may not allow for flash photography. I visited one museum once that had illuminated manuscripts on display, but wouldn\u2019t allow any flash photography as the light could damage the artifacts. At the time, I purchased some higher-speed Kodak Ektar 1000 speed film which allowed me, to make use of the exposure control settings on my camera and capture some images without a flash (sadly, I have no idea where those pictures have gone). If I want to take pictures under similar circumstances now, my iPhone really isn\u2019t the right tool for the job. I\u2019ll get much better results with my Nikon if I play with the exposure settings. But, other than astrophotography, the vast majority of the images I take are now all done on my iPhone which does better than any point-an-shoot camera I\u2019ve ever had to this point. ",

But , Smartphones camera have improved a lot , thats because of Exmor RS or its Variants like Exocell have improved Image Processing and has provided Better Twilight , Night Shots ( Obviously way weaker in resolution than DSLR ) , Dawn shots are now way better than early days of Smartphone. Mobile Sensors are smaller but pack in lot of resolution , but it is useful only during daytime ( 40MP) & not at all as useful in night due to Noise as pixels are small to capture any data , thanks to massive improvement in the camera technology you can achieve identical / near identical photographs like DSLR , but you can never achieve the depth or cropping prowess of a DSLR. That's were the sensor size of DSLR counts. The Max Cropping is possible only with 40MP photos in Mobile , but with DSLR , any brand DSLR can do better. But thanks to all the sensor improvements , excellent & near DSLR type shots can be achieve , but the quality of Depth & level of Cropping like DSLR can not be achieve ( You don't need cropping always , And normally we do minimum cropping , so Smartphone camera will do good , but if you are into Wildlife Photography with animals running at a distance , and need to zoom / Crop extensively than DSLR is the only answer ) , including capturing Flying Eagle shots etc. & not to mention Zooming is possible with only DSLR ( And Bridge Camera ). On a positive note with Smartphone , you can click excellent random shots & i will rate it anyday better than DSLR for portability ( Good ones can be rated Professional , which are put by photographers / Amateurs in exhibitions or Photo Contest & many wins ) , so Smartphones is better option for Excellent Spot Scene photos , but if you want professional Grade Very Big Frame shots , Slow- motion Photo Shoots ( Were you need Full manual control on shutter & Focus ) , in motion photos like a Deer running , Flowing River Stream , Sea Waves , Misty Stormy Winds etc. can only be better on a DSLR ( In Short if there are 100 ways to click better photos in different Scenes , Smartphones can click only in 40 ways the rest 60 Types of Photography is only possible with a DSLR ) , thanks to the full manual control that a DSLR achieves.

            "answer_text": "When you take a picture you actually run into a complex process involving : Creation intentLens picture deformationSensor capturePicture post-processingThe short answer is that in some cases, phone camera can overrun DSLRs, but in most of the case, they can\u2019t. The most obvious case where phones win is in everyday usage as you always have it with you. But if you set this scenario apart, and suppose you have your DSLR , that \u2018s another story. If you want to have a special creation intent, such as stopping a bird flight, or on the contrary demonstrate the flow of a river, you\u2019ll have to fiddle with speed parameter, which most of to the cases are not available on the phone camera. If you want to create bokeh (blur around a portrait head) or have perfect sharpness from the first grass a the forefront up to the mountains on the horizon, you\u2019ll have to fiddle with depth of field and aperture parameter, which most of the cases is not available on the phone camera. If you want to crop from afar this vulture nest, you\u2019ll need a big zoom which your phone can\u2019t offer. OK, but you might say , this is only temporary, one day you\u2019ll have all of it on your phone, and they will win. Actually, no. Because the law of physics are here to stay also. Basically , what they say is that you need a big aperture and a big sensor to store enough light information. It\u2019s the optical equivalent of \u201cyou need a big woofer to render bass sounds\u201d. Light at the core is quantic. You receive discret number of photons. If you don\u2019t have them, you can\u2019t invent the picture. You can\u2019t set up a magical algorithm to create the data you don\u2019t have. That\u2019s ultimately the advantage of DSLR. When you go away from an easy scenario where you are taking a picture of a still landscape brightly lit by the summer sun, you begin with the phone to be short of photons. Your sensor is so small that you don\u2019t have enough information to tell wether this is light grey or dark grey. You have also random noise, light noise (there were two photons in your shot, while normally 1.5 should have be expected) or electrical noise. So in low lights scenarios, or high speeds for fast moving subjects, phone cameras really are bad, and this can\u2019t really be improved to the level of DSLRs. You can try to raise the number of pixels in the phone - in order to store more details -, but you also need to open the door to have something to store, in other word to raise the aperture (the size of the lens) and then the size of the device, because you need to have a focal plan related with the lens size. The iPhone X is going this direction, by offering two lenses, but this is still a very small step to come closer to the potential of a real DSLR lens. That the reason why professionals still pay a fortune for DSLRs. It\u2019s not pure snobbery. ",

Those two things a big difference in the final images, particularly in the areas of color noise, and low-light capabilities. Phones are now doing very interesting things using multiple exposures and some very clever post-processing, which will probably start filtering back to high-end cameras, particularly the new breed of mirrorless cameras. My 7-year-old entry-level DSLR has things like multi-shot HDR, but the actual execution is slightly clunkier than a modern phone or tablet. For things like sports and action photography, phones are still nowhere near DSLRs, even older ones. In terms of neat new sensors, those are almost always going to show up in high-end cameras first, before they filter down to smaller consumer-grade cameras and smart phones. ",

Smartphone cameras have killed the low-end market for point and shoot cameras, for higher end compact cameras, and for DSLR's. They measure their market in 100's of millions. Here's data from CIPA (Camera & Imaging Products Association), an association of Japanese camera manufacturers. Compact and DSLR camera sales are down another 20+% in the last year following several years of declines. It's a bloodbath, and the clear reason is that nothing can compete with the convenience and ubiquity of smartphone cameras. On the other hand, if by 'beat' you mean attainable image quality then that's a more complicated story.  The price of convenience in smart phone cameras is a small sensor. The issue with small sensors is that the associated small lens limits the amount of light that can be captured in a single image and the size of the aperture.  For the same technologies, the smartphone camera has less light to work with and cannot achieve the same degree of selective focus.  The consequence of less light is lower dynamic range and higher noise.  The consequence of less selective focus is to omit a unique attribute of photographic expression. The form factor of smartphones also makes it  difficult to use attain wide angle or very long telephoto perspectives. So in those respects, the capabilities of DSLR's will 'beat' smartphone cameras for the foreseeable future. Do those distinctions matter?  For more sophisticated photographers, yes.  and they will seek out cameras that provide those features for when they need them. Whether that's a medium format, DSLR, mirrorless, is an open question, but smartphones can't meet those specific needs. But for a huge majority of people those aspects of photography don't matter.  For that very large group,  I think smartphone cameras 'beat' DSLR's right now. Here's an example of what a smartphone can do --   ",

They do all that some people want or need to do, and along with the clock, flashlight, browser, email, and all kinds of apps we carry them all the time. Lots of people have no need of a DSLR. I\u2019m not one of those people. I need my DSLRs and other \u2018non-phone\u2019 cameras to do what I need to do and no phone camera will replace my DSLR, unless maybe it\u2019s a DSLR with a phone built in. On second, thought, I don\u2019t want to be bothered with a phone call or text message while I\u2019m working with my camera, and the DSLR\u2019s too big to fit my pocket. I want to pick up a camera bag with DSLR, lenses, and lights and walk out with it when I need it. There\u2019s no way a camera phone with it\u2019s tiny little lenses, no real shutter, no real aperture, and itty-bitty sensor can do what a DSLR can do with real, big lenses made of real optical glass with real apertures and optical zoom, a camera body with a real shutter, and a relatively huge sensor to capture more texture and detail. Phone cameras can get stunning photos and videos for looking at on phones and web browsers. But if the goal is \u2018photography\u2019 and the images are to be printed or shown on a big, 4K screen, it\u2019s harder to get imagery that somebody wants to pay for, or an aficionado would appreciate, with the camera in a phone. I want both the phone with a good camera, and the DSLR, and I don\u2019t see a phone overtaking my DSLRs in my lifetime, as an elder geek. Maybe your experience will differ\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The question can be answered in two ways, technically and aesthetically. So as others have stated very well the sensor of a smartphone will not match the imaging horsepower of a DSLR. The ability of the smartphone camera to almost instantly capture a clear, well exposed and for a majority of purposes useful image have reached a point where they do equal and surpass a conventional DSLR. In my case I have used Canon and Nikon DSLR in my work. I also use Iphone 4S/5/5s, Lumia 640s and Moto G 2nd Gen. The IPhone will almost always capture the cleanest color of any imaging tool I use without any further software modification to it. Apple\u2019s software for their camera do provide some edge in my devices. So in this narrow viewpoint for me they have reached parity with DSLRs. In that I can use the Iphone to take a photo that can be used in most any editorial context for both print and digital formats. One other aspect of the smartphone is that it teaches one to see in a simpler window. You have one lens that is fixed, no zooming, you work with what you have to get the best image and in that you look sometimes look a little harder at composition with one set lens than you do if you have a zoom on your camera (or now phone). Finally getting better than DSLRs in what purpose-I should have asked this first. There are more images being captured now than anytime before so for photography (the act of capturing an image with a camera) smartphones have bested most devices before them in allowing most everyone to have a camera in their pocket.

            "answer_text": "\u201cDo flagship smartphone cameras perform close to the DSLR or even better?\u201d No way. The small sensor of smartphones capture terrible images. Abysmal dynamic range and egregious noise, they\u2019re completely unusable. The trick is that they capture many images in quick succession with different exposures, and then clever software stacks them together, creating a final image with acceptable dynamic range and noise. It\u2019s probably more accurate to say that the picture is drawn by the image processing software based on the information collected by the sensor. This works pretty well with well-illuminated scenes with no deep shadows and highlights, with low dynamic range. However it completely fails if any of the conditions are not fulfilled. Look at this:  She\u2019s not a distorted monster, just a beautiful small girl in a swing. She moved during the expositions. The camera software failed to recognize the movement and stacked together different scenes. The result is embarrassing. The camera SW attempted to draw further eyes and mouth on her face. I almost see the software struggling with the mismatch between sensor data of different exposures. Any, again, any 15 years old DSLR, with the shittiest lens that can be attached, would capture a razor sharp, perfect image under these circumstances. So would most compact/bridge cameras, and of course SLT/MILC too. Even old film cameras would have no difficulties at all. They capture the light between the opening and closing of the shutter, and that\u2019s it. No stacking. Only one, perfect shot. The mighty iPhone from 2 years back miserably failed, and so would all smartphone cameras. They do photography in a different way, and that not always works. The laws of physics cannot be defeated.

            "answer_text": "No. The 2 spects that contribute the most to image quality are sensor size and lense design. DSLRs have much larger sensors, which allows them to be less noisy in low light or at fast shutter speeds. Lenses on smartphones aren't remotely comparable to even crappy kit lenses. The technology and precision in today's Canon L, Nikkor, Leitz, Zeiss, and Sigma lenses versus the mass produced plastic cover over a smartphone sensor would be like comparing the third fastest sprinter from a high school track team to an F-14 Tomcat with full afterburners. This isn't to say that smartphone cameras aren't wonderful; they are awesome for web images. They fall drastically short whenever you try to print them in large sizes. If you plan on printing 11\u2033 x 14\u2033 or larger, a DSLR in the hands of a competent operator will yield much better results. ",

            "answer_text": "What's better, smartphone cameras or DSLR cameras? This link will show you the relative sizes of DSLR sensors compared to cellphone sensors. The cell phone sensor is the smallest one. Compare digital camera sensor sizes: 1\u2033-Type, 4/3, APS-C, full frame 35mm The bigger the sensor, the larger the pixels relative to other sensors that are smaller with the same number of pixels. Larger pixels let in more light. So assuming that the cell phone and the DSLR are using current tech, the DSLR has a huge, actually an insurmountable, advantage over the cell phone. Note that even the micro 4/3 sensor, much smaller than the full-frame and APS-C sensors used in DSLRs, is many times the size of the cell phone sensor. I will say that today\u2019s cell phones take very good video by any standard of comparison. I will say that they take good \u201cselfies\u201d for quick sharing and other web use. I will say that Apple, Samsung, and other companies have extremely advanced jpeg engines and get as much out of their tiny sensors as humanly possible, and that in daylight conditions they do good work. I will say that better photos are always taken with the camera you have with you than the one you left at home, and your cell phone camera is the one you will always have with you. And I will say that the tech is moving fast, and that cell phone cameras get better every year. I will say all these things, and they are all true. But any tech that gives a cell phone camera better image quality can give a DSLR better quality, too. So all other things being equal, cell phones are good and getting better, but right now, today, they are no match for the larger sensors of the DSLR cameras, and nothing that will make them as good is presently on the horizon.

Manufacturers are trying to counter these two shortcomings by means of the following: Multiple camera sensors: in order to increse the amount of light captured to generate an image, many manufacturers are using multiple sensors and then processing a single output from all the sensors input. Similarly, shallow depth of field has been mimicked in past to achieve bokeh effect. Interchangeable lenses is also mimiked using this with certain restrictions.Image processing and AI: If you have been following smartphone photography then you might be knowing the amount of hype Pixel smartphones have created when it comes to still photography, that is where Google utilizes it's AI prowess.Finally, if you consider the fact that you are naturally carrying a camera in your smartphone, whereever you go, and thus never need to worry about carrying any other device, in that manner a smartphone is a better camera.

Second, smartphone cameras typically only have a single focal length lens, and even the few that have two lenses have nothing like the range of even a moderate zoom lens, or of a couple of prime lenses. Sensor size is the big one. It shows up especially once lighting gets dimmer than outdoors sunlight, or cloudy bright. The problem is noise, and the ultimate limiting factor is the quantized nature of light. Modern sensors are so advanced in their technology that you really do run up against physical limits if you want to take a picture in poor light with a reasonably short shutter speed. Modern smartphone cameras are fantastically good: provided the wide angle of view they provide is appropriate, in good light they are pretty much as good as the 35mm cameras most people used in film days. But even with a good light shot, if you look at the image in full screen on a modern monitor you will probably see a difference between a smartphone picture and one made with a bigger sensor, though more in evenness of tone than sharpness of detail. Once the light gets murky, it\u2019s obvious. ",

            "answer_text": "Adding to the answers given by Parul, Rahul and Alok, since the technological advances would benefit smartphones as well as cameras, it would be highly unlikely that smartphones would beat DSLR's. At best they might produce pictures that are close and hard to differentiate from a DSLR photo by most people.  The quality of an image depends on the sensor technology as well as the sensor size. This is mainly why the professionals go for full frame DSLR's though the DSLR's with smaller sensors too are quite capable. People serious about photography do not mind the size of a camera. But the problem with smartphones is that everyone wants a slim, pocketable device and with larger sensors, a small device becomes a big challenge. The devices like the Lumia 1020 have been criticized in many reviews for their size and the hump over the camera, though it was the first smartphone to have optical image stabilization (please correct me if I'm wrong). Also the processors on the smartphones have to take care of a lot of stuff, while on cameras the processors can be designed to best tackle image processing, thus resulting to a better performance. Then would come the issue of the power consumption associated with the sensors and processors capable of better images and again the size of the device will matter here as the larger DSLR's can accommodate larger batteries as compared to smartphones.

One thing the two professions/hobbies have in common is an appreciation for good optics. The biggest asset for both professions is light gathering power. The larger the objective opening on a lens, the more light you get. The more light you get, the more options you have with what to do with it. For that reason alone, smart phone cameras will never be as good as a DSLR. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can get great pictures with your phone. You won\u2019t be shooting things that are high speed with a big zoom lens though (like sporting events). Where smartphone cameras have an edge though is in editing software. You can take a picture, edit it, and send it to someone almost immediately. There\u2019s no downloading to do. Smart phone apps can also allow for easy effects while taking pictures that DSLRs do not. There are upsides to both. When I\u2019m traveling I have my DSLR and smartphone handy for pictures. They both serve different roles. ",

Still, the iPhone 7s Plus trumped our DSLR in certain low-light pictures, such as shot, and when taking video.  That doesn't mean everyone should run out and buy a DSLR, though. What's really important is to decide what kind of photographer you want to be. For snapping quick, easily sharable pics that look good, a solid smartphone could be all you need. But if you really care about quality, and want to push your skills and photos even further, you're better off with a DSLR or high-quality mirrorless camera. Source-tomguide.com ",

But I agree with Dave Haynie below\u2026 old DSLRs dont stand a chance against today\u2019s smartphone and that is because sensor technology at that time wasnt matured enough. I have had a fujifilm dSLR (finePix S1 Pro) which at that time was only about 3MP. It was bulky and I\u2019d never use it once I\u2019ve had my 18MP Canon DSLR. I\u2019ve had it for almost 2 decades before I sold it to a fella who\u2019s collecting old stuff. This is not to say though that quality depends on Megapixels\u2026 I have demonstrated to my colleagues how a 0.3 MP shot from a modern DSLR is still better compared to a 40mp shot from a high end smartphone camera in low light. Modern dSLRs have much better sensors than an old DSLR from 2 decades ago\u2026 same goes with Smartphones of today, they\u2019d simply beat the devil out of any old gen smartphones. In my opinion, while smartphones may reach the level of older gen DSLRs, DSLRs will keep improving as well. There is always going to be a gap unless smartphones use a bigger or more effective sensor. Right now smartphones rely on 2 main things to make their photos better, post processing (including interpolation etc) and AI. A DSLR does not need to employ AI (though it certainly can) because a DSLR is all about manual control. I have used a smartphone for the majority of my non professional shoot and I loved them. I know their limitations so I\u2019ve learned to stop pixel peeping. Just so you know I am not yet using an AI capable smartphone (ive been using LG V20) and If I have to I would disable AI anyway as I believe it will rob me of full manual control of my shots. ",

A large sensor means that each sensel (individual sensor element) can collect more photons. That combination means that, for any given light level, the dSLR will require less amplification to produce a well-exposed image. And less amplification means less noise. Examples of \u2018good\u2019 images from phone cams are invariably Shot in lots of light.Smoothed to extreme amounts to remove noise, and obliterating detail.Displayed so small that image faults are minimised.Try taking a photo at dusk, with natural light, and printing it at A2. The dSLR image will (if shot by somebody who knows how to use it) look a hell of a lot better than the same image from a phone-cam Any technological improvements (like better sensitivity in sensors) can also be applied to dSLRs. So they will always keep those advantages of physical size. ",

As a result the development will be faster, the usage will be more widespread, there is more money for making it better. It really does not matter for most of us that the DSLRS are making Some of the photos better. Smartphone photos (And videos) are cheaper and good enough for most cases. - The DSLRs and classical cameras have a big advantage, bigger optics, so the originating optical resolution is bigger and better. But the manufacturers of DSLRs and cameras are somewhat slow. The phone manufacturerse do wonders version by version. Picture and video quality is a result of optics, mechanics and all the hardware and software transformations resulting in the photo and video files. The light source inside a DSLR is better, but the final results, pictures and videos are not so bad from the phones. Some other aspects before defining an answer: Price also matters. It is an extra cost to buy a DSLR camera. The phone is always there with us. Most of the people are satisfied by somewhat worse quality. The main target is the internet for us. We rarely want to make poster size printouts from our photos where quality would really matter. It needs bigger storage to store bigger resolution photos and videos. As a result DSLRs are becoming a niche market, mainly for photographers not for ordinary folks or hobbyists. if you do not want poster size printouts, the phone photos and videos are already good enough.

My Sony RX100 is not far in quality to the last generation of APS-C DSLRs, so not the cutting edge but not far off, plus you get the usability that phone users expect (plus they connect to your phone so you can publish via social media etc). If you want the best image quality via a pocketable camera that also doesn\u2019t impose the expense of separate lenses yet allows a decent optical zoom range and all the connectivity you expect with a phone, go for an advanced compact.

In a lens that size, you run into diffraction problems when you get smaller. Now, if they start improving on the size of sensor in cell phones, we might start seeing bigger lenses with larger focal lengths that have better optical quality. One of the reasons Apple doesn\u2019t go past 12 Megapixels is likely because the lenses used won\u2019t resolve much more detail than that anyways. And in any case, fake apertures look much worse than real ones, especially where people wear glasses and light doesn\u2019t blend a persons hair well with background. Real cameras do the job for real, phones have to fake it with software, and that\u2019s a pretty tall order that in my opinion, they fail at 9 out of 10 times. ",

If you want to choose for yourself prime lenses, or zoom lenses with high resolution, and so on, you will need a camera with interchangable lenses.  If you don't want to lug  around 30 lbs of camera equipment in a backpack, then the camera in your hand is probably a cell phone. They're doing pretty well. But just consider the optics and light-gathering capability of that tiny lens. Pitiful... But a real artist may choose to make art with virtually any tool. There is indeed a genre of phone photography.Likewise there is a genre of \"toy camera\" art, one subcategory is pinhole cameras with no lens or shutter at all; another subcategory is specific very cheap cameras, notably the Holga. Check out this website:http://microsites.lomography.com/holga/ Images like that prove that its not the camera that makes the art, it's the artist. Here is a phone photographer/abstract painter whose work I particularly admire:http://marlene-burns.artistwebsites.com/art/all/j+hotography/all In summary, the camera is merely a tool. It is they vision and skill of an artist that makes for great photography.  Artists usually prefer \"better\" tools. But a $30,000 large format digital camera is out of my reach, so a full frame DSLRCanon 5D mk III with an appropriate lens is my preferred camera when I am looking to create art. It took/takes a strong effort to put/keep that camera in my hand, but for me, the results are worth it.   ",

Complicated answer: From the camera manufacturers\u2019 point of view, they will have a hard time selling their product if a multi-purpose tool can replace their specialized cameras. The camera manufacturers do have a few advantages. Size and weight is not a major concern. Nobody buys DSLRs and put it in their pocket. The design expectation is also different. People do not want too many buttons on a smartphone. On a camera, you do need more controls literally at your fingertips. DSLR are usually designed for add-ons and other accessories. Most smartphones are not designed for camera accessories. (Please don\u2019t bring up smartphone lens attachments.)  Crimson Sunbird. Zero chance of catching it on my smartphone. With my smartphone, I am usually more sanguine. I can always walk closer to the subject. Or take another picture. Or just shrug and look for another subject. That is also why smartphone cameras in advertisement are shown taking larger animals like deers and not birds.  Laced Woodpecker (Female) Bigger bird but poorer smartphone picture. I had a Samsung Zoom which had a 10X optical zoom but the images are not great. (Or I needed bigger subjects) Beats smartphones with digital zoom.  Paddyfield Pipit. Similar size to the Woodpecker. About the same distance but taken with a Samsung Zoom. There are also telephoto len attachments from Kodak and Sony for smartphones. The fact is that those attachments are not pocket sized. Smartphone cameras are destroying the market for simple point and shoot cameras. Or cameras with poor zoom range. ",

Or perhaps I should say larger-sensor mirrorless cameras are, because I\u2019m not sure DSLRs have that much of a future. Basically, with comparable technology, physics makes a larger sensor nearly always win. Physics favors larger lenses too. Thus, smaller sensors and lenses will probably always lag behind larger contemporaries in image quality. However, much of how phone cameras do so well is by using computational photography methods to make images look nice. Some, but not all, of that niceness is completely hallucinatory: the small sensor provided partial information about the scene appearance and computation basically made-up the rest. With a larger sensor, you can get better information about the scene appearance and thus produce an image that might not be prettier, but more accurately captures the true appearance of the scene. ",

Serious cameras need manual controls for creativity and at least currently a camera doesn\u2019t know what you are thinking as far as what the shot should look like. With smart phones you point, shoot and hope the phone guessed right. The other thing the phones are lacking is large aperatures, interchangeable lenses and large aperature. These things simply won\u2019t fit on something that fits in your pocket. We will either need some totally new technology or a rethinking of what a cell phone should be. I could see a camera that happens to be a cell phone where the camera is optimized and it also has smart phone features.

Because the way smartphone cameras are improving rapidly with the same speed DSLRs and Mirrorless Cameras are also growing rapidly by adding new technologies. So we can conclude that smartphone cameras can never catch up the DSLRs and Mirrorless. With the passing time DSLRs and Mirrorless Cameras will aslo improve.New technologies will be added which will easily defeat a smartphone camera. Thank you Have nice day ",

He surprised me by saying \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cthey can, already\u201d.

            "answer_text": "After taking a picture in a DSLR and a phone camera, you can view the image in 100% crop (viewing in original size). The issue with phone cameras, as they claim these days as powered with AI, the image still shows blemishes and even noise in low ISO. While the DSLR image, at minimum ISO, produce sharp image, with no notable blemishes or noise. If a phone camera can produce a sharp image (sharp equally at centre, edges and corners), without any blemishes or noise, then we can say that phones can produce DSLR quality photographs. This is not going to happen as size of sensor plays a major role in handling noise and sharpness of image. Sensors in DSLR are half the screen size of phones. If phones are going to carry such size of sensor, it will obviously reach or surpass the DSLR quality of photographs, while the phone will not be portable as they look now. ",

Digital zoom works by cropping a portion of the image and then enlarging it to the required size - it adversely affects image quality. With optical zoom, the glass elements inside the lens move to enlarge the view of a distant object without disturbing the size of the image. Optical zoom also provides you with more control of the relationship of the subject to the background or other subjects in the frame. ",

What about depth of field? Well, we already see it happening, it\u2019s just a matter of few years when artificial depth of field will become as real as a real thing produced by quality lens.

A large sensor (any DSLR has a large sensor compared to a phone), expressed in square millimeters, allows things that no megapixel count can compensate for on the small sensors of phones. What phones could start doing is using computing power to emulate some aspects of that - and they are starting to, actually. They can use algorithms to simulate bokeh in a portrait, for example. All in all, the limits of computing power in phones are being repelled further with every iteration of flagship phones, as you so nicely put it - the laws of physics are a lot more difficult to overcome. And I am not even starting to think of the size of zooms\u2026 There is one semi-forgotten attempt - or two - at making phones with big sensors. The fact that they are actually almost forgotten speaks volumes about the lack of interest for real photographic capabilities for smartphones in the general public! Those attempts were (or still are?) the Samsung S4 Zoom and the Panasonic Lumix CM-1. Google them up and think about having one in your pocket, and you\u2019ll know why I am happy to have a small phone in my pocket that can snap a quick picture and a big DSLR for when it\u2019s necessary!

So the compact camera users started using phone cameras. that is all. That segment would probably not have bought DSLRs anyway.

The film industry should shoot films using smartphone by then. It's never going to happen because when you are concerned about quality, the sensor size should be bigger, the better. Noise in the sensor during low light is the biggest enemy. My APSC sensor DSLR has much better dynamic range and colour reproduction than any of the top notch smartphone. ",

If you\u2019re just taking snaps in decent lighting that you will only ever view on a screen, then a smartphone camera is fine. Up to a certain size, the photos can be printed quite well too.

The photography style was changed a lot since the year 2016 - as per survey the camera sales was 35% down, showing 12% on DSLR and Mirrorless 4% followed by 10% decrease each year. The photography industry shy away starting from the compact camera sales then the decrease in the photo studios in each town centre's especially from the heart of the city. This is not because of the number of photographers. Anyone with a smart phone is a photographer, nowadays, who has no intension of printing those photographs though there was no need of external assistance to print photos - a printer and paper can solve it. In one word smart phones will replace DSLR like the capability of simple computation by smart phone, eg. E-mail. ",
