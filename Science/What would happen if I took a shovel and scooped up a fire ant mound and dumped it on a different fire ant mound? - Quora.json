            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll have a lot of angry ants trying to crawl up your shovel and pant legs. Generally, actually different mounds are far enough apart that getting a shovel-full of one mound onto another mound is going to be a losing race against the ants making it up the shovel and ruining your diabolical plan to use them as foot-soldiers in your crusade against their cousins. And their cousins aren\u2019t going to make things easy for you either. However, if you actually manage to pull it off, you stand a sporting chance of having one hive wipe out the other. Generally it will be the ones that got shoveled who will die, but they\u2019ll at least do a fair amount of damage to the other hive. It\u2019s theoretically possible that both queens will die, a double knockout. But usually only the queen in the shoveled hive will be vulnerable (if you got her at all). Unfortunately, fire ants occasionally have the ability to form super-hives containing multiple related queens. If you\u2019ve got fire ant mounts in walking distance of each other, they\u2019re probably closely related enough for this to be actually pretty likely. In which case, they\u2019ll first do their best to ruin your day, then once you\u2019ve retreated they might just get along with each other like the long-lost relatives they are. A multi-queen hive tends to remain a multi-queen hive, meaning it doesn\u2019t eventually die out when the queens reach their life-span limit but instead continually expands by having successive generations of queens take over. In theory, eventually the cooperation will break down as one strain of queens begins to exploit the rest by producing more queens than workers/soldiers, but in practice it seems the ants born from the other queens tend to notice this happening and nip it in the bud.

            "answer_text": "Interesting. I shall have to try that sometime. Then I\u2019d have to wait until the following day to go back for my shovel. Contrary to some answers here, it is possible to shovel up a mound without getting stung (much). The world\u2019s biggest fire ant expert (I think) is Dr. Walter Tschinkel at Florida State University, one of my former professors and now the author of this hefty book.  He invented the technique of making molds of fire ant nests with molten aluminum.  You can now buy these as table lamps and other pieces of decor.  Tschinkel writes in The Fire Ants of him and his graduate students shoveling fire ant mounds up into plastic bins. If I remember correctly, the upper few inches of the bin is greased or coated in some way to keep the ants from swarming up and over the sides. If I try it, I will wear long plastic gloves taped to a long-sleeved shirt, and be quick about it. I have so many mounds here in the summer that it shouldn\u2019t be hard to scoop one up into a 5 gallon utility pail, snap a lid on it, and go release these onto another mound some distance away (to minimize possible kinship between mounds).
