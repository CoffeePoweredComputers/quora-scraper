            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t. Metal detectors are there to detect metal. Gold is a metal. The metal detector will detect it. Why do you need to protect your gold? The metal detectors won\u2019t hurt it and unless you\u2019ve got a lot of it the chances are your bag will just pass right on through without triggering any questions. If you\u2019ve got thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of it then you\u2019ll probably be legally required to declare it anyway. If you\u2019re worried about other passengers knowing that you\u2019ve got it, the metal detectors don\u2019t scream out and mark your bag as the one to steal. Chances are nobody will take much interest in it, unless there\u2019s a huge amount of it. I travelled through US airport security with a couple of rolls of silver coins. I put them in the tray and threw my vest over the top. The agent operating the scanner asked about them, I said I had a couple of rolls of silver coins and he didn\u2019t even ask to see them, just waved me on my way. ",

That being said, the gold cannot remain in your pocket, when going through. Firstly on X-Ray (don\u2019t know which airports have them) it would look like a black hole and certainly have weight to it. \u2192 But beyond all that it will make the metal detectors go wild!!! Thus, to get through ALL gold will need to be put in a change bin and run through the x-Ray machine just like your carry on bag/s. Thanks! 3njoy C- ",

There is no reason to \u2018protect\u2019 your gold from a metal detector. It is not going to steal it. All a metal detector does is detect metal. If you mean you want to hide it from the detector, the only sure fire way is to not have your gold pass through the metal detector. Some ways to do that could be shipping the gold separately, putting it into baggage, or maybe explain to security and be searched in private. Randy ",

The only way you can shield gold\u2019s conductivity is by putting it into a more conductive container. but that will be detected by the security device and will be subject to manual inspection. I travel a lot and always buy gold coins on my trips. I put them with a bag of other \u2018normal\u2019 coins and happily put that through the metal detector . Just lose your paranoia! ",

Large amount of gold will need multiple flights and probably make it financially unviable. Meantime, you might want to give consideration to the possibility that a customs officer may be reading your question and how to convince them you were only asking hypothetical question. ",
