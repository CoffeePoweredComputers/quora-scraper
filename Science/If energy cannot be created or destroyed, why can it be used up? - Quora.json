            "answer_text": "You must be knowing a quote \u201cHalf knowledge is dangerous to health.\u201d You need to proceed further and understand the concept of Second Law of Thermodynamics as well. 1st Law of TD is about conservation of energy and that energy can only be transformed from one form to another, but can never be created or destroyed. It is the quantitative analysis of energy of a system. 2nd Law of TD, however, emphasizes more upon the qualitative analysis of energy of a system. That\u2019s when the concepts of anergy and exergy come into picture. Even if the system has 100 Joules of energy, say only 80J can be actually converted into useful mechanical work. Talking about the discussion you have mentioned below the question. Batteries work on chemical energy principle where a chemical product is formed after certain usage limit and the battery although containing energy in terms of chemical products.Living beings when get old or on their deathbed loose continuous heat (the easiest way of energy dissipation) and since their body cannot convert more of chemical energy of food into useful work and heat, they die eventually.Universe is ever expanding and its average entropy is also increasing continuously due to every process/activity. So, whatever energy it is losing while expansion must be getting compensated with increasing entropy, increasing temperature, etc. Now, I hope that you know entropy is the randomness or disorderly manner of energy of any system.Running out of energy does not mean that the mass of the system has also been destroyed. Every mass has the tendency to absorb and retain energy in terms of its internal energy. It only means out of the total energy, some energy is used to perform mechanical work, some will be lost to surrounding and some will be regarded as unavailable energy.",

            "answer_text": "Note, in the process of fusion, two atoms join to make a third and release a little bit of energy. So strictly speaking energy is being created in the sense that matter is being converted to energy. But, at the end of the day, energy can be created and destroyed but some combination of matter/energy really does stick around. Yet, eventually, our ability to do useful work from that energy will be gone, even though the energy is still there. Ultimately, that is the result of the second law of thermodynamics. Think of the second law of thermodynamics as saying that everything tends toward equilibrium. That can be a simple process whereby you put an ice cube in hot water and, eventually, the hot water cools while the ice heats up until they are both the same temperature. A battery stores energy in the form of molecules and releases some of the energy to electricity and some to heat. That heat energy doesn\u2019t disappear but it gets dissipated into the environment in a way that makes it difficult to extract again. The atmosphere, eventually, gets a tiny fraction of a degree warmer than it was before as that energy gets spread out and shared among all the air molecules in the atmosphere. Eventually, when the universe is in equilibrium (and everything is the same temperature), we will be entirely unable to get that energy back to do useful work at all. But it will be there somewhere.
