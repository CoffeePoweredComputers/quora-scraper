            "answer_text": "At the very simplest, every author is paid a portion of the sale of each copy of their book(s). This portion is called a royalty. It starts getting interesting from here\u2026 Below are very basic explanations. But they should give you a foundation of understanding on the subject. In traditional publishing contracts, there are a lot of variations\u2014especially if your books turn out to be particularly popular. It is very important to keep in mind that as a writer, you are self-employed. You are not an employee of the publisher who takes you on. You are an independent contractor who creates product that the publisher will then distribute. Traditionally Published Authors Initially you are paid an Advance. As the name implies, an advance is an advance royalty payment ahead of sales of your book. The publisher knows you have to put food on the table, make bill payments, buy clothes, etc., while you work on your second book. So they give you a check based on their estimate of how many copies they figure your book will sell at the least. Most publishers are pretty good at estimating this. Then your book is released. Because you were already paid an advance on the first X,000 copies to be sold, you won\u2019t receive any royalty payments until your book sells copy X,001. If your book proves to be popular and it actually reaches that point, it will have earned out. This means it sold enough copies to generate enough returns that it covered the advance royalty they paid you at the beginning. Now you start receiving royalty payments. Most authors expect to be paid quarterly by their publishers. (Again, this schedule depends on your contract with the publisher.) So, every quarter, you will receive a check for all the royalties your book earned during the previous quarter. What you are paid depends on the contract and the agreed rate with the publisher. A really good rate is 15% of the net profit. Keep in mind, that is not 15% of the list price of the book, it is 15% of the net profit from the wholesale price. That means you are getting roughly 3% of the list price of the book. Again, it depends on what is in the contract. If you don\u2019t understand those numbers, I strongly suggest you do some studying about how retail sales work and the book sales industry. Independent Authors (Self-published) YOU are the publisher on top of being the author. Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, and others are NOT your publisher. They are retailers. Do not allow yourself to be confused! Depending on the terms the retailer offers, your royalty is a portion of the list price you set. The most common format that books are sold by independent authors is the ebook. For ebooks, most often this royalty share is 70%. (Some retailers charge \u201cdelivery fees\u201d that drop this to 68%. Some only charge 65% share. Pay attention to their terms before you jump in.) So, if you set your ebook to be sold at $4.99 and your share is 70%, then your royalty for each copy sold will be $3.49. Most retailers pay out royalties 60 days from the close of the sales month. This means if you sold 1,000 copies in January, then you will receive a check for the sales proceeds on April 1st. If you choose to make your book available in print through Print On Demand (POD) services, your share of the sales proceeds will be much smaller than 70% because the retailer is assuming the costs of paper, ink, energy, and maintenance on the machine that does the printing towards printing your book. Whatever is left over is the net profit, and you will get a share of that. WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! Before you get too excited looking at 70% vs. 3% of the list price, self-publishing vs. traditional publishing, keep in mind that as an independent author, you are the publisher!!!! This means that you have to front all the costs of producing your manuscript by paying for editing, cover art, advertising, and any other costs that come up related to production of a manuscript and distribution of your book. Plus, you will in no way sell as many copies as an independent as will a publishing company. You just don\u2019t have all the contacts and channels that a trade publisher has. You can build up these contacts and networks over time, especially if you turn out to be a popular author. But a publisher has these already in place. It will take you years to reach that point. Self-publishing is a marathon, not a sprint. If you don\u2019t have the wherewithal to stick it out for several years of work before seeing meaningful returns, it is best you take the easier route and find a publisher to take you on. ",

            "answer_text": "Money! Every writer's dream! I sold my novel A Kill in the Morning to a major publisher, Transworld for a rumoured million dollars.[1] This is how it happened and how I got paid.  The Process A commissioning editor at the publishers was interested in my book.He took a proposal to buy the book to the acquisitions committee.The acquisitions committee agreed to buy the rights to the book.The editor offered me an advance in return for rights to the book.I agreed in principle to sell the rights.The editor then negotiated the details of the contract with my agent.Most of the contract terms were standard boilerplate.The negotiation concerned the schedule.When my agent and the editor agreed the contract, the publishers and I signed it.I got my signing advance. When the book is published I will get a further advance called a publication advance.As the book sells, a percentage of the price is notionally assigned to me. If that money adds up to more than the advance then the book \u2018earns out\u2019 and I start getting royalties.All the italicised terms are explained in my Guide to Literary Contracts, but here are the most relevant ones: Rights When you write a book, the copyright is automatically yours \u2013 you own it and no one else can legally copy or publish it. What the publisher buys off you when you sign a contract is the right to publish the book, usually in specific countries, called territories. Advance This is the money the publisher pays up front for the right to publish the book. It is often split into a signing advance, paid when the contract is completed, and a publishing advance, paid when the book goes on sale. Sometimes there are other advances based on targets the publisher sets, like delivering the manuscript, or winning a prize. Subsidiary Rights These are the rights that are bought by the publisher and then sold on. For example, the right to produce: A serialisation of your novel in a newspaper or magazine.A Book Club edition.An audio book based on your novel.A translation of your novel into a foreign language.An edition of your novel specific to a territory, like a US Edition.When the publisher sells the subsidiary rights it generates more money for everyone, not just the publishers. The percentages used to split the money are contained in the schedule and negotiated between the agent and editor. The split percentages vary, but are often in the 50:50 or 60:40 range. Royalties Every copy of the book sold earns the author a small percentage of the price (typically around 10% of the price, although it can vary). If the book is sold at a discount then the percentage can drop. This is defined as price received, rather than the official published price. Earning Out Initially, the money the author earns in royalties is set against the money the author has already received as an advance. If at some point the amount earned in royalties exceeds the amount paid as an advance then the author starts to get paid more. This is called earning out. Most books don\u2019t earn out. NB: The author does not have to pay the advance back if the book fails to earn out. Actually getting paidThe publisher pays the various advances and royalties in the contract to your agent. The agent takes their cut (typically 10-15%) and transfers the remaining money to you. Here's what that glorious moment looks like:  Yay! Free Money! More DetailsI go through the whole process of selling a book and getting a contract in my Guide to Literary Contracts, which includes some of the weirder clauses you need to know about, like the Reversion Clause.  I know that's the rumour, because I started it. It was a lot less really. The figures in the picture aren't real either :-)",

            "answer_text": "It depends and varies from one publisher to another. Amazon used to send me a personal check every time my royalties exceeded a certain threshold. Now they are paying me 70% of each sale as it happens and the money is instantly deposited in my bank account. I really love that deal! Many other Ebook publishers pay on the threshold basis, usually somewhere between $75 - $100 in royalties and a payment is sent. I also publish on Smashwords. They used to have a threshold but now have also gone to immediate deposits for each book when it sells. In their case the money is deposited into a special PayPal account the author must make for this purpose. I\u2019m not crazy about PayPal but I can withdraw that money and put it into a bank. I know some print publishers calculate and pay royalties at the end of each calendar quarter, sort of like stock dividends. The percent of the book cost an author gets as a royalty varies widely. Big name print publishers who agree to take on a new author typically pay only 10%. Small publishers such as Wiley pay a bigger percent but their authors will sell fewer books. Big name best selling authors can negotiate their royalties and might get as much as 20%. Print on demand publishers such as Createspace tend to pay a generous percent (like 70%) of the MARGIN left AFTER they cover their printing cost and give themselves an undisclosed amount of profit out of the book. This portion is typically 80 -90% of the book\u2019s sales price. As you can see, print on demand is the worst of all deals for an author. For one thing, Createspace will do absolutely nothing to help sell the book. They are not a retail site \u2014 they only print books. Finally, we should talk about returns. Big name print publishers sell your books to brick and mortar stores. You get royalties from these sales BUT, if the store doesn\u2019t sell all of the books, the unsold ones are destroyed and accounted for as returns, which means the store gets money back from the publisher and the publisher will subtract that amount from your future royalties. I hope this answers your questions. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a combination of both; advances & royalties. However, having said that, let me clarify since the conditions have massively changed: If you\u2019re a first-time writer of a Commercialized Fiction OR Literary Fiction; you need to first secure a Literary Agent who \u201crepresents\u201d your work; here \u201cwork\u201d represents a detailed 3,000\u20134,000 word Synopsis with a full character set portrayal as well. He/she will use her leverage / connect / charm / influence; whatever you desire calling it to connect with the leading Publishing Houses to get your work selected. If all rejects; then you\u2019re on your own. Your advance goes down the drain. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a great first hit; or an accomplished author deserving merit; the amounts that they receive before they have written a single word, is simply mind boggling. E.g. Vikram Seth after his first epic novel, A Suitable Boy which became a raging phenomenon and a massive hit globally; made him a millionaire just owing to royalties. However, he received an amount of GBP 500,000 as \u201cadvance amount\u201d for An Equal Music, and a whopping amount of GBP 1,700,000 (i.e. GBP 1.7 Million) for his next novel, yet to be released, A Suitable Girl (from Hamish Hamilton). However, latest news mentioned that since Seth has still not finished the manuscript in 2017; when he was supposed to finish and get the book published by 2013 (i.e. 5 years ago); he has been asked by the publishers to return the cheque of GBP 1.7 Million. In fact, Penguin went through a phase wherein 12 top authors were sued one after another; all of them having pocketed massive sums of money; without producing a single sentence of course (Source).Which brings me to the second point, \u201croyalties\u201d based on number of Editions printed. The Literary agent usually brokerages this deal for an author; for a first-time published author; needless to say, the Publishing House will always push for a minimum percentage. On the other hand, critically acclaimed authors could push for a very high percentage; and their entire generations could simply live off from the royalties from the books that their great-great-grandfather wrote; and so on. Finally, an author must ensure that he/she reserves the right to \u201cre-negotiate\u201d the terms of royalty after a set of 10,000 copies and so on. This is very very vital; because often Publishing Houses will try and trick the author to keep the \u201croyalty percentage\u201d to a fixed amount on the sale of x number of books; irrespective whether 10,000 copies were sold, or 1,000,000,000 copies were sold. Hence, the author ought to ensure that he/she should be able to re-negotiate the prices and get better royalty percentage if the novel really becomes a huge success globally; and he/she can sit for another round of re-negotiations after every 10,000 copies (i.e. Edition Print, as it is called in the parlance of Publishing).Hence, authors earn from both \u201cadvance payment\u201d which is becoming gradually non-existent now in the world of writing; with multiple large names and authors defaulting multiple times on their manuscripts in recent years; and hence, \u201croyalties\u201d is practically now the only source of income for authors.

            "answer_text": "Most writers get paid a royalty by the book\u2019s publisher. For example once each year I receive payment from each of two publishers for two books. Royalties are usually in the range of 8 to 12% of wholesale price, that is the price a bookshop pays, typically 33% less than the list price. I also get a small annual payment relating to the number of times my books have been accessed in public libraries. This might not apply in your country. You will have to work hard to find a publisher ready to invest the necessary money and time in publishing your work. It won\u2019t be easy to get a publishing deal and you\u2019ll be in competition with many other authors. Only celebs and known authors get an advance, this is normally an advance on your royalties and is clawed back as sales roll in. Amazon and others selling ebooks pay a greater royalty (20\u201330%) as there is no production cost, no bookshop and no delivery cost; just the web site costs. However an ebook author has to work hard simply letting the great reading public know that their book exists and is maybe worth reading. As anyone can publish a ebook, there are thousands that sell in very small numbers. There are companies who will want money from you at the start of the process. They will promise you great sales but will only actually feed your vanity by sending you enough copies of your book to please you, your mum, your dad, a few friends and your uncles and aunts. They might email a few reviewers and stick the book on Amazon. They are known as \u2018Vanity Publishers\u2019. If all you want is a few copies on your bookshelves there are short run printers who will meet that need cheaply. Sad to say of the hundreds of thousands of authors, very few got rich. Still its fun.

            "answer_text": "It actually depends.  It's not the same for everyone.  I've been paid half upon signing, and half upon turning in a book.  I've been paid nothing up front and 30% of my earnings every month (which I absolutely LOVE).  I've been paid in quarters (one quarter upon signing, one quarter upon turning in a proposal, one quarter upon turning in a book and one quarter upon publication).  I am usually paid in thirds.  It depends on the deal and the publisher.  Yes, most New York-based publishers will pay in thirds.  One third upon signing, one third upon acceptance of a proposal and one third upon acceptance of the project.  So when I sign three-book contracts, I will get two-thirds for one book (because I always sell off a proposal and therefore get my signing money and my proposal money for Book #1) and one-third of Book #2 and one-third of Book #3.  Confused yet? Because I have such an extensive backlist (32 books and counting) I receive checks all the time.  The book(s) that pay me monthly are electronic books and so I receive regular checks from them.  I also receive royalty checks from the New York-based publishers in the spring, summer and fall, but you never know how much those check will be because you never know how well your backlist is selling.  Keep in mind, that once a mass market paperback is out of print, it's gone.  It used to be that it was gone forever, but these days they exist electronically which is a boon for published authors.  You're never out of print.  Now, if you're J.K. Rowlings, your books will always exist in bookstores and so you will receive your brick and mortar sales, your electronic sales and your foreign sales on a regular bases.  Most of my backlist is out of print (as are most mid-list author's books) and so I just get electronic and foreign money on the books that have already earned out. Yes, each book must EARN OUT before you receive any money.  I routinely earn out these days because publishers know how well I will sell based on software from Nielsen Bookscan.  They compile a list of top-selling books (based on actual sales -- go figure) which is vastly different from the smoke and mirrors New York Times Bestseller list and the Publisher's Weekly Bestseller list.  Everyone in New York has access to the Nielsen list.  From there it's easy to calculate how much I am worth. A new author, traditionally published, will likely be offered payment in thirds.  There, more than you ever wanted to know or needed to know about how authors are paid.  :) Edited to add: publishers will hang on to your money for at least a year even if it earns out quickly.  Why?  Because they wait to calculate if there will be any books returned to them (called a reserve against returns) so you'll be waiting awhile for your money. ",

            "answer_text": "Advances are going down. I don't know what it is in other industries but I'll be honest about my experiences:  First Book: Wiley, $5000. I more than made back the advance for them and continue to get royalty checks.  Second book: Wiley: $7500. This one also made back the advance. I get minimal royalty checks.  Third book: $30,000. I think this one sold 300 copies. That was my last book with Wiley. You are only as good as your last book. REMEMBER THAT! Fourth book: Penguin. I think when all was said and done I got about $100k. Maybe a little more. The book was titled \"The Forever Portfolio\" about stocks you should hold \"forever\". It came out in the middle of the worst financial crisis ever: December, 2008. Nobody was thinking about stocks they should hold forever. I begged them not to release it then. But it was \"on the schedule\" so they couldn't change it. I'm going to write a post over the next few days at http://jamesaltucher.com about how diseased I think the publishing industry is right now in terms of marketing, advances, timing, etc.  Fifth book: I did with a co-author with Harper collins but WSJ paid the advance. Not sure I should say what it is but a little less than 4th book and split it down the middle with co-author. better royalty arrangement though than my prior books.  Sixth book: I intend to self-publish within the next month or so.  In other areas:  a friend of mine writes GREAT fiction novels. None of his novels ever became bestsellers although a few were local (NYC) good-sellers. And he continues to publish. His advances, however, are approaching $0he told me one friend of his who got a $250k advance on a book and then her prior book came out and sales were poor. The publsh tried to reduce the advance but they couldn't. Now her next book will certainly get a much lower advance.one friend of mine gets advances in the millions but he does regular bestsellers. That said, taxes, agents, etc take a big bite so he makes money on speaking.Once spoke to a hedge fund manager who manages John Grisham's money. He says evertime Grisham comes out with a new book, another $20mm goes into the fund.Hope you can a Grisham and not a...me. ",

            "answer_text": "Contracts vary. Typically it works like this: The author gets an amount on signing the contract, and another amount on publication. These two amounts together are called the \u2018advance\u2019. After that, the author receives a small percentage from each copy of the book sold. This is called the \u2018royalties\u2019. However, the royalty payments start only after the the book has earned back its advance. Some publishers don\u2019t pay advances, and authors only get royalties. Others pay only advances (in this case, called a \u2018flat fee\u2019) and not royalties. Some books never sell enough copies to earn back the advance, so the author never receives royalties. (In this case, the author doesn\u2019t have to pay back the advance. It\u2019s the publishers loss. But the publishers probably won\u2019t publish more books by that author.) Some publishers actually charge authors for publishing books. These are the so-called \u2018vanity publishers\u2019, and it\u2019s a scam. They operate in the grey area of what is just legal but not ethical. They make their money not from selling books, but from milking gullible new writers. Advance plus royalties is the ideal arrangement, and established authors usually insist on this. Royalties only, or flat fee, are also acceptable. But vanity publishing is always bad. Don\u2019t fall for that scam. In addition, many authors these days are their own publishers, because modern technology (ebooks, print-on-demand, online sales) make this possible. This is called \u2018self-publishing\u2019 or \u2018indie publishing\u2019. Indie authors don\u2019t get advances. They get paid royalties for each book sold. The royalties are paid by the distributor (for example, Amazon). The royalties per book sold are much higher than those paid by a publisher. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Authors are paid via advances and royalties set forth in the publishing contract. Advance and Payouts \u2014 Most publishers are willing to pay authors some portion of the royalties before publication. Advances tend to be scheduled in installments. These are called \u201cpayouts\u201d and should be listed in the contract. Here are three typical payouts.Small advances \u2013 \u00bd at signing, \u00bd at publicationMedium advances \u2013 \u2153 at signing, \u2153 at delivery and acceptance of the manuscript, \u2153 at publicationLarge advances \u2013 \u00bc at signing, \u00bc at delivery and acceptance of the manuscript, \u00bc at publication (hardcover), \u00bc publication (paperback)It is important to remember that an author does not receive royalties until the advance has been recouped. The advance is an advance against royalties.Royalties - The contract will list a schedule of royalties paid as a percentage of the sale of each book for all formats. Typically there are four major formats: hardcover, trade paperback, mass-market paperback, and ebook. You will want to be clear about how the publisher calculates the royalties. There are a variety of formulas. A percentage of the retail price (or list price) is much different (and more money to the author) than a percentage of the net price (which takes into consideration any discounts given to induce a bookstore to buy the book). The basic calculation looks like this: Retail Price x Royalty Percentage x Books Sold = Author Royalty Payment. Examples of royalty percentages might be:Hardcover \u2013 10% retail price on first 5,000 copies, 12\u00bd% on the next 5000 copies, then 15% thereafter.Paperback \u2013 6-7\u00bd% of retail price. This rate can escalate like for hardcover based on the number of books sold. That mark can be 25,000 books or even 150,000, then 8%.Digital or ebooks \u2013 25% of retail price or net price (which is low if you consider the publisher does not have the standard printing and shipping costs to pay).Territory \u2014 The royalties will be based on books sold in the territories licensed in the publishing agreement. There are generally three major territories of interest.North American Rights in English \u2013 Usually this includes America, Canada, Philippines, and US Army BasesWorld Rights in EnglishWorld Rights in all other languagesSubsidiary Rights - This is another potential source of income for a writer. These are less important rights than the primary right to publish the book. The publisher can license these rights to a third-party for a license fee, or exploit them itself. Sometimes the publisher will forgo subsidiary rights, thinking the author and agent can do better at marketing them. If the publisher does license any subsidiary rights, the contract will set forth the split in the licensing fee, like 50/50 or 90/10 depending on what right is being licensed and to whom. Some subsidiary rights are:Dramatic or Performance \u2013 This covers the right to produce the work in formats like film, television, plays, and cable. Generally, an agent will reserve these rights to be sold separately to a studio or network. A publisher will still benefit when the movie enhances book sales.Audio \u2013 This covers audiobooks. Frequently these rights are licensed to multiple audio producers.Merchandising \u2013 These may not be important but it is good to be clear who controls the right to make things like t-shirts, toys, etc.Reprints/Mass-market paperbacks \u2013 Some publishers are not in the business of mass-market paperbacks and will license the rights to a trade publisher who specializes in them.First Serialization \u2013 This would be pre-publications like excerpts in newspapers, periodicals, or on-line publications to help generate interest in the book before it reaches the shelvesHope this helps.

            "answer_text": "How do we get paid? If they belong to the class of bottom feeding authors like me and a zillion others - very badly. In my early days as a writer, I courted publishers and agents and can truthfully say I did not receive a single rejection slip. That was, of course, because none of them bothered to read the synopses I sent them. I suspect most of my letters were binned by the semi-literate intern who opens the mail. I did get some interest from a couple of established epublishers (really online book sellers, not publishers in the sense of actually marketing books). These people paid a low percentage royalty of ~25% of the net i.e. cents per copy, and sold a few. Now I publish as part of a co-operative with other independent authors and get paid half-yearly because it\u2019s convenient that way. How much? I\u2019d be embarrassed to tell you. One good thing about our business model is that we are not on a production mill. Our books stay \u2018in print\u2019 all the time and when a reader chances on one, they can always go on to other titles by the same author. ",

            "answer_text": "Narrative Path's Author Studio is our attempt to answer this question (About | Narrative Path). With the publishing industry in flux at the moment, and more and more authors finding success without needing a publisher, we think that more than one new means is needed for authors to get paid. Several other answerers have provided clear details of how the process works in Traditional Publishing. But the world is changing, and there are new forms of publishing now that did not exist ten years ago. In fact, we are seeing a number of different business models, of which a few are:  self-publishing - there are several different kindsco-op publishing - authors pool their resourcesindie publishing - authors outsource everything that isn't the actual writingThere are variants of each of these and there will no doubt be more in the near future. All have the advantage that the author does not hand over rights to the book. Self-published authors have the most control and the biggest cut of the royalties, since they get whatever is leftover after the marketplace (Amazon, iTunes, etc) take their cut, but they have to spend a great deal of their time marketing and promoting, and still have to pay for some professional services like editing. Co-op publishing means that authors share the cost of some of the professional services, and in many cases, help eachother out editorially. But most importantly, they share their distribution lists for promotion. My theory is that when this works - and it doesn't always work - it is likely to be the most competitive and durable model that is also capable of consistently delivering quality books. Indie publishing varies a great deal, ranging from being a miniature version of Traditional Publishing, through exploiting detailed knowledge of new media and webmarketing, to agile tailored professional services solutions. Some indie publishers insist on a formal publishing contract so you still have to give up the rights to your work. Be ready to negotiate. Others, especially those at the professional services end of the scale, prefer that you keep full rights and full artistic control, and just take a percentage of the sales. (Narrative Path Author Studio is a little different, but you can find out more from the link above). ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the publisher. Smaller publishers only pay a royalty after sales are made and have a minimum amount to cut a check. Most smaller publishers DO NOT put print books into stores unless they are special ordered on a no return basis. They all generally go through Ingram Spark. They usually pay quarterly and the first payment will probably not come for six months, if at all. Major publishers (there\u2019s about 36 of them and they are all owned by 6 media companies (Disney, Sony, Viacom, BMG, Universal/NBC, etc.) and they only deal through agents and the agents negotiate the deal. They pay an advance against royalties, often in 3 or 4 parts. One part on signing, One part on approval of edits and maybe cover. One part after publication. It generally takes 8 to 16 months from the date of signing for the books to get into stores (only big publishers and small presses or University presses put books into stores). Then there is a 1 year hold-back for returns (the stores have a right to return unsold books for exchange or credit, you don\u2019t get paid for returned books, close out books or promotional books, you get paid less for book club pressings). Then they have a minimum amount to cut you a check. They generally pay quarterly AFTER any hold-back periods. Self-Publishing pays 30 to 90 days after the end of the month in which a sale occurs (and you can generally see a sale instantly on your self-publishing Dashboard) based on the company (smashwords pays in 30 days, Amazon 60 days, Ingram 90 days). There is a minimum for check ($25 for smashwords $100 for Amazon) but no minimum for pay pal or direct deposit to an American account (fees to foreign countries can occur based on company). The print on demand companies generally give the customer a few days to return a book, in which case even though the sale shows up on your dashboard you don\u2019t get paid for it. Most common reason for return is profanity, graphic sex, and finding the book elsewhere at a lower price (one of my books is 99 cents on Amazon as they have a minimum, but it\u2019s free elsewhere).

What authors get paid depend on a couple of factors: Their publishing model: self or traditionalThe size and generosity of their publisherMy first publisher was Mahaveer, a small barely-known house in Daryaganj. I was paid a 5k signing advance, and we agreed on a 6% royalty of the MRP, that was agreed to be Rs. 125   Sorry for the bad pictures, I was 15 and didn\u2019t have a decent phone. Over the course of my 5-year contract, I received about Rs. 1,50,000 in total royalties, based on the number of books sold. While it was a big deal for me at 16, I realized in hindsight that sales were severely under-reported due to no transparency between the publishers and writers in India. We have to take their word for this. When I turned 22, and my contract with Mahaveer expired, I decided to look around for a better publisher, and through sheer happenstance, signed a contract with Juggernaut publishers for a three book deal, including republishing my first one digitally. Here the contract was much more generous. I was given 10% royalty, and 25000 signing advance for each book (upon delivery of final manuscript). Up till a couple of months before my book deal was signed, a friend told me Juggernaut was giving an advance of 50,000 to each writer. Ah well!   ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. Publishers usually pay hefty advances only for their best-selling authors. If you are a first time author, it is extremely hard to even get a publishing contract let alone an advance. However if you prove that you have a pre-existing reader base or a market for your book, then you increase your chance of getting an advance on your contract. In most cases the advance is paid out against royalties, which means you will not receive any royalty from book sales till the advance has been recouped. Royalties paid out by traditional publishers usually vary from writer to writer. On an average they pay around 7.5% of the the cover price to the writer as royalty. Traditional publishers also need to sell a large number of copies to even recover the publishing costs for the book, hence they take most of the profits from book sales and provide a small percentage to the author as royalty. If your main concern is getting maximum profits from book sales while ensuring that you don\u2019t compromise on the quality of publishing,distribution and marketing, then you should consider getting your book published through any self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press. The royalty payout is much higher when compared to traditional publishers. In the case of Notion Press, we offer 100% of the profits from book sales as royalty to the author. ",

            "answer_text": "No author can honestly count on a publisher's advance on sales. Paying an author simply locks them to contract. If you hope your book to be a success, you should self-market. Dream up ways to direct-market your own book whether corporate or self-published. (Hints: local author, in front of the liquor store on Friday night; brochures with ordering information sent to likely venues like libraries.) Your publisher, if they're good folks, will allow you to buy cartons of your own books at top discount, 50-60% or even at cost. All that extra profit goes in your pocket with direct-marketing. Pretty satisfying, too, to beat your publisher at his own game. Another pitfall to avoid: If your books don't sell well for a few years, the publisher may wish to pulp them to save storage costs. ALWAYS write it into your contract that you be given right of first refusal for remainders and destroyed copies. ",

Author writes the book, submits to the publisher who decides the fate of it and pays the author annually a royalty amount which varies from 3-10 % of the book MRP multiplied by total number of books sold that year.True for most debut authors and the non famous one. 3. Author writes the book. Makes a partnership deal with the publisher. Gets the royalty as well as a cut in the profits. Gets an advance amount and also the profit cut if it gets to become a motion picture.True for the popular bestsellers, you know who. Deals can be different too. The ones I said cover all the major ones. It's like a pyramid. The top point is taken up by case number 3. While 1 takes up the little area beneath it, 2 is what covers the whole big thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Every contract is different, but most author royalties are driven off of a percentage of either the list price or the net sales. I've seen list royalties range from 5-15%, and know of some that have been negotiated even higher. If it were 10%, and the publisher set the price at $10.00/\u00a310.00 per book, then it's a $1/\u00a31 for every book sold (with a caveat, discussed in a moment).  A royalty based on net sales is driven off of how much the publisher gets from the retailer for each book. Since retailers get books at a discount, the rate is usually higher (I've seen anywhere from 10% - 30%). So if the rate was 20%, and the price was $10.00/\u00a310.00, and the retailer purchased books for resale from the publisher at a 50% discount rate, then again, the author would receive a dollar/pound on every book sold. The caveat to all of this is that most sales to bookstores are returnable, so the publisher will hold a portion of the sales royalty in reserve for an agreed upon length (around 3 years). After that period if the books sold to the bookstore are not returned to the publisher, then the publisher will release the reserves. ",

            "answer_text": "Authors own the copyrights to their work (or well, they should), which is then licensed to different publishers and /or distributors under various deals. E.g. first print-run publisher (traditional book publisher) will get printing / ebook rights against some downpayment + royalty (or for new writers, likely just a royalty). Then some other publisher may get audiobook rights, or translation rights for global variants, etc. The more of this author can publish himself, theoretically the larger portion of the pie he\u2019d own - but the book industry is stacked very heavily against that, unless you already have a very large audience and following. Strictly in terms of \u201chow / when they get paid\u201d - book retailers will buy from distributors to build up inventories, but keep them around for 3\u20136 months to see how sales trend and refund the unsold number of books. So the first royalty check is likely to be 6-months after publish-date because it\u2019s on nett : sell-through copies minus wasted printing costs on unsold ones (after recovering any advance they paid). The good publishers to go after would be able to sell direct-to-customer and better handle refunds. But as far as I can tell, that\u2019s nearly non-existant. ",

I have always chosen to \"roll the dice\" and take a lower royalty up-front and hope that sales will be good.  My royalty agreements have a wide variety of clauses in them.  In other words, I get more from certain uses than I do for others.  On a printed version, after a certain sales goal is reached, my royalties are usually between 12 and 15%.  But on digital versions, they are much higher (due to less up-front costs for the publisher).  If several of my books are combined into one volume, the check I get for that can be substantial.  Book deals vary widely from publisher to publisher.  I've never used an agent, but I have had lawyers look over the contracts because they're usually pretty good at spotting anything that is not in my favor.  If you're a new author, you can find some pretty good contract tips in the annual \"Children's Writers and Illustrators Markets\" book.  Another book I found to be really helpful was \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Publishing Children's Books\". ",

I'm lucky to make a living writing books, but I publish in a very specific nonfiction genre -- exercise and nutrition. Depending on your topic and your ability to reach an audience on your own, without the publisher acting as middleman, you might be able to make far more by self-publishing. Traditional publishing is a very inefficient business. It works for books like mine, where there's an audience looking for the precise product I create. But in other areas, particularly fiction, a lot of writers are finding they can publish more, publish faster, and reach their audience more directly when they control their own production by self-publishing.

            "answer_text": "Anonymous's answer is very comprehensive - it's a whole menu of different rates depending on how and where the book is sold. May I take the opportunity though to caution people in general about becoming obsessed by the percentage?  When you're getting paid royalties for a book, you get an advance against them up-front. So, let's say - completely oversimplifying things, and making up the figures - that your book sells, always, at \u00a310, that you get 10% of the RRP or \u00a31 per copy sold, and that you were paid \u00a310,000 as an advance against royalties. This implies that the publisher reckons you're going to sell about 10,000 copies in the foreseeable future. What if the book bombs and you only sold 1,000 copies? Well, you the author still have your \u00a310,000. In effect, you were paid \u00a310 per copy sold, or a 100% royalty. It's the publisher who has gambled and lost in this scenario. Let's also consider the fact that the publisher is spending significant sums on actually publishing the book. You are giving up the lion's share of the purchase price, but almost all of that money is being spent on getting the book to market (and also to build in a profit margin for the retailer - Amazon's wholesale discount is very steep.) So if a publisher tells you that they're going to pay you a whopping royalty, consider asking what they're actually going to be doing; and if it looks from a straight numerical comparison like you'd need to be bonkers not to self publish (say, 7.5% vs. 70%), it's almost always going to turn out that it's a more complex decision than the royalty percentage suggests.

I was offered six-figures for my debut series (originally written as 6 novels but sold as a 3-book deal).  When I got my second contract (for 2 books) it came back with the same \"per book\" advance - even though I eanred out in less than one year with my first book.  My publisher said \"you should consider this a good offer as most new advances going out is 50% of the last one\" - I didn't agree.  We negotiated and I ended up getting the same advance as the first series which essentially means that I got 3 times as much from my perspective (same money for 2 books that I previuosly got for 6) but from the publisher's standpoint they paid the same price for 3 books as they did for 2.

If you are a well known author you may get something called Advanced Royalties. Which is a sum you get at the time of signing and then submitting manuscript, which hopefully will support you in the writing process. For leading authors it can range in Millions of rupees. Alternatively, you can sell the full rights of your book. Then you do not get any royalties after the first installment. I am not aware of any author or publisher who has done such an arrangement. ",

Frankly I prefer to forget the advance and just get the book out in its marketplace ASAP, which is easier to do now with some of the (few and far between) hybrid publishers who don't take 6 years to take a book from typewritten manuscript to finished volume.  However I'm a fairly prolific writer (nearly 30 published/contracted books) so am earning a bit from the backlist while writing new stuff.  And James, when you write your blog post about the traditional publishing industry being 'diseased' let me know please ... I can give you several examples of that from personal experience! So far I have only self-published one eBook but certainly intend to move more into that direction in future. If I have one more exasperating experience with traditional publishers I think would slit my throat. ",

If it became a hit, they will reprint it. That\u2019s when you can get a royalty for your book. But I know a publishing company who just pay their writers based on how many sold copies of the book (which is absurd) ",

They can negotiate a much better advance than you could ever do on your own and make the publishers want the book. The only way a first time author can get a high advance is to get two publishers to want the book and essentially bid against each other. The other thing first time authors don't do well enough is to hold their own work and abilities at a high enough level. Put a financial figure on the amount of money needed to make the book worth your time and make sure your agent is aware of your needs. You, of course, risk the publisher saying no but that's part of the game. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers so far rightfully suggest that advances for most new books have decreased, but that a decent amount is still available. My understanding is that you can earn anywhere between \u00a3500 to \u00a35,000 in the U.K. for the majority of first books. If you have generated a decent amount of hype though, you can still attract five and six figure sums.  But however much you are offered, there is a good chance that you could earn a good deal more as a self-published author as you earn a greater percentage from each sale (up to 70% per books as opposed to 12.5%) and retain all the rights for your work.
