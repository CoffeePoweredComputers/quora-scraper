            "answer_text": "Great question, in fact, this is a question that many may wonder. To first understand the question, we must understand that most likely, the proton and electron count is the same. Although, when it is uneven, most likely caused from a loss or gain of an electron. In this case, six protons means it is a Carbon (C) atom, in which has gained an electron. In this case, it is defined as a Carbon Ion.
