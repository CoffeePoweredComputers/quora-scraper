            "answer_text": "Q: I'm struggling to understand the Big Bang theory. I get it as far as how it started in the first place. How did something pop up from literally nothing? A: We don\u2019t know. We are looking at the Big Bang backwards and from within. What we can see, and what Big Bang cosmology explains, is that the universe used to be a very hot very dense place, which since then has expanded to a very cold very empty place in which we live today. This is supported by evidence from cosmic redshift and cosmic microwave background, and by experiments in the lab of the extreme conditions of the early universe. We are also seeing that the expansion rate is accelerating, leading to predictions about how the universe will end eventually. Because we don\u2019t have a top-down view of this process, but look at it from the inside and after the fact, there are some horizons. One is the cosmic microwave background, which is the earliest light from the universe. It is often called the afterglow of the Big Bang. It is the afterglow of the plasma that filled the early hot dense universe, and since plasma is opaque, we cannot directly observe earlier stuff. Maybe we can observe it with gravity waves, if our gravity wave detectors get precise enough, but for the moment, any earlier observations are indirect, from studying patterns in the cosmic microwave background and from the large scale structure and what we can infer from that. And that in turn means that details get fuzzier the further back in time we go, eventually understood by theoretical physics alone The ultimate horizon is at the Planck epoch, at [math]10^{-43}[/math] seconds after the bang. Then the conditions are so extreme that physics as we know it cannot explain what happens. We would need a Theory of Everything that combines quantum mechanics and general relativity, and, well, we don\u2019t have one. Perhaps we can find it if we find a theory on quantum gravity, but we don\u2019t have one either. So we cannot predict what happened in the Planck epoch, and thus we don\u2019t know how the universe started.  There are hypotheses, of course \u2013 thought-experiments by physicists and cosmologists on how you can get a universe started, and not all of them starts from nothing. Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, for instance, takes the prediction of the end of the universe, when entropy is at maximum and nothing can ever happen again. If also protons decay and black holes evaporates, then there will only be red-shifted photons in an empty universe. Then the only frame of reference will be that of photons who because of special relativity \u2013 in their reference frame \u2013 don\u2019t experience time. They are there in the same moment they are emitted. So in that empty universe, where there is only that reference frame, they are everywhere at the same time. And that is a lot like a big bang, where all energy is at one point because there are no other points, so they would also be everywhere at the same time. So the end of the universe would lead to a big bang. Predecessor Black Holes make a similar trick: when a star collapses to a black hole and a singularity forms, the \u201cmathematical other side\u201d of that singularity would be a time-reversed black hole, or a white hole. And mathematically, a white hole looks a lot like a big bang. So this idea suggests that our universe formed from a black hole in a previous universe. That could even lead to an evolution of universes of sorts: the best universes would be those that makes lots of black holes, i.e. have a lot of big stars in it. This could solve the fine-tuning problem, because as Stephen Hawking once said, the universe is not fine-tuned to make humans, but to make black holes. That would make us more or less the waste product of the black hole-making process. The Eternal Inflation hypothesis doesn\u2019t use earlier universes, but instead uses the inflation of the early movement. We think that because the cosmic microwave background is incredibly smooth and uniform, the universe must have been ridiculously small to have time to smooth out that much. But we can also see minute variations, indicating that there were once small fluctuations that were \u201cfrozen\u201d because of a rapid expansion. This is the inflation theory. You can actually flip that on its head: suppose that before the universe, there was an inflation field, expanding exponentially. In this field, a quantum fluctuation happened that cause a bubble to slow down. And that bubble is now our universe. It would even fit in with the observation of the increased expansion rate: it is simply our bubble starting to catch up with the rest of the inflation field. The Zero Energy Universe hypothesis is one of the models which starts from nothing. It treats the universe as a book-keeping problem: it first suggest that gravity is negative energy potential. It is best understood with a bit of high-school physics: take a ball and throw it straight up. At the moment it leaves your hand, the ball has a certain amount of kinetic energy. At the moment the ball reaches the top of its trajectory and is still, it has no kinetic energy any more. But energy cannot be destroyed, so it is usually explained kinetic energy transforming into an equal amount of potential energy. When you do this exercise on the universe, and take all energy and matter and sum it up in one column, and all the gravitational potential in the other, it looks as if the two sums are identical. So you have [math]E_m[/math] amount of energy/matter, but also [math]E_g[/math] amount of gravitational potential, where [math]E_m=E_g[/math], or in other words [math]E_m-E_g=0[/math]. Then you can flip that, so that [math]0=E_m-E_g[/math]. You start with nothing, and from that you get a universe with matter and gravity. And that means that not only could you get a universe from nothing, but that in a sense, it is still nothing, only very unevenly distributed.  These are not the only ideas of how you start a universe. It\u2019s just some of the more famous and some of my favourite ideas. But, as I said, because of that pesky little horizon at the Planck epoch, we cannot test any of these ideas and see if which one, or any other, or anyone at all, is the correct one. So we don\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "You are making the assumption that something can\u2019t come from nothing. That\u2019s because it\u2019s true in your experience, in your own perception. But perception is not reality in this universe, which is wildly different than you think it is. As it happens, something comes from nothing all the time in our universe. It\u2019s just a quantum thing. Here\u2019s some interesting data points on that: http://washingtonpost.com -- Cosmic Question Will the Universe Go Crunch, or Will 'Dark Energy' Rip It Apart? Either Way, Your Head Will Pop The ultimate question is why the universe exists at all. (Alan) Guth says the equations for inflation allow the universe to expand forever, \u2026 but the equations don't permit an eternal past. There has to be a beginning, back there somewhere. Where did that first pulse, that first little spark, come from? Guth says he's worked out scenarios in which the laws of physics allow something to pop into existence from nothing. But he adds, \"I was implicitly assuming that the laws of physics already existed, even when there was no space, no time, no matter. I think that's all I need to assume. Nevertheless I am clearly making a big assumption there. That does raise the question of what caused the laws of physics, where they came from.\" What's his answer? \"I don't have the foggiest idea.\" So let's quickly summarize where we are: We're not sure if the universe will keep expanding or start contracting. We don't know if The End, if there ever is such a thing, is many billions of years away or many trillions of years away. We don't know if constants are constant. We don't know why there are laws of physics. We don't know why there's something rather than nothing. And thus we might guess that scientists will not soon put theologians out of business. Physicist Lawrence Krauss released a work titled A Universe From Nothing in which he sought to explain that it\u2019s not only possible but likely, that our Universe burst into existence from absolute nothingness \u2014 not even three-dimensional space existed before our Universe was born. (Popular Mech 10/2017)\u2026the uncertainty principle works for other quantities, too. The same principle applies to energy and time. The more you know about a particle's energy, the less you know about when it is, and vice versa. Here, something weird happens: If you know that there will never be a particle at a particular point, suddenly that point could have any amount of energy, sometimes enough to create a particle anyway. These particles are called 'virtual particles,' and they're basically quantum fluctuations. Once you make enough 'nothing,' the universe starts trying to find a way to fill it, even if that means creating particles out of thin air to do it. There's also the possibility that the entire universe is just one big virtual particle. Scientific American mag: An extreme case of particles' being unpinpointable is the vacuum, which has paradoxical properties in quantum field theory. Look closely at any finite region of an overall vacuum\u2014by definition, a zero-particle state\u2014and you may observe something very different from a vacuum. In other words, your house can be totally empty even though you find particles all over the place. \u2026the theory predicts a particularly mind-boggling behavior of the vacuum: the average value of the number of particles is zero, yet the vacuum seethes with activity www.zmescience.com Aug 2019 \u2026 an observer \u2026 who is accelerating\u200a would observe photons and other particles in a seemingly empty space while another person who is (not moving) would see a vacuum in that same area. Discover mag - The laws insist that the fundamental constituents of reality, such as protons, electrons, and other subatomic particles, are not hard and indivisible. They behave like both waves and particles. They can appear out of nothing--a pure void--and disappear again. In truth, the following will tell us that what we think is something is actually nothing, acting like something: The central lesson of quantum physics is clear: There are no public objects sitting out there in some preexisting space. As the physicist John Wheeler put it, \u201cUseful as it is under ordinary circumstances to say that the world exists \u2018out there\u2019 independent of us, that view can no longer be upheld.\u201d Quanta Mag April 2016 We have to learn to think differently. Not only did everything come from nothing via Big Bang, everything that we think is something is actually nothing. Nothing but physical laws, physical interactions. Welcome to the brave new world of physics. Once again. ",
