            "answer_text": "Because the partial vapor pressure of a solvent in a solution is lower compared to the pure solvent, when it can be regarded as an ideal solution (i.e. where solvent-solute, solvent-solvent and solute-solute all have equal interaction energies). This will cause the melting/freezing equilibrium point of the solvent to decrease, because there is now lower pressure and energy in the amorphous form and this makes it less favorable for it to go back to the lower energy state of the coexisting phase/the pure crystal form (it is more stable in a low pressure/lower energy form, so less temperature is also required to bring it to this form). The amount of change in the melting/freezing points will also ideally be proportional to the molar concentration of the solute. To make matters more complex though, the crystal structure could also be weakened a bit by the presence of impurities, which will cause the initial melting point to drop even further a bit. So, if the impurity content in the material is low, and we can regard the compound in question as an almost ideal dilute solution of impurity compounds, the melting point of the material will likely be lower compared to the pure compound. I guess most compounds and their respective impurities correspond well with the ideal situation. However, if the interaction of the material with the impurity compound is particularly strong, so that energy is released during solvent-solute interaction, the melting point could be even lower than predicted from the ideal situation and the amount of impurity. If the interaction on the other hand is much weaker with the impurity compound compared to both compound\u2019s self-interactions, it\u2019s doubtful that the compound will be present as an impurity anyway, because it will not be very soluble in the material. But if that were the case, the material could very well have a higher melting/freezing point compared to the pure material (assuming the impurities stay in the same amorphous phase and do not phase-separate out at the melting/freezing equilibrium).

            "answer_text": "this effect is so intense that the lowering of melting point of camphor and other substances can be used to measure the molecular weight of an unknown compound (coarse low tech method), This phenomenon is also well studied with thermo-gravimetric instruments and is the base in the technology of weldering, alloys, etc, etc. The atomic or molecular causes are studied in the field of Solid State Physics, any imperfection in lattice, every impurity inside the allotropic arrangement, (certain stable aggregate form) will cause distorsion and a new less uniform, less stable aggregate. This is better seen from the solidification perspective, the fused mass of the solid is let to cool down, we are checkibg out temperature, it cools fast until it starts to solidify and heat is released, then there will be a plateau (resting point) that temperature is the melting point. When an impurity is introduced into this fused bulk mass, the cooling down if the mass will skip the old melting point and this happens because the released heat of solidifying is invested now in kinetic energy or molecular vibration for the impurity (remember heat is infrared radiation), so? well the plateau or that point of constant temperature will be lower, bellow the expected and never above! it.
