            "answer_text": "One of the \u201cprime directives\u201d in our universe is conservation of momentum, due to one of several symmetries (Noether\u2019s Theorem). When you stop at a traffic light, most assume momentum gets \u201cabsorbed\u201d as heat in the brakes \u2026 but that is wrong; a car\u2019s momentum transfers to the earth, which then spins into a slightly different direction. If two objects collide, they can bounce back or stop with a thud \u2026 in both cases, momentum is exactly conserved. ",

            "answer_text": "In a pure two body collision two objects may come to rest only if the initial total momentum was equal zero. This is the situation of the particles colliders as this configuration allows to use all the kinetic energy for creation of new particles. In every day life it is not always easy to isolate completely two objects from their environment in order to verify this momentum conservation law. Conservation Laws ",
