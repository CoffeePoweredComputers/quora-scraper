            "answer_text": "The relationship between Science and Technology can be described as non-existent. There is no relationship whatsoever between Science and Technology. It is the mathematical so-called \u2018physicists\u2019 who convinced the world that Mathematics and Technology are related to Science and Physics. The problem starts with the definition of so-called \u2018science\u2019 that the mathematicians imposed upon the world. \u2018Scientists\u2019 don\u2019t seem to know what science is Dictionary.com defines science as: science: a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws\u2026 systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. The Wikipedia defines science as: science: a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe These are the notions just about everybody on the planet has of what science is or is supposed to be. Most of us learn this by rote in high school, college, or by browsing the internet. Nobody questions them. And yet, we do have a problem right up front in that no one has ever been able to define the word knowledge unambiguously. No one knows what it means to know. But even if someone were able to define this enigmatic word it wouldn\u2019t matter anyways. Is science about knowing? Is science a collection of knowledge? Is it like stamp collecting? Is this what scientists do? Accumulate knowledge to build useful gadgets? Or is that the task of technicians and engineers? Here we are in the 21st Century and not one so-called \u2018scientist\u2019 or \u2018mathematical physicist\u2019 at any university or think tank on the planet can tell you simple things such as how a magnet attracts another from a distance or the physical mechanism of gravity? So the results are clearly there. We have technology, but the \u2018scientists\u2019 and mathematicians who call themselves \u2018physicists\u2019 have no understanding of the simplest invisible mechanisms that Mother Nature uses to do her daily chores. Not one mathematician at any accelerator on the planet \u2013 CERN, SLAC, Fermilab, UNILAC, KEK, etc. \u2013 can illustrate the simplest atom for you. Not one professor at any university can give you a rational physical interpretation of ANY invisible phenomenon! Therefore, the question stares us in the face. What do these so-called \u2018scientists\u2019 and \u2018mathematical physicists\u2019 really\u2026 \u2018know\u2019? What is Science? Let\u2019s capitalize the word Science to distinguish it from the so-called \u2018science\u2019 that mathematical so-called \u2018physicists\u2019 do and define it rigorously and unambiguously\u2026 Science: rational explanations As it relates to the real, physical world, Science is about explaining mechanisms in a rational manner. The theorist is saddled with the burden of making a movie of the mechanism he proposes. We should understand the mechanism by merely watching the movie. Do we perchance need anything other than our eyes to understand how a brick broke the window? If you watched the movie of the brick going through the window, do you think you would understand how the glass ended up on the floor? Would you be able to explain it to a 10-year-old? You may think that Mother Nature\u2019s invisible mechanisms are a very different story. Phenomena such as gravity and magnetism are impossible to figure out, right? Or are they difficult to figure out simply because we can\u2019t see the invisible mediators? If a magnet attracts another from a distance, clearly there is some invisible, intangible entity between them mediating the transaction. Otherwise, the theorist is explaining the phenomenon with spirits and black magic. Likewise, if you jump and always fall back towards the center of the Earth, there is an invisible entity mediating between the Earth and you. As one professor put it:  So what can you think of that can pull on every atom of you while you\u2019re pulling on every atom of it and goes right through things? You clearly must brainstorm elongated mediators that interconnect atoms. Without some kind of object, the theorist is introducing spirits again and \u2018explaining\u2019 action-at-a-distance with miracles. Is Science an indefinite search? Once we figure out the invisible entities that Mother Nature uses to do her invisible tasks \u2013 light, gravity, magnetism, electricity, atomic behavior, cosmic phenomena attributed to magical black holes and dark matter, etc. \u2013 we\u2019re done with Physics. There is no more to learn about the Universe after we figure out the invisible stuff. Is it difficult? Is it beyond human comprehension? Let\u2019s see\u2026 The Universe consists of space, dead rocks such as planets and asteroids and comets, many stars, and clouds of gases. That\u2019s it. Now, how difficult can it be with all that inert, ordinary matter? We just have to figure out what invisible mediators prevent the Earth from flying out of the Solar System. So again, how difficult can that be? What is Technology? To figure out what technology is, we merely need to quote one of the leading technologists of the late 19th Century and early 20th\u2026 \u201cI have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\u201d Thomas Edison Technology is about developing useful gadgets by trial and error. You do not need to understand what a magnetic field IS. You simply need to be familiar with what it DOES and apply it in some way in the lab. Edison died without ever having the foggiest idea what a magnetic field or what electricity is. He simply tinkered in his workshop with behaviors of invisible entities that others had discovered and written about. Science is about explaining and understanding how \u2013 causes, mechanisms \u2013 the Universe works. Science is not about developing gadgets or calculating or making predictions. These last two are actually the tasks of astrologers. . . . ",

            "answer_text": "Science typically concerns itself with understanding naturally occurring phenomena and technology is the application of scientific knowledge to develop tools to solve a problem. For example, genomics is the study of the genome, and a sequencer is a tool for understanding the genome. In other words, science is the foundation for technology. Both science and technology use the same basic principles to achieve similar ends. They both \u201cstand upon the shoulders of giants\u201d by discovering or building new things on the foundations of previous work. They both rely on validation and testing to confirm the work. They both rely on their respective communities to replicate and test the work. In the case of science, this is through the peer review process (and through open science\u2019s focus on reproducibility), in the case of software this is through the code review process (and the very nature of open source software in general).
