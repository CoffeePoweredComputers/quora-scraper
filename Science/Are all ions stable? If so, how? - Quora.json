            "answer_text": "Ions are not stable, they are in excited state. The fact that they exist as ions means that they need to gain lose or share electrons to attain a stable electronic configuration and duplet or octet valence shell structure resembling that of noble gases. Only after the losing gaining or sharing of electrons (chemical bonding), are they in ground state \u2014 which is stability. ",
