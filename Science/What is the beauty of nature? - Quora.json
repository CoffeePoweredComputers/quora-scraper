            "answer_text": "Nature is the lovely and attractive world with many beauties and wonders. It is an art of God and the rest of the things in the universe are artificial. It is created by god for the purpose of human beings. Nature is very essential to life and it is very much related with life. In the universe, there is nothing equal to the beauty of nature. In nature, no effort is made to create anything; the beauty on it comes naturally. But human beings are not appreciating it to the full. It teaches many valuable things to human. It teaches man to treat both happiness and sadness alike, in short nature is impressive and instructive. Life and nature are similar concepts, because nature is the study of life. If a person examines the beauty of nature, he may find some parallels in human lives and a nature world. For instance, the falling and ebbing of sea waves can be taken as an example. The falling suggests the ups in the human life and the ebbing suggests the downs of the human beings. The flower and thorns in a rose suggests that life has both pleasure and pains. It is good to spend time in nature, because it provides wisdom and pleasure to human being. There is a saying by John Keats\u2019 that \u201ca thing of beauty is a joy forever.\u201d Beautiful things in the world provide ecstasy to the onlookers. If a person ignores this beauty of nature and spends time in urban areas, it spoils persons\u2019 health and make human feel himself as a machine. So, it is relaxing just to stare at the beautiful scenario like mountains, oceans, waterfall and a dense forest. There is also a saying by Margaret Hungerford that \u201cbeauty is in the eyes of the beholder\u201d. Everything in the world will not look pretty to everyone\u2019s eyes, but nature is the only thing which looks pretty and cool on everyone\u2019s eyes. So, nature is the only exception to this saying. It freezes human\u2019s heart and soul, because it is not an art of man but an art of god. It has universal beauty in it which is pleasing to human sense. There is a beauty and mystery in the natural world and it always fascinates mankind. When a person analyzes everything in nature it leads human into a wonder. He will ask himself that was it come by chance or was it created? He will not receive answer, so nature is a puzzle. The beauty is there in nature until it remains a puzzle to readers. If a human truly love nature, he will find beauty everywhere and everything in nature. Nature is full of beauties; human should know to perceive them. In nature, there is a landscape which gives ecstasy to the onlookers and melts one\u2019s stress away; the changing weather and season paints the sky; five elements are there in nature which operates the world; a rainbow in the sky leaps up human\u2019s heart; powerful ocean and it\u2019s waves impress human; mighty trees and vast forest inspire the feelings of human beings and along with that the birds and birds\u2019 song and wildlife makes the world alive and dazzling with beauty and charm. Waterfall which pour from the top of the mountain is an awesome and amazing sight; silver moon and golden cluster of stars shine so bright in night which lights the dark sky; the blue sky offers sunrise which opens the bright day and gives sunset in the evening which welcomes the beautiful moon and its kids which is stars; the heaven provides rain to the world which feeds the earth and makes the land fertile; blossoming flowers decorate the world with its wings of colours. In short everything in nature gives man with a feeling of positive hope. This grand show in nature is eternal and everlasting. Nature is mould with its own beauty naturally without having any effort. Only nature has eternal beauty which enriches the world. The eternal beauty in nature came naturally and no effort is made to create anything. This visible beauty in nature is not only good for one\u2019s eyes but also good for one\u2019s invisible soul and senses. Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty in nature will also remain eternal fresh forever in their heart and soul. Thus, Nature provides optimistic feel to its onlookers and arrests human minds with its attractiveness. ",

            "answer_text": "A few muddled random associations to meditate on this question: A man and a girl were walking through a garden. The man said to the girl, \"Isn't this rose particularly beautiful?\" The girl looked at him stricken and said, \"They are all beautiful.\"     The concept of wilderness as a beautiful place is a relatively recent concept. In the past, wilderness was considered to be a wild, untamed, dark, and dangerous place to be avoided except by the most daring explorers or outlaws and desperadoes.  Think Little Red Robin Hood, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, Peter and the Wolf.  More recently, it has been considered to be a pristine, unspoiled, bright, untouched garden of Eden vista to be protected and experienced in person -- an ideal vacation spot or a challenge for adventurers and extreme sports aficionados.    How that attitude changed is an interesting story that you can research on your own. A starting point in this blog post: That Devil, Nature What hasn't changed is the capitalist mission to exploit the natural resources and commercially develop those lands and seas.(Mountaintop removal mining)  Commercial encroachment on wetlands, Northampton, MACondo Monotony: The Future of Ward 3? - North Street Neighborhood Association     And I give you this:Life Finds A Way: 25 Plants That Just Won't Give UpAnd I ask, what makes the plants more beautiful than the pavement and architecture in which they are growing?   Why do some find this beautiful?http://www.lolocohen.com/featured/graffiti-new-york-city/    Beauty is in the eye of the (human) beholder.    And while Shakespeare is referring to play acting when Hamlet says,  \"The purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.\" I believe it is our perception of nature that we consider beautiful, in whatever aesthetic we indulge and admire.
