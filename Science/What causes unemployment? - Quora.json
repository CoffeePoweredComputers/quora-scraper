            "answer_text": "Thank you for the request, Nitin. I love the curiosity behind the question. Something that I finding missing in most of the people I meet these days.  To be unemployed is to be naked in a place where everyone is dressed. You know it is awkward but it is what it is. Especially if you are an introvert, highly sensitive and self-conscious. It is like being constipated after a wholesome meal. There is a big part of a cheat meal that you gotta unload but it just ain't happening. Your breath becomes shallow, you are constantly worrying and when the next opportunity comes, you better give it your all. It is like having unprotected sex. You know you are going to be fucked but still you cannot hold yourself back. You want to be fucked. You need that person inside you. And you need it right now. You suffer your mind's own made up reality. You are doing it, so that for those fleeting moments , you wanna escape pain and reality. It is like counting every penny you spend. You literally count every fucking thing. You live on your parents payroll and you feel like shit. Even when you have the best people around you, you wanna throw up and walk away from everything. From everyone. Why? Because you are looking for praiseworthiness. You want to be of value but you know you are sucking the life out of people who you love. It is like getting crushed by the weight of your own expectations. There is that nagging guilt and shame that hangs across your neck like an albatross. You actually start looking at people's eyes a lot. And man, the looks we get. Here is a sample. Caring look wanting you to find something. Judging look fucking with your self-esteem. Loathing look stripping you naked. Shaming look taunting your life. Empathetic look urging you to move on. Blaming look shitting on your mistakes. Glaring look belittling your very presence. Sorry look offering you sympathy and more pity. Assuring look making you want to hug the living daylights out of the person. Loving look making you get back to the grind again. Who told you, looks don't matter? I am telling you they matter. To me right now, eyes speak more than words. I am doing the best I can and to be really honest being unemployed, totally sucks! It is a tough phase without a doubt. But it is only a phase! Image credits: Google images ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s is when the number of \u201cunemployed job seekers\u201d actively seeking work becomes greater than the number of vacant jobs employers are willing to offer to \u201cunemployed job seekers.\u201d The contention \u201cis unemployment really just a consequence or a cause and effect of employment?\u201d Without the business of employment! unemployment would also not exist - However it is not logical to remove one to eradicate the cause of the other - rather better to just accept that both Unemployment & Employment do exist at the same time as the opposite sides of the same coin do.Employers generally look for specific employees, with the right skills or qualifications in the right location within a set number of hours. And more often Employers want employees to have their own transport and work more flexible or longer hours on request - and use some of their own work gear.Some employers prefer offering jobs to people who already have jobs or favor people with more experience and work tools and licences, registrations etc the employer can save time and money not having to train and pay on behalf of employees. Some employers may even wait until a trial period has been reached.Some unemployed people are already marginalized with there own reasons besides having no job - such as poor health, poverty, illiteracy, isolation, abuse, injuries, disabilities, trauma, mental health, convicted offenders, smaller indigenous cultures, health defects like deafness, colour blind, impairments, allergies & phobias of height, flying, dust, hayfever, animals etc. through no fault of their own will not even be considered a match by an employer unless employers are prepared to engage in social change and offer already marginalized groups of unemployed people access to real jobs without prejudice and judgement.Some unemployed people don\u2019t want to work, hold down a job or want to work in a job they don\u2019t like.Some unemployed can survive by being dependant on government welfare and have learnt how to live healthy lives frugally.Some employers have high attrition rates meaning the type of work environment or conditions, collective or individual employment contracts or way employees are treated causes business to have a high turnover of employees.The definition of unemployed may or may not include people who are: disabled, elderly, retired, injured, impaired, a pregnant wife, a single parent, are unemployed but not registered as such including new immigrants. Thus all these different groups or numbers of individuals can distort the real actual numbers of people who are not gainfully employed. And vice versa not all employed people work full-time, there are many people who are only employed part time. Even though government may count them as being as employed the same as people who are employed full-time without distinction.",
