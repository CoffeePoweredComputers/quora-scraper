            "answer_text": "Two reasons. The more important one is because we don\u2019t have anything to compare the lack of the Sun\u2019s gravity to. Basically, the Sun\u2019s gravity is affecting the Earth as much as it\u2019s affecting the people on it, so we\u2019re falling together around the Sun. Or rather, almost as much, there might be small differences because we\u2019re not all at the exact same distance from the Sun as the Earth is, but that\u2019s a really minor factor at this distance. Second reason is that this far away from the Sun but this close to the Earth, the Earth\u2019s gravity is about 1633 times stronger than that of the Sun. It would be like trying to hear someone 10 feet away whispering in a very noisy environment. ",

            "answer_text": "The Earth and everything on it is in free fall around the sun.  It's very similar to being on the International Space Station, which is in free fall around the Earth.  The gravitational field at the orbital distance of the ISS is over 90% what it is at the surface of the Earth, but since an orbit around a star or a planet means continuous free fall, the gravitational effects are not felt.  They are basically cancelled by the acceleration that is produced by the gravitational field. Since on the surface of the Earth, we are prevented from freely falling by the surface, we experience the gravitational effects due to the Earth. ",
