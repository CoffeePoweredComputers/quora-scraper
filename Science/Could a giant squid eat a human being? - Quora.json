            "answer_text": "Well, the squids are carnivorous, and maybe can bite a human as accidental event. But human beings are not their habitual food. The habitat of the giant squid is too deep for a human being and they dont used to swim towards the surface of the sea. And human beings, if get that depths must do it in a submarine, that protect them of any harm. Therefore is quite eventually possible that kind of accidents. It could happen if when a squid is trapped and left on the deck of a ship, and a foolish and reckless human put its hand, near the beak on the mouth of the squid and got bitten. There are always somebody as foolish to do it . ",

Even with specialist deep-diving scuba gear no human is ever going to get down into giant squid habitat (and no giant squid is ever going to break into a submersible), while any giant squid coming up into the depths a human might swim in will be too ill to attack anyone.

A Humboldt squid, or squids can be very dangerous, and could cause serious or fatal wounds. About the only time a Giant Squid would have an opportunity to feed on a human, would be after a deceased human sunk several thousand feet in the ocean. Even then, there are too many scavengers about to leave anything left for a squid. ",

I would recommend avoiding and large squids, if possible. ",
