            "answer_text": "How is transparent aluminum going to change manufacturing? Transparent aluminum is an imaginary material from Star Trek. Transparent ceramics like alumina (sapphire) and aluminum oxynitride are unlikely to alter manufacturing because they offer few unique capabilities unless some durable sensor window is required. They\u2019re not the hardest ceramics, the toughest ceramics, or the most heat resistant ceramics. However, both ceramics could benefit from improvements in their manufacturing techniques. Edge-defined sapphire growth tends to pick up inclusions. Boule sapphire growth\u2026well, look at the Apple sapphire debacle. There\u2019s a potential to greatly increase artificial sapphire availability if you can run those larger boule furnaces correctly. Aluminum oxynitride manufacture could benefit from more near-net shape forming, since it needs so much polishing after sintering. ",
