            "answer_text": "Yes of course,in fact almost all the combination reaction is a redox reaction.Redox reaction is a reaction in which there is loss or gain of electrons or there is addition or removal of oxygen or hydrogen.For eg .C+O2->CO2Here,there is addition of oxygen hence oxidation takes place.Considering other reaction,Na +Cl->NaClHere,there is loss of electron by Na and gain of electron by Chlorine.Hence,it is also a redox reaction.
