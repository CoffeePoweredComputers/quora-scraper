            "answer_text": "Much of the routine work in offices such as recording information, writing and sending Messages, calculating, gathering and analysing data has been taken over by machines. These functions can now be performed more quickly, more accurately and more efficiently and the time thus saved can be used for more challenging and simulating tasks. Every second the networks formed by telephones, telex printers, radio stations, and satellite links transmit millions of messages from one place to another.

            "answer_text": "Let me rephrase your question: How has technology improved communication in the 21st century? Even so restricted, the question could still be answered with a book. OK, now I guess you\u2019ve been given a class assignment. And I answer: Technology has not just improved communication; it is communication itself. Imagine a world without (cell) phones, TV, radio, internet and www, loudspeakers, microphones, video and audio equipment, books, music albums, hearing aid, the braile, printing presses, newspapers, magazines, iPad and other devices. Can you imagine such a world? Maybe it once existed, but you have to go back about 6, 000 years. The answer to your question then? Just list the functions of each of the above communication gadgets and equipment. State how Facebook has helped you in communication, for instance. Or Quora. Or WhatsApp. In case you can\u2019t put your thoughts together, go for one of my new ebooks, 33 Businesses Thriving on Journalism Skills. Now you have your hands full! Best of luck. ",
