            "answer_text": "The only ones who flipped was republicans in the US. Why? Because the Kochs flooded them with fossil fuels money. Climate change was a bipartisan issue until fossil fuel money started to flood the republican party.  Roger Fjellstad Olsen's answer to What effect does lobbying have on climate change issues being addressed in the US?  In the US, at least 180 congressional members and senators are declared climate deniers. They\u2019ve received more than US$82 million in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry and its partners. The Kochs are probably the main founders of the american denial machine. Their agenda is to undermine all science which comes into \u201cconflict\u201d with their self interests. They are mega big polluters. And they have paid politicians to \u201cdo nothing about global warming\u201d. (Watch the video) Most republican politicians are puppets for the Kochs.   What is the current state of affairs after 70 years of this climate denial machine? In the US, at least 180 congressional members and senators are declared climate deniers. They\u2019ve received more than US$82 million in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry and its partners. Q: How much money bribe from oil and gas industry does it take to claim that \u201cclimate scientists are in it for the money\u201d? A: $763,331 Climate scientists slam Rick Santorum's \"conspiracy theory\" that they're in it for the money  When you have received $763,331 from oil and gas companies, I guess its mandatory to claim that \"climate scientists are in it for the money\" right? LOL Oil & Gas: Money to Congress Or this: A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that over the last 20 years, private funding has had an important influence on the overall polarization of climate change as a topic in the United States. Corporate funding and ideological polarization about climate change  Truth is these interests are spending billions on lobbying officials: \"Lobbying is conducted away from the public eye,\" explained Brulle. \"There is no open debate or refutation of viewpoints offered by professional lobbyists meeting in private with government officials. Control over the nature and flow of information to government decision-makers can be significantly altered by the lobbying process and creates a situation of systematically distorted communication. This process may limit the communication of accurate scientific information in the decision-making process.\" As the study concludes, \u201cthe environmental organization and the renewable energy sectors were outspent by the corporate sectors involved in the production or use of fossil fuels by a ratio of approximately 10 to 1.\u201d How lobbyists buy climate change legislation http://www.drexel.edu/~/media/Fi... About $2 billion USD was spent between 2000 and 2016 by a variety of fossil-fuel related actors on US lobbying alone to confuse the issue on climate change, deny the science and prevent action. This is according to a peer-reviewed study published in the Springer journal Climatic Change, a long-lasting interdisciplinary journal with a solid impact factor of 3.537. The study is The climate lobby: a sectoral analysis of lobbying spending on climate change in the USA, 2000 to 2016 by Robert Brulle of Drexel University.  As Brulle points out in his abstract, Major sectors involved in lobbying were fossil fuel and transportation corporations, utilities, and affiliated trade associations. Expenditures by these sectors dwarf those of environmental organizations and renewable energy corporations.  https://phys.org/news/2013-12-ko... https://cleantechnica.com/2016/0... Exclusive: Billionaires secretly fund attacks on climate science\u2019 CONCLUSION: Climate deniers have no reason to say climate science is politicized. They have themselves made it political.  Libertarian and free-market ideology has traditionally had difficulty dealing with negative externalities, as detailed in the non-libertarian FAQ; denial allows a person to simply ignore the limitations of their ideology. American conservatives in particular tend to distrust government, dislike regulations and hate taxes, so that any problem whose solution is a tax or a regulation naturally attracts distrust. The Denial for profit movement has, naturally, exploited these conservative values. Most of the propaganda they create is simply pandering to their tribe. We also live in a time when many people feel they dont have to be objectively wrong anymore. Lobbyists create tribal food, pulp fiction, which can be used to fill the holes and flaws in deniers ideology. To justify their denial. Americans want a clean environment, widespread good health, high standards of living, security, freedom, peace, and opportunity for both themselves and others. This posed a problem, given that the polluters industries and their network opposed environmental regulation and government action on global warming, and supported privatizing Social Security and health care. So the Denial for profit polluters knew they had to hide their self interests into \u201csomething\u201d. If your dog needs a pill, which he hates, what do you do to make the dog swallow it? Yes, you hide the pill in its food. \u201cThey connected their audience\u2019s underlying ideologies to climate change: Because cutting GHG emissions requires intervention regulation or increased taxation of carbon emissions\u2014that curtail free market economics, people whose identity and worldview centers around free markets became particularly likely to reject the findings from climate science when the logic was laid bare.\u201d An environmental law might sound perfectly OK for conservatives, but when the Denial machine is renaming said laws for \u201ctax scams\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d, this triggers their already dislike for governments and their built-in fear of communism, and will feel like honey being inserted into their ears.  Just like tobacco industry, fossil fuels made it into a lifestyle issue. An ideological issue. For generations, the Tobacco industry has tried to convince millions of people that smoking is cool, sexy and completely harmless. Its become tribal. Black and white. Climate denial has become mandatory for the american right. If you dont hate the government, you\u2019re a socialist. Smearing scientists and undermining \"unwanted\" science which comes into conflict with self interests and ideology, is all part of the denial propaganda machine: \"Cynicism about the motives of public servants, including government-backed climate scientists, can be traced to a group of neoliberals and their \u2018toxic\u2019 ideas\". \u201cBack in the late 1980s, when it became pretty clear that there was no persistent Soviet threat, conservatives needed a new bogeyman, and they found it in the environmental movement. \u201cGreen is the new Red.[\u2026] Cries for environmental regulation were twisted into calls for socialism and the end of economic progress.\u201d Climate Science Denial Explained: The Denial Personality How Is Climate Change Denial Still a Thing? The irony of this thinking is hilarious; While the scientific work of agencies like NOAA and NASA is higly respected and acknowledged world wide, in america, they are hated by the denial movement, and in such way, if this was the 50s, climate deniers would been locked away for anti american behaviour by the McCarthy process. 50 YEARS OF US SCIENCE AND GOVERNMENTS AND PRESIDENTS COMES TO THE SAME CONCLUSION ON AGW: PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON\u2019S 1965 \u201cRestoring the Quality of our Environment report\u201d. Fifty years ago: The White House knew all about climate change On November 5, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s White House released \u201cRestoring the Quality of our Environment\u201d, a report that described the impacts of climate change, and foretold dramatic Antarctic ice sheet loss, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. That 1965 White House report stated: \u201cCarbon dioxide is being added to the earth\u2019s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas at the rate of 6 billion tons a year. By the year 2000 there will be about 25 percent more CO2 in our atmosphere than present. This will modify the heat balance of the atmosphere to such an extent that marked changes in climate, not controllable through local or even national efforts, could occur.\u201d On the 50th anniversary of the White House report, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are indeed at 399 ppm: 25 percent over 1965 levels, exactly as predicted 50 years ago.  http://ourchildrenstrust.org/sit...  Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1989 EPA REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE  Page 28: http://bit.ly/2w8YMuV 1970: Nixon founded the Environmental Protection Agency. 1987: Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol (to ban ozone-depleting pollutants), In 1989 Pres. Ronald Reagan proposed creation of the U.S. Climate Change Research Program (USGCRP) to coordinate the research, monitoring, and assessment activities of more than a dozen federal government agencies an Departments. Pres. George H.W. Bush signed enabling legislation two years later. Trump and his Administration and Republicans in Congress are ignoring and denigrating three decades of scientific research and monitoring and systematically dismantling and bastardizing the USGCRP.  George H W Bush introduce cap-and-trade (to deal with the acid rain problem). The Political History of Cap and Trade And what about George W Bush?  Well Dubbya of course ran against the single politician--Al Gore--who is most closely associated with the cause of climate action in modern U.S. history. So I suppose it isn't too surprising that we heard lines like this spoken on the campaign trail: \u201cAs we promote electricity and renewable energy, we will work to make our air cleaner. With the help of Congress, environmental groups and industry, we will require all power plants to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of time. And we will provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading, to help industry achieve the required reductions.\u201d What might be surprising for you to learn, however, is that it wasn't Al Gore--but George W Bush--who made that statement in the run-up to the election. It was Bush who had committed to combat climate change through the regulation of carbon emissions. http://michaelmann.net/content/v... George W. Bush administration 2001 National Academies report: Committee on the Science of Climate ChangeDivision on Earth and Life StudiesNational Research Council \u201cGreenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.[\u2026] Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are expected to continue through the 21st century[\u2026.] The predicted warming of 3\u00b0C (5.4\u00b0F) by the end of the 21st century is consistent with the assumptions about how clouds and atmospheric relative humidity will react to global warming. The National Academies Press Trump's 2018 National Climate Assessment. \ufe0f Based on extensive evidence \u2026 it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,\u201d For the warming over the last century, \u201cthere is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\u201d Climate Science Special Report: Executive Summary ",
