            "answer_text": "White magic is magic that only helps you become stronger spiritually. So meditation, the exhalations. Things like that. It's specific to just you, and nothing of material gain. Only spiritual gain. Gray magic is any magic you do for any kind of material gain, or any magic you do with a positive intent that is either for you or another person and will affect the material world. Seeking a raise at a job, attracting love into your life, a protection spell. Things like that. Black magic - is controversial. First of all, different magic paths define it differently. Speak to a Choas magician and they will probably tell you there is no grey magic. Only black and it's all good. Speak to a Wiccan and they think everhthing besides white is black magic. Speak to an independent Witch and she tells you that black magic is any magic with a negative intent. Speak to a Neo Pagan and they tell you the only real black magic is calling down to demons or hell. Speak to a ceremonial magician they tend to blur the lines so to speak- what people tend to think of as black they don't. What Hollywood has done is really fucked. Even what they did to Crowley was fucked. You have to really study and learn to find out. What most mundane people think of black magic - like in the movies - is some sects of Voodoo ( only in Africa) and some magics in like South America ( and some in America) like Palo Mayombe. Those two can use human sacrifice and so on. Witches , who for the most part have the worst reputations are probably the sweetest and nicest people. Sure there are black witches but they are rare. Very rare. The typical Witch doesn't even use magic very much because of that witches code .. 3x3 thing. Ceremonial and Choas magicians yes.. They have no adverse reaction to doing some black magic but it's not black magic to them. It's just magic. Most of the time. But that's also part of their path. They have to get rid of all the dogma and belief systems and the lies that most humans are rooted by. Choas magicians don't believe that there are any repercussions from doing black magic and that's very rare. Most people who do magic believe there is some price to be paid for doing black magic. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly black and white: black is the absence of all see-able color altogether and has amungst humans been the symbolic representation for evil. For in the dark of night lays our most primal fears. Darkness is symbolically the dwelling place of the malicious entities that stalk the night, what is known to be there but remains unseen. Black, is attributed to this darkness and subsequently the evil that is assumed to dwell in that darkness. This is why black is often representative of things like death or that things that cause death. White is the presence of all see-able color seen in tandem for lack of better terms. White has within it the essence of all of the colors of the spectrum and thus white symbolically contains the symbolic nature of those colors contained within. White also had come to represent cosmic purity in that white symbolises light. More directly, sunlight. All light pushes away the uncertainty, fear, and darkness brought by the night or more directly darkness. White represents purity health and life. On the second: magic is neither universally good or bad in fact tales amungst our people throughout the history of story telling represents magic as a power used for just about everything by just about anything. From human beings to deities, plants, animals, jewelry, charms, even ghosts, fairies, the wind. Just about anything can use magic for this is the nature of symbolism in that these tales of magic seem to indirectly say magic is everywhere. Magic as a word holds a slew of meanings and interpretations but in origin means the art of the Magus. A Magus being a human of learnedness and wisdom. One of the wise men. So magic would be the art of wisdom. Instead its current interpretation is the apparent ability to alter the course of events by some supernatural force. Magic is and always will be the art of wisdom, a craft if you will. Now to the meat: black magic represents the power to do bad or negative things to a person place or thing whereas white magic is the promotion of love and health. (A gross oversimplification) These terms should not be used in conjunction with magic\u2026 or race\u2026 or anything for they are deceivingly causing a line to be drawn between the two sides of the same coin. Magic like everything else is more complicated than one side or the other. Rather it is better described in degree and scale. Hope this long winded explanation helps if at all. ",
