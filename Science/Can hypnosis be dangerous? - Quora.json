            "answer_text": "When I was doing my hypnotherapy certification, my teacher, a very experienced and skilled man kept saying that you can hypnotize someone for a very short period of time against their will. Every time he said that I did not like that. Sure enough, he calls me to volunteer in front of the class. Being old school, He wacks my head forward in a very fast manner while screaming SLEEP! I look up at him with wide eyes. He wacks my head forward while screaming louder SLEEP. I look up at him again. Our other professor jumps in and wacks my head forward while screaming SLEEP hoping the bypass my conscious mind with the element of surprise. I look up at him. Students in the class are puzzled and asking \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong? Why isn\u2019t she going in hypnosis? I see my teacher has a bead of sweat rolling on his temple. He sighs and asks me: \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d I answered: \u201cYou said you could hypnotize someone against their will and I did not like that idea (I do have control issues\u2026but that\u2019s a different story altogether). Now, I have my answer. You cannot hypnotize me against my will. He tossed his arms in the air and said: \u201cGo sit down!\u201d and asked for another volunteer who went in hypnosis very fast. So, long answer short, nobody can control you in hypnosis and if you put me on a stage no one could make me quack! That being said, hypnosis is a fantastic tool and thousands of women have given birth naturally and comfortably using my hypnosis for childbirth program. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, because anything you can do under hypnosis you can do without hypnosis. Absolutely not, because \u201chypnosis\u201d isn\u2019t dangerous - people are. Why isn\u2019t hypnosis dangerous? Because \u201chypnosis\u201d doesn\u2019t exist as such - it is a social construct, because all people\u2019s so called psychological problems and blockages are social problems, social blockages, relational impasses. \u201cHypnosis\u201d, just like religious experiences, or romantic encounters or therpauetic breakthroughs, or political consciensiation or spiritual awakening are certain social pretexts that allow people who are conditioned a certain social way to go from A to B, in a way that wouldn\u2019t allow themselves to without that \u201cchanging room\u201d. \u201cHypnosis\u201d is the \u201cthing\u201d in the name of which they allow themselves to change. So, again, nothing happens in hypnosis that doesn\u2019t happen outside hypnosis, even the phenomenon of selective focusing on certain selected aspects of behavior - the emphasis is on the performance of \u201ci can\u2019t help it\u201d, just like the problem state of the client. Its all a matter of selective meaning making that the client sincerely pretends to not be pretending to perform. This isn\u2019t \u201cfake\u201d, this is how every important passage in human life is negotiated. As for danger, people will do in life what they\u2019d do \u201cunder hypnosis\u201d, and call it \u201cI was in love\u201d, \u201cI lost my mind\u201d, \u201cI was hypnotized\u201d, \u201cI was just following orders\u201d, or whatever pretext that according to their conditioning allows them to make the leap\u2026 sometimes a leap into danger.

            "answer_text": "Q: Is hypnosis ever dangerous? Have you ever been in a traumatic or exciting event and from then on, some aspect of it always takes you back there a little? Like the smell of liquorice makes you feel nervous because your schoolyard bully's breath smelled like liquorice? Even if you consciously know that that kid is nowhere near you, and maybe even if you're now a lot bigger than he is, you still instinctively have that emotional flinch. Hypnosis is just a hack to access this part of your brain and injects those types of suggestions. That's why it works well to quit smoking or weight loss (if it's done personally, I don't know how much value those 500 person events can possibly have). It can give you certain inclinations or disinclinations, like whenever you think about a cigarette, it makes you feel a level of disgust. It can make you feel like something normal feels weird, and that something weird feels normal. However, it can't ever do anything that you can't consciously override if you choose to, other than feelings or general suggestions. It can't make you shout an obscenity, for example. It can only make you think that shouting an obscenity seems like a good idea, but, say you were at your girlfriend's mother's funeral, you would have no difficulty suppressing that urge. Also, the whole time you're placing these inclinations (and you are doing it to yourself. The hypnotist is really just a guide) you're aware of what you're doing, and if it sounds like some bullshit that you don't want to do, you just choose not do it, and then it has no effect whatsoever Source: My friends and I fucked around with hypnotism in college. When other people were experimenting with drugs or sex, we experiemented with brainwashing. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be - if you do not know what you are doing and do not qualify your clients. It is not supposed to be done with anybody with mental illness or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Hypnotherapists who are psychiatrists or clinical psychologists can do hypnosis with clients with mental health issues - but only as a part of a long term therapy, by the practitioner familiar with the client or with a referral from their long term therapist. For mentally healthy people it is safe, and even if some wrong suggestion is given - it will wear off quickly. For suggestion hypnosis to be effective - it requires repetition. In regressions, a lot of post-hypnotic suggestions are given to make sure that traumatic events they saw do not affect them and only serve to clear out the effects of trauma. Show hypnosis is another story. People are put in embarrassing situations and can be bullied by their classmates or coworkers for crazy things they did on the stage. I also heard about situations when volunteers fall down in hypnosis demonstrations and broke limbs. So there is an element of risk, do not go on that stage unless you want to be laughed at. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very unlikely that hypnosis would present a danger to someone because the hypnotist is essentially facilitating access to the subconscious mind. There are many exciting possible benefits to this. However, what are the potential dangers? The person in hypnosis might have a negative reaction, based on feeling like they are re-experiencing a past trauma. It is important that if this happens the hypnotherapist says these nine words or words like them: \u201cThe scene fades and you attend to your breath.\u201d This brings the person back to the present moment.Similar to 1, the mind sometimes protects us from certain truths and realities. Hypnosis can allow a person to bypass some layers of defence. This can lead to powerful psychological breakthroughs. However, if a client has been through a trauma, they may need ongoing therapy to deal with the problem.If a hypnotist is not knowledgeable, they can accidentally implant false memories. It is important for a hypnotherapist to never make assumptions and to allow a client to generate the entire narrative. This takes patience, training, and experience.In general hypnosis is not dangerous and can be an important ally in the therapeutic process. A trained hypnotherapist can ensure that a person feels secure during a session and is not accidentally misled. http://www.infocounselling.com ",

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis in itself is not dangerous but can be harmful if conducted by an unskilled practitioner.  For example, a car isn\u2019t dangerous but if it is driven by a bad driver it can cause a fatality or a serious road accident. Hypnosis can cause problems if someone is experiencing pain which has not been medically diagnosed.  Pain is a signal that something is wrong in the body, and a good hypnotherapist knows the risks involved by using hypnosis to cover up or try to treat this, and other chronic conditions without a diagnosis by a medical practitioner. Hypnosis in the wrong hands can implant false memories in people where they think something happened in their past but this actually never happened.  Some therapists think this is beneficial in the case of childhood abuse, or trauma, but in the hands of the amateur hypnotherapist these memories can be traumatic as far as the patient is concerned. Hypnosis is a beneficial therapy, and in any case the unconscious mind can protect people under hypnosis by rejecting hypnotic suggestions which if perceives as harmful. But if in doubt, choose your hypnotist carefully, deal only with registered, professional, insured hypnotherapists and you won\u2019t have any problems. ",

The husband was keen, being a bit of a show-off, but his wife was much less keen - in fact she had been pressured by hubby to take part. The hypnotist promised to prove to the wife that she was safe. She said OK, so he put her in a trance and as soon as she was nicely hypnotised he said \u201cnow remove your blouse\u201d. Quite predictably to anyone who knows much about hypnosis, this betrayal of trust immediately broke her trance, and she started to lay into the hypnotist, with very strong language. He smiled held up his hand and said \u201cdoesn't that prove nobody can make you do anything you don't want to do?\u201d She had to agree, so the hypnotist put her back under. He then said \u201cnow, strangle your husband\u201d. It took four strong men to pull her off. Be very wary of hypnotism as entertainment! ",

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is a state of awareness you pass through several times every day, whether or not you want to. You experience this state while you awaken from sleep, while you are asleep and while you fall asleep, at the bare minimum, every day. Most times, you will experience it during the day when you daydream, watch a movie, read a good book, play video games or drive on a boring highway for a long enough time. Guided hypnosis is only having someone guide you into this state of awareness by giving you instructions to follow to arrive there. If you don\u2019t follow those instructions, nothing happens. If you do follow those instructions, you may find yourself in a daydreamy state for light levels of hypnosis, or a moderate or even deep state of relaxation depending on how skilled the hypnotist is and how well you followed the instructions. Hypnosis isn\u2019t dangerous at all. Maybe you\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s dangerous to allow someone to put you in a state of hypnosis, or to be in such a suggestive state? Since all hypnosis is self hypnosis, and you always have control, you can always remove yourself from that state and you can always refuse to execute any suggestion given to you. For more than a hundred years now it has been widely known that suggestions that lead to self harm and death will not be followed. Usually the person will simply wake themselves up instead. Hypnosis is perfectly safe. It is just a state of awareness. You always have control of yourself. People reject suggestions that would be harmful to them. ",

I had horrible depression and anxiety and I was actually (as far as my providers were concerned) encouraging my body to literally shut itself down. At the time I knew just enough to be dangerous and had no idea I was programming myself. My poor hypnotherapist had to find out what I was doing, put a block on my self hypnosis, reprogram what I was doing and then fix what I did to myself and then let it run again. ",

Hypnosis can be potentially dangerous with the wrong type of hypnotist, but when it comes to self-hypnosis (usually through Youtube videos), it\u2019s also best to be careful. Though it is hard to tell and differs from person to person, certain hypnotic suggestions can stay implanted in your subconscious. Nothing too major, but maybe a minor one like becoming more relaxed at the snap of a finger when you need to stay alert or becoming distracted. And, like everything else, too much of something is always bad. I had to learn that the hard way with hypnosis. If you go the freelance route and do whatever hypnotic suggestions you want (again, I\u2019m just focusing on self hypnosis and not hypnotherapy, which is usually very carefully regulated), then you might start to feel disoriented and a little out of touch with reality. It could, in rare cases, also become addicting. Again, this isn\u2019t anything life threatening and you can make an easy recovery, but it\u2019s often best to know when to stop with putting too many and different suggestions in your head. Worst case scenario, it leaves you confused and distracted. Best case scenario, nothing happens. ",

While in fact so called hypnotic state is not something to worry about as it is just very ordinary state of mind that everyone enters naturally in so many different situations so many times everyday. What can be more a concern is what is done when one is in hypnotic state, which commonly is hypnotic suggestion that is what makes hypnosis hypnosis, otherwise hypnotic state alone is no different from taking a rest. Hypnotic suggestion can be done improperly in so many ways. For example, suggestion that is wishful thinking can lead to ineffective, useless or even adverse outcomes. What is even worse is some hypnotherapists even attempt to alter one\u2019s memories, that could be dangerous should this really work. ",

Hypnotic regression allows people to be able to recall events from any point in their lifetime. In other words, it helps them to get access to their unconscious memories. Now, those unconscious memories could be anything; maybe they are a number of embarrassing things someone did, which their mind decided on shutting out and moving from their conscious memory to their unconscious memory. But just as likely as those unconscious memories could be some embarrassing things that happened, they could also be a series of traumatic events. It\u2019s extremely important for the hypnotherapist to have an adept approach when handling a subject that has had traumatic experiences in the past, as it makes the subject vulnerable and more susceptible to the implementation of false memories during a trance. Nonetheless, regression can be very insightful if performed by a skilled hypnotherapist. ",
