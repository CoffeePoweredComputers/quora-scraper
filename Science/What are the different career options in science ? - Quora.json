            "answer_text": "Thinking about your career choice is a good way to articulate what you are interested in and also the values you believe in. You can pay more attention to your chosen area from now itself and chose to differentiate yourself from others. If the subject you chose finally ends up to be less exciting than you initially thought, you can switch to another subject anytime. This will also save you from making such decisions in the future (which can be more costly). Some advice though.Do not fall into the trap of \"Only one career can fit me\". You can pursue any one of many careers that will suit you and any decision you make right now will probably change in the future. Some tips to find a career that suits you- Ask yourself different questions and write down the answers that come to your mind. 1. Do you understand the concepts of Physics well enough to explain them clearly and concisely? 2. Can you identify the problems students face and help them where required? 3. Are you a good entertainer?  If you answered YES to all these questions, then CONGRATULATIONS. You can become a Physics teacher.Watch videos and read books about a bunch of different scientific phenomenon. Read these books for a start- A brief history of time by Stephen Hawking, Scientifica (encyclopedia), ABCs of the Human Mind.Youtube Channels to follow minutephysics , Numberphile, Vi Hart and many more. These videos are short, entertaining and can give you a new perspective on many subjects.In your vacation attend science fairs and exhibitions (like the Nehru Science Center).Start studying a course on Coursera - Free Online Courses From Top Universities.Research extensively about different subjects on the net. Good websites are http://CHEM4KIDS.COM, The Physics ClassroomBrowse the curriculum of different courses that you like.Career options in physics Careers in Maths  Careers in Chemistry  Careers in biology  Engineering careersResearcherProgrammerSoftware DeveloperTelecommunicationsElectronics (Semiconductors, Transistors, Logic Design, Integrated Circuit Design)BiotechnologyMechatronics (Mechanical+Electronics) - Useful for Robotics and associated fieldsArchitect Last advice- Do not fall prey to societal pressure and study a subject where your aptitude and interest complement each other.References-http://www.fontbonne.edu/academics/undergraduate/departments/biologicalphysicalsciences/Ideas and Inspiration | The University of Manchester | School of Mathematicstycho.bgsu.eduwww.york.ac.uk ",

            "answer_text": "Hi,there.Hope you do well in your 10th boards.All the best for that. As you have already made up your mind about taking Science with Mathematics. After 12,you may choose Choose Engineering for tat you have to give various entrance like JEE or state level entrances.Moreover,you can go to the core sciences and major in any of the sciences like Physics,Chemistry,Mathematics,Computer Science etc.Also you can go for Pursuing Bachelor in Computer Applications,Bsc in IT  etc.I have made a rough format for showing this to u.there are many details over this simple diagramatic representation too.
