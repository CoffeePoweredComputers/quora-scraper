            "answer_text": "A2A What constitutes purity in a person? Psalm 119:9 ESV How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word Philippians 4:8 ESV Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Psalm 24:3-4 ESV Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully. Ephesians 5:5 ESV For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ESV Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 2 Timothy 2:21 ESV Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.

            "answer_text": "How a culture defines \u201cpurity\u201d has differed from one age and one area to another. It used to be primarily restricted to the behavior of women and primarily had to do with their sexual behavior. Remember \u201cvirginity\u201d? Now, I think it has more to do with an adherence to strict ethical standards - those we all recognize as universally \u201cgood\u201d; honesty in word and deed, refusal to injure others, care and protection of those less able, a sense of duty to the \u201ccommunity\u201d however that\u2019s defined, things like that. The concept of \u201cpurity\u201d has a lot to do with a sense that there has been no \u201cdirtying\u201d, no smudging of the goodness of a person or concept, no compromising of the perfection of something.
