            "answer_text": "They do not know what the 'real' Time is and it is unlikely that they ever will. Of course, I am talking about the Time within Space-time which shares this field with Space (on a complementary basis). We believe that at a Black Hole Space is dominant but Time still exists (however small it might get). In our Solar System we believe that the Space-time environment is opposite to that found at a Black Hole. Therefore, we believe that Time is dominant where we live. Again Space still exists but it is just smaller - think about your experience of different Spaces to visualise this. Trouble is we can compare two Space-time environments (which I have just done in rough) but we cannot exactly measure how much of one exists at a particular point (or event) in Space-time. Ergo, we do not know what the Time is! ",

            "answer_text": "Scientists haven\u2019t any idea of what time it is at any moment. For you see, in reality we live in what we think as time moving forward. The truth the only thing real is consciousness and time is always now. There is no time, only a perception in our holographic existence which is like a dream. When you return to the reality before your conception, is the same time after death. It is infinite time. ",
