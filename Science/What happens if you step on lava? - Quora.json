If so, and you actually put your full weight down when you step, you will lose your foot and maybe your life, although I have seen a ranger touch it with her boot to show it was still somewhat liquid. If it is solid, but still red, it will melt your shoe or sear your foot (if barefooted). If it is cold, then it may collapse, or it may hold you up. It depends on the type of lava (aa or pahoehoe or pillow). ",

If you don\u2019t leave at that point you will fall over (into the lava) and be thoroughly cooked. As a consolation, your bones will last longer than the rest of you, and may prove of interest to future generations.  ",
