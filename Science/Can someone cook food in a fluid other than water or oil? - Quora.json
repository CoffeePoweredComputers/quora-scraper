            "answer_text": "If we're going with a technical definition for \"cook\" (specifically, if you don't require that the liquid be hot), then you can cook in liquid nitrogen.  \u200b That's a photo from sub-zero ice cream, an ice cream place that creates custom flavors for you on the fly. They dump cream and flavorings into a metal bowl, add liquid nitrogen, and stir aggressively. It's a fun place to go for dessert, and the billowing clouds of condensation make for a good show. The ice cream is decent and the texture is a bit different, but I won't go so far as to say it's better. Another possibility is melted sugar. It's a bit volatile to use as a cooking liquid, since it turns from syrup to caramel pretty quickly. You could do some interesting cooking in the narrow temperature range where it liquefies but isn't caramelizing quickly, but it will eventually caramelize (and eventually become unpleasantly bitter) even below its melting point. Melted sugar is already used as a cooking liquid for candied nuts, caramel popcorn, and so forth. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Water\" and \"Oil\", defined broadly, comprise most of the possible answers. You can get water with all sorts of thing dissolved in it (salt, alcohol, protein) and a vast array of lipids make up \"oil\". About the only additional one I could come up with is \"pure alcohol\", which wouldn't make a very good cooking medium, as it evaporates at temperatures well below the temperatures at which most things cook. Technically \"fluids\" include gases, and I suppose that you could fill a pressure cooker with some non-reactive gas (nitrogen, argon, etc). For that matter I suppose you could fill it with CO2 or O2, though I'd be surprised if the results were pleasant. ",

For meat, you could altogether avoid using oil by wrapping the meat in a foil and grilling it.  Milk, as standalone or in combination with other fluids, is also used as the cooking medium in several recipes. Even blood is used as a cooking medium. The Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania used cow blood (extracted in minor quantities without killing the cow) as the cooking medium. Milk is also added in small portions to the blood while cooking. Eggs, meat, vegetables are cooked in this medium. ",

Melted butter is another possibility, though some might consider that oil. I personally prefer coconut milk. ",
