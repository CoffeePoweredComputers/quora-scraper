            "answer_text": "A neon light or lamp produces light by passing an electric current through neon gas. This action causes a contained plasma wherein one of the main byproducts is light emission. For this to happen, the neon gas must be segregated from normal atmosphere and at a certain pressure. The light produced must be allowed to escape so as to be seen but the electrical charges involved are hazardous, so along with the gas itself, they must not be allowed to escape... So since glass is cheap, strong, easily formed, heat resistant and an excellent electrical insulator as well as extremely transparent, you can see that it is just about the prefect material for such devices. And no, they don\u2019t only come in tubes. Here is an old neon bulb. I say old because the idea of a neon bulb is an antiquated one and while they used to be used extensively for instrumentation, nowadays they are used primarily for decoration and accent.  ",
