            "answer_text": "Q \u201cWhy did nobody support Nikola Tesla to implement his idea of free energy?\u201d Tesla\u2019s famous Wardenclyffe tower was built with money from JP Morgan, and it was originally intended to be used for transmitting messages wirelessly. When he was beaten to that by Marconi, he then came up with plans to use it to broadcast power wirelessly. However, the tower never, ever generated \u201cfree power\u201d. It used power donated by the local electricity utility. So all this talk of free power is simple nonsense. Not just that, but it was a wholly impractical and ludicrously inefficient way of transmitting power anyway. It was beset with practical problems and wasn\u2019t capable of free anything. It\u2019s not surprising the investors pulled the plug on the money. Firstly, they were capitalists, not charities and weren\u2019t going to put money into something that would have been free. Secondly, when the primary use for which the tower was built turned out to be a dead end, then they were no longer interested. All this talk of Tesla being able to produce free energy is simply fantasy. He was never able to do it, and nobody has been able to produce a credible replication of the method (by which I mean one that can be independently tested and not by some conman sucking in the gullible). However, the legend goes on and the Tesla cultists seem to be obsessed with this idea yet manage to produce nothing. ",

            "answer_text": "Why did nobody support Nikola Tesla to implement his idea of free energy? Lets go down the list of reasons:- There is no such thing as \u201cfree energy\u201dTesla was not looking to deliver \u201cfree energy\u201dTesla had investors but he did not deliver for themWardenclyffe Tower was going to be a prototype for a method of sending messages and media content and broadcasting electrical power. The electrical power was going to be generated by diesel generators purchased from the Westinghouse Electric Company. Which means certainly not \u201cfree.\u201d The construction of Wardenclyffe was designed to make money. A lot of money. Tesla wrote to JP Morgan (his major investor) \u201c\u2026 I could not report yacht races or signal incoming steamers. There was no money in this. This was no business for a man of your position and importance. Perhaps you have never fully appreciated the sense of this obligation.\u201d (Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard) Tesla was relying on other people\u2019s money and that ran out. The money ran out at least partly because Tesla was not producing results. And Tesla was never going to produce the desired results - he got the physics wrong. ",
