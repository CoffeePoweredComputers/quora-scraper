            "answer_text": "When lightning strikes the surface of water, the discharge spreads out, forming a generally circular, radiating branching network of air sparks across the water's surface - a Lichtenberg figure-shaped pattern. Water, even salt water, has comparatively high electrical resistance compared to metals or high-current air plasmas/sparks). Lightning currents flowing through the water create high voltages (called \"step potentials\") between points that are different radial distances from the strike point. These high step potentials cause the air immediately above the water's surface to break down, forming a radially expanding layer of sparks (the conductive plasma channels are actually a better electrical conductor than the water below). The sparks fan out from the strike point, spreading out the current in the lightning strike across a larger area of water. Following is a small example of how a high-voltage discharge spreads across the surface of water (from \u201cDischarge Leader Self-Organization on the Water Surface\u201d by V. P. Belosheev, \u00cf Fiziki, Vol. 70, No. 7, 2000, pp. 109\u2013114):  At some distance from the strike, typically feet to tens of feet, the step potentials fall below the level necessary to ionize the air above, stopping further surface discharges. Similar step potentials exist below the water's surface, so swimmers or fish in the area may become temporarily stunned. Swimmers closer to the strike may be killed if the current pulse is sufficient to stop their heart. Similar effects sometimes occur in soil near a direct lightning strike. Radiating surface sparks sometimes leave burned Lichtenberg figures in the surrounding soil and grass, and the step potentials can kill animals and people in the vicinity. Following is an example of Lichtenberg figure left by ground surface discharges on a golf course and a discussion about step potentials:http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_ground_currents.htm ",

            "answer_text": "From the point of contact of the bolt, electrons rush out in all directions trying to get away from each other. As they spread out through the water, the voltage drops. These waves tend to move out horizontally more than into the ground below. There are usually several discharges down the same pathway to ground established with the initial discharge. Each produce a current of electrons flowing away from the point of contact. This continues out onto land with little effect on the discharge. Things close to the point of contact will experience a voltage potential across the length of the object. Living things near the point of contact will experience a shock. What effect that shock has depends on many things, for instance how much salt you had on your eggs that morning. Typically people in the water that are farther than about 20 ft from the point of contact survive the lightning strike. It\u2019s best to be treading water (not touching the bottom) and not touching anything with your hands (grabbing a dock or boat). I don\u2019t think science has a good understanding of why this is. It appears that doing so provides a preferred channel for the current to flow along. Lightning has been known to kill or at least stun every fish in a small pond, but this is pretty rare. Ponds tend to have taller things than the pond around them which gets struck much more often than directly into the pond surface. Oceans, big lakes and seas get struck directly, but their large size means that less marine creatures are killed or at least the ones that are killed are not noticed as much. ",
