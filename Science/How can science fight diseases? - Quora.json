            "answer_text": "After having finished secondary, so called high school, some people go and pass an entry exam and enroll at a UNIVERSITY AND STUDY MEDICINE , BRANCH OF SCIENCE THAT FIGHTS DISEASE. Now, where shall I start teaching you medicine? Ah, I just remembered I have no licence to teach it and not enough knowledge, either. If you pay them, some Universities, in some countries where English is not spoken, will take you as a paid student and tech you medicine. But, you will first have to learn the language in which they teach medicine and pay the cost of living there. I suggest you ask another question, which QUORANS CAN ANSWER in a post. Because studying medicine lasts in most countries 5 years, plus one you will lose, and then you are only a plain physician without any specialization. To do that one too, you will have to study another two years plus one you will lose, which all-together will take you ten bloody years of your life to become a specialist in something. And then you need a JOB. While you study medicine, most others will have used these ten years of their lives for a little more modest aims, working, getting married and raising children. YOUR CHOICE, MEDICINE OF LIFE. YOU NEED TO BE VERY SPECIAL IN MANY FIELDS TO DO BOTH. ESPECIALLY MONEY, I.Q, AND WORKING ETHICS WISE. ",
