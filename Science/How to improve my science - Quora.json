Do not \u201cbelieve\u201d but \u201cmake sure\u201d. Don\u2019t judge in a superficial manner. Check and double check. Ask for peer review/opinion. Show humility. Realize that the more you learn the less you know as more and more things come into view that you are ignorant about. Realize that only certain aspects of knowledge may open to you but of that you will possess thorough understanding. Let your knowledge be shaped by new understanding entering the field. Don\u2019t accept it blindly but also don\u2019t dismiss it off hand smugly. If you can do this, you can be one of the most knowledgeable in the field of your choice. Albeit it\u2019s part of honesty and humility: don\u2019t forget to acknoledge other\u2019s works. Finding valuable works is just as valuable as coming up with them. ",

You also have to try to find out the answers yourself if you are not getting satisfactory answers from anyone. Remember, first step of learning is to know what we don\u2019t know. ",
