            "answer_text": "Hey there. Cations are positively charged ions. They've lost one or more electrons, but they haven't lost any protons. They thus have a net positive charge. Usually these are metal ions. Good examples that are common: Sodium, Na+Potassium, K+Magnesium, Mg2+Calcium, Ca2+Aluminium, Al3+Iron (II), a.k.a Ferrous, Fe2+Iron (III), a.k.a Ferric, Fe3+Hydrogen, H+On the other hand, Anions are negatively charged ions, meaning that they've accepted one or more additional electrons. Once again, the number of protons remain the same, so there's a net Negative charge. Some of them can get quite big, consisting of more than one atom. Below are some common Anions you might encounter: Chloride, Cl-Bromide, Br-Iodide, I-Sulfate, SO_3^2-Nitrate, NO_3^2-Hydroxide, OH-Hydride, H-If you're really excited about Cations and Anions, allow me to introduce you to Zwitterions. They're molecules with an equal positive and negative charge, so their net charge is technically zero. A great example of these would be amino acids, which mostly exist in our bodies as Zwitterions.  Here, we have Glycine, an amino acid, in it's zwitterionic state. Image is from Wikipedia. Have a good day! ",

            "answer_text": "Anions are atoms or radicals (groups of atoms), that have gained electrons. Since they now have more electrons than protons, anions have a negative charge. For example, Chlorideions Cl- , Bromide Br- , Iodide I-. These are monovalent anions, meaning they have a combining capacity with only one ion of Hydrogen. Similarly there are bivalent anions, etc. Cations is also type of ion that loss electron, that's why they have positive charge ",
