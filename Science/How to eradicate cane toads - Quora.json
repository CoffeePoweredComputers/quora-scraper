            "answer_text": "Short answer is its very difficult to eradicate cane toads as they don\u2019t have any natural enemies except man and even then there are limitations. The pleasant way is to put them in a freezer and they quietly go to sleep and die. The unpleasant way was a five iron played in the same manner as if you were on a golf course, however nowadays that\u2019s very much frowned upon. Another way is to put gas into a plastic bag and they go to sleep quickly as you put the bags in a freezer and that seems to be the preferred way by those who try and stop masses of them crossing from the Territory into Western Australia. About the only animal I know that has worked out how to partially eat a toad and survive is the common crow. Dog\u2019s and cats that have tried to eat or swallow them usually end up dying a painful death. Certainly the old cane toad is one animal that was built for survival and worse still is a fast breeder. Ranks up there with feral cats as one of the worst pests that we have in Australia and we only have ourselves to blame as we imported them here to combat cane beetles, which was a dismal failure. ",
