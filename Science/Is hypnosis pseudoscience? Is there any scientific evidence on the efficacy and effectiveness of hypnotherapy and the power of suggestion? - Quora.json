            "answer_text": "As was said to me at UVA when I presented the scientists of DOPS with 12 cases of people under deep hypnosis saying the same things about the journey, \u201cHypnosis is not considered a valid tool of science.\u201d People can go to a hypnotist to want to affect a change or cure, or the hypnotist may want to create that cure - so there\u2019s an inherent problem in using it as a tool of science. However, as I pointed out, it can be a data set. The way that drugs are introduced into the marketplace is by questions and answers - people fill out surveys and reply as to what the effects were. Ultimately, those answers become a data set. So I\u2019ve filmed 50 cases of people under deep hypnosis (so far) and compared those results to the 2000 cases from Dr. Helen Wambach (extensive case notes) and a decade later, the 7000 cases from Michael Newton (I interviewed Newton about them for the film \u201cFlipside\u2019). What I\u2019ve found is that the \u201creports\u201d of what people say under deep hypnosis (not the hour long casual session, but the four to six hour session) is remarkably consistent. It doesn\u2019t matter what a person\u2019s background, gender, is or was - they say the same things about the \u201cjourney.\u201d They are able to recall previous lifetimes, sometimes with forensic details that can be authenticated (as I do in my books) or they recall the same events that others recall though they\u2019ve never met. They learn \u201cnew information\u201d during their experience that could not be cryptomnesia, or some other method of transmission. I\u2019ve also had people recall a lifetime with someone else that they know, and had that other person do an experiment - finding a hypnotherapist in their city on a different continent, telling them nothing about their friend\u2019s memory, and they having the same \u201cmemory in detail\u201dof being with this person in a previous lifetime. I\u2019ve also filmed interviews between a medium and someone they\u2019d never met, did not know was coming to the interview, where the widow in question was able to verify and learn \u201cnew information\u201d from her husband no longer on the planet. I\u2019ve filmed three different mediums answering the same questions about a person no longer on the planet (someone I knew well that they did not) and in all three cases (once where I asked the questions, once where someone else asked the questions) all the answers came back the same. Just in terms of a data set, the reports of what people say under hypnosis is consistent, and reproducible. That is, if you take any hypnotherapist who is talented at their craft (not by asking leading questions, but by listening carefully to ask questions about a person\u2019s path), they can help a person recall a previous lifetime, or a near death event that occurred during their lifetime where they learn \u201cnew information\u201d about that event. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a body of evidence of people using suggestion to elicit a response - but having filmed 50 of these sessions, doing five myself, and comparing those answers and details with thousands of others, I\u2019ve found that as a tool, hypnosis can be used to understand a number of things. Including how consciousness works, how incarnation happens, why it happens, how and why we choose our lifetimes, how much of our conscious energy we bring to any particular lifetime, or how and why we may have chosen our own journey and how that has led us to this very sentence. My two cents. ",

Indeed, science itself is hypnosis, is suggestion - in that we are constantly biasing our reading based on its social significance, constantly conditioning each other in variations on a theme of collective response, constant group hypnosis, as the history of science, the various sciences in the various cultures \u201cproves\u201d - we are telling ourselves stories about stories, doctoring evidence, influenced by power, prestige, politics, and social pressure, from the moment we are taught our own name. \u201cI Am\u201d, is the first false presupposition after which all the rest follow, it is the inaugural act of assisted self hypnosis.
