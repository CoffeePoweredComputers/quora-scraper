            "answer_text": "A common distinction between natural and \u201cnon-natural\u201d is that of natural and cultural, i.e. influenced by human culture. I would argue that, while this is a useful distinction, it glosses over the fact that even culture is ultimately governed by natural laws. After all, what are the vessels that carry culture around? Brains. What are brains made of? fats and nerve cells, etc. In other words, the brain is a physical entity, governed by physical laws. Culture is usually studied by the social sciences, humanities, economics, etc., and it is usually assumed that these disciplines have the final word on all things cultural. However, the only reason why the natural sciences often avoid the study of culture is not because it is outside their subject matter, but rather because natural sciences like physics and biology study things rigorously, and since cultures are highly complex systems, studying them rigorously (i.e. with the help of detailed mathematical models) would be very difficult, due to the amount of information required, and because it would require very powerful computers. In other words, cultures, too, are natural phenomena, which means that the distinction between natural and cultural is an illusion created by the fact that it is difficult to study cultures using natural science. What this entails is that everything we observe empirically is natural. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that \u201cnatural\u201d means \u201cnot man made\u201d. This is actually not a very useful definition, since chemists can make many of the natural hormones, vitamins, alkaloids and signalling compounds employed by animals and plants and humans in their day to day lives. The synthetic compounds are indistinguishable from the natural products. ",
