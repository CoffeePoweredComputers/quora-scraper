            "answer_text": "Molecules are made of atoms. So different molecules can have different (or same) number of atoms they are made of. Atoms have names and you can find them on periodic table of elements. Different molecules consists of different atoms. F.e H20 (water) is made of 2 hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen atom, meanwhile carbon monoxide (CO) is made of one carbon atom (C) and one oxygen atom. Different atoms are made of differenr number of protons of neutrons in the nucleus (also electrons around the nucleus but they are very small even compared to atom and don\u2019t add uo for volume or mass) therefore their radius and mass are different. Also, the structure of a particular atom might be different - angles between the atoms might vary. For example, if you imagine atom as a small ball and molecule - several (or might be a lot - it it\u2019s a protein molecule, might me thousants of atoms) balls that are connected with each other (that are \u201cattracted\u201d to each other because positive charges in protons in negative in electrons), they might be connected in a line, like O\u2014O\u2014O (O being the atom and the whole thing - a molecule), making agles of 90\u00b0 Or it might make ofter more comples 3D forms. Different molecules have different agles in which they are connected. It is so, because different atoms react in unique ways (happens so because different atoms have their unique number of protons, electors, atoms have different sizes) so, knowing positive charge attracts negative, negative charge pulls away the negative and positive pulls away the positive - atoms are distributed in a way that is energetically good, is of a least required energy so to speak - different charges attract each other but not too much cause same charges don\u2019t allow to. Soo, to sum up: Number and sizes/radiuses of atoms containing the moleculeDifferent atoms (hydrogen, carbon or whatever) containing the molecules, which have different properties and attract each other in unique ways, causing different agles between the atomsAnd alsooo, molecules might be polar or non-polar. Talking in simple terms, if you have two atoms, and one atom attracts other atom\u2019s electrons with great force (again, the positive and negative charge interplay is important here, in school you might have been told the atom wants it\u2019s last shell of electrons to be complete, soo if it has 7 electrons in the last shell and 8 would make it complete - it must pull the electron other atom has with a really great force, right?) the other atom\u2019s electron becomes \u201ca shared one\u201d - that means it \u201cflies\u201d around it\u2019s atom but sometimes happen to be closer to other atom and fly around it. That makes the other atom (who partly \u201cstole\u201d the electron) partly negative and the first one partly positive, so this kind of molecule woukd attract positive charges with its negative \u201cside\u201d end and negative charges with it\u2019s positive \u201cside\u201d. So, polarity or it\u2019s absenceMolecules can also be organing or inorganic. Can\u2019t give the exact definition now, but organic ones tend to have hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sometimes nytrogen in it\u2019s composition. And they ususlly tend to be more complex.Sorry if the answer was super messy, but i hope you found it somewhat useful!! Good luck!! ",
