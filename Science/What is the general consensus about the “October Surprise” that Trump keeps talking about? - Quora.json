            "answer_text": "Well, Trump thought that the \u201cOctober Surprise\" would be the Durham Report, which would reveal all sorts of criminal behavior from Clinton, Obama and Biden - only it did not reveal any criminal behavior, so Barr decided to hold it back lest the release of the report have the opposite of its intended affect and help Biden instead of Trump. You see, Trump is a Narcissist, which means he can\u2019t really empathize with other people or understand what motivates them. Instead he thinks that everyone is exactly like he is - that they are willing to ignore ethics, morality and the law in order to get what they want. He quite literally cannot imagine that someone might be motivated by anything other than self-interest. In Trump\u2019s world-view, every successful person has violated multiple laws, stepped on other people, cheated and lied to get where they are - they just hide their actions in order to fake \u201cbeing good\u201d. So, in Trump\u2019s mind, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton must have committed a series of crimes in order to achieve what they did. So Trump set John Durham, the Attorney General for the District of Connecticut, to dig up and expose those crimes. Trump especially wanted proof that the Obama Administration had \u201cspied on\u201d or otherwise attacked the Trump Campaign in 2016. The Durham report was supposed to show that Obama, Biden and Clinton had committed multiple felonies; that Russia had NOT interfered with the 2016 election; that the Trump Campaign had no ties to Russia\u2019s government; and that Joe and Hunter Biden had done illegal things in Ukraine. It was supposed to provide enough evidence for Bill Barr to indict Obama, Clinton and Hunter Biden - demonstrating that the Democrats were more corrupt than Trump and turning the tide of the election so that Trump would be reelected. And it did none of that, and Trump is absolutely furious. In Trump\u2019s mind the evidence must be there because everyone is just as venal and corrupt as he himself is. To Trump the lack of evidence doesn\u2019t mean that there was no crime - it means that his enemies merely hid their crimes better than he could. But Trump continues to behave as if the Durham Report said what he wanted it to say, and is calling for the indictment/ arrest of his political opponents - apparently not realizing that this sort of authoritarian behavior is actually causing him to lose votes. So that is what Trump\u2019s \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d was supposed to be. The actual \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d was Trump catching Covid-19 and needing to be hospitalized for it. Despite all of his talk about being \u201ccured\u201d and \u201cimmune\u201d, it is still fairly obvious that Trump is very ill and receiving treatment. He has band-aids from where the doctor\u2019s have inserted IV lines, his voice is hoarse and he coughs and seems out of breath. A second \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d was the New York Times revealing details of Trump\u2019s tax returns. These returns (which Trump has not disputed are his) show a man whose businesses are failing, who has used illegal tax dodges and who is deep in debt to foreign entities - debts which start coming due in just two years. So that is what Trump meant when he spoke about an \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d and that is what the \u201cOctober Surprises\u201d actually turned out to be. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d is going to be that he doesn\u2019t have an October Surprise, but he\u2019ll pretend he does and it\u2019s just so awesome, the Deep State says he\u2019s not allowed to reveal it, even though he\u2019s the president\u2026 that\u2019s why he has to be reelected, so he can continue to fight the Deep State\u2026 and he\u2019ll be sure to defeat them, if he knows he doesn\u2019t have to worry about being reelected again\u2026 Because Trump is only a pretender at heart. He\u2019s a cowardly child who likes to pretend he\u2019s a hero, an insecure person who compensates by pretending he\u2019s a bully, but only against those not strong enough to fight back, or not in a position to fight back. He\u2019s President Walter Mitty, except that Walter was harmless guy who knew his limitations and kept his fantasies in his head. The last president we had like this was Nixon but when it mattered, in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Nixon\u2019s Secretary of State Kissinger and his Chief of Staff Al Haig kept Nixon in Florida specifically to head off any \u201cWalter Mitty\u201d hysterics that Nixon might try to act out. Trump pretended to ace his SAT\u2019s, while he paid someone else to take them; He pretended that he graduated \u201cat the top of his class at Wharton\u201d, when it\u2019s clear that he didn\u2019t even make Dean\u2019s list that year, which meant he ranked no higher than 56 in a class of 338, so he was not in the top 10 per cent. He didn\u2019t even crack the top 15 per cent. He just didn\u2019t want to do the work to accomplish it. He pretended to have bone spurs to dodge the draft. He pretended to be a successful, shrewd real estate developer, but needed his father\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars to bail him out many times. He pretended to be a shrewd businessman, but every business he launched - steaks, the shuttle, the game, the vodka, the water, the magazine, casinos, the \u201cuniversity,\u201d they all crashed and burned. All of them failed. Some were bad ideas, like the steaks, and the vodka, but some were good ideas, like the shuttle. He wanted to be successful, but he just didn\u2019t want to do the work to accomplish it. So it all failed and went plumb to hell, but he pretended he was a success anyway. He pretended to be a great negotiator, but he usually wasn\u2019t ever going to pay what he contracted to, and knew it. He was always negotiating in bad faith. He could have made good deals, but he didn\u2019t want to sweat the details. He didn\u2019t want to dot all his i\u2019s and cross all his t\u2019s. But he pretends to be a great negotiator anyway. He pretended to run a philanthropic foundation, but it was just a scam to attract donations, which he would spend on himself, or dole out for special favors; but he pretends to be a great philanthropist anyway. He pretended he wrote his autobiography, but it was ghost written. But he pretends to be a great writer anyway. He found his niche as a reality TV star, where everything is as sham and fake and done while the cameras are rolling, and stops when they\u2019re shut off. He\u2019s spent the last four years pretending to be the president. He really wanted to beat the pandemic. He wanted to be successful at it, but he just didn\u2019t want to do the work to accomplish it. So it all failed and went plumb to hell, but he pretended he had a great success dealing with the pandemic anyway. He told the the factory workers in the rust belt States that he would bring their jobs back and companies are opening up factories there and hiring thousands. But they are not building factories there. But he\u2019s pretending they are, anyway. He wanted to build thousands of miles of sturdy wall on the Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it. But he\u2019s only built a few miles of fencing, and some of that falls down in a strong wind.. but he\u2019s pretending he built a lot of it anyway. He wants to open the economy up fully, like other nations were doing. They did the work of a national shut-down, a national mask mandate, a national policy of social distancing and government assistance to all those for whom being unemployed for a few months would be a financial hardship; their medical needs, including home care, were always covered anyway. So Trump wants to reopen too, but he didn\u2019t do the work of leading us through the hardships to be ready to do that. But he\u2019s pretending he did, anyway. Now, he\u2019s running a terrible campaign. He\u2019s losing substantially in States where Republicans haven\u2019t lost in a very long time. But he\u2019s pretending that he\u2019s running a great campaign anyway. So, he has no October surprise. Everything he had planned has failed, whether it was the Durham report, the Palestinian deal, repealing the ACA, arrests of Biden, Obama or Clinton, a Covid-19 vaccine. And he\u2019s setting up for November, when he\u2019ll lose the election\u2026 but he\u2019ll be able to pretend he won anyway. ",
