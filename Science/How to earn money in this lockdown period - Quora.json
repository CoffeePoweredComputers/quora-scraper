            "answer_text": "The corona virus pandemic isn\u2019t just a health crisis \u2013 millions of people worldwide have also seen an impact to their jobs, whether in reduced hours, different working patterns, or losing work entirely. A third of people in the UK have been economically affected, with under-25s and women worst off. If you\u2019re one of these people, you might be looking for methods to make ends meet. We\u2019ve put together a handy list of 27 ways to make some additional money during the corona virus lock down \u2013 including everything from one-off tasks to ideas that may end up as an additional income stream even after the lock down has been lifted.  1 Check for government schemes and plans There are a huge number of government plans created to support people who are in financial hardship because of the lock down. Look up your local options and make sure that you\u2019re taking advantage of everything that you\u2019re eligible for. In the UK, this includes furloughed wages if you\u2019re employed or a taxable grant if you\u2019re self-employed and submitted a filed tax return for 2018/2019. While this isn\u2019t necessarily \u2018making money\u2019 it\u2019s an essential first step if you need to make up lost income. For more info, check out our blog on what to do if you\u2019ve been made unemployed due to corona virus. 2 Get paid to write online If you\u2019ve always wanted to be a writer, what better time to start than during lock down? While a lot of online writing jobs don\u2019t pay, there are still quite a few websites where you can make money by creating high quality, relevant content. You can get started by looking at: List verse: a listicle website that will pay $100 per accepted article.Long reads: a long-form content site that pays competitive rates. The website doesn\u2019t specify the amount paid but other websites and blogs have stated rates of $500-$1,500.Back2college: a site aimed at older students will pay $55+ per accepted article.All Pet Voices: a pet website that pays $75 per accepted article.iWorkWell: a website for HR professionals and SMEs that pays $200 per accepted article.Loaded Landcapes: a photography website that pays $20-150 per accepted article.Income Diary: a website focussed on making money online that pays $200-$500 per accepted article.A Fine Parent: a parenting website that pays $75 per accepted article. All of these sites only pay for accepted articles, so make sure that you review their criteria and read through the websites for an idea of their existing content and style before you start. Some websites also prefer to receive pitches before the main article. While a lot of freelance writers have regular clients, writing for some select websites allows you to build up a portfolio, create a niche, and work up to higher-paying and more reliable income, if that\u2019s something that you want to pursue. 3 Become a virtual assistant If you\u2019re a good communicator, have strong digital skills, and excellent organisational skills, you could work as a virtual assistant. You will need to accurately type at a speed of 80-100 wpm, work well remotely, and adjust to the needs of the business or person that you are assisting, but this is one of the more long-term and reliable options to make additional money during lockdown. There are a number of virtual assistant websites like Virtalent and 24/7 Virtual Assistants, offering $10-12ph and 20-120 hours per month. However, these websites typically require extensive experience within the sector before they will take you on. If you\u2019re new to being a VA or PA, you can apply for jobs on jobs websites like Reed, TotalJobs, or Glassdoor. If you\u2019d like to brush up on your skills or improve your CV before you apply, you can take some free courses that can help you get hired by improving your communication, growing your digital skills, or just learning how to write a great job application. 4 Have a clear-out If you\u2019re sitting at home 23 hours a day, you might notice the clutter a lot more than usual. Luckily, online auction sites and retailers are still open so you can follow lockdown rules while turning your unwanted belongings into cash. Some sites even offer collection from your door during lockdown.  These websites are a great place to start once you\u2019ve identified the items you\u2019d like to sell: Ebay is a great place to sell anything from garden furniture to old clothes and shoes.Webuybooks will buy books, CDs, DVDs, and games.Music Magpie will buy phones, MacBooks, CDs, DVDs, games, books, and lego.Cex will buy phones, laptops, game consoles, DVD players, smartwatches, assorted tech, and DVDs/games.5 Get crafty Some people have managed to discover new hobbies during lockdown, or remember old projects. If you\u2019re into arts and crafts, you could turn that hobby into an additional income. You can make your own jewellery, homemade cards, print t-shirts, upcycle things around the house, or even make beautiful terrariums to sell on sites like Etsy. Not all crafts sell well or will make a profit, so before you get started it\u2019s a good idea to check out what\u2019s already on there, how much it sells for, and compare it to what you\u2019d expect for the time, effort, and spend associated with it. You can also see how much competition there is, and decide how you will make your own crafts stand out. 6 Make money by taking surveys If you\u2019d prefer a lower investment in both time and expense, you can make money by responding to surveys online. You can even do this while you\u2019re binge-watching Netflix. The rewards depend on the website \u2013 some offer vouchers but a lot of them also payout via PayPal or directly to your bank. While it is relatively low-effort, it can also time quite a lot of time to build up your earnings \u2013 surveys pay as little as \u00a30.05 and as much as \u00a310 each, with the majority towards the lower end of the spectrum. You can get started with sites like YouGov, Prolific, Swagbucks, LifePoints, Survey Junkie, and OneOpinion. 7 Rent out your driveway If you have some driveway space and live in a busy area or city, you may be able to make an income from renting out that space. The need for additional parking may have increased in your area, as people are at home more during lockdown and need to park all their household vehicles at once. Websites like Just Park or Your Parking Space make it easy to find people who are looking for parking spots, and take a lot of the confusion out of admin and managing this additional income stream. 8 Rent out your car If the public transport in your area is on a skeleton service or people in your neighbourhood need to make larger purchases, you could also make money by renting out your car. Websites like Get Around help to connect car owners with potential renters. If you\u2019re considering this, it\u2019s important to weigh the risks against your own situation as car surfaces can hold bacteria and viruses well after people have returned the rental. 9 Try online tutoring Now that schools and colleges have closed, there\u2019s been a huge increase in parents looking for online tutors for their children. If you have in-depth knowledge around a particular subject, great communication skills, and feel that you have the right temperament to keep your students engaged and nurture their interest, you can apply to a variety of online tutoring websites that link up tutors with students. Some focus on academic subjects but others offer the chance to teach music, crafts, and other skills. If teaching for the first time feels daunting or you don\u2019t know where to start with a lesson plan, we have a range of free courses specifically designed for teachers. They can help you become a better music teacher, plan a great English lesson, or provide a grounding in how to teach online. 10 Sell your photographs If you\u2019re interested in photography or have lots of photographs on your hard drive, why not try selling them online? Businesses are creating a lot more online content at the moment, so the right images and themes could help you earn some money. Rather than uploading a lot of landscapes and only selling what you have, take a look at the kinds of images that business websites, news websites, and blogs have been using over the last few weeks. Try to shoot images around those themes and stay on top of what\u2019s in demand at the moment. Stock photography sites like Shutterstock, Alamy, Getty, and iStock take a commission from sales and allow people to find your images based on keyword searches. 11 Switch bank accounts Switching bank accounts can be a pain, but a lot of high street banks offer switching bonuses for people who move and for people who recommend banks to their friends. Some of the accounts require a minimum monthly deposit, but others don\u2019t have specific requirements. You can see recommendations and compare your options on websites like Love Money. 12 Make sure you\u2019re getting rewards and cashback While you\u2019re reviewing your bank account, make sure that you\u2019re registered for rewards and cashback wherever possible. Some bank accounts offer cashback on spending, and you may be eligible for rewards schemes. If not, you can still register for schemes that let you get cashback when you spend online via sites like QuidCo. 13 Get paid to test websites You can make money by testing out websites and letting businesses know whether or not they\u2019re user-friendly. Small adjustments can make a lot of money for people selling online, so it makes sense for them to get opinions from their target audience, rather than just their own marketing and development teams. You can get paid $5-$90 per test or interview, but most tests are around $10 and will be paid directly into your PayPal.  You can get started with these sites: User TestingUserlyticsTry my UIUserfeelYou don\u2019t need to be a digital expert to make a good tester, you just need to answer the questions honestly and understand what you\u2019re looking for. But if you\u2019re interested in brushing up on your knowledge, we have a free user experience course from Accenture to help you understand the questions and decision-making process. 14 Make money by staying healthy If you wanted to lose weight during lockdown, you can stay on track and actually get paid for it. My Achievement works with a variety of popular fitness apps and gives you points for anything from logging diet information and taking surveys through to exercising or meditating. You can earn $10 for every 10,000 points and choose from activities based on the number of points they give you. You\u2019ll also be contributing to health research while you do it. 15 Get paid to transcribe audio Transcription has always been a popular job to do from home \u2013 pay tends to start at $20 per audio hour, and how quickly you can transcribe will define the pay per hour worked. The increase in online video content has fuelled a rise in demand for transcription services, but speech to text software is also getting better so it can be a tough industry. Websites such as GoTranscript and Transcribe Me can help you to get started. 16 Start a blog or website Popular websites and blogs earn hundreds if not thousands through affiliate marketing, advertising, and brand partnerships. Now that everybody is at home during lockdown, lots of websites are seeing a boom in traffic and it could be a good time to build an audience. Creating a blog that makes money definitely isn\u2019t a short-term fix, but it could provide income over the long-term if you\u2019re dedicated and willing to learn how digital marketing works. Most successful blogs either get the majority of their traffic through organic search (via a process called SEO) or via social media by building a quality following. If you\u2019re not sure where to start, we have some free courses on digital marketing, social media, and web analytics to help. 17 Become a delivery driver It\u2019s no secret that there\u2019s a huge demand for delivery drivers at the moment \u2013 both to deliver online shopping for food delivery services. Despite tough prospects across a range of industries, there is still a huge need for delivery drivers but it is one of the riskier ways of making money given current transmission rates.  If you\u2019re considering this option, it\u2019s important to consider your risk category and the risk to others in your household. 18 Publish a book on Kindle In 2019, Amazon paid over $300 million to self-published authors on its Kindle platform. While it\u2019s a very competitive marketplace, it has been incredibly lucrative to those who have managed to build a following and gain additional income from Kindle Unlimited. The financial barriers to entry are low and you can decide how much you charge for your books. If you like the idea but you\u2019re not sure where to start, we have a free course to help you start writing fiction. 19 Become a clickworker Clickworker is another website that offers gigs and tasks that you can do at home. The site states that you make an average of $9 per hour but may be able to make more than that with time. The tasks include everything from categorisation to recording audio, so you should be able to find something that you\u2019re comfortable with. 20 Check if you\u2019re due a student loan rebate A total of \u00a3308 million was overpaid to The Student Loans Company in 2009/2010 and 2017/2018 and while most of it has been refunded, around a tenth was still waiting to be claimed in early March. If you haven\u2019t had a letter from the company recently and suspect they have an old address on the system, it\u2019s worth getting in touch to see whether you\u2019re due a rebate. You can call The Student Loans Company directly and go through their security questions to make sure that your file is up to date and see whether you\u2019re owed any money. 21 Put up some gigs on fiverr Fiverr is a freelancing marketplace that used to advertise the majority of tasks for $5. The current marketplace is less restrictive, but the expectation is typically that people will pay $5-20 for anything from marketing tasks through to relationship advice. You can browse the categories to see what\u2019s on offer before deciding on what you want to advertise. Most of the work is bespoke, but if you want to scale your earnings it\u2019s a good idea to advertise work that you\u2019ve already done, such as creating a guide or ebook that people can buy as a pdf. 22 Get paid for your music opinions If you\u2019d like to listen to some new music while you make money, Slice the Pie is a good place to start. You get paid to listen to at least 90 seconds of a track and review it. The pay rates depend on your star rating (which increases with the number of reviews you submit) and the number of words in your review. Unfortunately, your 2 cents aren\u2019t paid much more than that, so it takes a long time to build up enough money to withdraw but it may be one of the more enjoyable activities on this list. 23 Become a dog walker Animal lovers can make friends with some new dogs and earn money too. Although people are at home on lockdown, some people may have to still work long hours or be unable to take their dogs out, so there are still opportunities to get dog walking gigs. Just make sure that you follow social distancing rules when picking up your canine companions and throughout the walks too. 24 Sell your story If you\u2019ve lived through some unusual experiences, you may be able to make money from your story. Magazines and websites will pay for everything from extreme weight loss through to family drama and first-person accounts of dramatic incidents. Options like Real People Mag focus on more extreme events and pay up to \u00a32,000 for featured stories. There are also groups like FeatureMe! on Facebook which feature journalists offering slightly less (typically \u00a3100-\u00a3500) for smaller features and less shocking stories. 25 Get paid to solve problems for businesses Businesses often need outside help solving problems or improving their products, which is where corporate problem solvers come in. Problem solvers need detailed knowledge of their subject and an innovative approach, but can earn $20,000-$100,000 for their solutions, as well as professional acclaim. You can register with websites like InnoCentive to review current challenges and submit your solutions \u2013 the subjects range from medicine through to tech and product design. 26 Take part in psychological experiments When you hear \u2018psychological experiment\u2019 you may think of things like the Stanford Prison Experiment but tests taking place today are very different to those in the 1970s; you can get paid for anything from taking online questionnaires through to having your eye movements tracked when looking at paintings. Universities typically recruit students but they\u2019re open to non-students as well. You can see Bristol University\u2019s current experiments here \u2013 many of them can\u2019t be completed with social distancing in place but some are available remotely and during lockdown. If you\u2019re interested in just learning a little more about psychology before diving into an experiment, you can take a range of free psychology courses (including intros aimed at beginners) with FutureLearn. 27 Change careers It\u2019s a difficult time for a lot of industries. Some jobs work easily from home and the lockdown doesn\u2019t affect them as badly, while others may still take weeks or months to recover even after lockdown is lifted. If you\u2019re concerned about your industry or want to reskill, this may be a good time to consider your options. While changing careers often comes with a drop in pay, you may be able to move to a more lucrative field and regain lost earnings quickly. This may not help to make money specifically during lockdown, but it could be a long-term investment in your future. We have a variety of free courses for people who want to change career. They can help you test out whether that career move is really for you, and get started on your new CV. You can also explore our interactive career mapper, to help set you on the right path. ",

Most of the work is bespoke, but if you want to scale your earnings it\u2019s a good idea to advertise work that you\u2019ve already done, such as creating a guide or ebook that people can buy as a pdf. 21 Get paid for your music opinions If you\u2019d like to listen to some new music while you make money, Slice the Pie is a good place to start. You get paid to listen to at least 90 seconds of a track and review it. The pay rates depend on your star rating (which increases with the number of reviews you submit) and the number of words in your review. Unfortunately, your 2 cents aren\u2019t paid much more than that, so it takes a long time to build up enough money to withdraw but it may be one of the more enjoyable activities on this list. 22 Become a dog walker Animal lovers can make friends with some new dogs and earn money too. If you\u2019re available during day times, this could be a great option for you. Plenty of people ask dog walkers to come and look after their pooch during the week, which means it\u2019s likely that you could still keep your weekends free. Or you could branch out into pet or even house-sitting for more income options. 23 Sell your story If you\u2019ve lived through some unusual experiences, you may be able to make money from your story. Magazines and websites will pay for everything from extreme weight loss through to family drama and first-person accounts of dramatic incidents. Options like Real People Mag focus on more extreme events and pay up to \u00a32,000 for featured stories. There are also groups like FeatureMe! on Facebook which feature journalists offering slightly less (typically \u00a3100-\u00a3500) for smaller features and less shocking stories. 24 Get paid to solve problems for businesses Businesses often need outside help solving problems or improving their products, which is where corporate problem solvers come in. Problem solvers need detailed knowledge of their subject and an innovative approach, but can earn $20,000-$100,000 for their solutions, as well as professional acclaim. You can register with websites like InnoCentive to review current challenges and submit your solutions \u2013 the subjects range from medicine through to tech and product design. 25 Take part in psychological experiments When you hear \u2018psychological experiment\u2019 you may think of things like the Stanford Prison Experiment but tests taking place today are very different to those in the 1970s; you can get paid for anything from taking online questionnaires through to having your eye movements tracked when looking at paintings. Universities typically recruit students but they\u2019re open to non-students as well. You can see Bristol University\u2019s current experiments here \u2013 a lot of universities run experiments if they have a psychology faculty, so just check at your local college or university to see if it\u2019s an option. If you\u2019re interested in just learning a little more about psychology before diving into an experiment, you can take a range of free psychology courses (including intros aimed at beginners) with FutureLearn. 26 Change careers If you don\u2019t feel the same sort of passion for your work that you used to, or perhaps the industry is not as healthy as it once was, it may be a good idea to consider a career change. While changing careers often comes with a drop in pay, you may be able to move to a more lucrative field and regain lost earnings quickly. This may not help to make money immediately, but it could be a long-term investment in your future. We have a variety of free courses for people who want to change career. They can help you test out whether that career move is really for you, and get started on your new CV. You can also explore our interactive career mapper, to help set you on the right path. ",

Collect vast amounts of products that people can buy online. If you have a blog, especially a WordPress blog, you can install an e-commerce store directly on your existing site. This store may sell its own products, receive full profits, or consist of affiliate products (or both). The following plug-ins allow you to install an e-commerce store on the WordPress website. WP E-CommerceWooCommerceJigoshopGet Free Lottery TicketsHitting a big jackpot could solve a lot of your problems right now. It\u2019s tempting to buy those scratch-off tickets from the gas station. But that\u2019s not the best use of your money when you\u2019re in a bind. Instead, try scratching for free using an app called Lucktastic. Each day, it releases a new assortment of digital scratch-off tickets. Lucktastic says instant wins range from $1 to $10,000, in cash or gift cards to popular retailers. The app is supported by advertising, which allows it to keep the payouts high and the games free. It\u2019s not guaranteed money, but at least Lucktastic is free to play. And hey, somebody\u2019s gotta win. Take single dad Oneil Campbell, from Boston. He was shocked when he won a $5,000 Lucktastic prize. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that one coming,\u201d Campbell says with a laugh. \u201cI really didn\u2019t. This is something good that happened to me at the right time \u2014 when I can really use it.\u201d Search Your Wallet and Cash in on Your Dollar BillsSpecifically, dollar bills with strange serial numbers \u2014 ones that aren\u2019t easy to come by. The collectors at CoolSerialNumbers.com - Home will pay you big bucks if you have a bill with a rare sequence in your wallet.Turns out antique coins aren\u2019t the only currency worth cash to collectors. Check out their website for a full list to see if you\u2019ve got any of these rare bills, but here\u2019s a rundown of the sort of serial numbers these collectors are looking for: 7 repeating digits in a row on $1 Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. 09999999, 77777776)7 of a kind on $1 Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. 00010000, 99999099)Super repeaters on $1 Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. 67676767)Double quads on $1 Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. 00009999)and more!Earn $225/Month By Watching Cooking VideosIf we told you that you could get paid to watch videos on your computer, you\u2019d probably laugh.It\u2019s too good to be true, right? But we\u2019re serious. A website called InboxDollars will pay you to watch short video clips online. One minute you might watch someone bake brownies and the next you might get the latest updates on Kardashian drama. All you have to do is choose which videos you want to watch and answer a few quick questions about them afterward. No, InboxDollars won\u2019t replace your full-time job, but it\u2019s something easy you can do while you\u2019re already on the couch tonight wasting time on your phone. Unlike other sites, InboxDollars pays you in cash \u2014 no points or gift cards. It\u2019s already paid its users more than $56 million. It takes about one minute to sign up, and you\u2019ll immediately get a $5 bonus to get you started. ",

            "answer_text": "While lots of schemes on the internet which promise to give you an opportunity to earn some money from home end up being scams or at best, reward you with so little for so much effort, there are a few that are genuine and that keep to their promise. One of such reliable schemes, which I have regularly patronized to earn myself some cool money during this lockdown, is Winplay.app. Winplay.app is a platform that gives you an opportunity to create awareness about cryptocurrencies, blockchain projects, crypto exchanges etc, while rewarding you with valuable crypto tokens for your efforts. You can easily trade the tokens you earned on any exchange where the token is listed, and make some money as a result. How does Winplay.app work? Winplay.app makes available easy tasks that you can do to earn points. Usually, the more points you earn by completing as many tasks as possible, the higher you climb on the Leaderboard which will give you a chance to earn higher rewards at the end of the campaign. Some of these tasks include Twitter share, Facebook share, Article Creation, Video Content creation, Twitter follow etc. For example, a campaign currently ongoing, which will end in a couple of hours, is the Noia 350,000 NOIA Giveaway.  This particular campaign promotes the NOIA blockchain project, and rewards the top 500 participants with a total of 350,000 NOIA tokens. To earn money on the Winplay platform, simply click on the Winplay website, and sign up for an account with your email address.  Then verify your phone number through either Telegram or Whatsapp.  After successful verification of your phone number, a confirmation link will be sent to your registered email address. Click on that link to verify your account. Once you have done that, your account becomes fully activated, and you will gain access to the platform where you will be able to join any available giveaway campaign, do simple tasks, play mini games and take part in a lucky draw etc to win points. Earning money through the Winplay platform is easy, and I have participated in at least fifteen (15) Giveaway campaigns where I won for myself a good amount of crypto tokens worth more than $700 in all.

            "answer_text": "We live in a moment where making money online has become a necessity rather than just an option to explore. The world is headed towards a digital, and technological shift, which means that many of the traditional ways of making money are becoming obsolete. Many brick and mortar businesses shut their doors for good, and over the years this has proven to be an uprising trend. It\u2019s happening all over the world, and we can't stop it, so we might as well learn to adapt to it. Learn Something New  It\u2019s time to learn a new skill. More specifically, it\u2019s time to learn a DIGITAL skill. Something that can be done from the comforts of your own home, and is IN DEMAND, right now. There are many options to choose from, but I will be focusing on the ones that have the highest potential of creating a full-time online income (in my opinion). You can learn more about my favorite choice here. Before I get into that, there is something important that I want to mention first. Avoid Online Scams  You see, there are many online scammers and low-quality services out there that can mislead people into thinking that they can make a lot of money fast and easy without actually putting in the work. Basically they promise a lot but deliver nothing. I\u2019m only saying this because right now there\u2019s a lot of people who are trying to take advantage of all the panic that\u2019s going out in the world, to try and make a quick buck out of unsuspecting people, and scam them out of their money. If you come across something that sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it probably is. How To Make Money Online  There are many different ways of making money online, here are some of them. Become a Freelancer. If you already have some digital skills that are in demand then this can help you a lot. If not, well maybe it\u2019s time to learn. You should know that this has become an extremely competitive field so you would need to stand out in order to land gigs on a consistent basis. Many bloggers and digital marketers outsource portions of their work because it can be difficult to be on top of everything all of the time. You can become a content writer for blogs, and get paid for that. On the other side of the coin, you can choose to learn the skills of affiliate marketing, and combine that with blogging. This can open the doors for a long-lasting and sustainable passive income stream. It is a skill, so it takes time to learn, and become good at it, just like anything else in life. But if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort, it can be well worth it. By taking advantage of this digital shift, you can put yourself right in the middle of all the money being spent online, and take a portion of that for yourself. The income potential is huge, and the great thing is that you don\u2019t even have to be good at selling things to people. In fact, you don\u2019t even have to talk to them. All you have to do is learn how to identify what people are searching for online and provide them with a virtual \u201cbridge\u201d that will take them to exactly where they want to be.[1] Footnotes[1] Become The Next Online Success Story | Wealthy By Default",

It\u2019s a social platform for neighborhoods to communicate with each other (e.g.,for sale items, neighborhood news/posts, etc.). Membership is free and specific for each neighborhood - you can only join the neighborhood you live in. You can make a post about looking for work and some of your neighbors might reach out to hire you for gig work. Neighbors seem to be more willing to help support people in their own neighborhood. One neighbor put up a post asking for kids willing to be sidewalk chalk artists, and offered them $20 each to create uplifting, positive artwork. You can also do this same thing on Facebook Marketplace. GIG WORK IDEAS: Lawn mowing and yard maintenanceCar washingGrocery shopping servicesFruit harvesting. Many trees are bearing fruit right now - offer a service to pick these and bag the fruit for them. You could also negotiate to keep a portion of the harvest for your family.Sell some of your unneeded items on Facebook Marketplace or NextDoorAre you creative? You can buy materials online and open an Etsy shop to sell your wares. Treat it like a real business and it can help you out. I\u2019ve done this before and was surprised. This can be real money if you put the effort in.Do you speak another language? Maybe you can offer private language tutorials and translation services.Just offer general help for hire, and neighbors will tell you what they needThink of anything you\u2019re decently good at and see if you can turn it into a service to help people that they\u2019d be willing to pay for. Outside of that, you can create a business if you have extra spare time and some ideas. Now may be as good a time as ever to brainstorm and try your hand at something you\u2019ve been thinking of or a new venture. You can take online courses to qualify you for some jobs that you may be able to do remotely. These might not be the best or most ideal options, but it\u2019s a start to get the wheels turning. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, see there are a lot of options you can try. As one can\u2019t go out, the advantage of working from home has emerged for many people. Like if a person doesn\u2019t lives in a remote area and doesn\u2019t want to go somewhere for joining, it is a good opportunity. So, I am going to tell earning practices one can do in lockdown. Freelancing: Freelancing is really good platform which pays off quite well. One can start freelancing on websites like http://Freelancer.com , Fiverr, UpWork. These sites are legit and really pay well. There is a wide range of jobs like data entry, web design, conversion of word file to PDF format, and many more.Internships: You can apply for internships on platforms like Internshala and Futwork(Frapp). They also provide good options.Content Writing: Now-a-days, the demand for content and article writers have increased much. One can apply for content writing, Ghost writing, technical writing, and much more.Social Media Marketing: The craze of social media has increased extensively since past few years. Now, it has become a source of marketing also. Many companies need people who can handle their page and post content. So if you are a social butterfly, you can give it a chance.Paid Survey: There are many platforms which pay you hard cash for submitting some surveys. Many companies need review and for that they take survey to know the need of people. Websites like Swagbucks, Toluna Surveys, Google opinion rewards, and so on.I think that\u2019s enough for now. There are many more options like affiliate marketing, blogging, marketing products on Meesho app, transcribing, proofreading. Although it\u2019s a huge list but nothing is too huge is you make start.

            "answer_text": "IN THE WAKE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AND SO MANY COUNTRIES GOING INTO SHUTDOWN, LIFE HAS CHANGED. The global coronavirus pandemic has been rampaging through the world affecting not just health, but economies and livelihood. It may or may not have affected you directly but indirectly, all our lives have taken quite a turn. According to reports, within the first week of April, 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment. Global unemployment is already at 190 million. No matter which part of the world, the pandemic has dealt a catastrophic blow on the workforce. Some have completely lost work, while others are facing a loss of income because of less work, and the rest have immense work pressure. At this time, no one is really sure when the world will return to normal and that means this might continue for a while. At least for the foreseeable future, we are going to be in our homes. And since our work life has taken a complete u-turn, a lot of us are currently feeling lost, finding a lot of time on our hands, binging on Netflix, stuffing ourselves with junk food, and feeling completely restless! Does that sound familiar? I know, you\u2019re also worried. You don\u2019t know where the next paycheck is coming from and when. Financial security plays a huge part in our wellbeing and overall mood. Currently, you don\u2019t know what is going to happen next and how you will take care of yourself and your family. On the other spectrum, if you\u2019ve been able to transition your work online, you may find yourself working longer hours than usual. You may feel disillusioned, exhausted, and undervalued. You\u2019re probably getting paid less than before, and you\u2019re addled with all these sudden changes. You\u2019ve been wondering if this is how you want to go on. Or do you want to make a change? How does one find work that doesn\u2019t just pay well, but is also fulfilling (work you can do on your own terms?) Don\u2019t lose hope because the digital world presents immense opportunities. During this global crisis, let\u2019s try and make the best of the situation. In fact, the changes that this has brought about in your life could be the major transformation you need to propel your life forward. We can look at events that send us out of work as a huge disappointment, considering that we have to explore new career options, but the truth is that this could be the time for you to completely reshape your destiny. To get out of struggling for a paycheck each and every single month and instead create the lifestyle of your dreams. There\u2019s a way for you to do this while at home, just with three to four hours a day. And the best part of it all is you can do it while spending time with your family and loved ones, AND while collect an unemployment check. Like I said, staying at home has become our new normal so we might as well start looking at how to work the situation to our advantage. HOW CAN YOU UTILIZE THE BENEFITS OF STAYING HOME RIGHT NOW? We are at a time in life when it is up to us to take control of our destiny. Even though we must stay home right now, it is up to us to take charge of our happiness. No matter what your background or your talents, there\u2019s a silver lining to be found in staying home. Think about this: What if you could earn money staying at home? What if it\u2019s something you can continue doing long after the lockdown is over? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if you can start earning for your dream lifestyle right now and save up for traveling once the pandemic subsides? One thing this pandemic has made very clear is that a lot of us have the ability to work from home. While you\u2019re staying home right now to survive a health crisis, eventually working from home might become the new norm. WHY YOU SHOULD BE GETTING INTO DAY TRADING RIGHT NOW While this might seem like a weird time to start a new career, there are actually plenty of reasons why you should. You need to breathe new life into your career. You are either stuck in a low paying, high-stress job, or suffering unemployment. In either case, you\u2019re stuck at home mulling over the overhaul your life needs to take and stressing out even more because you have the time to. Well, now is the time to utilize YOUR time to make changes! Today!! Starting a career in day trading means you\u2019ll spend at least a few months (to a year) learning the ropes and gaining knowledge. Make use of that time right away. You could spend your extra time right now binge watching Netflix or you could utilize it learning a skill that can change your destiny. I\u2019m a true believer that you can learn anything if you put your mind to it. The economy may be uncertain right now, but your ability to gain new knowledge never will be. If I never got into day trading, chances are I would\u2019ve been sent back to China after college. But I took a risk and decided to dive deep into the topic of day trading. I read every book I could read on the topic, studied graphs and took every single course possible. Through all of this research, I found a lot of stuff that didn\u2019t work\u2026 But I did find eight strategies that continued to work time and time again. And with those strategies, I created a portfolio that has made over $5 million in the last five years. I went from having no career options to reshaping my entire life. And it\u2019s not just me who has been able to do it! I have students who have replaced the income at their jobs, a few who have earned six figures a year day trading, and some who are earning seven figures each year. And while all of this may sound too good to be true, it\u2019s really not the case. Day trading is a combination of math and basic human psychology. There are graphs you can look at that continue down the same patterns each and every single time. Some as consistent as 75 to 85%. That means that out of every 100 times you make a move on the same graph, you\u2019re winning 85% of the time. When you think of the returns for that within a year, your income has the ability to compound significantly. A lot of investors look at earning 10% a year when they go and trade. And if you have a million dollars to go and put into the market, you\u2019re looking at earning a clean $100,000 a year. But if you are starting out where you\u2019re on unemployment or if you just have less than $10,000 in the bank, a return like that isn\u2019t going to do anything for your career. That\u2019s how I felt when I first started with my $27,000 investment. I knew that if I only got a return of $2,700 for the year, that I would be the first one to head back into a plane and get off on the next flight in China. I came here with limited knowledge of the English language and couldn\u2019t really see myself finding an industry to make a lot of money in. I wanted to do real estate but I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the contracts. So I found something that I could understand, even with language barriers. I took a deep dive into day trading because numbers and graphs are universal and understandable, no matter what language you speak. And I\u2019m so glad I did, because this industry completely changed the entire trajectory of my life. And just like it\u2019s changed my life, I know it can change yours. Especially during this time, where people around the world are seriously considering a way to make extra money. Now the difficult thing about situations like this is it puts a lot of people into fear: Where fear and uncertainty makes you panic and become scared of what will come tomorrow\u2026Where bills pile up and you fear you\u2019ll lose your home and face financial collapse\u2026The government is doing what it can to help with bailouts and stimulus checks. But this isn\u2019t enough to get you a permanent situation to take control of your life. You need to put your family first and take the initiative to keep your family alive and breathing. Then get them to thrive. It\u2019s your destiny to thrive. To stand out and overcome this adversity that came your way from this pandemic. To step up and reshape your entire destiny. It\u2019s not going to be easy and it\u2019s going to take a lot of studying and hard work, plus you\u2019re going to need a mentor to guide your way. But before getting into all of that, let me first explain what a day trader does so you can see if this is the right career move for you to make. WHAT DOES A DAY TRADER DO? A day trader, as the name suggests, trades stocks within the same day i.e. buying and selling on the same day without carrying them to the next morning. This is often done multiple times a day. The objective is to earn small profits every day that stack up over time. And what they also do is they can flip things around and bet the other way. Where they see trends going downwards and they make a bet that the stock is going down (this is called short selling, or shorting). As an investor of five years and having studied the statistics relentlessly, the numbers have proven that 94% of day traders fail. That means only 6% of them are making money. And while that would scare off most people from trying to even get into the industry, let me explain why people fail like this. It\u2019s because they get their emotions involved and wait for an upwards swing, thinking a stock is going to continue to go up. And then more people rally in on the ride up, thinking they\u2019re going to get rich. While this all happens, there comes a tipping point where a stock starts to go down. And these novice investors who ride the emotional wave of getting rich start to panic. They sell their stocks or hold on too long, then get wiped out in the market. And this happens time and time again. How I make money, and how my students make money is that they look out for this exact same thing happening. Instead of riding the upwards trends, they ride on the downward trends. And when a stock falls, they are able to get a 25-35% return on their investment. With $3,000, you could look at getting a return of $1,000 on a trade like that. And if that continues to happen 75% of the time, you could see yourself quickly making a lot more money. But it takes a lot of practice, mentorship and paper trades to really get to that point. WANT TO BECOME A DAY TRADER? HERE\u2019S HOW TO GET STARTED Now here\u2019s why this is a crucial time in history. Never before have we collectively had as much time and the need to make a change in our lives. This is why I think now is the moment to get started in day trading and change your destiny. Now that the seed for day trading has been planted in your head, in order to change your destiny, you are wondering how to get started. Success in day trading doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It takes time and patience. You need knowledge and skills. The accumulation of that knowledge is a time-consuming exercise that bears fruit at least a year down the line. Hence, this is not a get rich quick scheme. For new traders, this is what I suggest to help get you started with day trading: 1. KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE: The time on your hands that we\u2019ve been speaking of? This is where most of it should be going. The good news is, you\u2019re contemplating making a change in your life during quarantine, you are reading about how to find a new career and your knowledge building process has already begun. You\u2019ve come to the right place. Use this time to get yourself acquainted with day trading and its nuances. When I first started, I attended seminars and met other successful traders. I listened to their stories and studied their own techniques and patterns. It\u2019s time for you to do the same so you can build your own wealth of knowledge during quarantine at home. 2. CAPITAL: In the beginning, it\u2019s important you only invest what you\u2019re able to (and willing to) lose. And right now that will be a crucial decision. I also recommend my students start with at least $3,000 of investment. You can start with less, but $3,000 gives you the leverage you need to build momentum. With this, you set yourself up for potential success from the very onset. Whereas if you start with less than this, you don\u2019t give yourself enough room to work with. The money you make won\u2019t give you the traction you need, and the commissions you have to pay will eat into most of your profits. So if you don\u2019t have $3,000 that you can comfortably spare, begin saving now. In the meantime, study the markets, expand your knowledge, and create a Plan!! 3. CREATE A PLAN: This will be the beginning of a new career for you so start with a plan. Start prepared. Day trading is nothing less than a business. You cannot start blindly and hence you need to have a plan with strategy and goals. It\u2019s crucial that this plan includes risk management and an exit strategy. As much as you\u2019d want to owing to the time you have on your hands, you cannot jump into day trading and expect overnight success. Now that you\u2019re at home, invest some time building a plan. Your plan must include the following: RISK MANAGEMENT: In order to become a seasoned, successful and profitable day trader, proper risk management is critical. Whenever I am mentoring newcomers, I notice that a lot of them don\u2019t pay attention to risk management. Many of them assume that it will hold them back from success in day trading. It is actually the opposite! Proper risk management can actually set you up for success. Meticulous risk management ensures your losses remain small and don\u2019t turn into big ones before you even notice. Determining how much risk you\u2019re at ease with means calculating a profit/loss ratio, which is what you anticipate the profit will be versus what you might lose on a particular trade. Establish for yourself what the maximum percentage of overall capital you\u2019re willing to risk is. Sticking with a 1% to 3% potential loss, the overall risk remains low and gives you room to make more trades in a day. I call this The 1% rule It signifies that the maximum risk you take is no more than 1 percent on a single trade. With several trades in a day, keeping risk at 1% means there\u2019s more than enough leverage to provide ample returns while keeping any losses minimal. It\u2019s impossible to be profitable with every single trade; hence one must be prudent enough to keep the losses low. GOAL SETTING: During your planning stage, figure out how much you want to earn by and when. Think for now and also beyond the quarantine time, whenever that will be. Having a goal in mind will help you work towards it. Should this be daily or weekly or monthly goals? There\u2019s no correct answer, especially in uncertain times like now, so do what makes the most sense for you. Whatever you decide, make sure that your goals are realistic. If you\u2019re keeping your risk at 1%, your goal for profit should be around 2% or more. Finalize percentages that work for you to keep you in this race in the long haul. PAPER TRADES: This final tip is a secret weapon! I will get into this in detail shortly. 4. TIME: At present, my workday consists 2-3 hours of day trading. Any more than this is overkill and unnecessary. It\u2019s also where a lot of traders go wrong when they transition from a part-time trader into a full time one. Having said that, in the beginning, you need to invest A LOT more than 2-3 hours each day. You need to spend most of this time studying, planning, and experimenting. This is how you build a platform so in the future you only have to work 2-3 hours each morning. Again, most new traders get this all wrong. They jump into the trades and spend too much time trading and too little studying. This is how you fail. Building a new career happens from laying the groundwork. This begins for you now. And there has never been a better time in history to do this. 5. COMMITMENT: With everyone\u2019s work-life in such great distress right now because of the quarantine, it\u2019s more important than ever to commit to taking things into your own hands. You cannot get into day trading expecting to become an overnight sensation and making money right away. This is another reason most new traders fail. Taking a few courses and reading a couple of books is not enough. When you enter the world of day trading, you need to commit to it knowing it will take priority in your work life and become your major source of income in the future. That is how you will come out of this quarantine with a profitable career in your arsenal. In the beginning, you may get restless. You may feel discouraged. Take it one day at a time and see the results of your efforts gradually blossom. You need to see the bigger picture and appreciate that this is a process of building a skill. The results will come soon enough. 6. TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS: The best way to use knowledge is to apply it using the right tools. No amount of knowledge will yield fruitful results if you don\u2019t choose the right tools. To start with, you will need scanning software. During day trading, only some stocks are worth trading in. Identifying them correctly using a scanning tool is what changes the game. The next tool you will need is charting software. Charting is the process of watching asset prices move and take a call on when to trade. Charting software is used to create and view these charts and is a useful tool to understand market movements.. During the lockdown, you should take advantage of the numerous free trading tools available to you. These tools are significant for understanding the market, analysis, scanning for stocks to trade, and formulating your trading strategy. 7. A MENTOR: I wouldn\u2019t say I have any regrets when it comes to my day trading career but it would have helped had I looked for a mentor It\u2019s helpful to have a mentor guide you. I observed and spoke to a lot of people when I first got started, but I didn\u2019t commit to a single mentor. If I had, my trading portfolio would be much larger now! A mentor gives you the right training to get started and get set up for success. Most importantly, a mentor guides you in developing your knowledge and skills so you can create your own techniques and patterns. The quicker you do this, the quicker day trading can become your primary source of income. This is how you will reshape your destiny and achieve new heights (even during a crisis). Get a mentor. Find someone you trust and follow their advice. The only piece you\u2019re missing is the knowledge on how to do this specifically for trading. This is where your mentor comes in. START SMALL WITH PRACTICE! Want to know what would be the most significant thing you will do with all this time on your hands when it comes to being prepared for day trading? Practice. What if there was a way to practice day trading without the risk of losing your money? There is. It\u2019s called Paper Trading. Paper trading allows you to buy and sell securities without risking your money. It is a kind of simulation. While you\u2019re building your expertise and honing your skills, paper trading allows you the freedom to fail and learn new patterns. It will help you see what the real deal will be like! It\u2019s a fantastic way to map out your strengths and weaknesses, play with new techniques and patterns, and manage your risk. I still use paper trades when testing new techniques. I recommend all my students do the same, especially in the beginning. In fact, I tell them to prepare for 12-months of studying the markets and experimenting with paper trades before they invest large amounts of money. It\u2019s the secret weapon most successful day traders use. Once you learn how to do the same, you too can build a very successful portfolio. Your Next Steps\u2026 If you\u2019ve read this far, it\u2019s clear you\u2019re frustrated with your work situation. The pandemic has taken a toll on your career! You give so many hours to your career yet it\u2019s giving you sleepless nights. The monetary returns just aren\u2019t enough. There is no financial security. It\u2019s been a mission of mine to help people who want to make day trading their primary source of income. Now is the time for you to get started. Now is the time for you to build your own knowledge and expertise. The longer you wait, the longer you\u2019ll remain frustrated during quarantine. Take charge of the situation! I hope you\u2019ve found this valuable and I hope you are staying safe. We will get through this. ",

            "answer_text": "This lockdown has had a huge impact on each sector but has had a small impact on online sectors. The online sector here usually means digital marketing. Here I will give you some important tips and motivation so that you can earn money from digital marketing in a very short time. When you go to achieve something big, ask yourself these three questions. ..... What is your passion. ..?2. How much you care about your work\u2026.? 3. Can you do this every day\u2026? You may know a lot about elon musk, Bill Gates and be motivated a lot but you might be instantly motivated by it. This will not have any impact on your work. So, pull out the work of love that is hidden in your own heart. Blogging is the best source of income at home in lockdown. So, you start blogging on the niche on which you have enough knowledge and love. Since you have time is short so you have to do smart work not hard work. 1. You first select a profitable niche from different niche on which you have an interest.( Find blogging niche) 2. Second, select a micro niche from the niche of interest. And create a blog on that micro niche which we call Microniche blogging. But you will notice that your micro niche wants to be profitable.( Microblogging niche) 3. You buy a domain for a small fee and buy a hosting from a good hosting provider.( Bye domain and hosting) 4. One thing to keep in mind when you start blogging is that content is king. So, you plan on content with 30 low competition keywords for three months. So, you have to publish ten blog posts a month. ( Keywords research and find 30 low compilation keywords using Google adwords, ubber suggest, semrus etc keywords tools) 5. One thing to keep in mind is that Google is much smarter than us so you need to seo if your website is to grow organically. One thing to keep in mind here is never copy someone else's content. ( Please stop spam, focus on SEO and growth organically) 6. Patience and self-reliance will publish a valuable blog post every three days. But each poster length should be above three thousand words, and you will try to give a complete guideline about that keyword in each post. ( Min length 3000 words) 7. These three months you will invest 10 hours of your life on the blog please please ......... (invest 10 hours per day, and continue 3 month) 8. In these 10 hours, you will invest 4 hours on social media marketing. One thing to always keep in mind is that no matter how good your product is, if you don't do marketing then the value of your product is zero. ( 4/10 hours investment social media marketing) 9. See your blog as a business or brand. When you market a blog post, you think you are doing brand marketing. ( Blogging as a business or your own brand) 10. Here I will not tell you anything about Adsense or affiliate, you will learn on your own when you get a lot of traffic to your blog. Please never give up. ....... I discussed in an income source details rather than telling you a thousand income sources. If I can add some value in your life through this post, please support. ",

I have been in digital marketing since 2016 so yeah I can share some real money-making tips that would help you to make real cash online. Freelancing - If a beginner looking to earn real cash online. Then go with FREELANCING. You just need to have a skill and you\u2019re good to start freelancing. You need to have a laptop and an internet connection. I am sure these two things you\u2019ll have. I recently wrote an ebook on FREELANCING! WIll launch it soon! And let me tell you in order to start freelancing you don\u2019t need to invest single rupee. As I said you just need to have a skill that can be served online such as Content Writing, Graphics Designing, Coding and so on. Affiliate marketing - If you want to actually make passive income affiliate marketing is the best option. But it requires lots of effort to generate income at an initial level. Once you cross that phase you can make a decent amount of money on a passive mode. Blogging - This one is my favourite, but Blogging is not for everyone. It requires so, much patience and time which most of the people aren\u2019t ready to put. However, blogging can give you a decent amount of passive income if you work consistently These are the methods, I believe that can give you real money. ",

I wanted to start a legitimate online business where I could earn from home. I had little money to invest just a couple of hundred bucks but had this burning desire to learn. I searched for a quite amount of time to start something with this much money. Then I came across forex trading which just requires a minimum of 100$ and you are good to go but the key point is you need knowledge first. Forex is a recession proof business and every day 6\u20137 trillion dollars are traded and its one of the largest markets of the world. It's been around 2 and half months now and I am making over 500$ every week sitting home in ny comfort trading at what ever time I want to. Hope this was helpful information, if you're interested to start and have any questions or want to know where to get started direct message me and I can share some resources. ",

If you have to cook, then cook before you start working so you can focus on your work.Don't spend entire day on work. Take some time to read, sleep, meditate also.You are getting paid for the job so do it right.I cannot stress the importance of having a proper schedule during these times. Yes you can take it slow some days. But random schedules make the day seem long and tiring with the office work, household chores, own interests etc. Take care and be safe !

We\u2019ve put together a handy list of 26 ways to make some additional money from home (or in some instances, via the gig economy) \u2013 including everything from one-off tasks to ideas that may end up as an additional income stream.  1 Get paid to write online If you\u2019ve always wanted to be a writer, what better time to start? While a lot of online writing jobs don\u2019t pay, there are still quite a few websites where you can make money by creating high quality, relevant content. You can get started by looking at: Listverse: a listicle website that will pay $100 per accepted article.Longreads: a long-form content site that pays competitive rates. The website doesn\u2019t specify the amount paid but other websites and blogs have stated rates of $500-$1,500.Back2college: a site aimed at older students will pay $55+ per accepted article.All Pet Voices: a pet website that pays $75 per accepted article.iWorkWell: a website for HR professionals and SMEs that pays $200 per accepted article.Loaded Landcapes: a photography website that pays $20-150 per accepted article.Income Diary: a website focussed on making money online that pays $200-$500 per accepted article.A Fine Parent: a parenting website that pays $75 per accepted article. All of these sites only pay for accepted articles, so make sure that you review their criteria and read through the websites for an idea of their existing content and style before you start. Some websites also prefer to receive pitches before the main article.

For example , in certain High rise Apartments , some of the residents are preparing breakfast , lunch or snacks items and selling within the gated community. All they do is to paste a notice near the lift of every block and wait for orders. Many are making good money. Basically you have to look at gaps in service areas. You may serve a group of senior citizens by bringing groceries, Rations, provisions of medicines to their door step. Most of them may not be accustomed to ordering online. Online tuitions could be a good source of income. If you have any other skills like plumbing, electrical work or even as beautician, you might be in great demand. A lot of people are losing jobs due to Covid. They need professional help. Either to find a new job or to navigate them to a new profession or business. If you are having contacts or knowledge, you can also start an online consultancy. Apart from earning money for yourself, you get the satisfaction of helping out someone in distress. Masks are there to stay. If you are creative, then make designer masks. It could be in packs of 7 , so that one can wear a new design each day of the week. ",
