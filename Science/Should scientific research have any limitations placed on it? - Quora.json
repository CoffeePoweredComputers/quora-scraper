            "answer_text": "In 1958, The International Geophysical Year started new kinds of research in oceanography and meteorology. The United States Weather Service ( as it was known then ) saw that the incoming flood of information would facilitate one of their long term goals - long term weather forecasting. This was one of the objectives they were mandated to pursue, and it was then that they had a chance to do it. Long term weather forecasting never panned out; we still can\u2019t forecast weather more than two weeks out, but an unexpected bonus arrived - climate forecasting. In the 1960s and 1970s, atmospheric science became a well developed scientific discipline, and we began to see how chemical and physical changes in the atmosphere could result in world wide alterations in the weather over decade-long periods of time. These changes could alter the agricultural productivity of many regions and affect the populations of fish in the oceans. Studies of the effects of chloroflurocarbons, carbon monoxide, volatile hydrocarbons and other man made gases revealed their interactions with upper atmosphere chemistry. Study of the ozone content of the upper atmosphere began to show subtle relationships between the absorption of sunlight, and atmospheric and oceanographic temperature. This was punctuated by the finding of a sharply increasing temperature which correlated well with the release of these gases from human activity. Industry became alarmed by these findings, as they were implicated in the release of carbon dioxide and methane. They began a continuing campaign for the government to shut down this line of research being carried on by the new weather service - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Their efforts to limit and stifle this kind of scientific research is succeeding. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. There are ethical and legal restrictions that are absolutely necessary, like informed consent and privacy protection. There are boards that make sure experiments are ethical and properly conducted, and research can\u2019t begin without their approval. What we shouldn\u2019t have is arbitrary restrictions that can\u2019t be defended objectively. For example, the University of Kentucky ordered hemp seeds from Italy for research purposes. The DEA seized the shipment. Why? Why get in the way of bona fide agricultural research studies conducted by a state university? Approval for Cannabis research is still extremely difficult to obtain. It\u2019s a Schedule I drug because it has \u201cno medical use.\u201d Well, how do we know what medical uses it has if we can\u2019t study it? I can\u2019t understand or agree with restrictions like that. This is only my personal opinion, not necessarily that of the USDA. ",
