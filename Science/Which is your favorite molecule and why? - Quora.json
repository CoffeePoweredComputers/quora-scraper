            "answer_text": "Carborane acid, or H(CHB11F11). Just see how beautiful it is:  The above picture is the molecular structure of its anion, which has a beautiful icosahedron shape, with each vertice made of a boron atom, except for one vertice made of a carbon. The carbon is attached to a hydrogen atom while the borons are attached to either a fluorine or a chlorine. It\u2019s very unusual that the carbon is covalently linked to 6 atoms instead of 4. Carborane acid is one of the strongest acids, which is even comparable to fluoroantimonic acid. Yet it\u2019s a very \u201cgentle\u201d acid, which can be safely stored in a glass bottle or even be handled by hands (just like perchloric acid). The reason is that its anion form is almost non-reactive. For comparison, fluoroantimonic acid contains hydrogen fluoride (HF), which reacts violently with a number of materials. For this reason, carborane acid is an ideal protonating agent, which can be used to catalyze some chemical reactions.

            "answer_text": "My personal choice probably comes down to two fairly different molecules so I\u2019ll breifly explain both. Water is the first purely due to the wide range of uses and the useful characteristics that it\u2019s has; a few examples being it\u2019s use as an almost universal solvent, the ability of it to act as a habitat, the density of it decreasing when it freezes meaning that the ice cubes in my drink float and it having a high latent heat of evaporation so that I cool down after sweating. The second one is probably hydrated copper(II) sulfate because of the colour. ",
