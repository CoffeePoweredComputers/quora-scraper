            "answer_text": "What are the most important things in life? Let's constrain this question to material aspects of life. And look at it from a population perspective rather that the individual's. At least that's what I did when deciding to pursue a PhD in the area.  The first thing would be the air that we breathe. Without it we wouldn't last more than a couple of minutes.  The second thing would be water. Without it we're talking not more than a few days really.  The third is food. Not medicine. Not IT. Food. Pretty cool, right?! There's also a million relevant ethical considerations in re production systems, sustainability, health, animal welfare, wealth distribution, feeding a growing population, planetary boundaries and what not. Plus food will give you some of the most intense pleasures in itself. Just imagine what it'll do when you know the whats, the whys and the hows... Considering the challenges ahead of us, it's also a chance to be part of a solution. But like most career options, something to consider and follow only if you think it'll yank you chain. It did mine and I am very happy for my choice.  ",
