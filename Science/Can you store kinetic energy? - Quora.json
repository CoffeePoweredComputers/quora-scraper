            "answer_text": "Flywheel is the basic form of this type of mechanical energy storage, the new technologies that are emerging are SuperConducting Magnetic Flywheel, where you have a sophisticated flywheel made of meta-materials (magnetic/non-magnetic) suspended by Magnetic Bearings in ultra high vacuum, surrounded by conductive  coils (SuperConducting) for inducing opposing currents  in the FlyWheel. These devices store electrical energy in from of rotating mass, when needed the energy is extracted and it is said that this extraction has the best known responses  to our transient energy needs, although this mechanism is not yet clear to me.

            "answer_text": "The flywheel idea is also used in an alternative to electric hybrids - braking energy is transferred to a spinning wheel. This was (is?) used in some race cars. Then when it is time to accelerate, the stored energy is transferred back to the wheels. Race cars are ALWAYS speeding up and slowing down so this can be a significant gain - can save one or more refuelings.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact we do.  In data centers for instance we use arrays of spinning gyros which we keep spun up constantly, because in a power blip it takes a number of seconds to bring up emergency generators and stabilize the output, and the energy in the spinning gyros is sufficient to bridge the time gap.
