            "answer_text": "There is no acceleration downwards lest it get crushed. The acceleration upward depends on how much additional force you can muster. The applied force acring upward Is equal in magnitude but directly opposite in direction from gravity. The net force is zer0. There's no acceleration but you might drift. Pushing or pulling would be perpendicular to gravity and assuming no friction the acceleration would be I g,. 9.8n/sec\u00b2 or 32fr/sec\u00b2 in the direction of the applied force. ",
