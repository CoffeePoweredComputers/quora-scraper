            "answer_text": "If I might add my two cents, while practicing and changing technological devices over to German can be greatly beneficial, you are now at the level where serious improvement will require attention to detail and broader language exposure.  Here are some simple pieces of advise: If at all possible I would look for fellow students/people/peers working to improve their German skills and practice with them. You can help each other to improve and it can make the learning experience much more fun. Find someone who speaks the language as their first language to give you some tips on where you can improve. Find someone who can coach you on taking the B2 test. Beyond the German needed to work and study in a German speaking environment there are specific vocabulary and grammatical components to the B2 test that might require specific training. Another fun option to increase your German language exposure is also watching films. Start with some popular films that you already know and then work your way to  German culture films.  Congratulations on passing the B1 test! I hope you continue to learn and study German. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I suggest you not to pick up many things; choose a method and stick to it. A very good course is Assimil - German at ease: it's an easy-to-grasp, spontaneous and well-organized course that you can download it from Torrent.Anyway, Aspekte is a good book; you can keep it as a guide.Secondly, you should organize your daily study; if your German session lasts for instance one hour, dedicate 15 minutes to a different activity:- grammar (essential in German)- listening activity (videos, podcasts or activities in your book)- reading (a book, an article, whatever)- writing (you can choose among different activities in your book)I didn't quote speaking, which I consider the most important part; if you don't have a parter to practise with, speak to yourself about a topic or your routine. You should dedicate another 10-15 minutes.The passage from B1 to B2 is a big step, so it will take you some time to achieve it: don't be discouraged! ",

            "answer_text": "This was my answer to a similar question: I allowed myself no English except to ask what a certain was in German. I insisted that colleagues, and later friends, spoke only German with me. (A lot of it turned out to have been Bavarian but that\u2019s another story!) I listened to German radio wherever I went (the only competition in southern Germany was AFN, so that was a no-brainer.), watched German television (and over 25 years later I\u2019m still allergic to dubbing.), read German newspapers and magazines, and I always had a dictionary with me. Yes, even in the car. My grammar is still dodgy, but I worked at C level for many years, managed up to 75 people, and have many friends with whom I can talk about anything. Perversely I occasionally, but only very occasionally :-), have to hunt for a word in English. The only real downside was that my other languages retreated to some obscure nether region of my brain, and took a lot of coaxing to eventually come back out! Viel glueck. ",
