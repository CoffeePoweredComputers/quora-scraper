            "answer_text": "Basically, you are talking about top down approach. Big to small. Two approaches are common Ball Milling.Laser AblationYou can also use Ion beam milling but I am not sure about their usefulness. Its better to make TiO2 nano-particles bottom up if you are intending for a uniform particles size, or specific morphology. Sol gel is a the most commonly used method for bottom up. Its very easy as well if you have the proper reagents. ",
