            "answer_text": "There is no clear answer to this question. This element has been produced in such minute amounts that its density can only be guessed at (predicted). The previous answer correctly provides that prediction. The cost of producing this element is about $5.75 billion for just a few atoms. The most stable isotope of Oganesson is Og-294 which has a half life of only 0.89 milliseconds. It can be synthesized but it has a very fleeting existence. ",
