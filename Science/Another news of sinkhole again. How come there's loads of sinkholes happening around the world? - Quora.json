            "answer_text": "RE: Another news of sinkhole again. How come there's loads of sinkholes happening around the world? Sinkholes, like earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions, are happening at more or less the same rate that they always have. The key word in the question is \u201cnews\u201d. Something can only get on the news if someone gets word of some \u201cnewsworthy\u201d event to the news people. With more and more people in the world there are more and more people around to notice some \u201cnewsworthy\u201d event and report it. Not only that, but with more and more people having video-capable \u201csmart phones\u201d it makes it that much more likely that said \u201cnewsworthy\u201d event will make it into the news. If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Of course it makes a sound. But if I may be permitted to transmogrify the above to be more pertinent to the question: If a sinkhole opens up in the woods and no one is there to fall into it, is it newsworthy? Not in the slightest. Trouble is there are more and more people, houses, buildings around these days (and smart phones) so there are more and more people, etc, falling into sinkholes so more and more sinkhole events are deemed \u201cnewsworthy\u201d. The same goes for all other disasters as more and more people are affected. ",
