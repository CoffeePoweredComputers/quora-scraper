            "answer_text": "Python is playing a very important role in the medical field. The use of machine and deep learning in the medical field has led to this usage growth. Let me explain you with an example during this corona pandemic when the number of patients is very large as compared to the doctors and other facilities python(machine learning) was helping detect if someone has corona by their X-rays and CT scans. It also helped forecast the number of cases and fatalities so that government and hospitals can think ahead and arrange for the facilities needed. Mining social media data to better estimate spread/symptoms and general public perception. It also helped in predicting the structure of proteins and their interactions with chemical compounds to facilitate new antiviral drugs/vaccines or recommend current drugs. Python has a lot of usages in medical and other fields(mainly because of its powerful open source machine learning packages). ",

            "answer_text": "I take it for granted because I work mainly in image processing. But as it becomes more important for all scientists to have at least some programming skills, the usefulness of Python become more obvious. First, Python is relatively easy to use. It has easy to understand syntax and doesn\u2019t need to be compiled. For the most part, error messages are helpful when debugging. Second, it is free and has a ton of great libraries (it has a lot of libraries because many people use it and many people use it because it has a lot of libraries). Third, it has a some nice statistics packages, which make it very useful for doing medical research. All in all, it is a great language for scientific computing because you don\u2019t need to be a programming ninja to use it effectively. It is useful for programming ninjas too though; it\u2019s not just for beginners or casual users. ",
