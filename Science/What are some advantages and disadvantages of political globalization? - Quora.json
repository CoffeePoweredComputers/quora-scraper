            "answer_text": "Usually the term globalisation refers to the spread of economic and cultural exchanges around the globe. Political globalisation might be used as a term to describe the efforts to build international structures to advance cooperation between nation states, or even, at its most extreme - to offer an alternative to the nation state. The potential advantages are obvious enough at one level: We live on a small planet with finite natural resources and an ecology which is changing because of man\u2019s actions. If we do not cooperate to find better ways of living on the planet then not only may we not survive but also we endager the beauty and diversity of the world. Hence the Paris Accords on climate change and the sense of international outrage that the USA has withdrawn from international cooperation on these issues.We have a terrible history of using the nation state to wage war and to murder each other. Arrangements which bind countries together (e.g. UN, NATO etc.) may help increase the chance of peace.Nation states and corporations often abuse economic power to advantage the rich and disadvantage the poor (e.g. tariffs on agricultural goods imposed by US and EU hurt farmers from other countries, countries where farming is one of their natural strengths). So organisations like WTO can try and encourage countries to reduce the level of exploitation.I could go on. Almost no aspect of the modern world can be locked in a box and treated as just a \u2018national issue\u2019 - think of the growing power of Amazon, Facebook or Apple. None of this is to suggest that we are good at cooperating. Just as individuals can be selfish, rather than public spirited, so countries can be nationalistic rather than internationalist. However this is no argument for not trying to work together. Some people in the USA think that international institutions are some kind of threat to the USA, and I suppose this is natural enough. If you are (currently) the most powerful country in the world and are able to get your own way without reaching fair and just agreements with other countries then it must be tempting to believe international institutions would be a threat to you. In a way they are - they are a threat to the worst part of any country - because they are a constraint on nationalistic self-interest and exploitation. However, if the Founding Fathers were here today I suspect their sympathy would be with the internationalists who desire to help build \u2018a new order under heaven\u2019 that might extend the benefits of freedom, democracy and human rights to all human beings.

            "answer_text": "What are some advantages and disadvantages of political globalization? You are advancing a question that has stymied mankind since long before mankind had literacy. Of all the examples, one of the most insightful was that of Confucius, who recognized that the problem with the society of man, was as it still is, is government. He spent his life advancing that government should have requirements of \u2018qualification\u2019 for those who apply it, to even begin to have any success. Sadly, no nation has made the requirement that qualifications, or ability, are a required. Some very insightful men\u2026as Immanuel Kant, the father of psychiatry in the 18th century\u2026who identified how each individual\u2019s thinking works and why, also lacked understanding human nature, advocating that there was some magical way that the world could live in some harmony with all. Christianity, stepped outside the boundary of government, and advocated the concept of Confucius, that if all could treat others with the reciprocal they are treated, the original golden rule, perhaps society of civilized order could exist. Montesquieu in the early 18th century made this determination, if a society has their own mores\u2026tier standards\u2026their morals\u2026the foundations of what they expect form society\u2026and the religious application that advances those ideals, then if they form a government they are ready. In the idiotology of mohammadism, if the caliph, the political leader of the state and the theocracy are totalitarian and all, \u2018submit and obey\u2019 then harmony will reside. In America the idea of liberty was\u2026is not now advocated by the society\u2026that the role of the state is to protect and preserve the inalienable rights of the individual. Is it not obvious that as was once acknowledged that all societies are so different, that some universal political organization created globally is beyond the very laws of nature and the God of those natural rights. Advantage, none is known. Disadvantage, to do so would require that all men\u2019s liberty, and therefore their freedom would have to be dismissed. ",
