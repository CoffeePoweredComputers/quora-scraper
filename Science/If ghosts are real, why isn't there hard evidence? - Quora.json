            "answer_text": "I'm not a deeply skeptical person about the supernatural, because I've had some anecdotal experiences, particularly with telepathy. So my answer is not based on measurable phenomena, but what limited contact I've had or felt from ghosts. It is simply not tangible enough to yield hard evidence. Mostly I see ghosts in dreams or glimpsed fleetingly in mirrors. The other people I've met who admit they do this also see them mostly in mirrors, etc. I think all ESP runs off soul energy, which is not something we can measure yet. Maybe we'll master that someday, or not. Until we do, there will be no hard evidence. And ghosts can't appear strongly enough to convince non-ESP-sensitives because they can't generate more soul energy since their bodies have died. Perhaps they simply can't produce more of that once their body dies. There's definitely a link between body and soul; some crazy study one of my sister nurse\u2019s friends read revealed that critical patients on beds equipped with scales showed a sudden weight loss of 2 ounces or more when the patient died. She took it to mean the weight change showed the departure of the soul. She never quoted me a source for that one, sorry, I wish I could confirm or debunk that. She claimed her dying patients in ICU showed this weight loss also, which started her belief, and other nurses confirmed it had happened to some of their patients. (She was not a great big liar, either.) But the body-soul link seems plausible to me after a few deaths in my family; what remained of the person's I loved was just an empty shell to all my senses. I was disconsolate until I met them in my dreams. They told me things I'd not know myself. I was reassured also that they still loved their loved ones, and that I might see them again after my own death. I think a few ghosts are capable of tapping into environmental and/or living ESP-sensitives to supply them with enough soul energy to appear, which allows non-ESP-sensitives to see ghosts also, but it appears to tire them (ghosts and sensitives) out. And it happens at inopportune moments, when nobody is prepared with cameras and whatever sensors might measure their appearances. So it's going to be nearly impossible to predict activity and record proof. Yet it's probably for the best; those who've died had their chance to act in this world. Little they could do or say after death would alter our lives, and might make it harder for us to let go. And skeptics who don't want to believe there is life after death will not be convinced even if hard proof appeared. ",

            "answer_text": "What is your definition of hard evidence, according to us researchers we have hard evidence but some person have a different meaning of hard evidence! We have hard evidences and I have a definition of paranormal energies. as per scientific terms (there is no scientific explanation but only relation to science ! ) There are many concrete scientific proofs about Spirits or ghost or such energy existence. on the base of such proofs a whole paranormal science exist ! So yes they exist for sure ! Ghost or spirits are actually free electromagnetic energies in terms of science and relation with science ! the scientific relation to it is that , generally the human conscious energy ( human electromagnetic energy )getsdispersed in the atmosphere is form of heal and light once a person dies , but in some cases , it doesn't ( science has no concrete proof about why it doesn't and in what cases it doesn't but some researches say that , where there are lots of death due to wars and such bad reasons ( no natural reason , untimely death ) and lots of bad history , that places to become haunted !) so if the conscious electromagnetic energy of a human brain doesn't disperse in the atmosphere and still remain as a intelligent energy after death it means the persons soul hasn't attained white light (in scientific relations ) and when such energies gather very much in a certain place then the place tend to become haunted ! so not all persons become a spirit ! or a ghost ! this is the logic ! we have found many evidences and concrete proofs which many team all around the world have documented of a intelligent electromagnetic energy existing at real haunted locations ! so yes they exist in form of energies the energies in scientific terms are electromagnetic energies ! these energies are called as ghost or spirits ! So yup they exist! ",
