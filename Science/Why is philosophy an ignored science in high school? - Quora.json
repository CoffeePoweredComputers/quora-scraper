            "answer_text": "No, philosophy is not ignored in high school. Philosophy is taught in high school even middle school. Euclid's geometry and logic is philosophy. The philosophy you meant in fact is philosophers thoughts and theories which is IMHO all religious and metaphysical garbage in the western tradition. It ought to be ignored unless you're willing to get poisoned by it in college. ",

Plato dealt with God (the First Cause, not the Christian God); Socrates with suicide as a noble way to accept a death sentence; Spinoza denied Judaism and was a pantheist; Nietzche denied Christianity, etc. ",
