            "answer_text": "Some very respected physicists believe that the answer is yes, while other very respected physicists believe that the answer is no, and still other very respected physicists are not sure what the correct answer is. This remains an open question in need of significant, relevant data from high quality scientific observations and/or experiments. To see an impressive \u201cyes\u201d hypothesis, read Carlo Rovelli\u2019s book Reality is not What it Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity, especially Chapters 8 and 9. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it would do so. If a structure can/ does undergo a Big Bang, it must move in one or any direction at light speed. This collapsing and re expanding behavior are caused by the interaction between negative energy (dark energy), and ordinary positive energy. It is the repulsive gravity of negative energy that causes expansion, and attractive gravity of positive mass, matter and energy that causes collapsing. ",
