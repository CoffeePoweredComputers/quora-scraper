            "answer_text": "It is difficult to asses a reactivity, a word that does not mean what most think it does: rectivity refers to the rate (in common parlance, speed) of a reaction, not to the energy involved, which is instead related to the equilibrium of the same reaction. (The picture is complicated, however, by the fact that the energy thus released increases the temperature of the system, which of course makes the reaction faster). In the example. sodium and magnesium are both strong reducing metals with large negative potentials, not much different between them, thus it is not the energetics of the reactions which is important. My two cents: the difference is in the solubility of the products, the hydroxides of sodium and magnesium: the first is quite soluble in water, the other much less: thus it remains on the surface of the metal passivating it against further attack by water and slowing the reaction.

            "answer_text": "Sodium is more reactive than magnesium when placed in an aqueous solution because of the family it is in. Sodium is part of the Alkali metal family which consist of highly reactive elements (reactivity increases going down a family) in addition to the halogens (fluorine, iodine, etc.) -because of their great electronegativity and ionization energy differences. Thus, because Mg is part of the Alkali Earth metals it is deemed much less reactive than any element in group 1 of the periodic table. ",
