            "answer_text": "Why were computers from the 80s so expensive?I tried my best to lower those prices (but not intentionally). Starting in 1975, the home computer market began. The prices were in the ballpark of $1000 to $1500 for a full computer (CPU, memory, keyboard and display device). The industry grew a bit with Apple II, TRS-80 and many other non-compatible machines. Most were running CP/M as an Operating System (OS). The industry was primarily in the hand\u2019s of enthusiasts and a few trailblazing companies Then when IBM released their PC in 1981, businesses now felt comfortable with \u201chome computers\u201d since IBM gave their \u201cstamp\u201d of approval but they were expensive still. The first PC clone was produced from Compaq in 1982, but there were still many (in the 100\u2019s) other non-PC computers. When I wrote the original Phoenix BIOSes in May 1984 to May 1985, this enabled any company to make and sell PC hardware without IBM copyright violations. This consolidated the \u201chome\u201d computer industry to primarily the Apple II, Apple Macintoshes, and the PC (and XT and AT versions). The almost total dominance by the PC clones in computer sales that followed the introduction of the Phoenix BIOS (and other third -party BIOSes created afterwards) allowed the phenomenal growth of the computer industry (and also the electronics industry), which lowered costs, and increased the demand for peripherals. The PC clones hovered in the $1200 to $1500 for a near top of the line computer, all the way through about the year 2000, all the while increasing in speed, increases in memory size, hard drive size, video resolution, and better printers. Meanwhile the growth of the internet, starting in 1991 also fueled the sales of computers. So now, a typical high-end desktop is roughly $1000, although vastly more powerful. The reason they have not dropped even more, is that modern graphical operating systems and software keep demanding more from the computer.

            "answer_text": "This was not necessarily the case.  My first computer, acquired in 1982 for $100 (or $250 adjusted for 2017 inflation) The most common home computers of the 1980s were standalone 8-bit machines made by various manufacturers such as Atari, Commodore, Apple, Texas Instruments, and Tandy. Depending on the manufacturer, these machines cost between $500 and $1000 ($1200 to $2500 today, comparable to a modern higher-end desktop or laptop) between 1980 and 1987 when their usage started to taper off in favor in favor of what were then called \u201cIBM compatibles\u201d (which I\u2019ll say more about momentarily). By the end of the 1980s, those 8-bit manufacturers which were still offering these machines were doing so for no more than $200 per machine.  In contrast to those machines marketed toward consumers for home use, the IBM PC, which is the hardware foundation for virtually all modern Windows-OS machines, ran between $1500 and $3000 ($3800 to $7500 in modern value). This was not, however, intended as a home computer but instead as a business tool, and was priced accordingly. When IBM began licensing its hardware architecture to other manufacturers, this caused the price of compatible machines to drop dramatically, which was also necessitated by the obsolescence of those cheaper early 80s machines using 8- or 16-bit processors.
