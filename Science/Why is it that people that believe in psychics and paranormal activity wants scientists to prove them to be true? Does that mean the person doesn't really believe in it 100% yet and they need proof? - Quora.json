            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not my experience that people who believe in psychics and paranormal activity want science to prove them to be true, although that may be the position of many or most. I have only heard from people who believe in psychics and paranormal activity the demand to prove that those are not true. This is a burden of proof issue, perhaps the most basic concept in rational thinking, IMO. People who claim that something exists, something happens, or that something is real, have the responsibility (the burden of proof) to demonstrate that it is true. If someone tells you that psychics claimed activities are real, it is not up to you to prove that these aren\u2019t real, it is up to the one saying that they are real to demonstrate that they are real. The same is true of claims about paranormal, fairies, gods, squirrels stealing food from the bird feeder, and that there is one more slice of cake in the fridge. In every case which I have encountered, those making claims that psychics and paranormal activity are real, have failed to demonstrate their claim. They become outraged, they divert, they quote individual experiences, but they do not, ever, provide reason & evidence which demonstrate that their claims are valid. If they could demonstrate their claims, according to rational standards, their claims would be accepted as valid. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not require Science to prove anything about metaphysics, because metaphysics is beyond the proof or scrutiny of Science. Moreover, I have had far too many experiences with metaphysical occurrence that are not explainable by any science. Something most people, who access the metaphysical world, have always known. The only scientific arena that comes close is Quantum theory. Which is truly beyond weird. And even Science will admit this. Science is the understanding of the physical universe while psychic, clairvoyance and paranormal activity is of the metaphysical universe. I really seriously doubt some people truly understand what the terms paranormal and metaphysical actually mean.
