            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want to learn.  Physical chemistry comtain several parts. If you only want to learn about basic thermodynamics, you only need to know some basic Calculus, just as easy as most people study at the first grade of university, may be even easier. For example, in classical thermodynamics, the hardest mathematics is  Maxwell's equations, including second partial derivative.  However, if you want to study more advance physical chemistry, these knowledge is not enough. Mathematical statistics, is the next step for you. By the way, I assume you've studied linear algebra. Until now, these are easy mathematics that every students need to learn. However, if you still want to study more advance physical chemistry, skill of solving differential equation is needed for any calculation related to quantum. You also should be able to familiar with the concept of complex variables functions. As far as I concern, these are the all skill you need for physical chemistry in university.  Some thing may be good for you: you don't need to be master in these subject but make sure that you can do basic calculation using these skills. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the school and what level they expect, actually. My school had to dumb down the math because some of the people who had to take P Chem didn\u2019t take anything above 2 semesters of Calculus. However, I worked in a P Chem lab and I had to know a ton of math, which is why I minored. Talk to your profs to see what\u2019s expected. I think 2 semesters of Cal and Linear Algebra should be fine, but Multi variable Cal helps wonderfully as well, as does Diff Eq, and Vector Cal, but that\u2019s just depending. ",
