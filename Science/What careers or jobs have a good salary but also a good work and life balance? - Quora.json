            "answer_text": "Without knowing you, or your interests or skills, I cannot be specific about any \"job.\" But I will tell this.  Any job that you love doing is the right job.   Sure money is important, but rather than chase wealth for the sake of wealth, pursue the job that will be satisfying from day to day.  If you are happy in what you do, then your family will be happy, you will teach great lessons to your children, and the balance you seek will occur naturally. I have known presidents of large banks and other companies who have made hundreds of thousands in salaries and even more wealth in stock, be miserable. They drank too much, their spouses left them,and their children were spoiled rotten jerks. They were unhappy people every day for most of their careers, except for two. They took their own lives. ",

            "answer_text": " How can one answer this question apart from the person asking, if you ask me I am a Chartered Certified Accountant by choice and I love what I do. I can write here extensive articles convincing you Chartered Accountancy is the best profession which rewards you both in terms of money and social status, but that is what I think, for me it\u2019s the best. How can I conclude same for someone else who is unique in his/her own individuality? Life is unique for every individual, instead of finding balance between work and life, explore yourself and know your inner abilities while fulfilling your level of satisfaction in finding what you want to do. Why not find something to work for in which you actually live rather than achieving balance between life and work. Let work be your life, in this way you will make success just by living it because you actually love what you work and have no differentiation between work and normal life. Best solution would be to spent some time alone, plan things ahead, convince yourself what you actually want from your life. Communicate with yourself and than write down a list of answers which you got from your inner-self. Once you are done with your list compare them with actual real life scenarios what is more practical and reasonable which satisfies your personal needs and also enable you to stand distinct in your social reality. I have seen many successful people doing just fine in their life, everything seems perfect from our perspective but they don\u2019t love what they do and end up in changing there profession. Don\u2019t be one of them take things planned from start, you should know what you actually want rather than running in totally opposite direction. Because at the end it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you had made, only thing what rests with you is your internal satisfaction if you don\u2019t have that with all of your so called success, it\u2019s not success at all.
