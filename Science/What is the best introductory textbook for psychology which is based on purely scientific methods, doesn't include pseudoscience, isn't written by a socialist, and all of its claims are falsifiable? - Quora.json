            "answer_text": "The Heart of the Question: Based on a ranking of Introduction to Psychology books the most popular author and very respect in the discipline is Dr. David G Myers who is quite prolific. I don\u2019t know if every claim is falsifiable. But if you find 25, 50, or 100 claims that are falsifiable, you are ahead of the net game, because the alternative would just throw the baby out with the bathwater. It\u2019s not so much an either/or question as it seems to be framed on the question: Here is his website: Textbooks Here is his Amazon profile: David G. Myers The Limits, Assumptions, and Paradoxes of Falsifisability: Karl Popper the philosopher of science abandoned falsifisability or at least the hard demarcation based on that criteria. I think that was because of the failure of positivism and the failure of the verification principle itself. I\u2019m not 100% sure on the rationale and/or justification. It\u2019s worth researching, however. Not to mention, this gets us into all kinds of questions about what it means to be falsifisiable in the first place. Is cosmology falsifisable? Is falsifisability a genuine criteria for knowledge? What constitutes falsifisbility? What about knowledge that is vital, but we can\u2019t seem to find any falsifisability? Even Popper\u2019s original defense of the theory runs into problems. For instance As an article citing Sean Carroll in the Scientific American points out that its too grounded in Vienna Circle thinking, which was grounded in physics\u2014that is it assumed its frameworks and paradigms. But in 2014 falsification has become a much less reliable and more complicated beast. Let's run through a list of its limitations and failures. For one thing, Popper's idea that no amount of data can confirm a theory is a dictum that's simply not obeyed by the majority of the world's scientists. In practice a large amount of data does improve confidence in a theory. Scientists usually don't need to confirm a theory one hundred percent in order to trust and use it; in most cases a theory only needs to be good enough. Thus the purported lack of confidence in a theory just because we are not one hundred percent sure of its validity is a philosophical fear, more pondered by grim professors haunting the halls of academia than by practical scientists performing experiments in the everyday world. Carrol also points out the following, with the caveat at the end: The last problem with falsification is that since it was heavily influenced by Popper's training in physics it simply fails to apply to many activities pursued by scientists in other fields, such as chemistry. The Nobel Prize winning Roald Hoffmann has argued in his recent book how falsification is almost irrelevant to many chemists whose main activity is to synthesize molecules. What hypothesis are you falsifying, exactly, when you are making a new drug to treat cancer or a new polymer to sense toxic environmental chemicals? Now you could get very vague and general and claim that every scientific experiment is a falsification experiment since it's implicitly based on belief in some principle of science. But as they say, a theory that explains everything explains nothing, so such a catchall definition of falsification ceases to be useful. All this being said, there is no doubt that falsification is a generally useful guideline for doing science. Source: Falsification and its discontents Don\u2019t get me wrong, I get that the criticism of Freud is problematic and the lack of falsifisability and/or the overall pure assertion in some cases by Freud is highly, highly problematic. However, one has to think that the methodology and self-reflection of psychologists has improved since Freuds more speculative and non-scientific work. From a philosophical perspectives universal statements aren\u2019t falsifisabile. For instances mothers X and fathers Y, presumably because we could never have enough data to prove either premise, because it almost assumes that without having all 10 billion of each tested, we don\u2019t have true evidence. A silly and ridiculously high definition of truth or evidence. It makes inferences useless. It also slows down science to a slower than a snails pace at addressing issues. You can\u2019t have a double-blind that includes the entire worlds population for every product, medicine, or procedure ever invented. It\u2019s not economical use of scientific dollars plain and simple. Just to be clear, the author of the Scientific American article is actually this guy who was quoting Sean Carroll: Ashutosh Jogalekar is a chemist interested in the history, philosophy and sociology of science. He is fascinated by the logic of scientific discovery and by the interaction of science with public sentiments and policy. Additional Resources: Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Linked to Criticicisms) Falsifiability - Wikipedia (Controversies Sub-heading) Karl Popper (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) As I pointed out earlier, the critique of demarcation itself is a critique of the need for falsification as well.

            "answer_text": "Psychology and sociology, it seems, are considered \u201csofter sciences.\u201d Unless one can reduce human psychology in order to predict over 99.9 % it would not be a hard science. Perhaps the closest might be clinical lab psychiatrists that are skilled in medical science because of the \u201cdouble vision\u201d (physics/psychology). In this sense, NUCLEUS (physics) = SELF (psychology) and by extension ATOM=EGO. If you can demonstrate the same analogies using cross reference tables with terminologies for both areas of discipline, you might end up jumping also outside this box. The atom and \u201cmolecules\u201d would be as if parallel to how the structure of family, friends, acquaintances and so on loosen and bind to crystallize into other shapes, etc. Analytical psychiatry may offer insights that are common for almost all systems. For example, \u201cIn Einstein\u2019s vision, the universe is like an organism in which each part is the manifestation of the whole\u201d (Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind p 76). Each individual is made in the same image as \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201cparts,\u201d by whatever terminology. Everyone is composed of sub particles, atoms and molecules, chemical dna, bacteria, organs, and so on (multiplicity) while simultaneously acting as a person (unity). This same process operates for social structures, for example, Alvin Toffler in Foreword to Nobel Prize recipient Ilya Prigogine, and Isabelle Stengers book, Order Out of Chaos, says, \u201cImagine a situation in which a chemical or other reaction produces an enzyme whose presence then encourages further production of the same enzyme. This is an example of what computer scientists would call a positive-feedback loop. In chemistry it is called \u2018auto-catalysis.\u2019 Such situations are rare in inorganic chemistry. But in recent decades the molecular biologists have found that such loops (along with inhibitory or \"negative\" feedback and more complicated \"cross-catalytic\" processes) are the very stuff of life itself. Such processes help explain how we go from little lumps of DNA to complex living organisms. More generally, therefore, in far-from-equilibrium conditions we find that very small perturbations or fluctuations can become amplified into gigantic, structure-breaking waves. And this sheds light on all sorts of \"qualitative\" or \"revolutionary\" change processes. When one combines the new insights gained from studying far-from-equilibrium states and nonlinear processes, along with these complicated feedback systems, a whole new approach is opened that makes it possible to relate the so-called hard sciences to the softer sciences of life-and perhaps even to social processes as well\u201d (Order Out Of Chaos p vii). If you study psychology and sociology as a harder science, biologists have noted the \u201ccollective I\u201d when observing ant, termite and bee colonies for example. Ants are like people. If you try swatting a bee, the individual does not have to know what happened, but an entire \u201corganism\u201d may step up to the plate to do something about it. Mold cells, without brains, emerge at a certain stage to become slime-mold, as if resembling intelligent behavior, even looking similar to neural cell firing and the universe. The \u201cPauli Exclusion Principle\u201d involving electrons in different levels is analogous to the emergence at different scales. Professor Pauli\u2019s dream illustration has a theoretical framework for an invisible unconscious (\u201cu-field\u201d around physicists) analogous to an individual \u201cI.\u201d  On the left his \u201ccountries mandala\u201d offers the same four functions of a psyche\u2019 that psychiatrist Dr. Carl Jung used in therapy for an individual. This \u201cemergence\u201d where the whole is greater than its parts, is as if an individual \u201cI\u201d jumps abruptly into another scale, a coherent orbit or level to emerge as an Ultra Human with a collective \u201cI.\u201d Homogenizing the human species as if a herd mentality, may be explored by referring to the brain wash used in marketing products, services, people and information. Evoking neural cell firing by putting \u201cpellets of data/information\u201d into the Electro Magnetic sphere can, when \u201ccolliding\u201d with another system, i.e. Mr and Mrs Couch Potato, and the Family of Bored Apathetics can for a \u201cweave\u201d between the inner processes and external presentations.  By slowing down the signal thru pre amplifiers in the electro magnetic gadgets, or \u201crunning rings\u201d around thru metal objects placed on the heads of the human beings, the signals prompt the subconscious and by the time the signal is amplified, the conscious psyche\u2019 and unconscious contents intersect, mixtures similar to chemical reactions. Algorithms are becoming quite a fashionable marketplace for mind control techniques. Services that provide quantitative studies after hooking people from all walks of life to clinical lab machines found that terminology in these \u201csofter sciences\u201d has helped the influx of monies. PRS (Post Reinforcement Stimulus) is commonly used in marketing and commercials. When lab equipment displays a \u201cburst\u201d it means that the \u201csample\u201d is experiencing an \u201canticipatory wave\u201d and about ready to display a \u201cdecision wave.\u201d If, for example, a sports nut is watching a commercial and a product belongs to the ambience and the viewer is displaying a decision wave like \u201cpleasure\u201d emotional response, the nod of approval will be met with the PRS to reward their image. However, if the machines shows disapproval, the image will reflect that the viewer has some sort of unsanitary stench and no one of the fantasized peers will want them around because that viewer does not belong. That \u201cnot belonging\u201d is a psychological trait that can be picked up when more than one AI handshakes with another AI, a formation of a SUPRA AI, a stupendous non local thinking system. The environment than can be expanded to include billboards, structures, etc so that it would appear as if an invisible mind boggling entity is using both animate and inanimate objects behaving as if to probe and judge our physical and mental whereabouts with an uncanny attention to detail transgressing and interplaying in our every day lives. The sophistication depends upon the knowledge and application of technology. ",
