            "answer_text": "This is a simple looking question but fairly complex. The best strategy to win cannot be given by 1. A loser who has only lost and never won 2. A winner who has never lost.(could be naturally gifted) 3. A loser who loses with a strategy. 4. A winner who wins without a stratergy(some gifted people do win this way). So what we need to develop a stratergy is to observe loser and winners, acquire methods that give results and stay away from practices that cause failure. If we consider ourselves an average person possesing the guts to work hard for something then, The person best suited to teach a strategy will be the one who has won after some loses and used a definitive strategy himself. A gifted champion ( i know he works really hard but he got the physique too)  A champion with a not so gifted body( probably worked very hard and smart)  So, consulting an average person who has been a loser and is a champion now, is the best bet for anyone according to me. PS :- I have answered this in a very approximate and general way, stratergies for many tasks, sports, different careers , LIFE are very different from each other and the meaning of winners and losers is also different in these cases. Please take the answer with a pinch of salt ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously without any doubt it would be the loser. Losers are not always losers. Their goals in life are filled with challenges,to regain that sense of fulfilment,the losers always create a new goal and contribute everything that they have learnt. It\u2019s only by experiencing difficulties that make a loser to create the best strategy to win something. ",
