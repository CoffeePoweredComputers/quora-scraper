            "answer_text": "Black holes are one of the most interesting class of objects in the entire universe. And they are not very well understood. If you take a look at List of unsolved problems in physics in wikipedia, a fair number of them are about black holes, or involve black holes in some way. Some of them are listed below:  Theory of everything (\"Grand Unification Theory\") - Black holes are the places where you get extremely strong gravity over small length scales - ideal places where gravity and quantum mechanics interact. Incidentally, our inability to cast gravity in quantum mechanical terms is the biggest obstacle in achieving a Theory of Everything. That makes black holes ideal places to test your ideas about a Theory of Everything.Gravitational wave - We have not yet managed to directly detect gravitational waves. Inspiraling black hole binaries are thought to produce gravitational waves. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO are looking for them.Dark matter, Galaxy rotation problem - What is dark matter? One of the proposed solutions is Massive compact halo objects (aka MACHOs), which are black holes, cold neutron stars and cold white dwarfs hypothesized to be present in the galactic halo.Quantum gravity - Black holes are the places we expect to see the effects of quantum gravity in action.Black hole information paradox, and black hole radiation  - Do black holes produce Hawking radiation? What happens to information about particles falling into a black hole? Do black holes destroy information?Cosmic censorship hypothesis - All black holes are hidden behind an event horizon which masks the singularity from the outside world. Do naked singularities (i.e., singularities without event horizons) exist? Astrophysical jet - How do astrophysical jets form? The most impressive jets are of course, produced by accreting black holes.Supermassive black holes - How did supermassive black holes form?",

            "answer_text": "Your proposition to send a camera into a black hole makes sense in our ordinary world here on earth, the problem with your proposition is that black holes are really, really weird. The quickest flaw with the camera-probe idea is that once you go in a black hole, physics bars you from coming back out, this includes radio waves. The escape velocity of a black hole is faster than the speed of light, which relativity says isn't possible to achieve unless your a tachyon, and we don't know if tachyons exist. Theories are about as good as it's going to get, direct observation isn't really possible, once you go in a black hole you don't come out.  We cannot know very much about a black hole because the \"heart\" of the black hole is shielded behind what's called the event horizon, the point of no return, this is also where the black hole's surface begins, it's black because no light can escape at that point to register in our retina. So basically no information can escape past that point. The only thing we can tell about a black hole is its size, mass, charge, and spin. All of these are calculated by seeing not the black hole itself, but how other objects are affected by it. No probe would be needed for this, we could make some estimates based on stars around it, this is how we estimate super massive black holes in the center of galaxies, the orbits of stars around it. So there isn't all that much we can learn from the outside of the black hole, and even if we went inside a black hole, the immense gravity wouldn't allow anything to be transmitted out.  However, on a more optimistic note, if my memory is correct, there might ,theoretically, be a way to observe the inside of a black hole. A Kerr black hole is a rotating black hole. It may be possible to enter and exit from one of these. But the weird thing is, due to relativity which says time moves differently for different observers, the time should basically come to a stop at the event horizon because the time dialation is so intense. So if we sent a probe into a Kerr black hole, and say it had a timer that counted up from zero, we'd notice the clock on the probe begin to count slower and slower until the probe just looked like it was sitting there and the clock stopped. The image of the probe would eventually look reddish and start to dim, but the clock's time would never move forward. So what's interesting is that it basically never falls into the black hole, yet again another reason we can't look inside of one. That fact also makes gettin out of a black hole weird. How do you get out if you never went in? Now it should be noted, the probe thinks it's doing just fine, from its view the people on earth are moving really really really fast, and it keeps getting faster the closer it gets to the black hole. To the probe, it's clock ticks normally, earths clock is screwed up. So in the probe's frame of reference it should eventually enter, but at this point were talking about it going into the black hole, and since we have no idea of knowing what's inside of the black hole, we have no idea what would happen, we can only speculate.  So even if it came out, which form the probes perspective might be a couple hours, earth would be looooooooonnnnnnngggggg gone. Heck, I think that by the time it got past the event horizon the universe should already so torn itself into shreds. Another way we might be able to get a good grasp of the I write of a black hole is with the theory of quantum gravity, which has yet to be perfected.  Lastly, we might be able to find a naked singularity, if the spin of the black hole is fast enough, the event horizon vanishes, and the singularity is exposed. Though it seems unlikely the occur naturally. To conclude, it is practically impossible to see inside a black hole with our currently. In the future, theory may allow for us to go in and come out, but we aren't quite there yet. ",
