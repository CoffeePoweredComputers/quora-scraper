            "answer_text": "The intriguing aspect of this question is the many ways it can be answered depending on the definition of the key word \u201clargest\u201d: Highest from sea level: Mount Everest (29,000, base is at 17,800).Highest from land base to peak: Denali (Mt. McKinley). (20,210, base is at 7,200)Furthest from the Center of the Earth/ Closest to the Sun: Chimborazo 25,600. It\u2019s near the equator, which bulges out farther than the latitude of Everest because Earth is an oblate sphere. So the top of Chimborazo is about 6,300 feet further out into Space than the top of Everest.Furthest from top to bottom: Mauna Kea is 33,500 ft. in height, much of it underwater.The bulkiest mountain that\u2019s a defined peak: Mauna Loa, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (again, mostly underwater)And if we generously extend the definition of mountain to what is a massif, in this case a hybrid between a mid-ocean ridge and a shield volcano, by far the bulkiest land-form is Tamu Massif in the Pacific.Measures in imperial- I\u2019ve converted to metric for everything except mountains, cooking and fish.",

            "answer_text": "The largest mountain on Earth has never been climbed. It lurks in the dark and the deep. Bring up your mental picture of Italy: its highways, its cities, its slow roads and its Italian Alps. (If you\u2019ve never been to Italy, think of Arizona, Finland, New Zealand, or Maharashtra \u2014 they\u2019re all the right size).  [Image: Italian Alps] Now, take that mental picture, and imagine that the whole of Italy is one huge Alp. The sheer scale of it will try to slip away. Don\u2019t let it. Hold that image in your head. That\u2019s Earth\u2019s largest mountain*. In 2013, a group of oceanographers in the Pacific discovered that the ridge they were studying was, in fact, one single volcano [ngeo1934]. They named it Tamu Massif. Here\u2019s Tamu Massif, stretching 4,620m (14,633ft) above the seafloor. That\u2019s a respectable height - about half the height of Mt. Everest - but the sheer size of it is extraordinary.  [Image: IODP] *I\u2019m using the word \u201cmountain\u201d broadly here - Tamu Massif is underwater, barely explored, etc. I think this is a great starting point to debate the definition of \u201cmountain\u201d. I want this answer to prompt you to think about it - is Earth\u2019s largest volcano too big to be a mountain? Too shallow? Too unfamiliar? For my own part, I think that discussing \u201cEarth\u2019s largest mountain\u201d without mentioning Tamu Massif would be a bit like discussing \u201cEarth\u2019s biggest city\u201d and saying that Tokyo is too sprawling out to count.
