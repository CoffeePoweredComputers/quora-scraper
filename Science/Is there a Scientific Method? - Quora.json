After all, how can they? They can\u2019t do another Big Bang and then test whether inflation gives a universe like ours. The general \u201cscientific method\u201d is usually written something like this: \u201cThe steps of the scientific method are to: Ask a QuestionDo Background ResearchConstruct a HypothesisTest Your Hypothesis by Doing an ExperimentAnalyze Your Data and Draw a ConclusionCommunicate Your Results\u201d Steps of the Scientific Method This is actually the \u201cHypothetico-Deductive Method\u201d Hypothetico-Deductive Method - Testing Theories The basic steps are: Construct a hypothesis. This is a statement.Make deductions from that hypothesis about things that should exist if the hypothesis is true.Look for those things. This search may involve an experiment to find observations. It may involve observations of things that already exist.Assess the validity of the hypothesis. The observations either 1) support or 2) falsify the hypothesis.The H-D method can be used by any discipline as long as the participants agree what constitutes an area of valid observations \u2014 the \u201cdata\u201d. In science, the physical universe is the valid area or \u201cdata\u201d. In history, data is the documents written by people of the time. For instance, I am reading a book about the Wars of the Roses. The author hypothesizes the motivation for Richard III seizing the throne of England and deposing his nephew. He draws on what people close to Richard III wrote and acts of Parliament on the subject, since these give justifications. Another example is Biblical studies. Within the Biblical scholarship community, there is the Documentary Hypothesis of the origin and authors of the first 5 books of the Bible. The DH is that the Pentateuch is a composite work written by more than one individual. The \u201cdata\u201d is the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch. Neither the history or the Documentary Hypothesis fall under science, but both are using the H-D method. Cosmologists also use the H-D method. They make hypotheses about events in the early universe and then look for observations that should be there. For instance, Alan Guth hypothesized that the very early universe expanded exponentially for a short period of time. This is called \u201cinflation\u201d. Inflation solved a problem of the larger theory Big Bang by producing a \u201cflat\u201d universe with matter evenly distributed on a large scale. However, inflation also predicted interactions of the cosmic microwave background radiation and free electrons. This is the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. It was proposed in 1970, but not detected until recently. The observation strongly supports inflation.M Joy and JE Calrstrom Probing the early universe with the SZ effect.

            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a Scientific Method. The Scientific Method, as a formal process, was developed by science educators in an effort to enforce discipline and rigor in the science process. Indeed, the Scientific Method was first codified in 1910 by John Dewey in a textbook entitled How We Think. Given the fundamental nature of the process, it is remarkable that it was first published so recently. Indeed, for a while, the Scientific Method was called Dewey's Method. I really wish it had retained that name; confusion between the Scientific Method and science broadly impedes scientific education, and introduces unhelpful controversies. Before Dewey, science education was more focused on the memorization of science facts; Dewey worked to shift the focus of science education to being a \"process of knowledge construction\". Dewey was instrumental in instituting laboratory experiences in science education. Scientists and philosophers had a surprisingly tangential role in the initial development of experimental-science formalisms. Dewey did consult directly with contemporary prominent scientists (specifically, Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, John Merle Coulter,Albert A. Michelson, and Jacques Loeb ), but Dewey was responsible for framing experimental science in a way that it could be incorporated into science-education curricula. The Scientific Method is a process for creating models for cause, localization, or classification. The Scientific Method begins with a question; e.g., 'why is the sky blue?'. The second step is to propose potential models--''hypotheses' (e.g., \"the sky is blue because air is blue\", \"the sky is blue because light reflects off of the oceans, which are blue\", or \"the sky is blue because light is refracted through the atmosphere\"). The third step is to perform experiments to eliminate potential models through contradiction. These experiments may be thought experiments instead of physical experiments (e.g., \"The sky is not blue at sunset at my location, thus the sky is not blue because air is blue\"). Ideally, after generating hypotheses and performing experiments, only one model is left, which is the answer. There are limitations to the Scientific Method: First, the Scientific Method only applies to questions of cause, classification, or localization. You can use it to find your lost car keys, but it does not apply directly, for example, in questions of optimal value, effect, or existence. Second, the Scientific Method works by elimination; you can arrive at the 'right' conclusion only if it is one of the hypotheses that you have considered. You can't find your car keys if they happen to be in a place that you do not consider. Third, the Scientific Method is subject to the practical limitations of the practitioner. For example, if you are blind, you cannot consider hypotheses that require you to have sight. You cannot constrain the nature of the past if you cannot go back into the past to validate those constraints. You cannot constrain the nature of reality if you cannot provide any necessary link between your perceptions and reality. Fourth, the Scientific Method generally assumes that the test environment is static. You may not be able to find your car keys if someone keeps moving them.
