            "answer_text": "Hydrogen. For an atom to have atomic number 1, it should have a single proton in the nucleus since the definition for atomic number is the number of protons or electrons normally found in an atom of a given chemical element. Taking the number of electrons to be the atomic number may not be correct in all conditions since elements tend to turn into cations and anions on losing and gaining electrons respectively. Hydrogen is the only element with a single proton in the nucleus and therefore has atomic number 1. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen has the atomic number 1, the atomic number of an element is determined by the amount of protons in an atoms nucleus. Often this number is also equal to the amount of neutrons in an elements nucleus, other than in the case of isotopes where the amount of neutrons will differ, altering the atomic weight of the element but where the chemical properties and atomic number will stay the same.
