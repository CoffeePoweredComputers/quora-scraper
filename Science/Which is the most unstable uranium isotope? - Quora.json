            "answer_text": "Which is the most unstable uranium isotope? Some of the isotopes of uranium, in descending order by half-life (ascending by radio intensity): U-232: 68.9 yr U-233: 159,200 yr U-234: 245,500 yr U-235: 700,000,000 yr U-236: 23,420,000 yr U-237: 6.75 days U-238: 4,468,000,000 yr U-239: 23.45 minutes The most nstable, then, among those mentioned is U-239. That\u2019s not the final word; many more isotopes of uranium are possible, but which veryt quickly breakdown, which means \u201cmore unstable\u201d with the definition we\u2019re using. The one definite is that U-238, the most common isotope of uranium, is the most stable. ",
