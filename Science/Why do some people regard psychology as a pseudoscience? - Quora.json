            "answer_text": "Lack of rigor, mainly. People in the natural sciences make a concerted effort to be polite to social scientists but will, if they think they\u2019re safe, typically say some unkind things about psychology (and other social sciences). While I\u2019m not exactly a die-hard \u201crationalist\u201d STEMophile, I do think that the natural scientists have a point here. The social sciences lack sufficient rigor to make definitive predictions. This is especially damning if you look at the history of the sciences: the natural sciences have revolutions and paradigm shifts largely independent of prevailing cultural attitudes. For example, elites in the USSR tried to suppress both Darwinian evolution and Einstein\u2019s relativity on the basis that both were bourgeois science. Eventually, though, even the ideologically orthodox Soviets had to admit that relativity was real, because you can\u2019t make nuclear weapons without it. There is almost nothing else in history quite like natural science in that regard: you have to believe it because it just throws the proof at your feet. The social sciences, on the other hand, seem to be downstream of cultural attitudes among the elite classes of society. For example, psychologists didn\u2019t decide to pathologize \u201cthe authoritarian personality\u201d until the liberal democracies won the second World War \u2014 to say nothing of countless other political uses of psychology. Correlation is not causation, I grant you, but it should get your attention anyway. It gets worse when you ask people involved in social sciences to defend the status of their disciplines as science. Generally, they say something along these lines: \u201cYou have to have a Ph.D in my field to even understand the results, so you, personally, can\u2019t criticize its verifiability.\u201d That\u2019s funny, because I can easily verify the natural sciences; grab any chemistry textbook and run a few reactions in your kitchen, and you\u2019'll find that you cannot falsify chemistry. Or buy a telescope and do some amateur astronomy, and you can fail to falsify relativity. You can also do that second one by turning on your GPS, using it, and noticing that it works. And these are both the hardest of the natural sciences, which can quite easily be tested by a layman. And yet, the social sciences cannot even be understood as science unless you have a graduate education in the subject. This should set off your bullshit alarm. Now, are there parts of psychology that are closer to being science? Yes. Psychometric testing, such as IQ testing, seems to predict certain things, even if it\u2019s extremely vague and questionable. And of course, the perceptual stuff in cognitive psych is much more well-grounded than something like implicit association testing or terror management theory. All the same, the word \u201cscience\u201d carries a certain weight of credibility. The authority of the word, \u201cscience,\u201d springs from the success of the natural sciences. And the social sciences get their authority by using the word, \u201cscience,\u201d and riding the coat-tails of the natural sciences by doing so. ",

            "answer_text": "Because, for most of its modern history, psychology has lacked a \u201cbase case\u201d or \u201cfrictionless plane\u201d against which to form hypotheses and against which to test theories. To explain what I mean, let me start with a story\u2026 When I first arrived at Princeton (as an economics student), I attended a reception hosted by the head of the psychology department. Over drinks, I started discussing schizophrenia with a noted expert on the subject. I asked him whether schizophrenia has increased or decreased over time, particularly during the last Century\u2014since it seemed in my observation that social sentiment regarding \u201cthe world becoming a crazier place\u201d might have some validity. To my surprise, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know. There is no standard index for diagnosis.\u201d Elaborating, he explained that while there is some sort of codex of various symptoms for psychological ailments (which is updated occasionally), there is no consensus that a given pathology, such as schizophrenia, necessarily involves a certain set of symptoms. For example, you could have a multiple-personality disorder and not be schizophrenic or be schizophrenic and not have such a disorder. Moreover, what\u2019s been dubbed symptomatically as \u201cschizophrenia\u201d has changed over time. As a result, there is no way to truly compare whether the proportionate number of cases of a given pathology in 1960 say, were greater or less than the proportionate number diagnosed today. Furthermore, his explanation also suggested that there is no \u201cprediction\u201d regarding such pathologies. In other words, one cannot say that \u201cpsychologically normal\u201d consists of a certain set of measurable mental inclinations or behaviors and use that as a \u2018frictionless plane,\u2019 against which to compare average, human behavior. This is what would be necessary for psychology to truly be dubbed science: a set of refutable hypotheses based upon a base case model, against which one can evaluate data and eventually forge (or refute) theories (which are collections of supported hypotheses, mind you.) So what does all this mean? It means that psychological analysis is often subject to changing terms and interpretations and that it consists more often of a large body of case knowledge\u2014 with comparable characteristics\u2014as opposed to a set of theories that are continually tested and revised. Psychological phenomena are thus documented observations of dispositions, inclinations or behaviors\u2014not models of anticipated behavior. Unfortunately, this opens the field to manipulation by pseudoscientists and politicians and social entrepreneurs. For example, in the early 20th Century, the medical and psychology profession was in full support of such pseudoscientific ideas as eugenics, while at the same time accepting Darwinism as a theory, without actually first assembling hypotheses to test either. The ripple effects of both eventually led to discriminatory policies such as Jim Crow in the US and Naziism in Germany. Closer to our time, the lack of testable models in psychology also means loosely defined concepts, such as \u201cintelligence\u201d (IQ) and emotional intelligence, lack definitive parameters of scope or objective quantifications. For example, we cannot predict that doing x and y (or possessing x and y, or experiencing x and y), will lead to a higher/lower IQ or \u201cEQ\u201d (a ridiculous concept, by itself), then test whether subjects who did, possessed or experienced x and y actually achieved the predicted IQ/EQ. There simply isn\u2019t a theory of how to acquire or enhance intelligence in either case. Instead (following this example), we see intelligence analysed as a trait that psychologists try to measure but without any specific purpose in doing so or without any theory related to it. Everything is about correlation: Correlation with success, correlation with personality traits, correlation with leadership ability, with income, with life span, etc. You see the problem, right? If we only discuss correlation (and not causation) we can assert anything\u2014e.g., \u201ccertain people are more (or less) intelligent because they are this (or that)\u201d. And this is precisely what has happened in the sub-field of intelligence study. Moreover, simply because these studies use statistical measures to show correlations does not make them scientific. There is no theory of what we should see: thus, they are not offering evidence for or against such a theory in light of the evidence. At best, there is a tacit model of common perception and casual observation\u2014e.g., \u201cpeople expect smarter people to succeed\u201d or something. Indeed, even though there is evidence intelligence is influenced by various factors (environmental, genetic, etc.), it is still considered a \u201ctrait,\u201d which may not be a entirely correct way of defining it. The danger again, as with eugenics, is the politicising of the concept. In today\u2019s world, for example\u2014where there is now a strong gender lobby\u2014the effort is made to suggest gender is biologically defined but not binary. Psychology is then misused to gloss over the lack of biological evidence that would explain the wide range of gender classifications beyond binary and genetic mutations. In other words, policed psychologists would suggest mental states override biological evidence when none can be found. Other spheres of politics face the same challenges. Nonetheless, let me offer one notable exception to all this: cognitive, behavioral psychology, for which Dan Kahneman, a psychologist, received the Economics Nobel Prize. In economic science, the \u201cfrictionless plane\u201d is homoeconomicus\u2014the perfectly, rational being. What Kahneman, Tversky and researchers subsequent to them showed was that human behavior routinely departs from the predictions of the rational economic model. These departures are considered \u201cirrational\u201d. Moreover, these departures have predictable characters\u2014which makes them even more fascinating\u2014such that they can be considered \u201cbiases,\u201d or directional departures from rationality. As a result, in a given set of circumstances, we can predict how a human being might respond to a given phenomenon and therefore what biases he might exhibit. So let\u2019s be clear: Prior to Kahneman and Tversky suggesting that psychology might invoke the rational man paradigm as a base case, psychology did not have such a base case\u2014and therefore, it did not have a scientific program in the strict sense. I suppose it remains for psychology as a field to now consider whether a type of rational man can be defined for domains outside economic gain: Say happiness, political ambition, etc. ",
