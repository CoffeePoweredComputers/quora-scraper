            "answer_text": "As there are many types of the interactive forces exist in the nature. But basically speaking there are four fundamental natural forces which exists in the nature. In the case of dipole dipole interactions the dominating force is electromagnetic(although there exists other three as well but are approximately negligible comparatively). There are a lot of applications of the dipole-dipole interactions, which cannot all be explained here. I would recommend you to check out  Also despite of this, search more video content on youtube about this topic, to get the complete information about this\u2026.. ",
