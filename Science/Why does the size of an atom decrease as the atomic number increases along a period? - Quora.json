            "answer_text": "Why is happens ? The size of an atom only depends on Principle Quantum Number. Now along the group moving from left to right the Principle Quantum Number increases. You must be wondering why decrease not increase even though an electron is added to the next congener element ? But you also have to notice that an addtion of the electron, a proton is also added. Therefore the force of attraction of Nucleus is increased. Now for Lithium [atom: 1s\u00b22s'] the effective nuclear charge for 1s\u00b2 electron is maximum while for the 2s' electron, due to screening effect of 1s electron, the effective nuclear charge is mush lesser( its like: jo log pehle aaya usse achha khana mila aur last me aaya usse bachakhucha khana mila). So the outermost electron is far away from necleus. This cause the increase in atomic size. For Berilium [1s\u00b22s\u00b2] as effective nuclear charge increase due to an addtion proton, even though 1s electrons screens, but effective nuclear charge is tends to attract the outermost electron. This reduce the size of the atom. And this continue for the next congener elements (B, C, N, O, F) Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "As you said that when we move along a period no. Of electrons and protons increases that's true so, you see according to COULUMB'S law :\u201cforce of attraction between two unlike charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges\u201d, and in our case total positive(protons) charge and total negative (electrons) charge both are increasing hence overall force of attraction between electrons and nucleus increases which results in decrease in atomic radius as we move along a period . This is maybe the most simplified way to answer your question but just for your info. The overall process involved in this phenomenon is a bit complex. ",
