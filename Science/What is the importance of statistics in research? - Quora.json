There are 2 major areas of statistics: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics Imp. statistical measures which are used to summarize research data are: Measures of central tendency or statistical averagesMeasures of dispersionMeasures of asymmetry (skewness)Measures of relationshipOther measuresFirst measure of skewness is based on mean and mode or on mean & median. Other measures of skewness, based on quartiles or on methods of moments. Kurtosis is used to measure peakedness of the curve of the frequency distribution.
