            "answer_text": "2020 is a year of choice. We are all making a choice to either grow up or remain in the business as usual system. The path of growing up is based on having faith in ourselves to go into a future without the protection of the securities that we have become accustomed to. It means taking the path of personal responsibly to be of service to others and become a master of our own destiny. That may sound like drama and fantasy, but it is the way of consciousness. Science cannot define consciousness because consciousness defines science. It is a fundamental property of the whole dynamically shifting and developing universe. Human beings have been experiencing a retarded consciousness for the last 16,500 years in the third density of love and light. This stage of consciousness is designed for us to make a choice which path of consciousness we want to develop from. The path of love and light or the path of dark light that is protected by greed, selfishness, cunning and deception without the need of love. In fact any love and empathy is seen as weakness and there is always someone ready to take advantage of it. This has been the way of things on earth for the last 16,500 years for the majority of civilized humanity. Some indigenous tribes followed the fourth density ideals even though the planet was still in the third density. In 1990, she shifted into the fourth density and is now becoming a fourth density consciousness entity called Gaia. As humanity shifts we will begin resonating with each other as we develop towards becoming social memory complexes. From my perspective, consciousness can be retarded, but never reduced as it is the creator and the creation. ",

            "answer_text": "And then electrodynamics is reduced down to some multi-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry, which can be reduced down to permutation theory which can be reduced down to \u2026 and so on without end. I think it all can be reduced down to what you ate for breakfast and whether or not you had time to jack off before your morning rush out the door. ",
