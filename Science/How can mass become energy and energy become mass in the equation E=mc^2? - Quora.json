            "answer_text": "E = mc^2 Well it's better to say E=\u0394mc^2 Where \u0394 is change in therefore \u0394m is change in mass Now E= \u0394mc^\u00b2 is not responsible For can conversion of mass to energy and vice versa It measures the amount of energy released when mass get converted into energy in nuclear reactions. In nuclear reaction initial substance looses it's mass after reaction and this loss of mass is converted into energy and this energy is measured by the formula E=\u0394mc^2 Where \u0394m is difference in mass between initial product and product after reaction And c is speed of light in vacuum Which is 3.0 * 10^8 m/s ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, mass is solidified energy. If we burn wood or coal, some part is converted into heat (that is energy), some part into gases and some part into ash. Similarly, in case of nuclear energy, uranium ( or plutonium or thorium) is converted into heat. Some part of energy is converted back to matter that is deposited to perphery of hole created in earth during the nuclear explosion, in case the explosion is conducted at ground. Experiments to convert the energy to matter have not been very succesful. It is said that partial success was achieved by Australian scientists. The reason is that very large amount of energy would be required to produce very small amount of matter. ",
