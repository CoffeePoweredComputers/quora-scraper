            "answer_text": "No, but also Yes. \u2026\u2026. First, why No: The speed of light is always constant no matter how you approach it - if you run towards a beam of light, its speed will not increase relative to you. It remains 300 000 km/s. If you run with a beam of light, it will not decrease relative to your speed. It remain 300 000 km/s. Unlike speeds for anything else, the speed of light is invariant and not a relative phenomenon. The highest-energy photon and the lowest-energy photon ever observed, travel at precisely the same speed. Always. It means that if something seems to indicate the speed of light varies under certain conditions, the explanation is likely found elsewhere. It is hard just to accept that there is an upper limit by principle. I mean, why not?? To understand this, we have to realize that space is a geometric form bound by dimensions, and so by definition, also bound by limitations. The reason why a circle, for example, has only 360 degrees, no more and no less, is geometry. There is no such thing as a 361-degree circle. Some rules cannot be broken, no matter the level of creativity or power. We can, of course, mathematically add more degrees, but it does not change the fact. We cannot make a circle more circular. And so it is for the cosmic speed limit; we cannot make it speedier. Geometry is the real answer to this question. Our universe is composed of a 3-dimensional space and a 1-dimensional time, through which all interactions happen. This relationship (in a geometric coordinate system we call the universe) between a moving particle and space-time - in which one is producing an effect on the other - necessitates a finite end-result. Simply said; there must be limits for the reality to work. When we speed up, time relatively slows down and space relatively contracts \u2014 101 in Special and General Relativity. At the speed of light, time completely stops, and space completely flattens in the direction of motion. You cannot stop time more than completely, and you cannot flatten space more than flat. Sounds banal, and it is\u2026 but this is the answer. We have the same issue as with the circle example above. We cannot add more degrees to a circle\u2019s circumference, either. It is both impossible and nonsensical. Thus, it is a limit.  The illustrated coordinate system is a representation on how time flattens space. Y becomes X the faster you move. A different way to say this: When the cosmic speed limit is reached, time essentially ceases to exist and mass/energy become infinite. Therefore, it is not \u201cspeed\u201d or amount of mass that is limited per se, but the effect speed has on our space-time geometry, when it reaches 300 000 km/s.  \u2026\u2026. Now, why Yes: Since time is a function of speed, it means the internal referenced time is slowed down the faster one moves. Move at the speed of light and your time has slowed so much down that it stops. To the rest of the universe, you are still moving, but to you; your time is not ticking at all. And so, to you, you can move from point A to point B instantly. Be it 100 km in distance or a trillion light years. Instantly, is a hell of a lot faster than 10 times the speed if light. It sounds paradoxical. Because were you to move at the speed of light, from your perspective, you can move instantly to any point in the universe. However, to the rest of the universe, you are still \u201donly\u201d whooshing at mere 300 000 km/s. So who is right? You or the universe? Well, as Einstein has taught us; you both are. And thus, the answer must be No, but also Yes.  Thank you for the question, Lawson ",

How long did it take you to do that, a second? Now get up, walk down there, note how long it took, and then walk back up here. Took you thirty seconds you say? What if you ran? What if you jumped down the stairs, bounced off the walls, think you could do it in ten seconds? How come in your imagination you could do it in one? Because your imagination isn\u2019t bounded by reality. Imagine you\u2019re on the moon, jumping around in the low gravity, hopping in one of the cars to see if the battery still works. Took you just a second to get there, right? Well it took the Apollo crews three days, and it takes light 1.3 seconds, so you just exceeded \u201cthe speed of light\u201d (C). Imagine you\u2019re orbiting Alpha Centauri, secure in a bubble, free to zoom around and check out the planets, note how little the three stars of the Centauri system resemble the shots in SF posters.

Anyone who says otherwise simply hasn\u2019t run the calculation which you can do for yourself here: Space travel calculator When I set the input of distance: 88 light-years, acceleration: 1g STC returns the following for traveler elapse time during journey: 8.78 years. So that\u2019s a journey of 88 light-years, constantly accelerating at 1g for the first half, then decelerating at 1g for the second half and arriving after experiencing only 8.78 years of aging - a legitimate claim to a rate of travel 10x that of light. The trick is to not reckon the distance traveled until after you arrive. If you measure your instantaneous speed you will find that it is never greater than .99976c, the maximum instantaneous speed at the halfway point when the mission changes over from acceleration to deceleration. What\u2019s going on in this mission is that relativistic length-contraction effects are coming into play to shorten the distance to the destination during acceleration and then to stretch it back out during deceleration.

Currently, they exist Only in Science Fiction stories, there is no evidence that they exist in reality. There is some research being done on Warp technology- that would bend or compress space so you could arrive somewhere as if going faster than light while not actually traveling through space faster than light. If gravity is truly the result of Mass \u2018\u2019bending\u2019\u2019 space, as some theories predict, this might actually work, but no concrete evidence at this time that it can work.

I\u2019ll touch on one other point- because it may be a source of confusion- you may often hear the Universe is expanding faster than light. This is \u2018true\u2019 but misleading. Like a loaf of bread dough expanding in the oven when you cook it, it\u2019s expanding in all directions. The universe is expanding in all directions, so the overall size is increasing, distant galaxies mover farther away from each other \u201cfaster than light\u201d because the space between them is expanding, but they are not moving Through space faster than light.

Some physicists know this; some are lost in the complexities of Special Relativity. I will copy something from weinsteinsletter.weebly which makes it easy to see. I am going to offer an alternative to the gravity hypothesis. We know that people waves travel through people. We know that water waves travel though water. We know that sound (air waves) travels through air. It may be that electromagnetic waves travel through electromagnetic fields. Of course, there always seems to be a catch \u2013 now we must find the electromagnetic fields that light travels through. Where are these electromagnetic fields that light traverses? You\u2019re sitting on it. The atom provides an external electromagnetic field \u2013 any atom, all atoms (around here). External to the atom, the electron is closer (by the average of inverse squares) to any point in (external to the atom) space. Recall that an atom is mostly empty space and that the external part of an atom are its electrons. Thus, electro-negativity dominates our space. This electro-negative field provides an aether for light. Light (an electromagnetic wave or particle) travels through the aether (the electro-magnetic fields of space). Here is some background information. The electromagnetic field drops off (per electron, or per proton) as the inverse square of the distance. I guess I should mention that the electromagnetic field of a line of charge drops off as the inverse of the distance (no squared term). Further, I should mention that the electromagnetic field (from charge) of a (geometric) plane is a constant (for all distance, for all space). We exist in a sea of electro-negativity. Because our universe is made from electronegative-faced atoms (and molecules and other local matter), we should expect an electronegative field (for all space). What about regions in space that are positively charged? First, the \u201cpositive\u201d charged space may be rather just somewhat less negatively charged. Second, maybe light just changes phase in a positive region. For example, Faraday reported that light changed phase in a strong magnetic field. Therefore, M&M were transmitting light in a sea of aether, i.e., electronegativity. No wonder they found that the speed of light was a constant. They couldn\u2019t do otherwise. This aether was entrained. It was stuck to the Earth. Now I get to write this important conclusion. Thus, M&M found the speed of light on Earth to be constant because of the entrained aether. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes we can, but then light goes even faster. The speed of light is 300 000 km/s. Theoretically it's possible to travel 3 million km/s, due to time dilation. You see, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the closer you get to light speed, the slower your clock ticks. At 99.5% of light speed, only 1 years passes for you, for every 10 light years you travel. That works out to 3 million km/s. Exactly 10 times the speed of light. The thing to remember is that time dilation affects our biological clocks. It's not just our clock that says only 1 year has passes. We physically experience only 1 year. All our biological processes slow down. That means we physically age 1 year for every 10 orbits of the Earth around the sun. If we could see earth, it would be spinning like a top. ",

The fastest vehicle ever made only traveled at about 200,000 mph, which is far less that the speed of light. Theoretically, it is not possible to go faster than the speed of light. However, because time dilates and length contracts and one gets close to the speed of light, one can travel a distance that a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth) measure as more than a light year in a time period, which as measured by the traveler, is less than a year. However, that is not the same as traveling faster than the speed of light, because from the point of view of the traveler, they went less than a light year, and when they measure their own speed, it is less than the speed of light. Also from the point of view of the observer on Earth the trip will take more than a year. ",

            "answer_text": "NO. Observable velocity is absolutely limited, but not because c is an arbitrary limit. It is a fact that Newtonian momentum is inadequate to explain measured momentum at relativistic speeds. Fact is, momentum is NOT proportional to observed velocity, it is proportional to Proper velocity. These two measures of velocity are related by geometry, and have always been observed together. Not one single case where observed velocity of some mass is not accompanied by relativistic momentum. Geometrically, observed velocity is the cosine projection of Proper velocity. It is the nature of this relationship that as Proper velocity approaches infinity, observed velocity, its cosine projection, asymptotically approaches c. This means that an observed velocity greater than c would REQUIRE a Proper velocity greater than infinity. This is an absurd proposition. It goes beyond the singularity at c, because it is not merely a single value, it is ALL velocities greater than c. The tachyon cannot exist, even if it never slows down below c. Proper velocity routinely exceeds this limit, but Proper velocity is not observable. All particles with mass are constrained by the observable limit. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on who is watching. There are a lot of ways of representing the same physical situation and ways of doing transforms between them. So what follows is just an alternative transform to the usual Lorentz based treatment of special relativity. but we could start by constructing an abstract Newtonian frame of reference around our spacecraft. And we use it to track the Newtonian velocity that is the result of our spaceships constant acceleration. in this abstract frame we note that our ultimate velocity is infinite, we can always keep on accelerating and going faster and our \u2018abstract\u2019 Newtonian speed keeps going up. now, because space-time is weird and light speed is imvariant, there is a transform we must apply to see how our abstract-keeps-increasing-to-infinity speed translates to an observed speed. Because, as it turns out, the faster our velocity, the closer our velocity to c, relative to some other frame of reference: I.e. if we are covering many many meters per second, our velocity develops an increasing temporal component in the target reference frame: and we start to travel into its future. Ironically a seconds per meter value. Literally time travel. now again, this is just a rephrasing of the lorentz transforms in a way that I think can help explain some of the consequences of relativistic travel in a more intuitive way: when objects are moving into your future you have to see them as frozen in time. I.e. time dialation is what it looks like when something time travels forwards.the real reason you can\u2019t reach the speed of light Is it\u2019s actually unbound to the accelerating spaceship. They need to accelerate forever and still won\u2019t reach it. And accelerating forever would require infinite kinetic energy so that\u2019s where that comes from.because your velocity is unbound you can go anywhere you want in as short a time as you want to experience. But you always will incur cost where if you cross a million light years in a day, then you will arrive a million years in the future.accelerating, technically just changing your speed, gives you a velocity through time, not anything else: if a twin leaves earth and flies to alpha centuri and then returns, the time dilation of their journey is irrelevant as it symmetrically applied to both twins. The only thing that was important was that the one twin changes from +1 to -1 c 4 ly from earth: that twin gained 4 years in the earth frame one way and gained 4 years on the way back.",

            "answer_text": "Speed is a relative concept with no absolutes. The speed of light is the speed of light not a speed limit of the universe. The speed of light is always the same for every observer irrespective of their speed relative to an assumed stationary location. There is no absolute space or absolute time to determine an absolute speed. It depends on how you want to calculate speed, if you use the basic formula for speed ther is no limit. If you use relativistic calculations with a third party then you cannot go faster than the speed of light. When an observer is moving relative to something at say 80%C they will still measure the speed of light relative to them at the same as if they were stationary. In actual fact at the same time they could be stationary relative to another body. The question is what is the true speed of the observer. On their own they are at rest relative to space, so how can space prevent them from moving. Or other objects relative to them. The only real limit an observer has is their visual range of speed, which is limited to their speed of light, not their speed relative to other bodies. As there are bodies moving at all different speeds relative to the observer in the universe. Which one do we select to determine this speed limit of the universe. ",

So, at first sight, it seems that they exceed the speed of light ( that travel four and a half years) But these are because of their flow of time in their reference frame ( their speed of time) is slower than on Earth. As they approach much more to the speed of light then their time will slow down much more and according to their calculation, they travel with the value of the speed of light (calculated on Earth) multiply with 2 or 3 or 4 times more or even ten times if you like. But this is just as they run to catch Fata Morgana (in the desert). The real value for their speed of light is greater and greater and they never catch it in this way. We have to find other ways to escape from the Observable Universe. Outside, we will have a few problems because there is no the same stability of the spatial and temporal conditions as in OU. Therefore it will be hard to determine the speed. But certainly will be faster than the speed of light from the inside of our Observable Universe. ",
