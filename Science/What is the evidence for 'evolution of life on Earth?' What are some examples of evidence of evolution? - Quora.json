            "answer_text": "Their is no evidence for evolution. Finches remain finches regardless of how many times they undergo speciation. Peppered moths remain moths. E. coli remain E. coli. Bears remain bears, dogs remain dogs, T-Rex remained T-Rex. Colecanth remained Colecanth. Tiktaalik will remain Tiktaalik for every fossil found if it. The evidence is you are to take these zeros and imagine they existed:  \u201cThis diagram is originally from the Chicago Field Museum, Illinois and is copied from Dr. Carl Werner's book Evolution: The Grand Experiment , Vol 1 , p 127, 128, 229. The numbers on the diagram provided by scientists who support evolution\u201d This one sample is true for every single evolutionary tree for every single creature where they imagine the separate lines connect. The actual evidence? Zeros\u2026\u2026\u2026 When there exists no evidence imagination becomes your evidence. And you can imagine anything you like as long as you ignore every observation and experiment ever performed. Finches remain finches. E. coli remain E. coli\u2026. Kind after Kind. Get used to it, because imagination us not going to change it\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Read Genesis 1\u201311. Read about ancient historical texts around the world that almost unanimously include these SAME historical events with the same details. This is our true world history. Also read about how ALL ancient peoples all over the world wrote about, drew pictures, and even made statues of the dinosaurs they encountered. There are many, many of these stories around the world. There are dinosaurs in Job, in Bel and the Dragon for Catholics. St. George and the Dragon the most famous in England and on coins. Dragon-slaying saints of Christianity. Dragons in medieval times. Sure, some stories are fictionalized in whole or in part. But the oldest stories and the origin of stories is based on human\u2019s experiences with dinosaurs. Evidence for microevolution, evolution within kinds of living things, is in science and science books. Is fact, and can be studied. Macroevolution, evolution between kinds of living things, is a fanciful myth with no basis in fact which goes against the ancient historical accounts of the world. I believe history. Not made-up revised history on false premises, false dating methods, artistic drawings, hoaxes, wishful thinking, imagination, and a denial of not only historical documents ALL over the world, but also scientific ones as well.
