            "answer_text": " FIG 1 description: Schematic illustration of the mitotic division of the mammalian Golgi. During interphase, the Golgi stacks (green) are interconnected into a ribbon-like structure near the centrosomes (red) and next to the nucleus (blue). In late G2, before the cells enter mitosis, the connections between the stacks are severed. In early mitosis, the Golgi cisternae unstack and vesiculate, leading to the disassembly of the Golgi. By metaphase, mitotic Golgi membranes cluster at the spindle poles, associate with astral microtubules, and are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The membranes are then partitioned as the spindle elongates and segregates the chromosomes during anaphase. During telophase and cytokinesis, the Golgi membranes reassemble in each daughter cell into a larger ribbon next to the centrosome and a smaller ribbon adjacent to the cleavage furrow. In the \ufb01nal stage, the smaller ribbon moves to the opposite side of the nucleus to merge with the larger ribbon.  FIG 2 description: Schematic illustration of putative Golgi disassembly and reassembly mechanisms during the cell cycle. (A) During interphase, Golgi cisternae are held together by trans-oligomers of GRASP65 and GRASP55 (not shown). COPI transport vesicles are tethered to the Golgi by the giantin-p115-GM130 complex, which facilitates fusion with the targeting membrane. (B) Early in mitosis, phosphorylation of GM130 by Cdk1 inhibits binding of p115, which helps block vesicle tethering and subsequent fusion. GRASP65 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Plk, which disrupts GRASP65 oligomerization and results in cisternal unstacking. Unstacking increases the membrane surface for the formation of COPI vesicles that fail to fuse because of the disruption of the tethering complex, leading to disassembly of the Golgi (C). (D) During late mitosis, the Golgi reforms by two fusion processes mediated by NSF and p97 ATPases together with their adaptor proteins. Following dephosphorylation of GM130, tethering and NSF-mediated fusion are restored, generating short cisternae, whereas p97-mediated fusion reassembles membranes into longer, but single cisternae. Reformed cisternae are \ufb01rst linked by p115 and then stacked once GRASP65 is dephosphorylated by PP2A. Image and text taken from and if you want to read in detail about it: Golgi biogenesis. ",
