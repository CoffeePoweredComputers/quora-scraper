            "answer_text": "The Moon looks\u2026like asphalt.  This is a man in Wisconsin on an asphalt road.  This is a man on the Moon. Notice the similarity? These are Moon rocks  They are darker than you\u2019d expect. Reason? The Moon looks lighter than it is thanks to the fact that we are always looking at it against either a blue or almost black background. Now, during a \u201cBlood Moon\u201d, what you\u2019re typically seeing is an image of the Moon reddened by our atmosphere. If you were on the Moon in such a scenario, you\u2019d see nothing different. However\u2026 A \u201cBlood Moon\u201d can also be the result of a lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, you\u2019d definitely notice something different on the Moon. Rather than seeing the Sun, blinding and horrible in the sky, the Earth would blot it out. It would be very dark\u2026but a reddish hue would be visible. Why? Because the Sun\u2019s light will be reddened by passage through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. A tiny amount of that light will bathe the Moon in a Hadean glow. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean a lunar eclipse, say so. Leave \u201cblood moon\u201d to the illiterates. To someone standing on the Moon during what we\u2019d call a lunar eclipse, they would see a total Solar eclipse as the Earth moves in front of the Sun. It would not resemble a Solar eclipse on Earth, because the Earth would appear much larger than the Sun and could take hours to move across the Sun\u2019s disk. It would also look different because the Earth has an atmosphere, and as the sunlight passes through it, the blue light is scattered, leaving red light to pass through. You\u2019d see a red ring surrounding the surface of the Earth. Essentially, you would be seeing all the sunrises and sunsets on Earth at once. And that red glow is what illuminates the Moon during totality. If you looked around you, you would see the landscape illuminated by that red glow. But your eyes would quickly adjust and the color would be less evident. And that\u2019s still no excuse to call it a \u201cblood moon\u201d. ",
