What is its density? Step 1: Calculate the volumeV = lwh = 10.0 cm \u00d7 10.0 cm \u00d7 2.00 cm = 200cm\u00b3 Step 2: Calculate the density d = m/V = 433g200cm\u00b3= 2.16 g/cm\u00b3 MASS d = m/V We can rearrange this to get the expression for the mass. m = d\u00d7V Example:If 500 mL of a liquid has a density of 1.11 g/mL, what is its mass? m = d\u00d7V = 500 mL \u00d7 1.11g1mL = 555 g VOLUME d = m/V We can rearrange this to get the expression for the volume. V = m/d Example:What is the volume of a bar of gold that has a mass of 14.83 kg. The density of gold is 19.32 g/cm\u00b3.

            "answer_text": "The other two answers, from J. Sullivan and M. Lopez, cover the question well in a formal sense. I would just add an answer oriented to the intuitive sense, hopefully to help comprehension. Say for example you were asked to find the volume of a water bucket and all you had available for measuring was a bathroom scale. So you weigh the bucket empty (1 kilo), fill it with water and weigh it again (11 kilos) and subtract to learn that the bucket held 10 kilos of water. You know that water has a density (weight per known standard volume) of 1 kilo per liter. So to learn the volume of the bucket you only need to divide the weight of the bucket's water by the density, 10 / 1 = 10 liters. Voila. ",
