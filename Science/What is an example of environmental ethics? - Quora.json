This second person claims the first person violated the tree\u2019s rights. Note the tree remains silent throughout. Then the first person attempts to disagree with the second person, but is reminded the science is settled. Under this withering logic, the second person has a third person charge and take the first person to jail, who then appears before a fourth person who pronounces the first person guilty. The first person is duly sentenced. There you go\u2026 environmental \u2018ethics\u2019\u2026 ",
