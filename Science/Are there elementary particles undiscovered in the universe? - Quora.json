            "answer_text": "Not only are there no other elementary particles that are not already known, but some of the elementary particle that are known are not really elementary particles\u2026 let that sink in! What is undiscovered (and will always remain undiscovered) is the entity that is the building block of spacetime. These entities are NOT particles. Particles exist \u201cin\u201d spacetime. The component building block entities of spacetime exists \u201cas\u201d spacetime, not \u201cin\u201d spacetime. The energy associated with the entities of spacetime is proportional to c^0 and represents the base energy state in the three tiered hierarchy of energy expressed by this equation:  Physicists only know the energy that is associated with particles \u201cin\u201d spacetime. The known energy is the energy of light (photons) when G = 1 and m(subG) = h/wavelength and the energy of mass when G = 2 and m(sub2) = mass. During the big bang conditions existed for the E0 energy of spacetime to jump up to the higher energy states. After the big bang, E1 energy was not able to fall back to the base E0 energy state. This is why we have the law of conservation of energy. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything reveals the internal energy structure of spacetime, photons and the elementary particles. If a particle cannot be derived using Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything, then the particle does not exist in reality. The Gordon model tells us that an elementary magnetic monopole particle is impossible to exist. It also tells us that the down quark cannot be an elementary particle. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything shows that an electron and an up quark are elementary particles and that a down quark is a complex particle composed of an electron and an up quark. I sure this comes as a shock to physicists as they are totally committed to their current model BUT the Gordon model takes into consideration all the energy in the universe in its derivations and gives more details to the internal energy structure of particles. More importantly the Gordon model does not conflict with any accurate experimental data ever obtained but it does change the model. ",

            "answer_text": "From the point of view of standard physics, probably yes, although nothing unclassified has been found by the LHC. Some types of particles are theorised (gravitons, for example), whereas some are purely virtual models (the Higgs boson, even quarks, gluons\u2026). Yet, it\u2019s at least a bit questionable in the first place what a representation of a subatomic particle is, but the mathematical models based on them work mostly fine to some currently acceptable level. Here just recall that what we call a subatomic particle is a mathematical model in a framework of our currently acknowledged working theories in physics and that there are serious gaps in our ways of modeling them. Not to mention that many fundamental concepts used in physics are deeply logically flawed \u2014 for example, take spacetime and probabilistic wavefunctions/fields spread over it which are basically very useful concepts used together \u2014 however, their physical interpretation is not so \u201cphysical\u201d after all, but a better model of them we haven\u2019t had yet. (Btw, a funny side of this \u2014 you could add various imaginary particles/fields with their specific features to the Standard Model, which is considered to be a minimal acceptable set of modeling fields, just to do some fine tuning of some observed phenomena. So general this working model is, yet majority of observations falls into the acceptable error range of either the theory itself with this minimal set of elementary particles or related measurements.) On the other hand, most probably it is not a matter of finding \u201csmaller\u201d or \u201cother type of\u201d particles \u2014 rather, it is about how something is connected/related to something else. Briefly, what we consider to be spacetime with all the different particles/fields in it is a \u201chigh-level\u201d behavioral model, an averaged mathematical \u201cprojection\u201d of a discrete causal network made of extremely simple elements (\u201cparticles\u201d, whatever). Here different families of subatomic particles and their associated properties are actually only classified various descriptive and averaged patterns in behavior of such a network (see the link above or my other answers related to the subject for more). In that context, we have probably identified most or major ones of these \u201cbehavioral patterns\u201d, so to speak, yet some subtle ones are still waiting on us to be discovered. Everything said here was in my personal opinion. And, I really do respect physics and its achievements, so please consider the criticism shown above as positive. ",

            "answer_text": "In short and brief answer,nothing in science absolute as such,everything depends on the science and technology development, toward higher energy,resolution power and more accurate mathematical modeling to nature phenomena.Before 1897 the atom considered indivisible so it is the fundamental block in matter structure, its name in Creek is indivisible.But in 1897 discovered it is matter with electrons located as watermelon seeds,in 1911 the nucleus discovered with positive charge and it is the main mass of the atom,followed by discovering the nucleus constituents of the nucleus,the proton and neutron.Up to 1964 the nucleons considered as fundamental particles,but then they are found they are composed of quarks particles,their names has nothing to do with science,it is Gelmann fantasy.Now the fundamental particles are 16 quarks,leptons and Bosons. Is it possible new elementary particles be discovered ,the answer hung on up to new development. ",
