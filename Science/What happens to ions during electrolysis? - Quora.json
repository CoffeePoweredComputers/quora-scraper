            "answer_text": "The ions move towards the electrodes. Anions or negative ions, move towards the anode. Cations, or positive ions, move towards the cathode. At the anode, a deficiency of electrons is making the anode positively charged, which is what is attracting the anions. At the cathode, an excess of electrons is making the cathode negatively charged. What happens next depends on many things. A half reaction occurs at each electrode. However this may or may not involve the ions in the electrolytic cell. At the anode, oxidation occurs, as electrons are removed. At the cathode, reduction occurs, as electrons are gained. Some examples of different half reactions in different situations are as follows. In a copper refinery, the anodes are impure copper, having gone through processing to extract copper from whatever mineral is present in the ore. At the anode, the copper atoms making up the anode lose two electrons and go into solution, to move towards the cathode. More easily oxidised ions that tend to be mixed in the anode also form ions and go into solution. For example, lead and zinc are often found deposited along with copper and are present. Less easily oxidised metal atoms do not lose electrons. As the anode is eaten away completely in this process, these atoms drop to the bottom of the electrolytic cell, as form anode mud. These are silver and even gold which are often in the same deposit as copper. The cathode used to be made of thin sheets of very pure copper. However, modern refineries use a process developed in Australia, and plate directly onto stainless steel. This is better as the stainless steel is more rigid and thus smoother, allowing for the deposited copper to be much purer, around 99.9999% pure if my memory serves me correctly. Copper ions from the solution gain electrons and deposit as copper atoms. These can later be remove from the stainless steel cathodes. The above is an example of electrorefining, which occurs at copper refineries. these may be a long distance from the mine where the anodes are made. A copper refinery is near where I live. Across the road from the copper refinery is a zinc refinery. There, electrowinning occurs. Zinc cannot be obtained as easily from its compounds. So a zinc compound is dissolved in water, and electric current is passed through. The half-reaction that is wanted at the cathode is for zinc ions to gain electrons to make metallic zinc. Due to how difficult it is to reduce zinc, it is almost as easy to reduce water and make hydrogen gas. Zinc refineries have to ensure the solution has a high pH, to reduce the risk of making hydrogen gas. However, sometimes, explosive hydrogen gas does get made, with a risk of accident. So that illustrates that even water can be electrolysed. Electrolysis of water, that is slightly acidified is a reaction that can be done in a piece of apparatus known as Hoffman's Voltameter. The volume of hydrogen will be twice the volume of oxygen, as twice as many hydrogen molecules are made. Other reactions can occur. Recharging a battery for a laptop computer or a phone, or the battery in a car all involve electrolysis. In these cases, the reactions are simply the reverse of the reaction that produced the electricity to run the device. ",

            "answer_text": "They move, under the influence of the electrical current. Here is the trick n. 1: cations (i.e. positively charged ions) move to the cathode (the negative electrode), whereas anions (negatively charged ions) move to the anode (the positive electrode). Here is the trick n. 2: which is which? Remember PANIC. Positive is Anode, Negative Is Cathode. When the ions get to either electrode, cations pick up electrons and get reduced; anions, on the other hand, lose such electrons and get oxidised. ",
