            "answer_text": "It is mainly for historical reasons, as the kilogram was originally defined as the mass of 1 liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius at sea level (actually the gram as 1 cubic centimeter or one milliliter of water at the temperature of melting ice, later at the greatest density of water, i.e. 4 degrees[1]). That means that the specific gravity of water, is the same as its density in kilograms per liter, which is 1. This is very convenient. Water was chosen as the most commonly available substance that could be obtained in reasonably purity, and was the most commonly used in the early 1800s when all this happened. Of course, hydrogen is used as the fluid for gasses, water for liquids or solids[2]. Thanks for asking. Footnotes[1] Gram - Wikipedia[2] the definition of specific gravity",

            "answer_text": "Because the definition of specific gravity compares the temperature change of a substance for a given amount of heat energy compared to a standard material. What shall we use for our standard material? A solid is ok, it\u2019s stable but a little hard to measure it\u2019s temperature, which is required. Gases are too difficult to handle and most are colorless which makes them hard to see. So we are left with a liquid. If it\u2019s cheap and plentiful that helps. Wait, what about water? It fits every need. So there you go. ",
