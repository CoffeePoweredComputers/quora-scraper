One is antithetical to the other.  1 Peter 2:19-24 NIV [19] For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. [20] But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. [21] To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. [22] \u201cHe committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\u201d [23] When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. [24] \u201cHe himself bore our sins\u201d in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; \u201cby his wounds you have been healed.\u201d The one who carries the instrument of His own unjust torture and death, says \u201cWhoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me\u201d. Christians can, and will, be injured and murdered as a result. Come, Lord Jesus. ",
