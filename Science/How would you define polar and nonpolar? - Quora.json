            "answer_text": "Polar molecules have dipole moments that do not cancel out. There is a side of the molecule that is more positive or negative. Look at the molecule for water or hydrochloric acid.  Nonpolar molecules have dipole moments that cancel out. Consider the molecules of CO2 and methane (CH4) for example of this. This means that there isn't a side that is more positive or negative. Nonpolar molecules could even lack dipole moments. Consider diatomic molecules. The point is that no side is different charge-wise. ",

            "answer_text": "To determine if a molecule is polar, if you are in a lab, simply mix it with water. If it dissolves, it is polar.  If it does not, it most likely is not. If you are working on this theoretically, first draw the Lewis structure.  Determine the shape of the molecule and determine if any of the individual bonds are polar (you need an electronegativity table for this). If the molecule has only nonpolar bonds, then it is non polar.  If the molecule has some polar bonds, determine if the molecule is perfectly symmetrical.  If it is, most likely the molecule is nonpolar.  If not, then it is most likely polar. ",
