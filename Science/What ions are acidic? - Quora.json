            "answer_text": "It is an interesting question but the way it is worded is not great. One definition of acid is \u201ca substance which on addition to the solvent increases the concentration of positive ions formed by the autoionization of the solvent\u201d Consider water and liquid ammonia for a moment 2H2O \u2192 OH- + H3O+ and 2NH3 \u2192 NH2- + NH4+ These two equilibria exist in the liquids, the eqilibrium lays very much to the left. If you were to add a Bronsted acid such as F3CSO3H to liquid ammonia then the reaction would be F3CSO3H + NH3 \u2192 F3CSO3- + NH4+ Thus you have generated more NH4+ In the case of liquid ammonia or water if you were to add simple protons to either then these would act as Lewis acids and bind to the solvent molecules thus forming NH4+ or H3O+. The Lewis acid is a species which can accept an electron pair (or pairs) this offers a means of forming positively charged species in some cases. For example copper(II) dications are Lewis acids with a moderate strength. In water a copper(II) cation reacts with four waters to form [Cu(H2O)4]2+ ions while in ammonia they would react to form [Cu(NH3)4]2+. So a positively charged Lewis acid can act as an acid according to the definition of \u201ca species which increases the number of positvely charged ions in solution\u201d. Some Lewis bases such as chloride and cyanide anions are anionic, these can react with metal cations (lewis acids) to form neutral or even anionic complexes such as ZnCl2 and [Fe(CN)6]3- Things can get a little complex as some Lewis acids are electrically neutral and can react with electrically neutral Lewis bases to form neutral complexes. For example borane can react with pyridine to form Py.BH3 which is a neutral species. So I would say that some positively charged ions are able to act as acids. ",
