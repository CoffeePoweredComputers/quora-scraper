            "answer_text": "Importance of technology such as mobile phones and GPS are easy to see, as you are able to make sure you have a means of communication in the instance of a problem. But this is universal and if we are talking about only the importance of technology for the youth, it works in a respect that it allows for new friendships to be made through the use of social-media. In addition to this technology allows for more current and easy learning than ever before. It\u2019s so easy for a younger person to just \u201cgoogle\u201d something now and find the answer.
