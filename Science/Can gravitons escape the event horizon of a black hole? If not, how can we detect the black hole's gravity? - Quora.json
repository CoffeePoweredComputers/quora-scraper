            "answer_text": "The gravity effect of a black holes decreases with distance, like all gravitational effects. There are two questions related to main question as follow: 1- How can we detect black holes? \u201cThe first way we detect black holes is by their gravitational influence and the second way is by observing the matter falling into the black hole.\u201d  \u201cIllustration of the horizon surrounding the black hole. The black holes is represented by the small heavy dot, the light rays or particle trajectories which cross the dotted line cannot cross it again.\u201d 2- Does a black hole eat its gravity? According to above item, if a black hole eats its own gravity effect inside of event Horizon, every black hole should be undetectable. So, gravitons can escape the event horizon of a black hole. Now considerable question is: Do gravitons really exist? However, according to old definition of graviton in quantum field theory, answer is: \u201cSurely, no, graviton does not exist\u201d. In quantum field theory, the graviton is massless with a spin of 2 that mediates the force of gravitational field. This is because the source of gravitation is the stress-energy tensor, a second-rank tensor. But evidences show, gravitational potential is quantized. In fact, old definition of graviton is not able to solve quantum vacuum problem. According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a vacuum isn't empty, and filled with particle-antiparticle pairs that appear and disappear randomly. So, we need a new definition of graviton. New definition should be based on developing old theories and experimental evidences. At present, the greatest problem in theoretical physics is combining the general relativity with quantum mechanics. Physicists are trying to solve this problem in the context of modern physics or to think the beyond of the modern physics, while they have not cared classical physics. In all of these efforts, the classical physic has been ignored, while nature is unique and all physical phenomena, from the microscopic or the macroscopic ones are obeying the same law. To answer the question of this topic, first we must answer this question: \u201cWhat is the intersection of these three theories about the gravity?\" The intersection of these three theories about the gravity, the emphasis is on energy. So, to find the answer, let's focus on energy. Classical mechanics Every atom creates its own gravitational field. Also, particles such as electron creates its own gravitational field. Not only massive particles, even photons carry their own gravitational fields that are inherent in their mass-energies. The gravitational field of a massless point particle is first calculated using the linearized field equations. Is gravitational field continuous or discrete? Stars are born within the clouds of dust. A star is made up of atoms, each atom contains a few sub atomic particles, and each element has its own gravitational field. So, the gravitational field of a star is formed of combination the gravitational fields of its sub atomic particles. When a star explodes, every part of it such as sub atomic particles carries its own gravitational field. It shows sub atomics particles absorb each other, even in star. In the other word, gravitational field is quantized. Gravitational field In classical mechanic, the gravitational field g around a point mass M is a vector field consisting at every point (with distance r of point mass M) of a vector pointing directly towards the particle that is given by:  With regard to the exchange particles concept in the quantum Field theory and the existence of graviton, when a particle / object is falling in the gravitational field, it goes from a low layer to a higher layer density of gravitons. Thus, we should investigate the impact of changing the density of gravitons on the exchange gravitons between the particles that in continue will be done. Why gravitons escape of event horizon? The reason is that the escape velocity of a massive body is related to speed of graviton that is described as follow: In quantum mechanics, the concept of a point-like particle is complicated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, because even an elementary particle, with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. According to the quantum mechanics that photon and electron are unstructured particle, we cannot answer the unanswered questions. There are many articles that show, photon has upper limit mass and electric charge, which are consistent with experimental observations. Theories and experiments have not limited to photons and graviton will also be included. For gravity there have been vigorous debates about even the concept of graviton rest mass. In recent decades, the structure of photon is discussed and physicists are studying the photon structure. Some evidence shows the photon consists of a positive and a negative charges. In addition, new experiment shows that the probability of absorption at each moment depends on the photon's shape, also photons are some 4 meters long which is incompatible with unstructured concept. For study and understanding the photon structure we need to describe relation between frequency and energy of photon. The change of frequency of the photon in the gravitational field has been demonstrated by the Pound-Rebka experiment. When photon falls a distance equal y toward the earth, according to conservation law of energy we have: Color-charges and magnetic-color A photon with the lowest possible energy also carries electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, the features of gravitons entered into the structure of the photon must behave in a way that along with explaining the energy of photon, describes increasing in intensity of electric and magnetic fields. In other words, some of these gravitons cause increasing the electric field of photon and some other gravitons increase the intensity of magnetic fields. Also, not only a photon at lowest level of its energy is formed by some of the gravitons, but also its formed members have electric and magnetic properties that is called color-charge and magnetic-color in CPH theory. The next step is to specify color-charges and magnetic-colors in which it is obtained by paying attention to at least change in energy of photon in a gravitational field while moving into blue shift of gravity.   By producing positive and negative electric fields, two magnetic fields are produced around the electric fields do form. Therefore, it will be made two groups of magnetic-colors. So CPH matrix is defined as follows:  CPH matrix shows the least magnitude energy of a photon. Sub-Quantum Energy (SQE) We use CPH matrix to define positive and negative sub quantum energies as follow: The first column of CPH matrix is defined positive sub quantum energy and the second column of CPH matrix is defined negative sub quantum energy, so;  The amount of speed and energy of positive and negative sub quantum energies are equal, and the difference between them are only in the sign of their color-charges and magnetic-color flow direction. Virtual photons There are two types of virtual photons, positive and negative virtual photons which are defined as follows:  A real photon is formed of a positive virtual photon and a negative virtual photon:  There, n and k are natural numbers. So far, the production of electromagnetic energy (photons) was described by using gravitational blue-shift, in reverse phenomena photons decay to negative and positive virtual photons. In redshift, virtual photons also decay to positive and negative sub quantum energies (SQEs), and sub quantum energies (SQEs) decay to color-charges and magnetic-colors, too. Color-charges and magnetic-colors away from each other, lose their effect on each other and become gravitons. In addition, there is a relation between the number of SQEs in structure of photon and energy (also frequency) of photon.  So, photons are combination of positive and negative virtual photons. Photon is a very weak electric dipole that is consistent with the experience and these articles are asserted. In addition, this property of photon (very weak electric dipole) can describe the absorption and emission energy by charged particles. Graviton Principle Graviton is the most minuscule unit of energy with constant mass m(G) that moves with a constant magnitude of speed V(G) so that V(G) > c , in all inertial reference frames. Any interaction between graviton and other existing particles represents a moment of inertia I where the magnitude of V(G) remains constant and never changes. Therefore;  Based on the principle of graviton, the total speed of transmission speed and non-transmission of graviton is constant. Also, total transmission energy and non-transmission of graviton is constant, so that:  As the graviton mass and speed is constant, its energy remains constant and can only its transmission energy changes to non-transmission energy and vice versa. Gravitons combine with each other and produce the large amounts of energy quanta, and energy converts to matter and anti-matter. In fact, everything has been formed of graviton. This approach to graviton helps us to describe quantum vacuum and generalize the Maxwell equations from electromagnetism to the gravitational field. Sub-Quantum Energy Principle One SQE is a very small energy with NRP (Never at Rest condition Particle) mass m(SQE) that moves with speed V(SQE) > c relative to inertial reference frame and in every interaction between SQEs with other particles or fields the speed value of SQE remains constant; as in every physical condition we have;  SQE principle shows that in every condition the mass, energy and the amount speed of SQE remains constant, and only the transmission speed V(SQET) and energy of SQE convert to its non-transmission speed V(SQES) and energy E(SQES), and vice versa. So, we have;  Light Speed According to the principle of Special Relativity, the speed of light in vacuum is constant and it equals to c for all inertia observers, and it is independent of the light source. How we can conclude this principle by using sub quantum energy principle? First, according to principle of SQE (which is also the result of the graviton principle) the amount of the linear speed of SQE depends to the interaction between SQEs and the other particles (or fields) in the medium. So, in a vacuum, photon (light) has not any interaction with other particles or fields outside of the photon structure, (assume gravitational effect of vacuum is negligible), thus, the linear speed of SQEs in the structure of photons are constant and equal to v(SQE) = c. Also, the linear speed of virtual photons in a vacuum is the same amount of c. Let\u2019s in generally, show the speed of photons as v(light) , it changes from one environment to another that in a vacuum is c, it means the speed of light in vacuum also is v(light) = c . So that:  Thus, the linear speed of photon depends to environmental conditions. Same as gravitons and sub quantum energy, but the total amount of transmission speed and non-transmission speed of photon is constant and it is equal to v(light), by changing the environmental conditions, such as photon enters to water, a part of its linear speed converts to non-linear speed and in this case we have v(light) < c . So we can write:  As the principle of sub quantum energy shows, the total transmission speed and non-transmission speed of SQE is always constant relative to the inertial reference frame and it is an intrinsic property of nature, which is also affected by the graviton principle, because SQE of gravitons are made. So the amount transmission speed (in this case linear velocity) of SQE is independent of emitter source of light. Escape velocity Escape velocity is given as:  According to relation number (25, in this post), V(G) > c, gravitons can escape of event horizon of a black hole until black hole become the absolute black hole.

            "answer_text": "The fallacy that is confusing you is this: You are thinking of gravity as being \u2018caused\u2019 by gravitons. It isn\u2019t! It is caused by the presence in a region of space of matter, energy, momentum and pressure (ie, a non zero energy momentum tensor at least in some region of the region you are looking at). This produces a non zero gravitational field at every point in spacetime. If, after a while, the black hole stabilises, the contribution it makes to the gravitational field throughout space stabilises too. But\u2026 Say the black shreds another star for breakfast (cosmic shreddies? Kellogg\u2019s is missing a trick!!), then the region around the black hole will have a changing energy momentum tensor, and it is HERE where the gravitons enter the scene: They carry the message to the rest of the Universe that Sagittarius A* has just eaten its breakfast and has fractionally increased its event horizon to accommodate the extra entropy it has gobbled up. The rest of the Universe is very interested in this information about Sagittarius A*\u2019s breakfast and each point duly updates its gravitational field value as soon as it receives the good tidings, courtesy of a graviton messenger boy.  So, in summary, gravitons don\u2019t cause gravity, the gravitational FIELD does that. What gravitons do is tell field values in other places how to change. And that is why, believe it or not, if you drop a brick, it falls on your toes.  Of course, this is not a mathematically precise way of putting it. It doesn\u2019t tell you about virtual gravitons leaping around between the brick and the earth, not to mention your foot. But it serves to illustrate that the graviton does not have to escape the black hole to transmit gravity to its breakfast and suck it into its gaping maw. It is the changing energy momentum tensor in the space outside the black hole that dispatches the gravitons on their way across the cosmos. And when a black holes tries to eat another black hole, and viceversa, that we hairless apes get to measure the little critters and jump for joy at the invitation to visit Stockholm, all expenses paid.

            "answer_text": "to turn those singsong statements into useful math.  After a decade  of work, and buckets of differential geometry (needed to deal with  messed up coordinate systems like the surface of Earth, or worse, curved  spacetime) the \u201cEinstein Field Equations\u201d were eventually derived, and  presumably named after Einstein\u2019s inspiration: the infamous Professor  Field.  This  is technically 16 equations (\u03bc and \u03bd are indices that take on 4 values  each), however there are tricks to get that down to a more sedate 6  equations.The left side of this horrible mess describes the shape of spacetime  and relates it to the right side, which describes the amount of matter  and energy (doesn\u2019t particularly matter which) present.  This equation  is based on two principles: \u201cmatter and energy make gravity\u2026 somehow\u201d  and \u201cwhen you don\u2019t feel a push or pull in any direction, then you\u2019re  moving in a straight line\u201d.  That push or pull is defined as what an  accelerometer would measure.  So satellites are not  accelerating because they\u2019re always in free-fall, whereas you are  accelerating right now because if you hold an accelerometer it will read  9.8m/s2 (1 standard Earth gravity).  Isn\u2019t that weird?  The  path of a freely falling object (even an orbiting object) is a straight  line through a non-flat spacetime.  Moving past the mind-bending weirdness; this equation, and all of the mathematical mechanisms of relativity, work perfectly for every prediction that we\u2019ve been able to test.   So experimental investigation has given General Relativity a ringing  endorsement.  It\u2019s not used/taught/believed merely because it\u2019s pretty,  but because it works.Importantly, the curvature described isn\u2019t merely dependent on the  presence of \u201cstuff\u201d, but on the curvature of the spacetime nearby.   Instead of being emitted from some distant source, gravity is a property  of the space you inhabit right now, right where you are.  This is the  important point that the \u201cbowling ball on a sheet\u201d demonstration is trying to get across.The  Einstein Field Equations describe the stretching of spacetime as being  caused both by the presence of matter and also by the curvature of  nearby spacetime.  Gravity doesn\u2019t \u201creach out\u201d any more than the metal  ball in the middle is.So here\u2019s the point.  Gravity is just a question of the \u201cshape\u201d of  spacetime.  That\u2019s affected by matter and energy, but it\u2019s also affected  by the shape of spacetime nearby.  If you\u2019re far away from a star (or  anything else really) the gravity you experience doesn\u2019t come directly  that star, but from the patch of space you\u2019re sitting in.  It turns out that if that star gets smaller and keeps the same mass, that the shape  of the space you\u2019re in stays about the same (as long as you stay the  same distance away, the density of an object isn\u2019t relevant to its  gravity).  Even if that object collapses into a black hole, the gravity  field around it stays about the same; the shape of the spacetime is  stable and perfectly happy to stay the way it is, even when the matter  that originally gave rise to it is doing goofy stuff like being a black  hole.This stuff is really difficult / nigh impossible to grok directly.  All we\u2019ve really got are the experiments and observations, which led to a couple simple statements,  which led to some nasty math, which led to some surprising predictions  (including those concerning black holes), which so far have held up to  all of the observations of known black holes that we can do (which is  difficult because they\u2019re dark, tiny, and the closest is around 8,000 light years away, which is not walking-distance).  That said: the math comes before understanding, and the math doesn\u2019t come easy.Here\u2019s the bad news.  In physics we\u2019ve got lots of math, which is  nice, but no math should really be trusted to predict reality without  lots of tests and verification and experiment (ultimately that\u2019s where  physics comes from in the first place).  Unfortunately no information  ever escapes from beyond the event horizon.  So while we\u2019ve got lots of  tests that can check the nature of gravity outside of the horizon (the  gravity here on Earth behaves in the same way that gravity well above  the horizon behaves), we have no way even in theory to  investigate the interior of the event horizon.  The existence of  singularities, and what\u2019s going on in those extreme scenarios in  general, may be a mystery forever.  Maybe. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravitons are massless particles, like photons. So they follow the same paths that photons do (the technical term is \"null geodesic\"). Since photons cannot escape the event horizon of a black hole, gravitons can't either. However, gravitons don't actually need to escape a black hole in order for you to detect its gravity. The gravity you feel at a particular point in spacetime is determined by the local curvature of spacetime at that point. Therefore, you don't need to know what's going on inside the black hole in order to feel the curvature of spacetime outside it. (Important remark: The picture of gravitons as the \"mediators\" of gravity, like photons are the mediators of the electromagnetic interaction, is actually incorrect. Unlike the electromagnetic interaction, gravity is fundamentally nonlinear. But gravitons are the quanta of linearized gravity, which means they are only suitable for describing very weak gravitational fields, such as gravitational waves. Black holes are, obviously, the complete opposite of weak and therefore a description of them using gravitons is inadequate. We don't know what the quantum description of nonlinear gravity is, and that is in fact one of the things a full theory of quantum gravity must be able to explain.) ",

            "answer_text": "The GRAVITON is a negatively charged particle that begins it\u2019s life in reverse time moving around a torus at 20 billion times the speed of light and powers creation in our forward time matter portion of our Universe. The GRAVITON CYCLE terminates around micro BH event horizons in cores of PROTON\u2019S and forms the event horizon of BLACK HOLES. So, to answer your question GRAVITON\u2019S are a 4d particle that originates in a reverse time dimension and does not cause gravity, but causes mass to form as part of a large scale energy cycle that powers our Universe. We are totally blind as to the functions of BLACK HOLES because we cannot see above the EMF bandwidth of light frequencies, and 96% of this energy operates in this 4D GMF spectrum that is moving at frequencies above the speed of light. In fact, the entire universe is most likely rotating at faster then light, so that EMF light waves are an effect of this large scale energy exchange. Here is what a black hole looks like: The GRAVITON CONTAINMENT FIELD terminates forward time, while the antimatter core is moving in the opposite direction forming a huge accelerator that has two polar positron rings focusing relativity jets above and below the core that is streaming antimatter at light speed trillions of miles into space. While the real energy is forming a reverse motion swirl of ANTIGRAVITONS that are repulsive to matter away from the core forming an hour glass that sets up a huge 50,000 light year across FERMI BUBBLE faster then light shock wave. So, we are clueless how gravity works. All of these effects that include space time curvature are caused by the GMF field that is cycling at high speeds flowing around and into mass. Here again, light bending, time dilation, and any other effect is caused by this 4d field that acts like a huge BEC. We can use this GMF ocean to actually communicate instantly or hear supernova\u2019s way before the light from these events reaches us. This brings up another problem: LIGO did not see a gravity wave, sorry but the collision of two graviton containment fields around black holes generate broadcasts that transmit way above the speed and frequency of light waves. Plus, this 4d energy cycle operates dark, we cannot see or measure these above light speed wavelengths. We can only see within light frequencies, so what ever wave we saw was an EMF wave and it was really great that we saw it but unfortunately it is not even how gravity works anyway. Mass does not cause gravity, GRAVITON\u2019S actually cause creation of mass in that FTL containment fields around GALACTIC CORES off spin high speed cyclones forming arms and safe zones for mass formation. The dimensional pressures at the centers of these cyclones are so great that PROTON\u2019S are made like popcorn. As the field collapses, an antigraviton is sent back towards reverse time, and the creation of a by-product of one quark and one antiquark begin to rotate a 3.3 trillion times per second around the collapsing field that forms a micro BH, while antimatter induction process generates an antigraviton with every completion of one orbit send this repulsive to matter positive charged particle back towards reverse time. So, the collapsing graviton capture process creates the gyrosopic motion of the proton, while the antimatter induction process generates a constant stream of antigravitons that create the Z-axis force of gravity and gravity well, allowing mass to form as sphere\u2019s, and to constantly transfer momentum that causes the earth to rotate, and revolve around our sun. There is a NASA video of a naked black hole, that comes alive when matter gets captured by the graviton flow towards the black hole. The point here is that BLACK HOLES operate dark, only 4 percent of our universe is visible. Everything else operates at hte 4d level of frequencies that are tied to this FTL large scale energy exchange that powers our UNIVERSE. We live in a DUAL TIME UNIVERSE. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity at a black hole event horizon doesn't have to be strong. The larger and larger the black hole is, the weaker than gravity is at the event horizon. The event horizon is a global property of space-time of having trapped light cones such that light cannot escape to infinity. We should not need quantum gravity to calculate things at the event horizon of a very large black hole. Virtual gravitons, like virtual photons, are purely a calculational device of pertubative quantum field theory. Virtual gravitons aren't real, so it makes no sense to talk about them escaping from the event horizon. See Frank Heile's answer to Quantum Field Theory: The Coulomb force between electrical charges is caused by exchange of photons. What is really going on, how is the transfer of these virtual particles responsible for such important phenomena we experience in our daily lives? . On others hand, Hawking radiation should produce real photons and genuine gravitons which do escape to infinity. These genuine particles originate from simply outside of the event horizon. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to distinguish between real and virtual particles. While it is true that no real graviton can escape an event horizon (hence, whatever happens inside the event horizon cannot produce gravitational radiation), virtual gravitons (responsible for the gravitational interaction between two bodies) are not constrained this way. (The same way, a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole can have a static electric charge.) Another important point is that insofar as the outside world is concerned, the event horizon remains forever in the future. I.e., you never see the event horizon form; all you see is infalling matter, infinitely redshifted, but never really crossing the horizon, ever. So if you are an outside observer, all the mass of the black hole is still sitting just outside the event horizon, perfectly capable of interacting with everything else without escaping from a horizon that has not even formed yet.

            "answer_text": "This question has always bothered me. The physics of General Relativity that describes gravity by proposing curvature of space time is one way to look at things and that expressly forbids anything created INSIDE the Black hole from interacting with anything OUTSIDE the black hole. There is NO spatial path connecting them! But we can always view the apparent effects of the black hole being created by points on the event horizon! Gravitons arise when we try to use quantum physics to describe the same problem. But even in quantum physics, we still have to describe a wavefunction distributed over space. However, it is not clear to me how we actually created a curved space and use that to define a wavefunction. All the math I have ever seen assumes a linear space-time fabric to describe a wavefunction. I have never seen quantum wavefunctions described in a highly non-linear space-time fabric. Most quantum functions are VERY small so, even with highly curved space-time , they still look approximately linear. But the wavefunction of a graviton clearly has to be huge. So I really don\u2019t see how gravitons can work to describe black holes. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no simple answer to this question because we don't have a quantum theory of gravity. So all we can say is that, if we were to apply the current methods of quantum field theory to gravity, disregarding the fact that the resulting theory breaks down at higher orders of perturbation theory, this is how we would approach it: We would split the gravitational field into two parts: the classical background, which is the solution to Einstein's equations, and the quantum field, which is the perturbation around that background field. It's this quantum perturbation that we would interpret as gravitons.  When you split the field in this way, the effective Lagrangian that describes quantum field will contain terms, which can be interpreted as (virtual) graviton(s) interacting with the vacuum: being created from nothing or disappearing into nothingness (as long as the conservation laws permit it).  So if you wanted to describe the behavior of an elementary particle near a black hole; to the first approximation, it would just interact with the classical background field, which is the Schwarzschild solution of Einstein equations. Then you would add to it quantum corrections in the form of exchanging virtual gravitons with the vacuum. And here's the big problem: quantum corrections in gravity turn out to be infinite, and we have no way of absorbing them into the free parameters of the theory. We say that such theory is not renormalizable.  Except for the problem of renormalizability, all other elements of this picture are known from other quantum theories. The background field formalism is used to calculate quantum corrections in the presence of classical electric or magnetic fields (where virtual photons may pop out or disappear into vacuum). Virtual Higgs particles interact with the Higgs condensate. You may even think of the background field as some kind of graviton condensate, in analogy to Higgs vacuum, if that helps.  Obviously this picture is incomplete (one could say it's full of holes) because, as I said, there is no quantum theory of gravity; and the perturbation theory, which we use to calculate quantum effects, only works in the weak field regime.

            "answer_text": "(1) Can gravitons escape the event horizon of a black hole? If not, (2) how can we detect the black hole's gravity? Short answers: A quantum gravity theory must first show that gravitons even exist.Indirectly, by measuring how objects orbiting a suspected BH behave.Currently, the graviton is entirely hypothetical. If in the future a usable QM theory of gravity is developed, and it shows that gravity is indeed quantized, and it shows that gravitons are the \u201cgravity force mediator\u201d particles, then answer (1) would presumably be Yes. But to get there, scientists have yet a lot of work to do. As for how to \u201cdetecting gravity\u201d: whether a \u201cblack hole\u201d or some other cosmic object (e.g., the sun), the same techniques apply. Here\u2019s a cut from www.forbes.com article The Gravity Of A Star: The best way to weigh a star is to measure how strongly it pulls on another star. If two stars are a binary pair, the speed at which they orbit each other is governed by the gravitational pull between them. By measuring their orbits over time, we can determine the mass of each star. Related (and answered) Quora questions: Why hasn't the graviton been detected yet?If both the photon and the graviton are massless, how do we explain that the photon cannot escape a black hole and the graviton?If gravitons cause gravity, and nothing can go faster than light, wouldn't a black hole have no gravitational pull, as even gravitons can't escape it?Can dark matter be made up of gravitons?",

Gravity is not a force like electromagetism - rather, gravity is our simplified understanding of the curvature of spacetime. Thus it doesn\u2019t need particles to interact. As Wheeler nicely summed up General Relativity, \u201cSpacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve\u201d. Also, it begs the question of the speed of light. There is no such thing per se as the speed of light. c refers to causality. Light, by its own frame of reference, is instantaneous and timeless, it is only by the perspective of a massive stationary object (i.e., us) that it appears to move. So while electromagnetic particles and photons can\u2019t escape a black hole, gravity itself has nothing to escape. ",

            "answer_text": "Scenarios: My perspective on this is, that there are no gravitons! Gravity is a fundamentally different interaction than that of the ones in the standard model. We have a geometric interpretation of gravity (via Regge calculus which is used in many quantum gravity theories, such as CDT or Loop QG). Even though asymptotic safety and many other approaches uses graviton, and calculates graviton-graviton interactions and their loop corrections and has nice and consistent results (even with cdt or lqg) it is still just an approximation. If gravity is not a quantum field then there is no graviton. Gravity not being a quantum field does not mean that there is no quantum gravity. If there is no graviton, but the interaction goes differently, then there is no problem, as there is no need for the interaction particle.If gravity is a quantum field, then to every point in the space you can associate a value related to this field. Even though the BH has the event horizont, and nothing what is inside communicates with the outside, it still has the gravitational field (in this case a quantum field) defined in every point of the spacetime, and has nonzero values in a distant spacetime coordinate. This location has info about the black hole and can communicate with any particle nearby (via graviton) directing them towards the source. Yes, gravitons are not coming from the source, but they are defined everywhere, as the are an excitation of the gravitational field.",

The river of space-time flows into black holes at light speed. Anything going at light speed essentially traverses all future time and space instantly from its frame of reference, but from our frame of reference nothing will get past the event horizon due to gravitational time dilation. Matter will approach it and in the very last microseconds slow down and fade from view. So from our frame of reference we can consider the event horizon itself (strictly speaking , just this side of it), to contain the gravitational field and all the mass/energy of the black hole. From an external frame of reference there is simply never a point-like singularity at the centre of the black hole. So the gravitational field and the mass/energy and the magnetic charge are still in the universe. This resolves the contradiction. ",

The event horizon is a global property of space-time of having trapped light cones such that light cannot escape to infinity. We should not need quantum gravity to calculate things at the event horizon of a very large black hole. Virtual gravitons, like virtual photons, are purely a calculational device of pertubative quantum field theory. Virtual gravitons aren't real, so it makes no sense to talk about them escaping from the event horizon. See Frank Heile's answer to Quantum Field Theory: The Coulomb force between electrical charges is caused by exchange of photons. What is really going on, how is the transfer of these virtual particles responsible for such important phenomena we experience in our daily lives? . On the other hand, Hawking radiation should produce real photons and real gravitons that do escape to infinity. These real particles come from just outside the event horizon. ",

To be clear, Hawking isn\u2019t proposing that black holes don\u2019t exist \u2014 just that black holes, as we\u2019ve understood them for the last 40 years or so, don\u2019t exist. The current understanding is that black holes are surrounded by an event horizon \u2014 a boundary in spacetime which only allow matter and energy to pass through one way, towards the black hole. The problem with this theory is that it\u2019s based on general relativity and in recent years, as our understanding of quantum theory has improved, numerous conflicts have arisen. Basically, quantum mechanics has a big issue with the idea that event horizons completely and utterly destroy information \u2014 a big no-no in the world of quantum. Hawking\u2019s new proposal tries to ameliorate this. Thus, for now, it is hard to say whether gravitons can escape the black hole or not. ",

Gravitational radiation that comes from the later stages of collapse is emitted in the region external to the black hole.  Now, depending on what sort of object is collapsing, there may be a burst of gravitational radiation just as the black hole forms.  Note that all of these terms are approximate, as from our point of view, it takes forever for a black hole to completely form, unless quantum effects or something else we don't know about interferes.

I expect that any \u201cgravity waves\u201d created, if that is even possible, could not be detected outside the event horizon. The waved from the merger of the smaller BH with the Super BH should be detectable. The way we detect BHs, is through their gravitational effects of other objects, and light via gravitational lensing. ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of the unresolved physics questions. We simply do not have a clear answer. Force action interpreted as an exchange of carrier particles is great in many cases but we also know that it leads to \"virtual particles\" in the renormalization process, virtual particles which can violate conservation principles and travel faster than light. So we are not very confident that those concepts do truly reflect reality. So one possibility is that we need to invoke virtual gravitions which can escape the event horizon. The other is that, because seen from the outside, the matter falling into a black hole never does actually reach the horizon, let alone beyond, what we feel is its gravity just outside the horizon, as if it didn't yet cross into it.

Gravitons are postulated as part of a quantum field theory description of gravity but, unfortunately, they run into all sorts of mathematical problems and the usual \u201cget out of jail\u201d cards played to overcome them on the other areas of QFT don\u2019t seem to work. At the moment I would suggest that in terms of the GToR, which is internally self-consistent in the way it explains gravity as distortion of space-time by the presence of mass, then it really doesn\u2019t need to explain away gravitons. In many ways, this is a challenge to the QFT theorists, not one for the GToR as, among other things, there is no experimental evidence for gravitons in the way there is for the gauge bosons that are responsible for the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. I should add that the detection of individual gravitons represents a massive challenge to experimental physicists, and I\u2019m not sure that anybody has suggested a way that it might be done. Of course we do know that there is an inconsistency between the GToR and quantum mechanics, so there is undoubtedly a problem. However, the GToR doesn\u2019t require gravitons so, in a sense, the question raises a puzzle that only exits for the QFT physicists who want to fit gravity into their framework. ",

Virtual particles can and do take on non-physical values such as negative momentum and mass.   As such there is no issue with virtual particles leaving a black hole.   Likewise there is no issue with virtual particles entering a black hole, and field are carried just as much by absorbing virtual particles as transmitting virtual particles. If you do not use a model of gravitons then you don't have even less of an issue, as it is space that is being curved, nothing is being transmitted or received at all.   In numerical models, the curvature of a surface is calculated as a result of the curvature of the surfaces it contains, and the surfaces outside.   There is always a path available to escape at least one marginally contained surface to the next.   So even non-virtual particles can travel back and forth that far... ",

According to General Relativity, gravity involves the distortion of space-time, and the equations of GR always seem to work. However, just because an equation describes something does not mean we understand it. For me, the basic problem is how does some external region for a body \"know\" how much to distort. Analogies with rubber sheets being distorted are fine, except that the rubber has very defined physical properties that we do not see \"space\" as having. Thus if the space-time can exert tension on an adjacent region, how come Newton's first law works? The inertial mass of the body should interact with space-time, through the Equivalence Principle, but it doesn't.  In my opinion, there are still aspects of gravity we simply do not understand, or at least I do not. ",

The other issue is that gravitons are perchance not affected by gravity, which means that once created, they are not bound by gravity's field, even though they transmit it. But supposing that gravity travels at the speed of light, and we have no reason to suppose that it is different than light, then gravitons are affected by gravity, and black holes do not exist.

These photons don't have the same restrictions as other photons when it comes to the curvature of space time.  It is the same reason a black hole could have a charge in theory.  Thus these photons don't care about the event horizon.  They just travel because to them the universe is just flat.

Black holes, just like any other object in the universe (stars, planets, etc),  have masses that act as the source of their gravitational force.  No need for anything to escape them. ",
