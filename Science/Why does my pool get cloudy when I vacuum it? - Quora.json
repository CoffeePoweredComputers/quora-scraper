            "answer_text": "I am going to assume that by \u201cvacuum\u201d you mean that you have a vacuum head and hose which is sucking the debris and dirt from the bottom of the pool and sending it through the filter system. If the \u201cvacuum\u201d you are using does not function that way, then you are not using the right word. Answer: if the water you are moving goes through the filter system, then the filter is not functioning properly. Broken internal components, missing o-rings on the backwash valve, or too high a flow rate are all possibilities. Sometimes very fine dirt particles will pass though a filter even it is functioning properly. In these cases a filter aid and/or a coagulant can be effective, but only after checking for physical problems with the filter. ",
