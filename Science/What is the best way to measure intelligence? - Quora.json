            "answer_text": "Question: How does one get their intelligence measured? Answer: Measuring human intelligence is difficult, and we do it rather badly. Intelligence has many components. There are various specific intelligence factors, and so called General Intelligence. Our current measures of intelligence generally focus on features of academic intelligence. We have a number of known problems with them. It is very difficult to remove a cultural bias element from intelligence tests.We have constructed our IQ yardstick on the basis that IQ is normally distributed, but evidence indicates that this assumption is invalid.IQ is supposed to be a measure of potential, but it seems to be clear that one can practice and study and improve at IQ tests - suggesting that the tests are actually measuring what\u2019s been learned, rather than the potential for learning, if you like.Over decades scores on IQ tests have been rising. Are people actually becoming more intelligent, or are we skewing the measurement to test what we currently consider important (categorisation, for example)?Longitudinal tests of people over their lifetime have indicated that those who did well in school increase their IQ over life, and visa versa. Once again, this raises the question about whether IQ is a potential or a measure of training. Is it really possible to increase your potential over time? What does this mean?There are orientations that aren\u2019t well handled by IQ tests. Some people are tactile. Some are conceptual. Rubiks cubes, jigsaws, can be handled - a very tactile approach. Chess - particularly if one enforce the rule that if one touches a piece one must move it, is very geometrically conceptual. Most of our IQ tests demand conceptual thinking. This works against those with a tactile orientation. Measuring IQ is a challenge with Human Beings, but it\u2019s far more of a challenge with non-humans. Measuring the intelligence of dogs, dolphins, and parrots needs one to rethink some of what one means by intelligence. And measuring the intelligence of AI is totally different again. Siri and Cortana can talk with thousands of different people in a dozen different languages, with different accents, and give useful answers, all at the same time. How does one compare that with the intelligence of a human being who can only speak three languages and talk to one person at a time? We are most of us familiar with standard intelligence tests. One I did recently was an on-line pattern recognition test. This has the advantage of being non-cultural - a pattern is language independent. Twenty questions in twenty minutes or something. So I solved all twenty in twenty minutes. And I knew they were all right. You either saw the pattern or you didn\u2019t. Which proves I have an IQ of what? Possibly more than 115, but beyond that, there\u2019s no upper bound. But patterns are a very limited type of test. One could probably develop an AI that would blitz this test. And it would be very hard to test a dolphin in this way. So Intelligence is indeed difficult to measure, and difficult to even define well. Just when you think you\u2019ve nailed it, it becomes elusive and comes up with a new angle. Should empathy be regarded as a form of intelligence? People who can focus and concentrate tend to do well on IQ tests. But when someone tells you to pay attention to something, what they are actually doing is telling you not to pay attention to everything else. So is the ability to not pay attention to everything else really a sign of intelligence? More questions than answers here I\u2019m afraid. Hope these thoughts help. ",

            "answer_text": "When administered professionally, IQ tests are reasonably accurate. However, they aren't tests of people's intelligence. They are measurements for young students to see what level of material they should be exposed to. They were an old attempt to do what we now do by saying so-and-so who is 8 can read books normally read by 12-year-olds; such a person might be said to have a reading quotient of 150. The SAT tests are similar attempts, but better. It was done in the early years of testing for schools. It was what my friend John Murray calls \"vacuumware.\" It exists to fill a need, but it still sucks. He first applied it to the X window system. Like the Social Security number, it got applied to do things far beyond what it was originally designed to do. I think it's pretty much useless as any sort of general indicator of such a broad term as intelligence. Criticisms based on that, however, are na\u00efve, because that's not what it is for. There are other criticisms. One is that it is \"culturally biased.\" Well, of course it is. It has to be. It was designed for an educational system that was itself culturally biased. It was intended to measure performance there, so that's what it had to be about. The culture of teaching has changed, and so have the IQ tests. Another is that it's wrong because a measured IQ these days averages about 120, whereas it was calibrated such that the average would have to be 100. Well, despite what some conservatives teach these days, mostly with \"could you pass this test\" which is full of bullshit and unanswerable questions (and was a test for teachers and not students, anyway), people are getting educated a lot better than in the days of the one-room schoolhouse. Kids are exposed to more challenging material at an earlier age, so what they can be expected to answer earlier has improved. ",
