            "answer_text": "Inhibitors, but it depends on what you are doing.A simple example is, if you are using gaseous reactants, you can inject an inert gas into the reactions mixture and it will impede collisions between the reacting chemicals, and slow the reactions down.(you are effectively making it harder for the reactants to make contact) but make sure you don\u2019t increase the pressure or temperature or other equilibrium based considerations may overcome what you are trying to achieve.Increasing the volume of a gas (without increasing the amount of it) has a similar slowing effect.Diluting solutions slows down their reactions (a bit of a generalisation\u2026.some reactions REQUIRE water to work).Performing the reaction at a lower temperature is sometimes quite effective.Making sure there are no catalysts present in you reaction mixture or as part of the container that you are using (e.g. don\u2019t use a rusty old container if Iron III oxide is a known catalyst for your particular reaction...there\u2019s a bit of iron IIIoxide in rust). Other than that\u2026see Viabhav\u2019s answer below\u2026it is a good one ;) ",

            "answer_text": "It depend on reaction to reaction and they are called inhibitors(work opposite of catalyst) for eg. Chloroform on reaction with oxygen in the presence of sunlight form phosgene gas(COCl2) which is very poisonous, to avoid this situation we add ethyl alcohol(C2H5OH) in chloroform so here, Ethyl alcohol is slow down the reaction and behave as inhibitor ",
