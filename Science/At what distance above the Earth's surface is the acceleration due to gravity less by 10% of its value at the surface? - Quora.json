            "answer_text": "First let\u2019s list what we know: The formula for gravitational acceleration is g=GMR2g=GMR2 The gravitational acceleration on Earth\u2019s surface is approximately 9.81m/s29.81m/s2. The mass of the Earth: 5.972\u00d71024kg5.972\u00d71024kg The universal gravitational constant: 6.67408\u00d710\u221211m3kg\u22121s\u221226.67408\u00d710\u221211m3kg\u22121s\u22122 The radius of the Earth: 6.378\u00d7106m6.378\u00d7106m Since we\u2019re looking for distance, we want to rearrange the equation so that RR is alone on one side of the equation. So: gR2=GMgR2=GM R2=GMgR2=GMg R=GMg\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221aR=GMg Finding 10% less of something is the same as finding 90% of that something, so we find our goal acceleration with 0.9\u00d79.810.9\u00d79.81 which equals 8.83m/s28.83m/s2. Now we plug in our values to find RR: R=6.67408\u00d710\u221211\u00d75.972\u00d710248.83\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221aR=6.67408\u00d710\u221211\u00d75.972\u00d710248.83 R=6.72\u00d7106mR=6.72\u00d7106m Now, note that this is the distance from the point where gravitational acceleration is 8.83 to the center of the Earth. We\u2019re looking for the distance to the surface of the Earth, so we\u2019re going to have to subtract the radius: 6.72\u00d7106\u22126.378\u00d7106=3.42\u00d7105m6.72\u00d7106\u22126.378\u00d7106=3.42\u00d7105m or 342km342km There\u2019s your answer.

            "answer_text": "As this decreases by the square of the distance, then to have a 10% reduction means you have to be 5% further from the centre of the earth (as the square root of 1.1 is about 1.05). The radius of the earth is about 6,400 kms; 5% of this is 320 kms, so you have to be about 320 kms above the surface of the earth - the height of a low earth orbit. ",

Your given value for a In 0.9, so, we need to find the square root of 1.11111\u2026 then multiply that times the radius of the Earth and subtract the radius to get your altitude. Sqft(1.11111\u2026) is 1.0541, multiply that by the average radius of the Earth, 3959mi, results in r=4173mi. This, your altitude is 214mi. ",
