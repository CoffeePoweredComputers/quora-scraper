            "answer_text": "Nature works by an interrelatedness that defies possibility. Nature responds to its own activity in ways that nourish that which pursues the activity by inhibiting it to enhance and amend accomplishment. Nature seeks harmony, not justice, but the equilibrium of any balance between things in a harmonious system infers justice in profound establishments that transcend existence as we know it. Nature is as cruel as it is kind, yet beauty and enduring survival come from each. Nature allows life to adapt to the changes that result from its designs in the motion of their living. A life in nature is its own thwart and its greatest supporter---hence it is taught to develop higher in order of effectual life by its own experience, and reaches a point of also learning by what it has by imagination of others\u2019 experiences as well. A third venue of learning is in dreaming. A fourth in foresight , hypothesis and heuristics ( supposing and trying to understand what it that is supposed will lead toward), and correspondences and associative relevances (similitude of abstractly proportionate elements). And a fifth by gut. Nature does not teach by suffering and suffering is this result .Learning through the use of force is called conditioning and can be genitically coded to be instinctual knowledge like birds nestbuild. This is mercy. for suffering. Nature has no knowledge of itself for nature is as a gift without explanation why it is given, how it is to be used, and what must be done with it when it cannot be beared. Nature procurs all memories and each is represented in the nature of its greatest accord. The most delicate and fragile of nature are the form and fixture of its strongest most longetive truths. Nature ranges fron the infintessimal to the infinite but cannot create range nor domain , cannot account nor attribute, cannot alter or choose, prevent or incur, but in it is that which is transipient in chance to be that which performs all these cannots. Nature abides by natural causes and innervates by supernatural acclaim. Its ligands are natural but its core is supernal. That is, the laws of nature must be obeyed by nature even if its laws don't apply. What comes from nature is more nature but what nature has as origin is not nature whatsoever. Naturally I'm speechless about the rest. ",
