            "answer_text": "I would not say conservatives do not believe in science. Speaking for myself, there are certain fields I am skeptical of, such as evolution, and the age of the universe, and the origin of the universe. The answers are constantly changing, yet the subject is being taught as fact! So much research gets off to a bad start from the beginning. Research costs money, lots of money! The way money is procured is through grants. There has to be a selling point to get grant money. So the research is skewed from the beginning. There has to be something \u201ccatchy\u201d to generate funding. It\u2019s always something bordering on the outlandish, it has to be the \u201coldest, newest, fastest, farthest, weirdest, first, last, only, one in a quadrillion, never before seen, extraterrestrial\u2026\u201d Something that will get peoples interest, overshadow the real reason for the research, and sometimes a genuine need goes unexplored because it doesn\u2019t have enough flash. But, that is not always a bad thing. Sometimes research for something useless can actually reveal something useful in the process! ",

            "answer_text": "Anti-science may be a little strong. I have a friend from church who is an aerospace engineer for NASA who is definitely an Evangelical Christian who takes the Bible seriously. Both of my doctors, my family doc and my oncologist are Evangelical Christians just to name a few around my life. Evangelical Christians, those of us who believe the Bible is God's Word are not anti-science. We just don't believe science has the final word about much of anything yet. It's a constantly self-correcting pursuit of Truth. It's a work in progress. The more they figure out, the more the Bible looks true to me. For example, did you know that the genetic physicist who is in charge of the Human Genome Project actually became a Christian as a result of his exploration into the complexity of DNA? His name is Dr. Francis Collins. You might want to read up on him. My interest in science doesn't run very deep but one area that does overlap with my interests is archaeology. There is some amazing archaeological evidence for the accuracy of the Bible that is continually being unearthed. So I think your assumption may be a little off. ",
