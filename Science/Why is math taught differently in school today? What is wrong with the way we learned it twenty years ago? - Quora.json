            "answer_text": "It's more accurate to say that math is not taught differently, it's taught badly. As for why, I would say there is no excuse. There may however be an explanation. Common Core Math is the third chapter in a terrible trifecta: New Math around 1962, Reform Math around 1985 and later, and Common Core around 2008. The common nominator is that the curricula adopt various gimmicks which make elementary arithmetic difficult and unpleasant. The simple realities of basic mathematics are encumbered and indeed covered over by inappropriately advanced aspects. In short, high school and college math were taught to second graders. It's idiotic and destructive. The pattern was the same for the last 60 years. Children complained and groaned and couldn't get it. Parents could not understand how to do the homework. Parents and teachers could not communicate with students, or each other. There was a general slowdown of everything mathematical, which undercut anything STEM. At the same time, the Education Establishment demanded that reading be taught with sight-words, thereby guaranteeing that tens of millions of children would end up semi-literate. Knowledge in all subject was taught with Constructivism, thereby guaranteeing that the average student will end up quite ignorant. See the pattern? Professor Dan Willingham, one of the few professors in our country who says sensible, scientific things about education, points out that \"factual knowledge must precede skill.\" In other words, you start with small simple stuff, master that, and then you move to more abstract and difficult stuff. All of these phony curricula try to make children think like college professors. But the professors have lots of basic knowledge in their heads: common math facts, multiplication tables, and simple ways to approach simple problems. The kids don't have any of that so they are just left to struggle with math that is 10 years beyond them. If you stand back and look at this sad spectacle unfolding in our public schools, you will see an absolute pattern. The schools are aiming for mediocrity. The goal is leveling. The larger goal is some sort of socialist brave new world. These people are ideologues and cannot help themselves. But what about the media? What about the universities? What about the foundations? What about business executives? Everyone should fight back against these extremists. BIG THINK: I want to add a recurring thought. If there were really a case to be made for a more abstract, more professorial approach to problem-solving, why wouldn't you still wait until the fourth or fifth grade? Or even the eighth grade? Make sure all the basics are in place, and then accelerate upward from that firm foundation. What's the rush? It's the rush that is the giveaway. The goal is not progress in math, the goal is cognitive confusion. The goal is to inflict a sort of concussion on young students so they never quite recover. Really, do you realize what the outcome is from most of Common Core? Children hate math and thus science. They become calculator-dependent at an early age and that's where their progress stops. Everyday Math, in the forward, explicitly states that finally relying on the calculator is a worthwhile goal for our students. (This wonderful video will require 15 minutes of your time but then you will know what a silly, corrupted thing is Common Core Math. If in a hurry, go to 9:30 minutes.)  ",

            "answer_text": "[1] 2 years ago, I accidentaly tried a new way to teach maths to my students. Before, I was trying to repeat how I had been taught maths : lots of theory, exemples, proofs, applications and after 6 hours of theory, a few exercices, bucketfull of copying what is written on a blackboard. No method given by the teacher, just the raw theorems so you have to devise your own methods by yourself. This might be fine for someone who wants to become a math researcher (It really helped me). But it really sucks for someone who wants to become a veterinary/doctor/work in economics/business\u2026and also for some engeneers. Also, 3/4 of what you have painfully written becomes worthless pretty fast (what use are examples once you have understood the concept, what use is the proof, once you have checked it once. You can just throw everything away and just keep your summarized notes with the theorems) These past 2 years, I have been teaching this way :1) the first day, I give students 40 pages with all the theorems we will use this year (less copying the blackboard), see joint document 2) each week, we focus on a chapter of maths during 9h but we mostly do exercices. When some theory is needed for an exercise, I explain what needs to be known. 3) Before giving the theory, I give and make them practise the best method that does the job 4) at the end of the week, when they have grasped all the fundamentals, I give some more theory about advanced stuff. So far, this has worked beautifully for me (and for them). They understand maths better and they have 5 times the training that they had before. The tail and the middle of the class are not overwhelmed anymore and get success, which encourages them to give it their best (they become quite stronger) The head of the class soars. The best student is able to get 30+ questions perfectly in 4 hours So, IMO, the way I was taucht maths was not the best possible way to teach maths to the masses. There are better ways : maths should probably be taught in context (the exercice leads to the throry and not the other way around).Also, people needs lots of time practising maths and less time watching a guy in front of a blackboard writing a complicated proof completely useless for you.
