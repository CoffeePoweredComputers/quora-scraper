            "answer_text": "NO. Anything damn group coming together and performing as a society/unit isn't communism. People having sexual fetish of /involving in orgy is not communism either. There was a mad scientist called Trofim Lysenko who told that crops should be grown without distancing and crops do not have classes like humans, back in 1930s USSR. He got backing from Stalin and got his idea implemented. That caused famine and killed millions. Such sort of thinking might be slightly dangerous, at times. Using human-centric logic, I can also prove ants are religious Hindus. Ants have caste system. They have their jobs divided.Everyone does their own duty, they follow the system of KarmaThey have varnashram. According to age, their duty changes which makes them Vedic Hindus. Much more staunch followers than we are.I can also prove that ants are like capitalists. Division of labourHierarchyCommunication via antennas or formal chainsThey love building cities. In fact, that is all that they do (sometimes, at the expense of other human's feelings)I can go on with this but ants are neither religious Hindus nor they are capitalists. And they are definitely not communists. They are insects who perform so due to years of evolution. We should not enforce human-centric religious / economic views on insects. ",
