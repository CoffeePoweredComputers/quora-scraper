            "answer_text": "There are many variants of the scientific methods available. Just google \u2018Scientific method\u2019 . Also look at the hits under images. Enjoy !! I personally would like to add more context to the traditional descriptions of the scientific methods, Give examples of it in action. One fine example is the discovery of a cure for stomach ulcers by Dr. Barry Marshall. Look it up. Some other additions: Starting point\u2014 a practical problem or a scientific mystery or conflict or just newly discovered phenomena. Then gather information and data, form questions and hypotheses test and so onStress that hypothesis building is just a form of educated guess work. It is also where creativity in science is best seen.Stress the iterative nature of the method: hypothesis testing, if not supported one can go back and revise hypothesis, test again, and repeat as needed to get a hypothesis that makes successful predictions or until all possible revisions have been exhausted. You may then need to start fresh and gather more data and explore new ideas.Stress the circular nature of the scientific method - once you get a successful hypothesis, it can act as the foundation to advance science further: Gather more data, make new hypotheses' - test them , etc.Most of the descriptions do not stress the importance of dissemination of information about your new hypothesis that can make successful predictions for in tests. after you have completed the process. - talk about it, report it, publish it etc.Your successful hypothesis may also have practical applications \u2014 then patent it, license it and make some money!",
