            "answer_text": "Light does refract when it enters a cube but the effect is mostly reversed when it passes out the other side. On the exit side the glass surface is parallel to the entry side so the two changes cancel (more or less). Light exits a prism through face at a different angle to the entry face so the refraction persists past the prism. Note: Refraction is the bending of light at the interface of different media like glass/air or water/air. Diffraction is effects like edge halos etc that occur due to wave interactions of light (and other things). Diffraction - Wikipedia ",

Light going through a cube is all slowed down by the same amount as it is travelling through the same amount go glass. When it goes through a prism, some of the light goes through more glass than other rays, causing a bend and a difference in the amount of slowing. this results in the rays having different colours.
