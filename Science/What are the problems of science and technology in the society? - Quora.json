            "answer_text": "When you lump \u201cScience\u201d and \u201cTechnology\u201d together with the same breath, I believe you\u2019re doing a disservice to one of them. Technology is basically applied science, or in other words, \u201cEngineering.\u201d \u201cScience\u201d is (when you reduce it to its basics) a methodology for improving of Mankind\u2019s understanding of the principles that underlie the real world. Quantum mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, and so forth are all predominantly taught as \u201cscience.\u201d Over many years successive refinements precipitate a gradual improving of the baseline of knowledge about these subjects. Please note that not one iota of technology results from this core understanding; that is what engineering is all about. When at some point the parties that are underwriting the expenses of basic research (science, for the sake of argument) say to themselves \u201cGee, that paper suggests interesting possibilities \u2014 how can we recover our costs?\u201d they turn to a crowd of engineers and pose it as an application exercise. It is at that point that things like mustard Gas, nerve agents, nuclear bombs, and space-borne weapons platforms are envisioned and then constructed. True, scientists can have impure motives as well and often figure on the engineering teams that make these unfortunate technologies possible \u2014 anyone can be evil \u2014 but the proof is in the engineering. What is engineering? A number of definitions are floating about, but the one that strikes me as most basically true is \u201cthe orderly practice of converting a theoretical concept into a working reality.\u201d At bottom, Engineering is a lot more complicated than the above definition lets on; it involves working with specifications, time-lines, budgets, material resources, personnel, and yes \u2014 science \u2014 to craft a plan of implementation, subjecting it to appropriate reviews and approval, and eventually a real thing that non-scientists (and presumably, non-engineers) can use. It is at this point the bad things creep in. My mention of mustard gas earlier was not a mistake. Mustard gas was devised by a chemist, who wrote a paper about it. Other chemists read it, and refined the underlying knowledge of the basic chemical reactions, and wrote their own papers. What happens next touches on the \u201cbadness\u201d of misapplied science. A chemist by the name of Victor Meyers improved on the chemical process further. An accident in his laboratory exposed his assistant to the toxicity of the resultant material, causing massive burns, lung damage, etc. A scientist would have recoiled from the subject at this point, but Meyers found this suffering was possibly useful. He collaborated with an English chemist who had defected to the German military machine just prior to the anticipated beginning of WWI, and the resulting product was easy to make, deadly, and more important had no benign uses. In short, it was made for an evil purpose. Meyers and his new-found buddy represented the military usefulness of mustard gas as a weapon to the German high-command, and with their enthusiastic endorsement pushed it into mass production. Mustard gas was first applied against the English at Ypres in 1917, killing thousands and maiming thousands more. Its efficacy impressed the English, and their chemists soon isolated the process themselves (theirs was much inferior), and applied it against the Germans in September of 1918, doing much to break the Hindenburg Line leading eventually to Allied victory, morally tarnished as it might be. I\u2019m sure that other abstract thinkers of earlier ages were equally culpable in taking abstract knowledge of the physical world and pressing it into service for warfare \u2014 but the process that is science had not yet been refined in those ancient times. Some of the same onus applies to scientists who contributed to new weapons in the Crimean War, the American Civil War, and other conflagrations extending back into the dark ages. The difference is that Meyers developed the Mustard Gas with an express application in mind \u2014 an evil one. This is why I cavil at the conjoining of ethics and science; true science is (and always must be) blameless for the problems that engineering unleashes. ",

            "answer_text": "Often times it backfires, such as the modern threat of nuclear war, obesity and disease rates increasing due to inactivity because of technology, eye problems from screens, social problems, many parents for instance will just give their kid a phone to play with to quiet them down or whatever, but by doing that consistently they avoid interaction with the kid, so phones can cause all kinds of developmental problems like that, not only socially, but if the kid doesn\u2019t play with physical objects, it could inhibit motor skill development. Job loss due to technology is another problem, that is only to get exponentially worse. Many people are less really connected to people socially than ever, due to social media, which claims to connect them virtually -_-. Of course, we are given the ability to, for instance, let me share this knowledge with you, using technology, but is it really necessary? How much has it actually improved things? Most people use the internet for useless, mindless things anyway. ",
