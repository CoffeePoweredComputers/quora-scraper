            "answer_text": "A pair of electrons which do not take part in bond formation in a molecule is called lone pair. Let's take an example of a water(H2O) molecule. A oxygen molecule when form a covalent bond with two two hydrogen atoms then a water molecule is formed.  As we know that oxygen has 6 valence electrons in it's outermost orbit therefore to complete it's octet it needs two electrons which are provided by two hydrogen atoms by forming covalent bond with it. Now the electrons which do not took part \u200bin the bond formation viz. two pair of electrons, are called lone pairs of oxygen atom in water molecule. ",

Basically, pair of electrons which do not form any kind of bond in a molecule. For example, in H20, oxygen has 6 electrons in outermost shell and it uses 2 electrons to form a single bond with each hydrogen atom. 6 - 2 = 4, hence, 4 electrons are now left which do not form any bond. These electrons are represented in form of pairs. Hence in H20, oxygen has 4 non bonding electrons or 2 lone pairs. ",
