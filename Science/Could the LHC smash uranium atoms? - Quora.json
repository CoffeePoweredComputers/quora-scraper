            "answer_text": "In principle yes but at additional cost of modifications of the acceleration and beam preparation system as uranium atoms have a different charge to mass ratio and are more difficult to ionize completely. This effort was not judged to be worth to make, instead recently also Xe nuclei were accelerated in the LHC in order to study more in detail the mass dependent effects comparing this with the Pb - Pb and p- Pb collisions. Why lead-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider? ",

            "answer_text": "Not so easily, its acceleration and beam guidance systems depend on the magnetic properties of the beam particles. Lead has been chosen as it is heavy, but at the same time very 'symmetric' in its magnetic moments, much like a single proton. ",
