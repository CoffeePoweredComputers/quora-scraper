            "answer_text": "Thats at the will of the person describing the accident .they still collide one puts force against another .immobility or the one getting hit .theres several explinations or definitions .like force of pressure .pound ft force of pressure .im pact .transfored of forced on inmoble .but no matter how you look at it to objects collided .the way its put on papper would be defined by how good the legal team is .thats sorta tricky they collided but usually one in motion caused the collision and forced the one hit into reaction just by being the one collided upon .it goes back to newtons basic law .for every action ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely. A body, even when moving is at rest relative to itself. I am sitting down as I write this but I am moving at about 67,000 miles per hour around the Sun. The elastic collision calculations conserving energy and momentum must be as determined by an Observer who is considered to be motionless. ",
