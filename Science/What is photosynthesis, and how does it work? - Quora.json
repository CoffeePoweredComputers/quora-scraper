            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is a biochemical process in which plants use energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide into a usable form of carbon (sugar). The process of photosynthesis is divided into two types of enzyme mediated reactions: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (Calvin/dark cycle). The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membrane of the plant leaf and during this process energy from the sunlight (which contains all wavelengths of light) is converted into chemical energy (ATP). The light-independent processes take place in the stroma of the plant and occurs both in the presence and absence of light. The overall equation for photosynthesis is written 6CO2 + 6H2O ------> C6H12O6 + 6O2. The equation shows that plants require, water, carbon dioxide, light & chlorophyll for photosynthesis to occur. Simple experiments can be conducted to show this using a bicarbonate solution, a sufficient light source and plant leaves.  Leaves, which are considered photosynthetic organs, have a clear waxy upper epidermis which allows a significant amount of light through to the plant and reduces water loss.  The stomata (a minute epidermal pore in a leaf) on the lower epidermis of the plant allow it to absorb carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The chloroplasts absorb light and use this in addition to carbon dioxide and water to produce food for the plant. Although chlorophyll is critical to photosynthesis there are other important pigments in addition to chlorophyll that are useful to plants. The presence of these pigments can be observed when completing a simple chromatography experiment using plant leaves and alcohol. It is important to note that the different pigments only absorb certain wavelengths of light. For example, chlorophyll A and B only absorb light in the range red/blue violet and carotenoids absorb blue-green light. The wavelengths that are most absorbed are also the wavelengths that result in the most efficient photosynthesis. I have done a simple experiment oxygen production experiment to observe the production of oxygen and to determine which colors work best in photosynthesis.                                                   PROCEDURE                       EXPERIMENT - OXYGEN PRODUCTION  1.  1/2 tablespoon of baking soda was added to 4 cups of water followed by a small drop of liquid soap to the water which was then stirred. (The control variableswere the amount of baking soda and water used). (An independent variable is the CO2 that formed in the water when it was mixed with baking soda).2.   Using a hole-punch, several of circles of spinach leaf were punched out. (The control variable was the size and shape of the spinach disks). (One of the independent variables was the leaf type chosen).3.  Next the spinach discs (8) were added to a syringe after taking the plunger completely out of the syringe. The plunger was then pushed back in and the syringe was used to take up baking soda water until it was about 1/4 or 1/3 full of liquid.4.   Then a finger was placed over the end of the syringe and the plunger was pulled back as far as it could go without pulling it out completely. This step was repeated several times until all leaf circles sunk to the bottom of the liquid in the syringe. 5.    The spinach disks were then placed into a clear glass with about 2 inches of baking soda solution and light was immediately blocked out.6.   Next a lamp with a compact fluorescent light bulb was set up in a semi-dark room and then the glass containing the spinach discs were placed in front of the lamp. (A control variable was the type of light bulb used). 7.    The discs were then observed and the number of circles that floated after each minute for several minutes were counted (positive control experiment). 8.    All of the preceding steps were completed using fresh spinach circles and plain water without any baking soda or soap to create a negative control experiment.9.  Next, steps 1-7 were repeated three separate times using three different colors of tissue paper (green, yellow, & white) around the glass containing the spinach discs. Fresh spinach circles were used for each test. (Another independent variable is the tissue paper color chosen).10.  The amount of time it took for the discs to float was observed (dependent variable). RESULTS  When the \u201cvacuumed\u201d spinach leaf disks were placed in the bicarbonate solution and next to a sufficient light source (for the positive control experiment) they sunk to the bottom of the beaker (figure 1.1); however after some time elapsed the circles began producing oxygen bubbles and they started to float to the top of the beaker (figure 1.2). The first spinach disk in the control experiment floated after 8 minutes.  The spinach disks that were placed in a solution of only water and a very small amount of soap and next to a light source (for the negative control experiment) remained at the bottom of the beaker after an elapsed time of 50 minutes (figure 1.3).   When beakers containing the vacuumed spinach leaf disks and the bicarbonate solution were covered with tissue paper there were significant differences in the times that it took the spinach leaf disks to float. The eight spinach circles in the beaker covered with white tissue paper floated the fastest and all disks were floating after only 22 minutes. The disks in the beaker covered with yellow tissue paper all floated after only 27 minutes. The disks in the beaker covered with green tissue paper took much longer and all eight disks were floating after 50 minutes. The specific times can be seen in figure 3.1 and 3.2.              ",

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesi- If we split the word in two parts i.e. Photo means Light and synthesis means composition. In other words it is the process used by plants and other organisms to convert the light energy from sun into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organism's activities.     The image shows that in Photosynthesis Carbon Dioxide, Water and Sunlight is absorbed by the plants and oxygen is let out into atmosphere to keep the Oxygen percentage in atmosphere stable. Photosynthetic organisms are phototrophs (these captures light), which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called Carbon Fixation.  Carbon FixationIn this reaction there takes place a redox reaction. In which Carbon dioxide is converted into Carbohydrates.The general equation for photosynthesis is therefore:2n CO2 + 2n DH2 + photons \u2192 2(CH2O)n + 2n DOCarbon dioxide + electron donor + light energy \u2192 carbohydrate + oxidized electron donor. (Further explained in Light Independent Reaction). Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP (Adenosine Thiosulphate) and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use infrared radiation. Before going through Light reactions and Light Independent reactions I want readers to go through the diagram of Chloroplast.    Light Reactions:-In the light reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinonemolecule, allowing the start of a flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP (Nicotinamide adenide dinucleotide phosphate)to NADPH. In addition, this creates a proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane; its dissipation is used by ATP synthase for the concomitant synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule regains the lost electron from a water molecule through a process called photolysis, which releases a dioxygen (O2) molecule. The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is: 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light \u2192 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Light Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):-In the light-independent (or \"dark\") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and in a process that requires the newly formed NADPH, called the Calvin-Benson Cycle, releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is: 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ \u2192 C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixationTo be more specific, carbon fixation produces an intermediate product, which is then converted to the final carbohydrate products. The carbon skeletons produced by photosynthesis are then variously used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, as precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the energy from plants gets passed through a food chain. The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar,ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate (GP), also known as 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA). GP, in the presence of ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or even as triose phosphate. Triose is a 3-carbon sugar (see carbohydrates). Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the G3P produced is used to regenerate RuBP so the process can continue (see Calvin-Benson cycle). The 1 out of 6 molecules of the triose phosphates not \"recycled\" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose,starch and cellulose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids.     The mechanism of Light Dependent reaction and Light Independent Reaction is shown in this image.  The end result i.e the sugars that are formed after these reactions are passed to the plants as food to them. The overall process takes place in four stages: Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll (thylakoid membranes)Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions (thylakoid membranes) Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (thylakoid membranes) Carbon fixation and export of stable products to plant *All the info is taken from Wikipedia and Google.

            "answer_text": "Joshua Engel gives an excellent sketch of how photosynthesis works. I'll just flesh out some of the details of the light-dependent and light-independent (Calvin) cycles. I strongly suggest you read his answer to this question before mine if you aren't familiar with the basics of photosynthesis. In plants and algae, chloroplasts are the organelles for photosynthesis takes place. This is what they look like:   (from http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/chloroplasts/images/chloroplastsfigure1.jpg) Within the inner membrane is a semi-fluid area called the stroma. Held within the stroma and connected to the membranes are structures called thylakoids, all made up of the same phospholipid bilayers that the cell membrane is made of. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum. Light-dependent reactions There's a picture of the thylakoid membrane below. It looks complicated, but there are only a few parts that really matter unless you're doing an in-depth study of the molecular basis of photosynthesis. There are two different processes that could happen here: Cyclic photophosphorylation and non-cyclic photophosphorylation. Of these, the non-cyclic kind is far more interesting, and is the one that is typically taught as standard in classrooms. If you want to know about the cyclic kind, feel free to ask me about that elsewhere. Think about things from left to right. On the far left is a protein complex called Photosystem II (abbreviated PSII). PSII and its companion, Photosystem I (PSI), both contain chlorophyll and other pigments in their reaction centers to capture the sun's light.   So here's what happens: PSII gets struck by a photon from the sun, knocking off some very excited electrons from the reaction center. The energy of the photon also allows a water-splitting complex in PSII to split water into two hydrogen ions, two high-energy electrons, and an oxygen molecule, the last of which is discarded. The electrons from water replace the ones knocked off of PSII. Meanwhile, the excited electrons go through a transport chain of proteins (plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, and plastocyanin above). At each stage, the lose some of their energy, which the cytochrome uses to push the hydrogen ions found outside the thylakoid to the inside. This sets up a gradient of hydrogen ions, since the concentration becomes greater on the outside. In the meantime, the hydrogen ions from water-splitting move with the gradient through the ATP synthase protein (the big orange one), powering it. The ATP synthase adds a phosphate to a molecule called adenoside diphosphate (ADP), turning it into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the basic energy \"currency\" of life. And since these hydrogen ions end up on the outside, they can later be pulled back inside by the electrons in the transport chain. Now back to our electrons. The energy from these electrons has mostly been depleted, and so they arrive, tired and hungry, at PSI. And what luck! PSI is struck by another photon, giving the electrons more energy. They pass through some more protein intermediates, then are picked up, along with a hydrogen ion, by the molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or NADP+. (Thank goodness there's an acronym, because that's quite a mouthful!) NADP+ gets converted to NADPH, which carries the hydrogen and electrons, along with their energy, to the light independent reactions. The net reaction of the light-dependent reactions is:2H2O + 2NADP+ + 3ADP + 3Pi \u2192 O2 + 2NADPH + 3ATP Light-independent reactions So now we've got a whole bunch of NADPH in the stroma; how do we take the energy in it and convert it to sugars for long-term storage? The solution is the Calvin cycle:  The reason the Calvin cycle and related pathways are called the light-independent reactions is that they don't need light to occur. The Calvin cycle is based on the enzyme RuBisCo, which is perhaps the greatest evidence against intelligent design because it's so wildly inefficient. In particular, RuBisCo is supposed to take carbon dioxide and attach it to a molecule called ribulose 1,5-biphosphate, but sometimes, instead of taking carbon dioxide, it grabs an oxygen molecule. Oops. Anyway, let's start from the beginning. We have five of a 3-carbon molecule called 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA). Through a series of complicated reactions which use up the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions, these five 3-carbon molecules are converted into three 5-carbon molecules, the aforementioned ribulose 1,5-biphosphate. Then, RuBisCo fixes three carbon dioxide molecules onto the three ribulose 1,5-biphosphate molecules. This forms three 6-carbon molecules, which immediately split to form six PGAs. One of these PGAs leaves the reaction as a product. This means there are five PGAs left, and we're back where we began. (That's why it's called a cycle!) The PGA that left the cycle is usually converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (PGAL), which can be rearranged and combined to form molecules like glucose, which is the end product of photosynthesis. Ultimately, it takes two PGALs to form one glucose molecule. Now, look at the photosynthesis equation again:  Everything here makes perfect sense! In order to get enough NADPH to form one glucose (sugar) molecule, we need six water molecules. We also needed three carbon dioxide molecules to form one PGAL, and two PGALs to form one glucose, for a total of six carbon dioxide molecules to form one glucose. And six oxygens are released through this process. Photosynthesis can get much more complicated than this. Of course, I simplified it a lot; the biochemical pathways involved are much more complex. Also, the method I described here is the most common mechanism for photosynthesis in plants, called C3. There are two other common mechanisms, called C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), the latter of which is found most often in succulents. These are interesting in their own right as evolutionary adaptations to particular stresses, although they're not that different. If you want to know more about them, ask me in a separate question.

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is a biological process that converts the raw materials of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It generally occurs in the leaves of green plants and requires light energy in order to make the reaction happen. (It is a photochemical reaction as it requires light and it is endothermic as it absorbs energy) Photosynthesis itself occurs in chloroplasts which contain the green pigment known as chlorophyll. The equations for this reaction are. carbon dioxide + water \u2192 glucose + oxygen 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082 The glucose produced is then used by the plant in order to allow respiration which releases energy needed for the plant. The glucose can also be stored by the plant as starch or converted into many other useful products. You can find out much more by checking out this Youtube video I put together.  ",

            "answer_text": "The basic gist: 2nCO2+2nH2O+photons\u21922nO2+2(CH2O)nThat is, water and carbon dioxide provide the raw ingredients (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen) and the photons provide the energy.  The end state is a carbohydrate, a bigger molecule that has more energy than either the water or the carbon dioxide.  There is some extra oxygen atoms left over at the end, which bubble off, while the carbohydrate stays behind.  The carbohydrate can later be used to provide energy for metabolic reactions in the plant. That easy description hides a world of complexity.  The reaction above doesn't happen spontaneously (at least not in significant amounts) because the energy levels are too high.  The electrons don't spontaneously jump around like that.  You need catalysts. The most important catalyst is chlorophyll.  Chlorophyll has a remarkable property: hit it with a photon, and it gives off an electron.  That electron can be absorbed by another molecule, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, causing an extra hydrogen molecule to stick to it.   With words like \"nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\", we leave the realm of plain English, and we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of the problem. The details of photosynthesis actually occur in two parts: the part that activates clorophyll and stores the energy as ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the same molecule that powers your muscles), and a second part that uses the energy from the ATP and carbon from carbon dioxide to create glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate, a simple carbohydrate that can be used to build more complex carbohydrates. The first cycle is called \"light dependent\", since light is necessary to active the chlorophyll.  The second part is \"light independent\", since it can happen even when the lights are off.  Both of these are actually a very complicated set of sub-reactions that go way beyond the \"plain English\" idea of the question.  You can add illustrations like this:  but I don't think they're particularly informative without a lot of underlying chemistry talk.  (That's an illustration of the Calvin cycle, a key part of the light-independent part of the process.) ",

            "answer_text": " Photosynthesis by definition is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. [1] Living things that depend on others for food are called heterotrophs. Herbivores like cows and other plant eating insects are examples of heterotrophs. [3] Living things that produce their own food are called autotrophs. Green plants and algae are good examples of autotrophs. [3]  Photosynthesis sustains virtually all life on planet Earth providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat; it forms the basis of global food chains and meets the majority of humankind\u2019s current energy needs through fossilized photosynthetic fuels. The process of photosynthesis in plants is based on two reactions that are carried out by separate parts of the chloroplast. The light reactions occur in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane and involve the splitting of water into oxygen, protons and electrons and in the dark reactions, the protons and electrons are used to reduce CO2 to carbohydrate. [2] Know that you know the definition of what photosynthesis is and who depends on this chemical conversion of light into energy let us explore the mechanisms at hand that provides the energy for most of the earth\u2019s functions.  Light reactions need light to produce organic energy molecules (ATP and NADPH). They are initiated by colored pigments, mainly green colored chlorophylls.[3] Dark reactions make use of these organic energy molecules (ATP and NADPH). This reaction cycle is also called Calvin Benison Cycle, and it occurs in the stroma. ATP provides the energy while NADPH provides the electrons required to fix the CO2 (carbon dioxide) into carbohydrates. make use of these organic energy molecules (ATP and NADPH). This reaction cycle is also called Calvin Benison Cycle, and it occurs in the stroma. ATP provides the energy while NADPH provides the electrons required to fix the CO2 (carbon dioxide) into carbohydrates. [3] The basic structure of the leaf To truly understand photosynthesis you must understand the physiology of a plants leaf and what mechanism contribute to the process.  Wide Plant Leaves Mosts green plants have leaves that are broad, flat and exposed to capture as much of the sun's energy (sunlight) needed for photosynthesis. This wide surface area allows for the maximum amount of light exposure for the process to help the plant grow. Veins The network of veins in the leaf also carry water from the stems to the leaves. Glucose produced is also sent to the other parts of the plant from the leaves through the veins. Additionally, the veins support and hold the leaf flat to capture sunlight. Pores (holes) The stomata (tiny holes underneath the leaf) allows air in and out of the leaf. Stomata (single is called stoma) is usually at the bottom surface of the leaf but some plant species have them on the upper surface whiles other have them on both sides. The stomata closes in the night to retain gases and moisture in the leaf cells, and opens during the day for gaseous exchange to continue. Where does photosynthesis take place? Photosynthesis takes place inside plant cells in small things called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts (mostly found in the mesophyll layer see the figure above) contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. It is important to note that not all the color wavelengths of light are absorbed. Plants mostly absorb red and blue wavelengths \u2014 they do not absorb light from the green range. Below is the structure of a mesophyll cell and the other parts of the cell that work with the chloroplast to make photosynthesis happen.  Cell walls: provide structural and mechanical support, protect cells against pathogens, maintain and determine cell shape, control the rate and direction of growth and generally provide form to the plant. Cytoplasm: provides the platform for most chemical processes, controlled by enzymes. Cell membrane: acts as a barrier, controlling the movement of substances into and out of the cell. Chloroplasts: As described above, simply contain chlorophyll, a green substance which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis. Vacuole: the container that holds moisture, and keeps the plant turgid. Nucleus: this contains genetic make (the DNA), which controls the activities of the cell. Conditions for successful photosynthesis There must be light and other molecules present to have a successful photosynthesis reaction in the plant leaves and they are as follows. Carbon dioxide (A colorless, naturally occurring odorless gas found in the air we breathe. It has a scientific symbol CO2. CO2 is produced by burning carbon and organic compounds. It is also produced when plants and animals breathe out during respiration)Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide diffuses through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (singular: stoma. plural: stomata)The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allows the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.Carbon dioxide is present in the air we breathe, at very low concentrations. Even though it forms about .04% of the air, it is a needed factor in light-independent photosynthesis.In higher concentrations, more carbon is incorporated into carbohydrate, therefore increasing the rate of photosynthesis in light-independent reactions. WaterPlants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots. The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass through them easily.Plants need water for other important things such as: it provides dissolved minerals that keep the plants healthy, a fluid a medium for transporting minerals, it keep the plant firm and upright with appropriate turgidity, it keeps the plant cool and hydrated, and allows other chemical reactions to occur in plant cells Light (Even though both natural and artificial light is OK for plants, natural sunlight is usually great for photosynthesis because they have other natural UV properties that help the plant)A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer. The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a palisade cell. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts.In light-dependent reactions (as explained in light and dark reactions early in the essay), photosynthesis increases with more light. More chlorophyll molecules are ionised and more ATP and NADPH are generated as more light photons are focussed on a green leaf. Even though light is extremely important in light-dependent reactions, it is important to note that excessive light can damage chlorophyll and photosynthesis can reduce.Light-dependant reactions do not rely too much on temperature, water or carbon dioxide, even though they are all necessary for the process to complete. This means cold or hot, the reactions will occur as long as there is enough light.

            "answer_text": "SHORT VERSION: Photosynthesis (From the Greek \u03c6\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf- [photo-], \"light,\" and \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 [synthesis],  \"putting together\", \"composition\") is a process used by plants and  other organisms to convert the light energy captured from the sun into  chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organism's activities.  Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and many species of bacteria, but not in archaea. OK, Now the Very very long Version (Total in-depth explanation) What is Photosynthesis? Photosynthesisis the process by which plants, some bacteria, and some protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular respiration converts into ATP, the \"fuel\" used by all living things. The conversion of unusable sunlight energy into usable chemical energy, is associated with the actions of the green pigment chlorophyll. Most of the time, the photosynthetic process uses water and releases the oxygen that we absolutely must have to stay alive. Oh yes, we need the food as well!We can write the overall reaction of this process as: 6H2O + 6CO2 ----------> C6H12O6+ 6O2 Most of us don't speak chemicalese, so the above chemical equation translates as:six molecules of water plus six molecules of carbon dioxide produce one molecule of sugar plus six molecules of oxygen  Diagram of a typical plant, showing the inputs and outputs of the photosynthetic process.  Leaves and Leaf Structure: Plants are the only photosynthetic organisms to have leaves(and not all plants have leaves). A leaf may be viewed as a solar collector crammed full of photosynthetic cells.The raw materials of photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide, enter the cells of the leaf, and the products of photosynthesis, sugar and oxygen, leave the leaf.  Cross section of a leaf, showing the anatomical features important to the study of photosynthesis: stoma, guard cell, mesophyll cells, and vein. Water enters the root and is transported up to the leaves through specialized plant cells known as xylem(pronounces zigh-lem). Land plants must guard against drying out (desiccation) and so have evolved specialized structures known as stomata to allow gas to enter and leave the leaf. Carbon dioxide cannot pass through the protective waxy layer covering the leaf (cuticle), but it can enter the leaf through an opening (the stoma; plural = stomata; Greek for hole) flanked by two guard cells. Likewise, oxygen produced during photosynthesis can only pass out of the leaf through the opened stomata. Unfortunately for the plant, while these gases are moving between the inside and outside of the leaf, a great deal water is also lost. Cottonwood trees, for example, will lose 100 gallons of water per hour during hot desert days. Carbon dioxide enters single-celled and aquatic autotrophs through no specialized structures.  Pea Leaf Stoma, Vicea sp. (SEM x3,520).  The Nature of Light: White light is separated into the different colors (=wavelengths) of light by passing it through a prism. Wavelength is defined as the distance from peak to peak (or trough to trough). The energy of is inversely porportional to the wavelength: longer wavelengths have less energy than do shorter ones.   Wavelength and other saspects of the wave nature of light. The order of colors is determined by the wavelength of light. Visible light is one small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The longer the wavelength of visible light, the more red the color. Likewise the shorter wavelengths are towards the violet side of the spectrum. Wavelengths longer than red are referred to as infrared, while those shorter than violet are ultraviolet.  The electromagnetic spectrum.  Light behaves both as a wave and a particle. Wave properties of light include the bending of the wave path when passing from one material (medium) into another (i.e. the prism, rainbows, pencil in a glass-of-water, etc.). The particle properties are demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. Zinc exposed to ultraviolet light becomes positively charged because light energy forces electrons from the zinc. These electrons can create an electrical current. Sodium, potassium and selenium have critical wavelengths in the visible light range. The critical wavelength is the maximum wavelength of light (visible or invisible) that creates a photoelectric effect. Chlorophyll and Accessory Pigments: A pigment is any substance that absorbs light. The color of the pigment comes from the wavelengths of light reflected (in other words, those not absorbed). Chlorophyll, the green pigment common to all photosynthetic cells, absorbs all wavelengths of visible light except green, which it reflects to be detected by our eyes. Black pigments absorb all of the wavelengths that strike them. White pigments/lighter colors reflect all or almost all of the energy striking them. Pigments have their own characteristic absorption spectra, the absorption pattern of a given pigment.  Absorption and transmission of different wavelengths of light by a hypothetical pigment. Chlorophyll is a complex molecule. Several modifications of chlorophyll occur among plants and other photosynthetic organisms. All photosynthetic organisms (plants, certain protistans, prochlorobacteria, and cyanobacteria) havechlorophyll a. Accessory pigments absorb energy that chlorophyll a does not absorb. Accessory pigments includechlorophyll b (also c, d, and e in algae and protistans), xanthophylls, and carotenoids(such as beta-carotene). Chlorophyll a absorbs its energy from the Violet-Blue and Reddish orange-Red wavelengths, and little from the intermediate (Green-Yellow-Orange) wavelengths.  Molecular model of chlorophyll.  Molecular model of carotene.  Carotenoids and chlorophyll b absorb some of the energy in the green wavelength. Why not so much in the orange and yellow wavelengths? Both chlorophylls also absorb in the orange-red end of the spectrum (with longer wavelengths and lower energy). The origins of photosynthetic organisms in the sea may account for this. Shorter wavelengths (with more energy) do not penetrate much below 5 meters deep in sea water. The ability to absorb some energy from the longer (hence more penetrating) wavelengths might have been an advantage to early photosynthetic algae that were not able to be in the upper (photic) zone of the sea all the time.  The molecular structure of chlorophylls. The action spectrum of photosynthesis is the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of light at generating electrons. If a pigment absorbs light energy, one of three things will occur. Energy is dissipated as heat. The energy may be emitted immediately as a longer wavelength, a phenomenon known as fluorescence. Energy may trigger a chemical reaction, as in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll only triggers a chemical reaction when it is associated with proteins embedded in a membrane (as in a chloroplast) or the membrane infoldings found in photosynthetic prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria and prochlorobacteria.   Absorption spectrum of several plant pigments (left) and action spectrum of elodea (right), a common aquarium plant used in lab experiments about photosynthesis The structure of the chloroplast and photosynthetic membranes: The thylakoidis the structural unit of photosynthesis. Both photosynthetic prokaryotes and eukaryotes have these flattened sacs/vesicles containing photosynthetic chemicals. Only eukaryotes have chloroplasts with a surrounding membrane.Thylakoids are stacked like pancakes in stacks known collectively as grana. The areas between grana are referred to as stroma. While the mitochondrion has two membrane systems, the chloroplast has three, forming three compartments.  Structure of a chloroplast. Stages of Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a two stage process. The first process is the Light Dependent Process (Light Reactions), requires the direct energy of light to make energy carrier molecules that are used in the second process. The Light Independent Process (or Dark Reactions) occurs when the products of the Light Reaction are used to form C-C covalent bonds of carbohydrates. The Dark Reactions can usually occur in the dark, if the energy carriers from the light process are present. Recent evidence suggests that a major enzyme of the Dark Reaction is indirectly stimulated by light, thus the term Dark Reaction is somewhat of a misnomer. The Light Reactions occur in the granaand the Dark Reactions take place in the stromaof the chloroplasts.  Overview of the two steps in the photosynthesis process. Light Reactions: In the Light Dependent Processes (Light Reactions) light strikes chlorophyll a in such a way as to excite electrons to a higher energy state. In a series of reactions the energy is converted (along an electron transport process) into ATPand NADPH. Water is split in the process, releasing oxygen as a by-product of the reaction. The ATP and NADPH are used to make C-C bonds in the Light Independent Process (Dark Reactions).In the Light Independent Process, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or water for aquatic/marine organisms) is captured and modified by the addition of Hydrogen to form carbohydrates (general formula of carbohydrates is [CH2O]n). The incorporation of carbon dioxide into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The energy for this comes from the first phase of the photosynthetic process. Living systems cannot directly utilize light energy, but can, through a complicated series of reactions, convert it into C-C bond energy that can be released by glycolysis and other metabolic processes.Photosystemsare arrangements of chlorophyll and other pigments packed into thylakoids. Many Prokaryotes have only one photosystem, Photosystem II (so numbered because, while it was most likely the first to evolve, it was the second one discovered). Eukaryotes have Photosystem II plus Photosystem I. Photosystem I uses chlorophyll a, in the form referred to as P700. Photosystem II uses a form of chlorophyll a known as P680. Both \"active\" forms of chlorophyll a function in photosynthesis due to their association with proteins in the thylakoid membrane.  Action of a photosystem.  Photophosphorylationis the process of converting energy from a light-excited electron into the pyrophosphate bond of an ADP molecule. This occurs when the electrons from water are excited by the light in the presence of P680. The energy transfer is similar to the chemiosmotic electron transport occurring in the mitochondria. Light energy causes the removal of an electron from a molecule of P680 that is part of Photosystem II. The P680 requires an electron, which is taken from a water molecule, breaking the water into H+ ions and O-2 ions. These O-2 ions combine to form the diatomic O2 that is released. The electron is \"boosted\" to a higher energy state and attached to a primary electron acceptor, which begins a series of redox reactions, passing the electron through a series of electron carriers, eventually attaching it to a molecule in Photosystem I. Light acts on a molecule of P700 in Photosystem I, causing an electron to be \"boosted\" to a still higher potential. The electron is attached to a different primary electron acceptor (that is a different molecule from the one associated with Photosystem II). The electron is passed again through a series of redox reactions, eventually being attached to NADP+ and H+ to form NADPH, an energy carrier needed in the Light Independent Reaction. The electron from Photosystem II replaces the excited electron in the P700 molecule. There is thus a continuous flow of electrons from water to NADPH. This energy is used in Carbon Fixation. Cyclic Electron Flow occurs in some eukaryotes and primitive photosynthetic bacteria. No NADPH is produced, only ATP. This occurs when cells may require additional ATP, or when there is no NADP+ to reduce to NADPH. In Photosystem II, the pumping to H ions into the thylakoid and the conversion of ADP + P into ATP is driven by electron gradients established in the thylakoid membrane.   Noncyclic photophosphorylation (top) and cyclic photophosphorylation (bottom). These processes are better known as the light reactions The above diagrams present the \"old\" view of photophosphorylation. We now know where the process occurs in the chloroplast, and can link that to chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP.   Chemiosmosis as it operates in photophosphorylation within a chloroplast.  Halobacteria, which grow in extremely salty water, are facultative aerobes, they can grow when oxygen is absent. Purple pigments, known as retinal (a pigment also found in the human eye) act similar to chlorophyll. The complex of retinal and membrane proteins is known as bacteriorhodopsin, which generates electrons which establish a proton gradient that powers an ADP-ATP pump, generating ATP from sunlight without chlorophyll. This supports the theory that chemiosmotic processes are universal in their ability to generate ATP. Dark Reaction: Carbon-Fixing Reactions are also known as the Dark Reactions (or Light Independent Reactions). Carbon dioxide enters single-celled and aquatic autotrophsthrough no specialized structures, diffusing into the cells. Land plants must guard against drying out (desiccation) and so have evolved specialized structures known as stomatato allow gas to enter and leave the leaf. The Calvin Cycle occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts (where would it occur in a prokaryote?). Carbon dioxide is captured by the chemical ribulose biphosphate (RuBP). RuBP is a 5-C chemical. Six molecules of carbon dioxide enter the Calvin Cycle, eventually producing one molecule of glucose. The reactions in this process were worked out by Melvin Calvin (shown below).   Ernest Orlando Lawrence, Berkeley National Laboratory.  One of the new areas, cultivated both in Donner and the Old Radiation Laboratory, was the study of organic compounds labeled with carbon-14. Melvin Calvin took charge of this work at the end of the war in order to provide raw materials for John Lawrence's researches and for his own study of photosynthesis. Using carbon-14, available in plenty from Hanford reactors, and the new techniques of ion exchange, paper chromatography, and radioautography, Calvin and his many associates mapped the complete path of carbon in photosynthesis. The accomplishment brought him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1961. (The preceding information was excerpted from the text of the Fall 1981 issue of LBL Newsmagazine.) Citation Caption: LBL News, Vol.6, No.3, Fall 1981 Melvin Calvin shown with some of the apparatus he used to study the role of carbon in photosynthesis.\"   The first steps in the Calvin cycle. The first stable product of the Calvin Cycle isphosphoglycerate (PGA), a 3-C chemical. The energy from ATP and NADPHenergy carriers generated by the photosystems is used to attach phosphates to (phosphorylate) the PGA. Eventually there are 12 molecules of glyceraldehyde phosphate (also known as phosphoglyceraldehyde or PGAL, a 3-C), two of which are removed from the cycle to make a glucose. The remaining PGAL molecules are converted by ATP energy to reform 6RuBPmolecules, and thus start the cycle again. Remember the complexity of life, each reaction in this process, as in Kreb's Cycle, is catalyzed by a different reaction-specific enzyme. C-4 Pathway: Some plants have developed a preliminary step to the Calvin Cycle (which is also referred to as a C-3 pathway), this preamble step is known as C-4. While most C-fixation begins with RuBP, C-4 begins with a new molecule, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a 3-C chemical that is converted into oxaloacetic acid (OAA, a 4-C chemical) when carbon dioxide is combined with PEP. The OAA is converted to Malic Acid and then transported from themesophyllcell into the bundle-sheath cell, where OAA is broken down into PEP plus carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide then enters the Calvin Cycle, with PEP returning to the mesophyll cell. The resulting sugars are now adjacent to the leaf veins and can readily be transported throughout the plant.   C-4 photosynthsis involves the separation of carbon fixation and carbohydrate systhesis in space and time.  The capture of carbon dioxide by PEP is mediated by the enzyme PEP carboxylase, which has a stronger affinity for carbon dioxide than does RuBP carboxylase When carbon dioxide levels decline below the threshold for RuBP carboxylase, RuBP is catalyzed with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. The product of that reaction forms glycolic acid, a chemical that can be broken down by photorespiration, producing neither NADH nor ATP, in effect dismantling the Calvin Cycle. C-4 plants, which often grow close together, have had to adjust to decreased levels of carbon dioxide by artificially raising the carbon dioxide concentration in certain cells to prevent photorespiration. C-4 plants evolved in the tropics and are adapted to higher temperatures than are the C-3 plants found at higher latitudes. Common C-4 plants include crabgrass, corn, and sugar cane. Note that OAA and Malic Acid also have functions in other processes, thus the chemicals would have been present in all plants, leading scientists to hypothesize that C-4 mechanisms evolved several times independently in response to a similar environmental condition, a type of evolution known as convergent evolution.  Photorespiration.  We can see anatomical differences between C3 and C4 leaves.    Leaf anatomy of a C3 (top) and C4 (bottom) plant.  The Carbon Cycle: Plants may be viewed as carbon sinks, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and oceans by fixing it into organic chemicals. Plants also produce some carbon dioxide by their respiration, but this is quickly used by photosynthesis. Plants also convert energy from light into chemical energy of C-C covalent bonds. Animals are carbon dioxide producers that derive their energy from carbohydrates and other chemicals produced by plants by the process of photosynthesis.The balance between the plant carbon dioxide removal and animal carbon dioxide generation is equalized also by the formation of carbonates in the oceans. This removes excess carbon dioxide from the air and water (both of which are in equilibrium with regard to carbon dioxide). Fossil fuels, such as petroleum and coal, as well as more recent fuels such as peat and wood generate carbon dioxide when burned. Fossil fuels are formed ultimately by organic processes, and represent also a tremendous carbon sink. Human activity has greatly increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in air. This increase has led to global warming, an increase in temperatures around the world, the Greenhouse Effect. The increase in carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the air has also led toacid rain, where water falls through polluted air and chemically combines with carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and sulfur oxides, producing rainfall with pH as low as 4. This results in fish kills and changes in soil pH which can alter the natural vegetation and uses of the land. The Global Warming problem can lead to melting of the ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica, raising sea-level as much as 120 meters. Changes in sea-level and temperature would affect climate changes, altering belts of grain production and rainfall patterns. Source: PHOTOSYNTHESIS ",

            "answer_text": "Autotrophic organisms such as green plants, algae and cyanobacteria (photosynthetic bacteria) make their own organic nutrients from simple inorganic nutrients (water, carbon dioxide and minerals) and radiant energy in a process called photosynthesis. The radiant energy is converted into chemical energy of specific organic compounds, mainly sugars and starch, amino acids and lipids. Oxygen is released as by product. Mechanism of Photosynthesis In green plants, the photosynthesis takes place in the cells containing chloroplasts. Most chloroplasts occur in the mesophyll cells of green leaves, but some are found in parenchyma cells below the epidermis of herbaceous stems. In the chloroplasts, the energy of sunlight is trapped in chlorophyll. The absorption of light energy by chlorophyll induces a rearrangement of the molecules electronic structure to an excited state, a process called photochemical excitation. The structure excitation in chloroplasts is responsible for oxidative change of water, a process called photo-oxidation; the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to NADPH, termed photo-reduction and phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a process known as photophosphorylation. All these reactions are commonly termed light phase of photosynthesis. The chemical reactions taking place during light reaction of photosynthesis were studied by Robert Hill, therefore also known as Hill\u2019s reaction.  ATP and NADPH are utilized in the reactions of carbon dioxide fixation that are commonly referred the dark phase of photosynthesis since it does not require the presence of sunlight. In many plants, the carbon dioxide is almost exclusively fixed in the chloroplasts by combination with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate to produce 3- phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA), which is converted to 4-C, 5-C, 6-C and 7-C phosphorylated sugars via a series of reactions collectively known as Calvin-Benson Pathway (Calvin Cycle).

            "answer_text": " Concept of photosynthesis Photosynthesis is a physiological process of plants. In 1898, scientist Barnes first used the term photosynthesis. Photosynthesis comes from two Greek words \u2018photo\u2019 means light, and \u2018synthesis\u2019 means, synthesize, or produce. Therefore, photosynthesis is the synthesis or production of any element with the help of light. In photosynthesis, solar energy from the sun is bound to glucose in the form of chemical energy. It is also a type of autotrophic nutrition. This energy is used in the biological work of plants. Other organisms absorb this energy directly or indirectly through food and use it to survive. That means the presence of living things on earth depends on photosynthesis (1) & (3). What is the definition of photosynthesis? The physiological process by which cells use chlorophyll and other pigments in the biochemical reaction of water and CO\u2082 taken from the environment to bind the solar energy to synthesize glucose and produce water and oxygen as by-products are called photosynthesis. In a word, the technique of making food for plants in the presence of sunlight is called photosynthesis. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6CO\u2082 + 12H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082 + 6H\u2082O (1). Site of photosynthesis  Fig: leaf structure Photosynthesis occurs in all green chlorophyll pigmented cells. Since plants contain mainly chlorophyll, photosynthesis occurs primarily in plants. The mesophyll tissue of the leaf is the ideal place for photosynthesis. This is because the leaves can absorb more sunlight as they are flattened and stretched. Mesophyll tissue cells have the highest number of chloroplasts and the highest amount of stomata, they are ideal for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs on the young green stems of plants, on the green aerial roots of orchids, bodies of euglena, chrysamoeba, etc (2). Components of photosynthesis and their roles The main components of photosynthesis are water, carbon dioxide, chlorophyll, and sunlight. There are also some other components like NADP, ADP, RuBP, etc. But among all these elements water, CO\u2082, chlorophyll, and sunlight play an important role in photosynthesis. (2) & (3) Sunlight Source Visible light is a part of the waves that constantly reach the earth\u2019s surface from space. This visible light of the sun is used in photosynthesis. It is actually made up of some tiny energy particles. These are called photon particles. These photos are used in photosynthesis. The sun is the main source of sunlight. Photosynthesis can also occur in artificial light. Role Sunlight helps activate chlorophyll.Sunlight produces high-potency ATP by photophosphorylation in the cell and releases oxygen into the water.Assists in photolysis (2) & (3).Chlorophyll Source Chloroplasts present in leaf mesophyll tissue are the main source of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is found in the grana area of chloroplasts. Role Chlorophyll is excited by absorbing photons of sunlight and breaks down water into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions.The electrons emitted from the active chlorophyll produce ATP in a light chemical process. (2) & (3).Water Source Terrestrial plants absorb water from the soil through the roots. Aquatic plants absorb water from reservoirs by their submerged parts. Parasitic plants absorb water vapor from the air by gaseous roots. Environmental water is the source of water required for photosynthesis of plants. Role Water is used as a raw material in photosynthesis.Water provides electrons to chlorophyll during photosynthesis.In dark reactions, the hydrogen needed to oxidize CO\u2082 is produced by water analysis.Water is also the source of the oxygen that is produced in photosynthesis (2) & (3).Carbon dioxide Source Terrestrial and parasitic plants absorb CO\u2082 from the atmosphere through the stomata. Aquatic plants absorb CO\u2082 dissolved in water by their submerged parts. Role CO\u2082 is a raw material of photosynthesis.Carbon assimilation occurs with carbon dioxide.The source of carbon in glucose produced by photosynthesis is carbon dioxide (2) & (3).Read full article from https://sciencequery.com/what-is-the-definition-of-photosynthesis/ ",

Green is important for photosynthesis to be carried out as an organelle called chloroplast having chlorophyl on-site is needed. And it also gives the plant color green. Chloroplasts have the ability to convert carbon dioxide and water to nutrients using sunlight through chlorophyls. Photo- which means \u201clight\u201d and synthesis which means to put together is constructing sth with light. General equation of photosynthesis is:  So here you see carbon dioxide, water and sunlight is needed. You see how green plants produce oxygen for us :) And the glucose can be converted into pyruvate which releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by cellular respiration. ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. Photosynthesis is done mostly at leaves of plants. Water comes from the roots via xylem vessels; carbon dioxide is absorbed through \u201cstoma\u201ds which are special structure for respiration at plants. Oxygen goes out of the leaf throug stoma, glucose is been carried to the cells of plant. Photosynthesis not only occurs at green plants. Some bacteria and protistans carry this out too.

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight into chemical energy.   There are two types of photosynthetic processes: oxygenic photosynthesis and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Oxygenic photosynthesis is the most common and is seen in plants, algae and cyanobacteria.  During oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy transfers electrons from water (H2O) to carbon dioxide (CO2), which produces carbohydrates. In this transfer, the CO2 is \"reduced,\" or receives electrons, and the water becomes \"oxidized,\" or loses electrons. Ultimately, oxygen is produced along with carbohydrates.  Oxygenic photosynthesis functions as a counterbalance to respiration; it takes in the carbon dioxide produced by all breathing organisms and reintroduces oxygen into the atmosphere. In his 1998 article, \u201cAn Introduction to Photosynthesis and Its Applications,\u201d Wim Vermaas, a professor at Arizona State University surmised, \u201cwithout [oxygenic] photosynthesis, the oxygen in the atmosphere would be depleted within several thousand years.\u201d  On the other hand, anoxygenic photosynthesis uses electron donors other than water. The process typically occurs in bacteria such as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria. \u201cAnoxygenic photosynthesis does not produce oxygen \u2014 hence the name,\u201d said David Baum, professor of botany at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cWhat is produced depends on the electron donor. For example, many bacteria use the bad-eggs-smelling gas hydrogen sulfide, producing solid sulfur as a byproduct.\u201d Though both types of photosynthesis are complex, multi-step affairs, the overall process can be neatly summarized as a chemical equation. Oxygenic photosynthesis is written as follows:  6CO2 + 12H2O + Light Energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O Here, six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with 12 molecules of water (H2O) using light energy. The end result is the formation of a single carbohydrate molecule (C6H12O6, or glucose) along with six molecules each of breathable oxygen and water. Similarly, the various anoxygenic photosynthesis reactions can be represented as a single generalized formula: CO2 + 2H2A + Light Energy \u2192 [CH2O] + 2A + H2O As explained by Govindjee and John Whitmarsh in \"Concepts in Photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis\" (Narosa Publishers and Kluwer Academic, 1999) the letter \u2018A\u2019 in the equation is a variable and \u2018H2A\u2019 represents the potential electron donor. For example, \u2018A\u2019 may represent sulfur in the electron donor hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The photosynthetic apparatus The following are cellular components essential to photosynthesis.  Pigments Pigments are molecules that bestow color on plants, algae and bacteria, but they are also responsible for effectively trapping sunlight. Pigments of different colors absorb different wavelengths of light. Below are the three main groups.\u2022 Chlorophylls: These green-colored pigments are capable of trapping blue and red light. Chlorophylls have three sub-types, dubbed chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and chlorophyll c. According to Eugene Rabinowitch and Govindjee in their book \u201cPhotosynthesis\u201d (Wiley, 1969) chlorophyll a is found in all photosynthesizing plants. There is also a bacterial variant aptly named bacteriochlorophyll, which absorbs infrared light. This pigment is mainly seen in purple and green bacteria, which perform anoxygenic photosynthesis.  \u2022 Carotenoids: These red, orange, or yellow-colored pigments absorb bluish-green light. Examples of carotenoids are xanthophyll (yellow) and carotene (orange) from which carrots get their color.\u2022 Phycobilins: These red or blue pigments absorb wavelengths of light that are not as well absorbed by chlorophylls and carotenoids. They are seen in cyanobacteria and red algae.  Plastids Photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms contain organelles called plastids in their cytoplasm. According to Cheong Xin Chan and Debashish Bhattacharya of Rutgers University (Nature Education, 2010), the double-membraned plastids in plants and algae are referred to as primary plastids, while the multiple-membraned variety found in plankton are called secondary plastids. These organelles generally contain pigments or can store nutrients. In \u201cThe Cell: A Molecular Approach 2nd Ed\u201d (Sinauer Associates, 2000), Geoffrey Cooper enumerates the various plastids found in plants. Colorless and non-pigmented leucoplasts store fats and starch, while chromoplasts contain carotenoids and chloroplasts contain chlorophyll.  Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, specifically, in the grana and stroma regions. The grana is the innermost portion of the organelle; a collection of disc-shaped membranes, stacked into columns like plates. The individual discs are called thylakoids. It is here that the transfer of electrons takes place. The empty spaces between columns of grana constitute the stroma (The Cell: A Molecular Approach 2nd Ed, Sinauer Associates, 2000).    Chloroplasts are similar to mitochondria in that they have their own genome, or collection of genes, contained within circular DNA. These genes encode proteins essential to the organelle and to photosynthesis.  Like mitochondria, chloroplasts are also thought to have originated from primitive bacterial cells through the process of endosymbiosis.  \u201cPlastids originated from engulfed photosynthetic bacteria that were acquired by a single-celled eukaryotic cell more than a billion years ago,\u201d Baum told LiveScience. Baum explained that the analysis of chloroplast genes shows that it was once a member of the group cyanobacteria, \u201cthe one group of bacteria that can accomplish oxygenic photosynthesis.\u201d  However, Chan and Bhattacharya (Nature Education, 2010) make the point that the formation of secondary plasmids cannot be well explained by endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria, and that the origins of this class of plastids are still a matter of debate. Antennae Pigment molecules are associated with proteins, which allow them the flexibility to move toward light and toward one another. A large collection of 100 to 5,000 pigment molecules constitutes \"antennae,\" according to Vermaas. These structures effectively capture light energy from the sun, in the form of photons. Ultimately, light energy must be transferred to a pigment-protein complex that can convert it to chemical energy, in the form of electrons. In plants, for example, light energy is transferred to chlorophyll pigments. The conversion to chemical energy is accomplished when a chlorophyll pigment expels an electron, which can then move on to an appropriate recipient.  Reaction centers The pigments and proteins which convert light energy to chemical energy and begin the process of electron transfer are know as reaction centers, according to Vermaas. The photosynthetic process Anoxygenic photosynthetic and oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use different electron donors for photosynthesis. Moreover, anoxygenic photosynthesis takes place in only one type of reaction center, while oxygenic photosynthesis takes place in two, each of which absorbs a different wavelength of light, according to Govindjee and Whitmarsh. However, the general principles of the two processes are similar. Below are the steps of photosynthesis, focusing on the process as it occurs in plants. The reactions of plant photosynthesis are divided into those that require the presence of sunlight and those that do not. Both types of reactions take place in chloroplasts: light-dependent reactions in the thylakoid and light-independent reactions in the stroma.  Light-dependent reactions (also called light reactions): When a photon of light hits the reaction center, a pigment molecule such as chlorophyll releases an electron. \u201cThe trick to do useful work, is to prevent that electron from finding its way back to its original home,\u201d Baum told LiveScience. \u201cThis is not easily avoided because the chlorophyll now has an \u201celectron hole\u201d that tends to pull on nearby electrons.\u201d The released electron manages to escape by traveling through an electron transport chain, which generates the energy needed to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate, a source of chemical energy for cells) and NADPH. The \u201celectron hole\u201d in the original chlorophyll pigment is filled by taking an electron from water. As a result, oxygen is released into the atmosphere. Light-independent reactions (also called dark reactions): ATP and NADPH are rich energy sources, which drive dark reactions. During this process carbon dioxide and water combine to form carbohydrates like glucose. This is known as carbon fixation.  Photosynthesis in the future Photosynthesis generates all the breathable oxygen in the atmosphere, and renders plants rich in nutrients. But researchers have been looking at ways to further harness the power of the process.  In his 1998 article, Vermaas mentions the possibility of using photosynthetic organisms to generate clean burning fuels such as hydrogen or even methane. Vermaas notes, \u201cEven though methane upon combustion will form CO2, the overall atmospheric CO2 balance would not be disturbed as an equal amount of CO2 will have been taken out of the atmosphere upon methane production by the photosynthetic organism.\u201d Advances have also been made in the field of artificial photosynthesis. A group of researchers recently developed an artificial system to capture carbon dioxide using nanotechnology (nanowires). This feeds into a system of microbes that reduce the carbon dioxide into fuels or polymers by using energy from sunlight ",

            "answer_text": "I could give the technical answer but that would require half a textbook chapter of high school biology... so the simplest layman answer would be: the natural biochemical process by which most plants help make the Earth a liveable breathable place for us oxygen-breathing Earthlings by converting the carbon dioxide we exhale (and water from the soil) into fresh oxygen (and carbohydrates that serve as nutrition to be passed down along the food chain). If you wanna go into details, the plants that have the green pigment chlorophyll in their cells, usually the leaves, (hence green plants) -- and, er, other coloured plant parts (like 'yellow' ones which have xanthophyll instead of chlorophyll, same function) -- are the ones that can carry out this process. All you need is carbon dioxide (the gas we breathe out) and water, and the good old plants will recycle those into breathable air and nutrition for us. I'm not gonna go into the electron transport chain or ATP gory details because that's boring A'Level textbook stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants can prepare their own food. \u2018Photo\u2019 means light and \u2018synthesis\u2019 means production or preparation. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis involves preparation of food using light from the Sun. The process of photosynthesis is carried out in the leaves of green plants. The raw materials required for photosynthesis are : light (obtained from sunlight), water (obtained from the soil by the roots) and carbon dioxide (from the air). Using these raw materials and in the presence of the green-coloured pigment chlorophyll, plants prepare glucose, which can be burnt to provide energy in all organisms. Another important byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen, which helps most organisms to sustain. The process of photosynthesis can thus be summarised in the equation:  Photosynthesis in plants occurs in green leaves and green stems, whose cells have specialized subcellular organelles called chloroplasts, which are oval-shaped structures, divided by membranes into numerous disk-shaped compartments. These disk-like compartments, called thylakoids, are arranged vertically in the chloroplast, stacked on top of one another. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural, grana) and these grana lie suspended in a fluid known as stroma. The chloroplasts consist of the light-trapping pigment chlorophyll.  Photosynthesis takes place in mainly two stages, light reactions (which require the presence of sunlight to take place) and dark reactions (which can take place even in the absence of sunlight). In the first stage, that is the light-dependent reactions, the chlorophyll molecules present in the chloroplasts trap light energy and convert them into chemical compounds which are capable of storing chemical energy. In the second stage of photosynthesis, called the light-independent reactions or the dark reactions, these chemical compounds help in the synthesis and metabolism of glucose.

This is actually pretty groovy since green plants are among the only forms of life which can pull of this feat. The actual chemical process of photosynthesis is quite complicated and involves a lot of energy. But the overall reaction can be represented by: Carbon dioxide + Water ----(in presence of chlorophyll)----> Glucose + Oxygen Another amazing reason why photosynthesis is awesome is that one of the end products is oxygen.

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is actually the synthesis of organic food by the reduction of carbon dioxide, utilising the energy of sunlight or photons, usually by the green plants in their chloroplasts. Chloroplasts may be compared to the cooking pots, where food is prepared by utilising the energy. Within the chloroplasts, there are light harvesting pigments called chlorophylls and carotenoids. From the chlorophyll, high energy electrons are emitted, which are accepted by various electron acceptors in the cell membrane of chloroplast. During the transport of these electrons, energy is released which is utilised for combining ADP( Adenosine Di phosphate) with inorganic phosphate to form ATP(Adenosine triphosphate) , an energy rich compound or the energy currency of the cell. Thus the energy of the sun light is stored in ATP and it can be utilised for the reduction of CO2 to form carbohydrate from which other food forms are synthesised. In mitochondria, during cellular respiration, food molecules will be oxidised to form ATP , and thus the energy of the food is stored in ATP. When energy is needed for any activity, the ATP will be broken down into ADP and inorganic phosphate and the energy will be released .Thus photosynthesis and respiration are just the reverse processes whereby the nature provides us with its energy to feed us for our activities, whether it be good or bad.

An almost complete quantum mechanical picture of photosynthesis is hypothesised, but as of now, only a little of the beginning of the reaction is well explained. Photosynthesis is accomplished by chlorophyll molecules in the chloroplasts of photosynthetic cells. Photons of a definite range of wavelengths fall on the chloroplasts and excite the photocomplex. Part of the energy is lost as heat, but most of it is captured through excitons - electron-hole pairs in the chromophores. When light is absorbed, as per the classical/semi-classical models, it can take one of the many paths to the reaction centre for being absorbed. However, we know now that these excitons exhibit quantum coherence - a phenomenon where both waves occupy the same phase, and hence, interfere positively. In essence, this maximises the efficiency of absorbance on energy from the photons. ",

During photosynthesis carbon dioxide and water turns into oxygen and sugar. Two stages: capturing energyUsing energy to make food.To capture energy, choloroplasts in plant cells capture energy from the sunlight. To make food, two things are needed. water (H2O)Carbon Dioxide (CO2)The water enters the plant through the roots of the cell. The water moves upwards the plant. Carbon dioxide enters the plant through small microscopic openings from the underside of the leaves called stomona. Six molecules of carbon dioxide (6CO2) and six molecules of water (6H2O) makes a sugar, glucose (C6H12O6) and six oxygen molecules (6O2) Some of the glucose made in photosynthesis is used by the plant for food. Some molecules are converted into other compounds. Other molecules can be stored for usage later on. ",

            "answer_text": "In photosynthesis light is converted into chemical energy which is later used by almost all living beings on the planet earth. Carbon Dioxide + Water = Sugar + Oxygen Carbon dioxide is converted into organic compounds and oxygen is released as a by product. Light Reaction : The plants have a pigment called chlorophyll the green pigment) and several other pigments such as beta-carotene. These pigments absorb the light energy which is basically the fire of your kitchen and supply the chemical energy to the chlorophyll. In chlorophyll you ll find this porphyrin ring which is basically as shown below, nitrogen and carbon rings with magnesium ion at the center.    This absorbed energy or the converted chemical energy is stored as ATP(Adenosine triphosphate). ATP has adenine ring and ribose sugar along with 3 phosphate groups. This is like the currency of the plants which they can store and use to make some delicious food later. The second part is the light independent reaction (or dark reaction) which consists of calvin cycle.Here there is an enzyme RuBisCo which captures CO2 from the atmosphere and produces some by products which in the end are combined and converted into sugar liberating oxygen.

So photosynthesis is the building of food in the presence of light. In photosynthesis plants take up water from soil and the water reaches to the mesophyll cell of a leave . There photolysis of water takes place and oxygen is released in the atmosphere . And the hydrogen protons and electrons dissolves in the stroma to form NADP-NADPH and ADP-ATP . Then NADPH and ATP reacts with co2 and RUBPH to release carbohydrates,water and energy. The photolysis of water is known as light reaction .. and the from utilisation of co2 starts the dark reaction .. hope it will help you :-) :-D ",

For further information, refer to the respective response Photosynthesis as we know is the process by which plants react with sunlight through their leaves, in combination with CO22 and water generate carbs (CH22O) and oxygen as bi product and hence generate food for themselves. This may be expressed in a chemical equation form as nH22O + nCO22 + Sunlight -> (CH22O)nn + nO22 The carbohydrates generated (may or may not be glucose) are the food necessary for plants. This reaction is light dependent i.e. requires sunlight to happen. Reference: Renu Joshi's answer to How does a plant do photosynthesis? ",

Most plants are able to make food directly from light energy, for example the Sun, instead of eating other organisms or relying on nutrients.  Photosynthesis can happen in plants because they have chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the pigment that makes plants green. Chlorophyll captures the Sun\u2019s energy and uses it to make sugars out of carbon dioxide from the air and water. The sugars fuel a plant's roots, stems, and leaves so the plant can grow. After plants use the Sun's light to make their food, plants release oxygen into the air. This oxygen is very helpful because humans and animals need it to breathe. Make sure you thank plants for the oxygen you use everyday!  ",

There are two types of photosynthetic processes: oxygenic photosynthesis and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Oxygenic photosynthesis is the most common and is seen in plants, algae and cyanobacteria. During oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy transfers electrons from water (H2O) to carbon dioxide (CO2), which produces carbohydrates. In this transfer, the CO2 is \"reduced,\" or receives electrons, and the water becomes \"oxidized,\" or loses electrons. Ultimately, oxygen is produced along with carbohydrates. ",

It acts roughly like a photovoltaic cell, with captured photons energizing electrons, with these electrons moving from one spot and replacement electrons coming from another spot. The replacement electrons come from a \u201coxygen-evolving complex\u201d in Photosystem II, and that complex gets them from water molecules. As those molecules get deprived of electrons, their hydrogen departs as hydrogen ions, leaving oxygen behind. The electrons from Photosystem II then go to a molecule called plastoquinone, then to the cytochrome b6-f enzyme complex, then to a molecule called plastocyanin, then to Photosystem I, with its antenna complex. Photons energize electrons there also, and they go to an enzyme called ferredoxin, then to another one called ferredoxin-NADP reductase. That one transmits the electrons to a molecule called NADP, producing NADPH. The NADPH then transmits its electrons to an intermediate in the Calvin cycle, which another answerer had illustrated here. It becomes NADP again and gets reused. The NADPH may also be used for other biosynthesis reactions, because a plant needs not only sugar, but the full set of biological molecules. It has to make its own lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and cofactors. ",

Chlorophyll in the leaves capture sunlight to act on water. Oxygen and moisture are given off to the air. Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomata. Carbon dioxide combines with a substance in the cell, eventually producing a kind of sugar (I think it's glucose). The sugar (dissolved in water) is transported from the leaves to the different parts of the plant. Once the sugar reaches the different parts of the plant body, it may be used up by the cells. Or it may be converted into starch and stored for future use.",

Water is composed of hydronium and hydroxyl ions. What plants do is to produce enzymes or compounds that can react with these ions and you get your oxygen and carbohydrates. ",
