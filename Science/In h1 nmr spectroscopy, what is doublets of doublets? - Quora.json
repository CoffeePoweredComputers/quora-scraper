            "answer_text": "You will encounter a doublet of doublet when a group of magnetically identical protons ( e.g. CH3 or CH2) is coupled with 2 different protons, with different coupling constants ( this is usually called an AMX system). The signal for that group will then be made of 4 peaks of identical area.  The reason is that the signal will be doubled a first time for the first coupling, resulting in a doublet ( 2 peaks of identical area). That signal is then doubled again for the 2nd coupling, causing each peak to be doubled, once again with identical area. So you end up with 4 peaks with identical area. You will be able to determine the 2nd coupling constant using the difference in chemical shift between peaks 1 and 2, or peaks 3 and 4. This will be the smallest of the 2. You can then determine the other coupling constant using peaks 1 and 3 or peaks 2 and 4.  Note that if the coupling constant have the same value, the two middle peaks will be combined in a single peak with an area twice as large as outside peaks, making the signal look like a triplet, whether your group is coupled with 2 identical protons (in which case you have a regular triplet) or with 2 different protons who happen to be coupled with the same coupling constant: this is called an apparent doublet. Here is an example where you should see a doublet of doublet: 3-chloro-1-nitro-prop-1-ene (NO2-CH=CH-CH2Cl). That CH2 will be coupled with both vinylic protons, the first in J3, the second in J4. The 2 constants should be different, probably around 7Hz for the J3 and between 1 and 3Hz (depending on the stereochemistry of the double bond) for the J4. ",
