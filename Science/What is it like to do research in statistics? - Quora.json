            "answer_text": "It's beautiful. I am also an undergraduate and I completed my first statistics research project this semester on records. I fell in love with research because of the uncertainty - you really have no idea how things are going to go, what the answer will be, if there is even an answer, or if it's already been discovered before. I got to do a lot of coding (which I also love to do) to simulate the data. Because each data point was taking so long to simulate, I ran my program on all the computers in one of the lab rooms overnight. That's probably my favorite memory from this last semester - allnighter with tacos and research. Once I had the data points I really had no idea what to do with them so I just experimented a whole lot until I found a cool result! And now I have one area of statistics that I can call my own (even if it is rather useless, it's still cool to me).  That's what research is. Staying up all night, exhilarating, beautiful, incredible work. Once you have a taste of research you can never stop thinking \"what if I do this....\" about the world around you. ",
