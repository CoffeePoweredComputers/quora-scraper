            "answer_text": "They can look like a lot of things \u2014 as Howard C. Berkowitz says, the \u201cphysics package\u201d can be fairly small. There\u2019s basically two shapes for (modern) versions of those \u2014 a pure fission weapon is basically a ball, and a fusion-boosted \u201chydrogen\u201d package is more of an oblong lump. To get that where you want it to go, you build a delivery system around it - a missile, a dropped bomb, or even an artillery shell. The very first one, the \u201cGadget\u201d, was detonated in the Trinity test in 1945. This was a steel casing filled with explosives to compress a ball of uranium containing a ball of plutonium; more of a \u201cwill this work at all\u201d test than a weapon. It looked like this:  (TR-311_4x5 - Los Alamos National Labs. Norris Bradbury, chief of bomb assembly, on the right.) Very shortly afterwards, two different bombs that were practically possible to air-drop were bolted together (and then dropped on Japanese cities). These were fairly normal air-dropped bombs- a big lump with a tail to make it drop straight.  (A replica of Fat Man, the Nagasaki bomb. US Department of Defense.) Inside, it probably looked a bit like this British bomb\u2014 a Violet Club bomb, holding what\u2019s probably a Green Grass physics package. (The British cold war color+noun codenames were excellent \u2026 somewhat unlike many of the things they were codenames for.)  (The warhead, or physics package, of the Violet Club bomb, from Violet Club: Quite Possibly the Worst Nuclear Bomb Ever Fielded ; they apparently got the photo from either Vulcan's Hammer: V-Force Projects and Weapons Since 1945 by Chris Gibson, or nuclear-weapons.info, which is run by Brian Burnell. No idea about the original source of the photo.) After the war, these bombs were polished a bit and shrunk down. A later but related design was the Mark 7; another \u201cdumb\u201d bomb, though one meant to be delivered with a \u201ctoss\u201d - you strap it under a smaller faster jet bomber, and when the plane gets close it pulls up sharply while releasing the bomb, so it flies forwards and up, covering a fair distance. The idea is to let the bomber approach at low height (which makes it harder to detect and shoot down), and to give it more time to get away before detonation. The Mark 7 was introduced in 1952, and looked like this.  (Mark 7 nuclear bomb - National Museum of the USAF) After this, the designs started branching out into all sorts of madness. In the same year the Mark 7 was introduced, the W9 warhead was designed. This was a much smaller package, small enough to be put in a 280mm artillery shell. Later developments made even smaller shells - the W33 was an 8\u2033 (203mm) shell first made in 1957. They made 2000 of the things, and never fired them out of a gun - the only one actually fired was one original W9. They filmed it, so I might as well include that (instead of a picture of an artillery shell - they didn\u2019t look like anything out of the ordinary). The artillery bit is around 9:10.  These comparatively tiny warheads could also be put into other things, like the mildly disturbing Davy Crockett launcher - a \u201crecoilless gun\u201d (think large bazooka) that could be carried in a jeep and was meant to be fired by a 3-man crew. It went a couple of kilometers, and had one of the smallest, lowest-yield warheads ever built \u2014 so despite the apparent insanity of a small crew-fired nuke, the operators were meant to survive firing it. It\u2019s one of the most \u201cnuclear bomb\u201d-looking items so far, looking like this:  (Preserved Davy Crockett casing, US Army Ordinance Museum). The same kind of warhead could be put in backpack nukes, meant to be used by army engineers to destroy infrastructure in front of invading soviet forces, or by infiltrating special forces. They were carried in a protective barrel-shaped backpack, and had controls up top.  (From The US Military\u2019s Backpack Atomic ) Inspired by how small warheads suddenly could be made, there was also at least one nuclear air-to-air missile, the AIR-2 Genie:  (AIR-2 Genie, USAF, Hill Air Force Base Museum) Normal \u201cdumb\u201d bombs never went away, though - one of the current nuclear weapons of the USAF is the B61 bomb, produced since 1965. It looks something like this, with the physics package (the actual \u201cbomb\u201d part) being the silver cylinder in the top row, left of the middle.  (B61 thermonuclear weapon. Chuck Hansen, The Swords of Armageddon: U.S. Nuclear Weapons Development Since 1945, who further got it from a US DOD or DOE publication). However, the big development allowed by the combination of better rocketry and smaller warheads was ICBM delivery - intercontinental ballistic missiles. If you could launch a missile from the US and have the warheads land in the USSR half an hour later (or the other way around) with no real chance of interception, well \u2014 that\u2019s clearly a scarier (and thus better) method than flying planes within shooting distance. The first ICBM was probably the Soviet R-7A, put into service in very low numbers in 1960. An ICBM is effectively a stubby space rocket, meant to go up and release the warheads, so they fall down again where you want them to. They can be launched from silos (holes in the ground), submarines, or tracked vehicles (the Russians seem more fond of those), and the missiles will look a bit different depending on that. As an example, and just to vary the country a bit, here\u2019s an R-36M2 \u201cVoyevoda\u201d, affectionately known in NATO as the SS-18 Mod 5 \u201cSatan\u201d:  (SS-18 missile, Strategic Missile Forces museum) Under the cover at the tip of one of those is the MIRV bus - a Multiple Independent[ly targeted] Re-entry Vehicle launcher. Roughly speaking this is a rack of pointy little bombs that you drop from space; each of them can be aimed to some degree. That way, your big (expensive) missile can launch a whole slew of attacks - and it\u2019s harder to shoot them down all at once than one at the time. The image below is the MIRV end of a US Peacekeeper missile. Each black cone is a Mk21 re-entry vehicle, containing a W87 warhead and not that much more; it can carry up to 11 of them. [1]  (W87 warheads inside MK21 RVs on a Peacekeeper bus at Vandenberg AFB in 1983. From Chuck Hansen, The Swords of Armageddon: U.S. Nuclear Weapons Development Since 1945, who again sourced it from a DOD or DOE publication). They look kind of \u2026 distinct coming down, too. This is a long exposure of a Peacekeeper test with dummy warheads:  (Time exposure shot of testing of the Peacekeeper re-entry vehicles at the Kwajalein Atoll, all eight fired from one missile. David James Paquin, for the US Army SMDC). I\u2019ve mostly been grabbing from wikipedia for this \u2014 List of nuclear weapons is a reasonable place to start.

As to why the bombs are shaped this way, this may be more detail than you want, but here\u2019s a diagram of the internal workings:  Basically, the explosion is a two-stage process: the primary fission trigger at the rear of the device explodes, compressing the secondary and flooding it with radiation to trigger a fusion reaction. The peanut shape is to accommodate the two main parts of the device. ",
