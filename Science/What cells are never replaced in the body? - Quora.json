            "answer_text": "There is a number of cell categories that are either not replaced when die, or not repaired when damaged. Cortical neurons - we (and animals with cortex) are born with a finite number of these cells, that begin to die actually even before birth. Now, SOME neurons in certain parts of the brain CAN be replaced - notably, cells in the hypothalamus, possibly cells in the cerebellum, and the like.Nerve cord neurons regenerate poorly, if at all, although some can be repaired, and new connections can be formed. Peripheral neurons also may become damaged beyond repair (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome).Rod and cone cells of the eye - when damaged, the vision is gone.Cells in the organ of Corti (inner ear) - when they lose their hairs (loud sounds is the main culprit), the ability to hear is diminished. These cells do not regenerate lost parts.Cardiac muscle cells - once damaged by infarction, they die and a scar tissue is formed, with the loss of heart function. They also die or lose function with ageing.Thymic epithelium, responsible for production of T lymphocytes, undergoes involution (regress) with ageing, gradually losing the ability to create cells.Beta cells in the pancreas, once destroyed in course of type 1 diabetes, do not regenerate (however, there is some interesting research on the plasticity of human pancreas Astonishing regeneration potential of the pancreasEndothelial cells of the major blood vessels do not regenerate, when damaged by atherosclerosis or varicose condition. Smaller blood vessels can regrow, though.Kidney cells were thought not to regenerate, but it seems that they may in certain conditions - interesting research being done on this Adult kidneys constantly grow, remodel themselves, study findsThere may be other sites in the body, where cells are not replaced; there are also sites, where situation is not clear (e.g. lungs). In some organs, cells can be prompted to multiply, but these techniques are still highly experimental. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all I would like to take this opportunity to salute you for bringing this question on the board As living organism grow and carry out numerous physiological process some cells tend to be worn-out dye some also remain dormant Large number of calls in the body are replace but it depends on duration that they take to be replaced Cells such as Blood cell muscle cell skin cell optical cell digestive cells are replaced regularly in entire human life There are some cells which reduce in the rate of replacement base on the age of the organism a good example is the heart cells In the best of my knowledge is that the only cells that are not replaced is neuro cortex only ",
