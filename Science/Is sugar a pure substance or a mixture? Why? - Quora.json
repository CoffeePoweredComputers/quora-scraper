            "answer_text": "From wikipedia: Scientifically, sugar loosely refers to a number of carbohydrates, such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or oligosaccharides. Monosaccharides are also called \"simple sugars,\" the most important being glucose. Almost all sugars have the formula CnH2nOn (n is between 3 and 7). Glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6. The names of typical sugars end with ose, as in \"glucose\", \"dextrose\", and \"fructose\". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of carbohydrates soluble in water. The acyclic mono- and disaccharides contain either aldehyde groups or ketone groups. These carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more  than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides  joined by glycosidic bonds with the resultant loss of a molecule of water (H2O) per bond.[32]Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with  other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and  polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized.  After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in  the blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and  galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures.  In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains  non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur.  Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.[32]Natural polymers of sugarsBiopolymers of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose (C6H12O6) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose (C12H22O11). Monosaccharides may be further converted into structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectinfor cell wall construction or into energy reserves in the form of storage polysaccharides such as starch or inulin. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical energy stored by cells, and can be converted to other types of energy.[32] Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain  composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by  plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest  cellulose only to a very limited extent, though ruminants can do so with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their gut.[33] DNA and RNA are built up of the monosaccharides deoxyribose and ribose, respectively. Deoxyribose has the formula C5H10O4 and ribose the formula C5H10O5.[34] ... We can see from this that plants produce many kind of sugars and the refining process is not going to separate them.  So you are never going to find any one pure chemical substance when you buy refined agricultural sugars.  The only way you would get a pure substance is if you chemically manufactured it.  There is no plant that only makes a single kind of sugar.  And technically cellulose is a sugar even. ",

            "answer_text": "As pointed out by others, \u201csugar\u201d usually refers to refined cane or beet sugar, which is sucrose. There are many kinds of sugars, but this is the most common commercial product. It\u2019s a pure substance because it consists of one kind of molecule. Refining incluces several processes that remove other things (such as the cellulose) from the beets or cane (use Wikipedia to find more about that). Refined sugar has well defined physical and chemical properties that make it very useful in product: well defined solubility, melting point, chemical changes at various temperatures, sweetness, etc. ",
