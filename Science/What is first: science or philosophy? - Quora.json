            "answer_text": "To understand the answer to this question, you need to understand what science is, and that's already difficult for many people. Some people think that science is a process of determining what we think about reality as such.  This is certainly what it is for some people, in that, for example, some people infer that the idea that evolution was unguided by any in-universe causal agency means that the existence of a god is absurd.  Is this merited?  Possibly, but not by \"science\" as such; only by one view of science in which Occam's Razor as applied to merely physical phenomena is able to yield metaphysical conclusions.  To put it in layman's terms: an absence of evidence for god is taken to be evidence of god's absence in that causal chain, and since god cannot be found directly in any given causal chain, there is no god. Now, in science, it is bad methodology to assume that one can completely rule out the existence of a thing based on a lack of proof.  For example, before we were able to prove space was curved, the idea seemed absurd to many at the Royal Academy; taking up the same maxim, they suggested that the absence of evidence was evidence that space was Newtonian.  (It wasn't.)  Yet there is something which not only provides us with the rules of science, but also its limits, the space within which \"science\" is able to render conclusions, and its principles, the things science takes for granted and cannot prove. Suppose I were to say that writing takes its principles from language, and language limits writing.  Would there be any sense in saying writing is \"first\", prior to language?  Actually, there might - writing might be the most noble form of language among other forms, and this is a sense of first.  Some scientists, especially atheists, think of science this way when they give philosophy any credit - yes, philosophy is in a way first, but the only sort of being is observable, empirical, mutable physical being, so that science is first philosophy.  Yet even these scientists have to admit that there is some prior sort of philosophy where being as being is investigated and delineated, whereby they can talk about how science is prior to, say, craft. In other words, there is always some philosophy before science which enables science to have meaning and upon which science depends, and in that sense philosophy must be first.  If there is a sense in which science is first, it is according to the place which physical being occupies in the hierarchy.  If there is no non-physical being such that we can investigate literally all being in a scientific mode, then science is the only true study of nature.  But since that is a philosophical conclusion not proven by science, even that must be taken from some higher philosophy, which we now call metaphysics, or as Aristotle also calls it, \"first philosophy\", the love of the highest wisdom and the knowledge of the highest causes. tl;dr: Philosophy has to be first, and even where science seems first, metaphysics (or \"first philosophy\") is even more first.

            "answer_text": "What is Science? Science is the practice of testing hypotheses about the world through empirical - that is, experimental - means. Scientific theorists may limit themselves to speculating on possible hypotheses or their underlying bases, while experimentalists test them out. This methodology for discovery of knowledge about the world was formulated via empirical philosophy. For instance, John Locke was a leading empiricist, as well as Berkeley and Hume. They believed that knowledge ultimately came from the senses, that at birth we are effectively a tabula rasa, or clean slate. The scientific methodology follows the logical strictures laid down philosophically. A hypothesis can never be confirmed as such, it can only be falsified. However, if you've discounted lots of hypotheses you may narrow the possibilities. You will also need fair comparisons of different conditions, which leads us to the use of control groups. Hence, Philosophy must be first as it determines the scientific method. One can also take the position of Kant in his attempt to overcome the scepticism of Hume. He said that as well as analytic truths that are basically matters of definition and tautologous (e.g. 1 = 1), and empirical facts (things that happen to be the case), there is a third viable category. These are a priori (can be known prior to experience) and synthetic (not simply analytic, and so informative). He formulated some of these as preconditions to a world that we can experience. For instance, for there to be objects and events at the same time in such a world, there must be a relationship between them, which therefore implies the existence of a spacelike relationship. Though it would be an empirical matter to determine, for instance, how many dimensions that space has. Although Kant's particular arguments have some issues, not least his separation of the world of appearances from the world in itself, there does seem some justification to say his approach is a fruitful and even necessary one. Some Philosophers believe that a neo-Kantian approach will ultimately be needed to resolve the difficult issues at the heart of Physics. ",
