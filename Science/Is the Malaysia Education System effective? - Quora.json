I feel like rather than honing my analytical skills, all I have been taught is the same content for the past 5 years and we\u2019ve done nothing more except memorized useless facts. I still don\u2019t get how being good at memorizing equates to being intelligent, because that\u2019s what the test seems to allude to. At one point I started to hate reading because I kept hearing the word \u201cHafal, hafal, hafal\u2026\u201d from multitudes of people, enough to get on my nerve and make me despise reading. Wasn\u2019t until the mid of 2016 I started to shrug it off and retrieve my passion for reading. It\u2019s not that much different from the Ancient China\u2019s public test. I guess very soon schools can start locking each one of us up in a room for three days to memorize answers and structures for examination. On top of that, notice how schools treat students with less impressive records than \u2018smart\u2019 ones differently? Grades have become sole proxy of intelligence and talent meanwhile it barely speaks for both. You don't know what the student who failed the other day could become if it weren't for the boring rote learning system that's currently being practiced. You judge him based on his As but who knows he's got real talent those other \u2018smart\u2019 students don't? ",
