            "answer_text": "Being hydrodynamic is just an added bonus to being hairless. That you do not need to be hairless to be hydrodynamic you can see in mammals like the otter and the beaver. Two water living animals that are hairy, and use special hair that does not get soaked. So it would not have been necessary to lose hair to become more hydrodynamic. But the most logical explanation has to do with our long distance running ability and our walking upright. Hair has more functions then just keeping an animal warm. It also protects the skin from attacks or scraping along thorns or sharp objects. It also protects the skin from the sun, reducing the possibility of sunburn or sun stroke. However as humans walk upright we do not need to protect our skin from the sun with hair, we can use pigmentation and at the highest and hottest point of the sun in the sky there is only a small part of our body exposed to the sun and that part is protected by hair. So what may have happened is that hominids who had a mutation causing them to have less hair, were able to walk upright longer and so bring home more food. As this meant they got a better standing in the group, the females wanted to mate with them more often, as the hairless members would be a safer bet that the children would survive. Next being hairless became cultural defined and the hairless hominid was in the lead. Also we have to take into account that we are not structured like cheetahs or other runners in the animal world, like wolfs. We walk upright, sweat easily and have a broad front compared to other animal runners. This broad front makes it easy to catch wind while running, we can even make our own wind by running, which makes for easy evaporation of sweat. So all we have to do while running is sweat and the running wind will cause evaporation and the loss of heat. It may even have been so that we first started to lose hair, before we started running. But as genes do not carry timestamps for when they first came to be and soft tissue is the first to decay after death, all we can do is speculate what was first: hairlessness, sweat glands all over the body, walking upright and running.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s face it. We are not aquatic and do not have to be hydrodynamic. The prevailing theory has to do with heat loss. We are almost a unique animal in being able to run long distances at speed, but that effort creates lots of heat. That\u2019s why we are one of a small number of animals that perspire over essentially our entire body. Fur would prevent this cooling from being efficient. Our skin becomes covered with moisture that is exposed directly to the air. Fur would interfere. Note that the issue is not fur being an insulator as much as it prevents air from getting to the skin to evaporate our perspiration and keep us cool as we run miles. At least, that\u2019s the latest theory that I have read. It is hard to know for sure. We can be rather certain, OTOH, that we did not lose our hair/fur because we discovered clothing. The timeline is way, way off for that nonsensical idea. ",

            "answer_text": "The ones with less fur shed heat better. The same thing was happening with African Wild Dogs, as they are also persistence hunters\u2026. and they lost the insulating layers to shed heat better, to avoid overheating on long distance pursuits. :D The aquatic ape hypothesis is without merit, as it ignores all evidence in conflict with it. So, we definitely took advantage of aquatic resources, just as we still do, and some other primates do too\u2026 but, we are the only furless one. So, surfers get surfer\u2019s ear, yet, they are not \u201caquatic\u201d\u2026. just able to go into the water for short periods of time. Pearl divers can stay submerged for a while, and collect oysters and other sea life, etc\u2026. but, they are no \u201caquatic\u201d either, and so forth. Some primates dive underwater, swim around, and collect submerged food, etc\u2026 but, they are not \u201caquatic\u201d\u2026. and so on and so forth. :D ",

            "answer_text": "I read some years ago a book by Elaine Morgan which explained this theory, that humans had an \u201caquatic\u201d period, some thousands of years ago, where they developed some adaptations to sea environment, and she had some arguments to think about. I remember about the fat layers we have in our bodies, very much alike to animals like seals and sea lions, and the way humans lost their fur and how the hair we still have is very thin and is distributed in a way that follows the same lines water would follow when we swim, making us more hydrodynamic. So, she had some points, but as far as I know, no more evidence has been found to support this idea. On the other hand, the lack of fur as a way to lose heat when doing long running after some preys, when hunting, is a very convenient trait, more if we keep in mind we had already the ability to use other animals skins to cover when weather was cold, and maybe even we had fire to keep us warm. Loosing heat efficiently was so important when hunting it allowed us getting some preys which were faster than us, just because we had this ability to persist when the prey was completely exhausted because of the heat. Unless some new evidence is found in support of Elaine Morgan\u00b4s idea, the heat loosing looks like the probable reason. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. Humans probably lost fur because they didn't need it anymore because we invented clothes. If you want a better aim at aquatic adaptations, our long feet, as in, we don't walk on our toes, like other animals. Our feet are kinda shaped like paddles. Also, our ability to hold our breath underwater. And our pointy nose (compared to other apes). ",

Fire enabled hairless primates to survive. Hairless primates also had another mutation called memory and cognitive processing skill manipulating our environment for survival. Humans were possible due to the lack of Hair 3\u20135 million years ago. Less hair would mean less wet fur so humans did not look green like sloths and orangutans. Less wet fur meant fewer bugs and biting insects. Before fur was ever an issue, we had to give up our gills and webbed appendages. Hydrodynamics, humans are terrestrial mammals, not amphibians. ",
