            "answer_text": "Whenever you hear a conspiracy theory, then always ask yourselves two questions: What would the conspirators gain from the conspiracy? Bear in mind that the potential gains to the conspirators must significantly outweigh the risks, or there is no point going ahead with the conspiracy.How many people would have to be in on the conspiracy for it to be successful? Conspiracies are most likely to remain secret when there are few people involved, and when the conspirators are a homogeneous group with a strong sense of belonging to the group.Scientists are generally truthful people. OK, over the years there have been a few who have been guilty of scientific fraud to further their career, but the nature of science is that it is self-correcting, and when other scientists fail to replicate the falsified results they tend to get found out, and get sacked. Lying is not a good way to progress in science in the medium- to long-term. So what would be the benefit of lying to the scientists that is sufficiently big to overcome the risk to their reputations and careers? For a conspiracy concerning a hot research topic like SARS-CoV-2, a conspiracy would have to include tens of thousands (at least) of scientists around the world. But remember that many scientists are independent thinkers, or they wouldn\u2019t be particularly good at science. And the scientists working on this coronavirus live and work in diverse political systems. Any coronavirus conspiracy would be unmasked almost as soon as it was formed. So my answer is to ask yourself these two questions and see what you think. ",

            "answer_text": "True scientists question everything and seek the truth. Technicians are people who do work in industries where certain skills are required. They are not necessarily scientists because they are not seeking truth, just doing what they are told to do, even if they call themselves scientists. Do scientists lie? Whistle blowers say they do. One scientist says they have to prostitute themselves to obtain funding, which means what\u2014telling the truth? Stefan Lanka offered \u20ac100,000 for any one who could demonstrate that the measles virus existed. Doctor David Bardens attempted to claim the prize after providing the biologist with part studies that had been published in medical journals.[1] Dave Mihalovic reported in January, 2017: In a recent ruling, judges at the German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) confirmed that the measles virus does not exist. Not a single scientist, immunologist, infectious disease specialist or medical doctor has ever been able to establish a scientific foundation, not only for the vaccination of measles but any vaccination for infants, pregnant women, the elderly and even many adult subgroups.[2] From the medical company that specializes in using scientists: Merck was slapped with two separate class action lawsuits contending they lied about the effectiveness of the mumps vaccine in their combination MMR shot, and fabricated efficacy studies to maintain the illusion for the past two decades that the vaccine is highly protective.[3] From the privately run Centers for Disease Control some more fabrication is uncovered as one of the conspirators exposes his involvement: Whistleblower Dr. William Thompson confirmed that \"the CDC knew about the relationship between the age of first MMR vaccine and autism incidence in African-American boys as early as 2003, but chose to cover it up.\" He remarked \"we've missed ten years of research because the CDC is so paralyzed right now by anything related to autism. They're not doing what they should be doing because they're afraid to look for things that might be associated.\" He alleges criminal wrongdoing by his supervisors, and he expressed deep regret about his role in helping the CDC hide data.[4] An appointed medical expert by the court to conduct an examination and oversee trials into the measles virus legitimacy finds evidence of fabrication. The court expert Prof. Podbielski stated on several occasions that by the assertion of the RKI with regard to ribosomes in the measles virus, the thesis of existence of measles virus has been falsified.[5] Scientists are not always truthful. As for covid-19, there have not been any truly legitimate scientific assays completed that have fulfilled the criteria that satisfy the proofs for the existence of the virus. No publication has been reported of any study that fulfills the following criteria: detectionisolationpurificationelectron micrographcharacterizationdouble blind control assayAll that has occurred is that viruses have presumably been identified using polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Claims of isolation are dodgy. Electron micrographs produced are not of purified virions, but culture with other matter. No purification of isolated virions have been performed, therefore no genuine characterization establishing the uniqueness of the virus has occurred. There have been no double blind laboratory assays. Essentially what has been occurring regarding the measles virus has been happening with covid-19. Dave Mihalovic writes: Two recognised laboratories, including the world's largest and leading genetic Institute, arrived at exactly the same results independently. The results prove that the authors of the six publications in the measles virus case were wrong, and as a direct result all measles virologists are still wrong today: They have misinterpreted ordinary constituents of cells as part of the suspected measles virus. From what has been happening regarding measles, we can expect ordinary constituents of cells are being claimed to be covid-19, when in fact they are not. What is to be expected is bacteriophages are being identified as covid-19, not an extraneous virus introduced into the body from bats or any other organism. While some laboratory technicians might believe that they are working according to the requirements of scientific research, the truth is some of their colleagues know that they are not. Unless Koch\u2019s Postulates are adhered to in the establishing of a pathogen, then what is being claimed to be detrimental to health is a faulty diagnosis. When the gold standard is based upon PCR amplification, the results are misleading. Stephen Bustin[6] is a leading expert on PCR and he seeking to establish global protocols for its use. Bustin claims that the PCR can be used to create whatever results desired and the method is a very unreliable diagnostic tool. Yet people are making claims about a virus supposedly detected using PCR, but one that has not been truly proven. Dr Stefan Lanka claims viruses do not exist\u2014and he is not alone\u2014having been a virologist for 20 years, but not being able to detect one genuine virus that was not a bacteriophage. The more I look into the covid-19 debacle, the more I learn that certain agencies are covering up the truth and laboratory technicians are not the scientists that they claim. The ones entrusted with the responsibility of being scientists in the medical industry are doing what ensures they obtain finance and prestige from those who fund operations. Neither does it help the case for scientific honesty, when one knows the truth about HIV/AIDS. Are scientists lying about covid-19? Which scientists are we talking about: the ones profiting from covid-19? Or the ones exposing it as a myth? Personally, I would say the ones who have not fulfilled the six criteria to establish the legitimacy of the virus, may not necessarily being lying, because they are doing what they have been told to do. They might just be ignorant of the Koch's Postulates: Four criteria that were established by Robert Koch to identify the causative agent of a particular disease, these include: the microorganism or other pathogen must be present in all cases of the diseasethe pathogen can be isolated from the diseased host and grown in pure culturethe pathogen from the pure culture must cause the disease when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible laboratory animalthe pathogen must be reisolated from the new host and shown to be the same as the originally inoculated pathogen[7]A number of scientists (technicians) claim that fulfilling Koch\u2019s Postulates is unnecessary. They are either ignorant or deceptively attempting to pull the wool over the eyes of the ignorant. Occam's razor takes the cleanest most definitive route.

            "answer_text": "Are the scientists lying about covid? Yes. Some of them, anyway\u2026 There are two groups involved here, both with some form of scientific credential. First is the much larger group of academics who are warning of how dangerous the virus is, and the overwhelming need to socially distance, wear masks, etc. Those with a PhD specifically in virology, epidemiology, etc will mostly be found in this group and they'll very much still be actively publishing research papers in the field. Second is the smaller group who have some form of political afilliation, to lobby groups, senators, the White House, etc. Most of them will have studied a science at best loosely related to epidemiology and are no longer involved in research. Their careers are often linked to various patrons and what they say publicly. This group is saying that the virus isn't much worse than flu, that it'll go away soon, and anything else that helps the economy and avoids panic prior to the presidential election. Both of these groups can arguably be called \u201cscientists\u201d to some greater or lesser degree, and they're saying opposing things. Therefore, yes, there must be people who call themselves scientists who are lying. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine which group it is, and whether or not they should still be entitled to continue calling themselves by that title. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not that there is no virus, there is, and it is still generally assumed to be about 3 times worse than the seasonal flu, but consider these numbers. Out of the nearly two hundred thousand said to have died in the US, 6 percent died directly from the virus, while the 94 percent had on average 2.4 diseases that were already life threatening such as diabetes, heart disease, etc. If this is true, then why are young healthy people running around so scared. Here a bit of a conspiracy seeps in, and it did not start with the virus but with the anti Trumpers, basically democrats and the media. It is generally known as fear mongering, and it has even recently gone beyond that to complicity of violence as political marcists organizations like BLM are allowed to spread chaos in our streets. Statistics are absolutely clear there is no, none, nada, systemic racism in police departments, one has to be out of touch with reality to believe that nowadays but here we are, Democrats pledging to defund police departments. It is all a bit insane, the conspiracy is more of a immaturity of temper tantrums of a political spectrum that cannot get their way and so they have gone from impeachment based solely upon fabricated documents to promoting and allowing fear to run amok, and anti American groups to destroy lives and businesses. It is also known now that China released this on purpose. Also you are not dealing with scientists, you are dealing with organizations, the world health organization has already shown itself as corrupt, cdc still seems to be protecting our interests abit, and there is big pharma, money makes the world go around, corruption and bias is all over, so we still need to dig for the truth, especially as the media no longer cares to investigate truthfully.

There are a few million scientists; it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to believe that they: 1) could coordinate a falsehood, 2) agree to reiterate the falsehood, 3) fabricate the supporting evidence to sell the falsehood. Doubly so since their professional career is predicated on accuracy and precision, and being in the rare position where you discover something surprising and support it (as debunking a lie would be) is as close as a scientist will get to fame and fortune. Also, scientists produce a lot of information about COVID-19. It is clear that quite a bit is truthful because a lot is used for guidance for public health and medical treatment, and it works. Growth predictions are validated by public health numbers, etc. So, if there is a falsehood, it\u2019s hidden in a lot of accurate and verifiable science. If we presume that not all scientists are lying, and we observe that not all things they say are lies, then we can say that \u201cscientists\u201d are not \u201clying about COVID\u201d. ",

Worldwide economy is going down the toilet, livelihoods lost, kids futures on hold, billions paid out in furlough schemes, University students locked in their dorms, doing 70% of their courses on laptops. An aviation industry almost bankrupt with all other reliant industries to follow like a house of cards. Millions of hospital appointments delayed, people needing operations for other conditions on longer waiting lists. These are not orchestrated or preferred scenarios. They benefit nobody in the long or short run! Who wants to inherit or try to control a broken society on the verge of breakdown? Yes, the initial infection rate projections were incorrect but science is self correcting, it offers the best explanations and solutions it currently can to help solve problems. It makes me chuckle that this is a worldwide crisis, yet the conspiracy claims I read here (they aren't even theories) are completely different than those proposed in my own country! They are so varied and daft. Policital agendas? Seriously? That's how we know these people are parroting dodgy guff from any old shitty conspiratard website claiming to offer the facts.
