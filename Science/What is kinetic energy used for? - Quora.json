            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and can therefore be found in every object that moves. In everyday life, we are surrounded by it: be it people strolling in the streets or bikes riding around the city. Next to the examples provided in the answer below, kinetic energy can also be used to generate electricity \u2013 or rather it can be transformed into electricity.Wind turbines, for instance, use the wind flow, so the kinetic energy in the wind, and transform it into electricity with the help of a generator. There are even floor systems that can convert kinetic energy of people's footsteps to electrical power by means of an electromechanical system:  In the following Quora thread you will find even more answers and examples: How is kinetic energy used?

            "answer_text": "1. When you hit something by hammer, first you move up the hammer to let potential energy be stored in the hammer. Then you let it move done. As it moves down, velocity keeps on increasing and the hammer keeps on gaining kinetic energy. When the hammer hits the object, all the kinetic energy stored in the hammer gets released in he target object. 2. Hitting the cricket ball with a bat with large movement of the bat. 3. During discus throwing, athlete moves the body in circular motion, so that the discus gains kinetic energy, before throwing it. 4. For washing of the cars and vehicles, water jet is used. Kinetic energy stored in the water jet helps removing dirt particles stuck to body of the vehicle. Readers are welcome to add further examples through comments. ",
