            "answer_text": "Scientific Reports is a Nature Publishing Group open access journal intended for publication of technically sound research that doesn't satisfy the criteria for their high impact journals. Therefore you can expect rigorous peer review and that the published articles are of a high quality, but they are not judged on potential impact like the Nature branded journals. However, that said, there are many authors highlighting their Sci Rep papers as high impact simply because it's a NPG journal. It's just that the Sci Rep editors do not use potential impact as a selection criterion. So in a way it's a little bit disingenuous of the authors and their institutions to promote these articles as being impactful. I've read a number of Sci Rep articles that have made it into the popular press and they are definitely not material that you'd expect in a high impact journal, but they look nice and polished and are technically solid. It's pretty much the go to journal if you've been working hard for a year and didn't get that big result you were hoping for, but you want to account for the time spent. The problem that I have with it is that because it's not a high impact journal, but a generalist journal, it's a good place for your work to get lost. There's so many journals, that in any field you tend to have a short list of go to journals where good work is published. Of that list there would be very few generalist journals, selected for their high impact. Sci Rep just doesn't fall into that category. Therefore, as an author you need to spend more time promoting the paper, because otherwise it will go unnoticed and uncited. However, if you want metrics, Sci Rep has an impact factor of 4.525, whereas Nature Communications, a high impact generalist NPG journal has an impact factor of 11.88. Mind you those are both good impact factors. Essentially Sci Rep is a good journal. I've just have always had trouble deciding when it would be appropriate to publish there. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience does not support that Scientific Reports is a good journal. Unfortunately, the paper that I read in Scientific Reports was not of good quality and had numerous flaws. The paper described basic concepts mistakenly. That is probably because the in-house editor who reviewed the paper did not have the specific expertise. It is disappointing that such papers are published in any journal leave alone Scientific Reports. Other open access journals from the NPG publish technically flawless papers although the conclusions can be challenged. Questionable papers are published all the time in many high impact journals including the NPG journals, Translational Science, PNAS etc. I would think twice before considering that all papers published in Scientific Reports could be of good quality.
