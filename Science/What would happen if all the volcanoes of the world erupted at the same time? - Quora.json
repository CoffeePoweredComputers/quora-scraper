            "answer_text": "As has been mentioned in every other answer, this scenario is impossible with the earth processes that we know and understand. Let us therefore make the assumption that some \u2018aliens\u2019 (or evil fairies riding black unicorns - whatever realm of impossibility that you choose to use), has the technology or magic to cause all of the volcanoes on the planet to simultaneously erupt. There are three types of volcano: 1) Extinct; 2) Dormant; 3) Active. For the purpose answering of this question, I will ignore the extinct volcanoes - they do not have any magma left and they do not have any crustal pathways for new magma to get to them; they are effectively just mountains at this stage. The active volcanoes\u2026 Well they are already actively erupting so there wouldn\u2019t be any difference for them. Let us just then discuss the effects of the dormant volcanoes. Dormant volcanoes will still typically have a magma chamber and the \u2018plumbing\u2019 to the source of the magma is present, even if no magma is moving through it. I would expect for this question that it refers only to the magma available for immediate eruption, rather than any refilling of the magma chambers before hand (since that would not necessarily be a fast process, likely taking weeks, if not months, depending on the volcano). Given that the majority of the magma in the magma chamber of a dormant volcano is basically a crystal slush with very little fluid, the eruptions from these volcanoes would be very localised - gas emissions, a small bit of ash, unless you were in the crater at the time it likely wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Of course, some of the dormant volcanoes are also supervolcanoes. Yellowstone is an obvious one that people point to, and while it would be catastrophic, it would not wipe out humanity globally - only locally with regional effects (Since a catastrophic Yellowstone eruption will happen at some point what is the likelihood of anyone surviving?). Other volcanoes capable of supervolcano eruptions (eg, Lake Toba and Taupo Volcano), can have variable eruption sizes and it is all down to how much magma is in the chamber. If the magma chamber does not have much magma in it, then the eruption will be small. So the land-based volcanoes, while they will cause some inconvenience and localised effects, really would not be that bad. But, they are not the only volcanoes. The mid-ocean ridges are basically one large volcanic system whereby new oceanic crust is formed from adiabatic (decompression) melting of the asthenosphere. This does not generate large volumes of magma in any one location, but globally it is responsible for large volumes of magma.  (Image source: Mid-ocean ridge) The effect of a rapid increase in magmatic activity along the mid-ocean ridges would be bad for ocean life. For example, the eruption of the Ontong Java Plateau, which covered roughly 1% of the Earth's surface when it was erupted, is thought to be responsible for an oceanic Anoxic event (the early Aptian anoxic event). The reduction of oxygen in the ocean would lead to massive reductions in sea life, and this would have big influences for the entire food chain. For example, the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, the mechanism for which is still not completely understood, resulted in the extinction of 96% of sea life and 50% of land-based life. There is evidence that the oceans underwent an anoxic event during the Permian-Triassic extinction event (although the cause is unknown, it is suspected that CO2 released by the flood basalts from the eruption of the Siberian Traps were responsible). Basically the global food chain would be disrupted, and this would lead to many deaths. In addition to the effect on the oceans, the outpouring of volcanic gases would result in a reduction of global temperatures. This is has been noted with a number of volcanic eruptions (eg, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo lowered global temperatures by ~0.4C and it took a couple of years for the climate to recover; the Year Without a Summer in 1816 is thought to have been caused by the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora). Eruptions of all of the volcanoes in the world would definitely cause some global cooling. Sunsets would be spectacular for years afterwards due to the particulate matter ejected into the upper atmosphere\u2026 So while the land-based volcanoes would cause local to regional damage, the ocean-based volcanoes would have a global effect. Humans could survive, but it would be a hard world for thousands of years as the climate and oceans recovered. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be nearly impossible for all of the volcanoes on earth to erupt simultaneously. Many volcanoes are extinct, and have been so for so long that we are not aware of them. However, IF they did erupt as well, needless to say, we would be screwed. Since we don\u2019t know where they are, many people would get killed, still feeling shock and confusion that there is a volcano under the neighbor\u2019s house. Another thing\u2014the term \u201call volcanoes\u201d includes supervolcanoes and megavolcanoes. Everyone knows supervolcanoes\u2014Yellowstone, La Garita, Long Valley, and Valles in the western US, Aso, Aira and Kikai in Japan, Tabo and Tambora in Indonesia, Taupo and Macauley Island in New Zealand plus another one off the coast that we only just learned of, Campi Flegrei in Italy, Cerro Gal\u00e1n in Argentina, Altiplano-Puna in Argentina and Bolivia, Atana Ignimbrite in Chile, Cerro Guacha and Pastos Grandes in Bolivia, Kurile Lake and Karymshina in Kamchatka in Russia, Bennett Lake in Canada, and Baekdu Mountain in North Korea and China have all had supereruptions that we know of (though Baekdu Mountain, Tambora, Aso, and Kikai aren\u2019t considered supervolcanoes), several of which have the capability to wipe out humans\u2014we know that Taupo nearly did, about 27,000 years ago. Even without the rest of the volcanoes, the ash and gas in the air would be so thick that all plants would quickly die, and all animals would choke to death or just drop dead from the gas. Even life in the oceans wouldn\u2019t be safe. Also, there are the megavolcanoes\u2014there is two colossal blobs of superheated rock called thermochemical piles in the upper mantle under Africa and under the Pacific\u2014and they are bigger than some of the continents. The African one stretches east and west of Africa without reaching the north or south and has a tiny outlet\u2014the Reunion Island volcano in the far east\u2014and the Pacific blob is slightly smaller. We think that they are being fed by About 65 million years ago, one was under India and possibly helped to wipe out the dinosaurs\u2014the Deccan Traps. The sulphuric acid and ash released into the atmosphere would have wiped out most of them, while some in India would have been killed by the colossal amount of lava ejected. If those two alone erupted, we\u2019d be screwed. If just a couple of the supervolcanoes erupted, we\u2019d be screwed. If it was just regular volcanoes\u2014well, Lakag\u00edgar killed over 6 million worldwide in 1783, and caused ice to form on the Gulf of Mexico in June. Several regular volcanoes, including Lakag\u00edgar, Pinatubo, and Mt St Helens, not to mention Krakatau, have caused nuclear winters. If they all erupted simultaneously, we\u2019d all die.

            "answer_text": "Oh boy. That would be problematic for most life forms bigger than a water bear to say the least. Side note I imagine Iceland would be having one hell of a time since they have ~196 volcanoes. I imagine that would be a very busy day for their volcanology department. In addition to all the havoc that your run of the mill volcanoes would cause on the surrounding populations, you've also got to take supervolcanoes into account. How explosive a volcano is is measured on the volcano explosivity index (VEI). The closer to 8 that a volcano is to 8 the more literal hellfire it's going to bring. Supervolcanoes are volcanoes with a VEI of 7\u20138 and they're going to cause the biggest problems if all volcanoes spontaneously erupt. A single supervolcanic eruption would be catastophic to say the least, but all supervolcaneos erupting all at once? oh boy. In just one supervolcanic eruption the quantity of material that will be exploded out of the volcano will be enormous. A greater problem than just the magma however will be the ash. I imagine that if all supervolcanoes and every other volcano were to erupt, the atmosphere would be absolutely filled with ash blocking out almost all sunlight. The sheer amount of ash released would likely cause global cooling for decades. The lack of sunlight will cause crops to die in huge numbers likely resulting in widespread famine in the remaining population that wasn't killed in the eruptions. There's a chance humanity may not be wiped out entirely, but it would likely wipe out most of the population either from the eruption, the health complications from the ash, or by famine. It wouldn't be pleasant that's for sure. ",

But IF it did, then we\u2019d be in a world of trouble - I don\u2019t think humans would be COMPLETELY wiped out - we are pretty widespread around the world, after all, and volcanoes aren\u2019t evenly distributed - but almost certainly large numbers - probably a majority- of human beings would die either due to the volcanic eruptions themselves, or as a result of the severe climatic changes and atmospheric pollution that would persist for several years afterward. Many other species would either be wiped out, or would be damaged severely. It would be years - or centuries - before humans would recover civilization, and the relative population of animal and plant species would probably be permanently altered. ",

Each volcano is going to do that in its own time \u2014 which is not to say that several volcanoes can\u2019t erupt at roughly the same time. The ash they blast into the atmosphere disrupts air traffic and can cause global cooling. If enough volcanoes erupted explosively, local climates would be affected for sure and global climate possibly would be too. So, the \u201call at once\u201d scenario is unlikely, but \u2014 to quote Live Science: \u201cAt the end of the Permian, the Siberian Traps underwent massive volcanic eruptions.\u201d Pangea was rifting, and there was a lot of volcanic activity driving the break-up.

Volcanoes erupt when the pressure in the magma chamber exceeds the weight of the plug. These are very slow, occasional, events. Relieving the pressure in one place makes adjacent eruptions less likely. There is no plausible mechanism where every flue would open all at once. If it were to happen, the skies would darken with ash, temperatures plummet, rivers block and re-route, the pH of the oceans change. Plants would die and animals starve. Mass extinction would be followed by the planet's normal response: the long slow climb back to a flourishing ecosystem. Something like this happened in the Cenezoic era, around 65 million years ago. It went on for a while, and nothing like all the volcanoes at once. ",

Then the people who survived would have to face another problem.  The volcanic dust and gas would block the Sun for quite long. Long enough for the plants to die. Food shortage will be there and without food, the future of humanity looks bleak.  But the possibility of this happening is almost nil. Until the geodynamic system of the earth changes radically there are no chances of this happening. So rest assured :) ",

It\u2019s more useful to calculate the possible effects of something that actually could happen, like Yellowstone National Park erupting. Nearly the entire park sits atop a system of magma chambers with a humongous caldera. When that erupts again, it could wipe out industrial civilization. At minimum, it would kill tens of thousands of people and cause hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars in damage. I think it\u2019s probably a good idea to know as much as possible about that one volcano. ",

            "answer_text": "RE: What would happen if every volcano on Earth were to erupt tomorrow? Zach Rhodes answer is essentially correct, but I have my doubts about people surviving in bunkers. Those bunkers would already have to exist since you are giving us no time to prepare in your question. But would any existing survival facility be prepared to outlast a decades-long volcanic winter which would start almost without warning, followed by a mini-ice-age? Initially I thought not, but then it occurred to me that there would be millions and millions of people who wouldn\u2019t die immediately but who would die after the volcanic winter had set in and, as such, they would be frozen and therefore remain edible for a long time. So it might just be possible for people emerging from a bunker years later to find something \u2014 excuse me \u2014 someone to eat. And if they could hold out long enough munching on frozen people then they might be able to piece together a society around a nuclear reactor somewhere and get things going again. Don\u2019t forget that some our ancestors DID survive the Toba eruption 75,000 years ago. (And they probably had to eat some people who were not our ancestors.) Toba was \u201conly\u201d one supervolcano, but our ancestors had no high tech stuff to help them survive, so maybe humanity could survive every volcano going off at once tomorrow given that we have that high tech help and know a lot more.
