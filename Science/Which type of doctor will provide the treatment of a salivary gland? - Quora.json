            "answer_text": "There are 3 pairs of salivary gland: sub-maxillary, sub-lingual and sub-mandibular. These glands can get different types of ailments and hence the doctors that treat them vary accordingly. All of you must have received vaccinations against mumps which is a viral disease affecting the salivary glands. Mostly the submaxillary glands gets affected while in a few the sub-mandibular salivary glands are affected. A general physician with an MBBS qualification can treat this condition. I have. Acute bacterial infections of the sub-maxillary glands [parotitis] that cannot be managed by antibiotics require the services of a general surgeon for drainage of the pus. Chronic infections of the parotid glands are dealt with by ENT surgeons or maxillo-facial surgeons [dentists]. Auto-immune diseases of the salivary glands would require the services of a rheumatologist. Malignant tumors [cancer] of the salivary glands would necessitate appointments with surgeons and radiologists. Your general physician will be in a better position to guide and walk you through this problem and know to whom you should be referred to when required. Regards and take care Dr. Somanna ",

            "answer_text": "Usually an ENT surgeon will be the first one to see you and based on his examination he may treat you himself or refer you to the concerned specialist if the diagnosis needs one. Rarely you may be referred to General Surgeon, Oral Maxillo-facial Surgeon (OMFS) or even sometimes a Rheumatologist ( for some auto-immune diseases of the salivary gland ). ",
