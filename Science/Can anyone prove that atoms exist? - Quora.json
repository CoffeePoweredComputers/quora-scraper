            "answer_text": "Technically, atoms do not exist at all. They are a useful MODEL that we use to describe mass-matter. Atoms exist \u201con paper\u201d. Every atom in the Universe has the same basic composition (on paper). The construct of atoms differs from model to model. The most common model is one where protons and neutrons are compactly and tightly crammed in the core of the atom (called the nucleus) and electrons orbit said nucleus. A second model that is preferred by Quantum Physicists, is the one in which the three particles are waves. Matter waves to be exact. Electrons are not particles in this model. They are, rather, standing waves with an integer number of wavelengths that enclose the so-called spherical shell of the orbit. Ditto for the protons and neutrons; for they too are considered to be matter-waves. A third model is akin to the second, but it takes it one further step: each nucleon (particles that exist in the nucleus) us made of three \u201cquarks\u201d which are vibrating strings. It is unfortunate that when we speak of atoms, we totally forget, or ignore, the concept of Fundamental Quantities (FQ). There are SEVEN FQ in our Universe. The top four are: 1) Space (as in \u201cdistance\u201d); 2) Time; 3) Matter (mass and/or energy); 4) Charge. A FQ is a quantity that CANNOT be defined but it can be MEASURED. The particles mentioned above have FQ as their properties. Since we cannot define FQ, it follows that we cannot define these particles, and hence, we cannot say how atoms exist because they contain matter with properties unknown to us. The electrons, protons and quarks have FQ of mass/energy and charge and they have properties of speed, hence they have the FQ of Space and Time. Even neutrons, that are technically neutral in charge, can be considered to have charge, because they are believed to be made of quarks. The quarks that make up a neutron do have charge. It so happens that their charge adds up to zero. Since our models of atoms are constructs of matter that are basically FQ, we can say that we really cannot say that atoms exist. Conclusion: atoms exist only \u201con paper\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "It makes more sense if you were to continually cut something in half, you\u2019d never be able to stop. You should ask yourself: why should that make sense? And how did you determine that should make \u201cmore sense\u201d than something else? Like, how did you weigh the amount of sense each of these two ideas makes? This isn\u2019t an insult. Those are real questions! So, we came up with experiments to determine how the universe behaves; which actually makes \u201cmore sense\u201d. And for the purposes of this discussion, scientific observation says that atoms make \u201cmore sense\u201d. They make so much sense\u2026 we can draw pictures with them.  But why can\u2019t you keep dividing? Why is there a limit?  Well, let\u2019s take a detour. Suppose you\u2019re traveling at 1 meter per second. You should be able to keep doubling your speed, right? It makes no sense that there should be any speed limit. So just keep doubling it! Except, our scientific observations show that there is a speed limit. So, it certainly does \u201cmake sense\u201d; that\u2019s what\u2019s real. Our previous understanding of how things \u201cshould work\u201d was faulty. It\u2019s very similar. It sounds \u201csimple\u201d that you should just be able to keep cutting matter apart into infinitely smaller halves. Except, no. You can\u2019t. That\u2019s just how it is.  Now, your question asks \u201chow do atoms exist\u201d? That can be answered at different levels of complexity. Judging from the question, I think you\u2019re looking for a \u201cbig picture\u201d question of HOW. Simple answer: we don\u2019t know how. \u2026 Okay, okay. We do know how. See, atoms are not the smallest things in the universe. There are sub-atomic particles: for examples, protons, electrons, and neutrons. And we have a very decent theory for describing how those particles combine into atoms. (And then very interestingly, we know that both protons and neutrons can be divided further into \u201cthirds\u201d\u2026 but electrons cannot be divided further!) So, I think you\u2019re really asking, \u201cWhy atoms?\u201d And again, you can answer that at different levels of complexity. But I think a few different big-picture answers are most appropriate: So, why not atoms? Which isn\u2019t really an answer. And yet, this is the only answer we can really answer. Tell me how you think things work, and I\u2019ll try to tell you why it doesn\u2019t work that way. No matter how much we do this and I answer \u201cwhy not\u201d, I can\u2019t seem to ever tell you a positive \u201cwhy\u201d.Science isn\u2019t very good at answering some kinds of \u201cwhy\u201d questions. We can tell you what is or by what process something follows. But there is no more fundamental answer about preference\u2014except to look for deeper theories.Now let\u2019s have a little thought experiment. If you could continually cut something in half and \u201cyou\u2019d never be able to stop\u201d, that suggests that the finite size of an atom can be divided into an infinite amount of stuff. This raises\u2026 difficult questions.One thing we often observe is summed up in a common saying: \u201cNature abhors infinities.\u201d This isn\u2019t technically or mathematically true, but expresses a rather deep idea. There is a very large difference (heh) between mind-bendingly large numbers\u2026 and infinity.Someone once joked that time exists so everything doesn\u2019t happen all at once. And likewise, that space exists so that everything does have to happen at the same place. These are very simplistic statements, but can you accept that as making logical sense?Well, I think it\u2019s simplest to say that the existence of atoms guarantees that everything doesn\u2019t happen at one time, and one place.Or\u2026 from a different perspective, that what we perceive as atoms are the happening of everything not happening in one place, at one time. \u2026 According to some rather simple rules we have observed about how the universe operates.And so why? Hmm. Well, I do suppose the universe would be rather dull if everything happened all at once, at only one place. When you get into these deep questions, it\u2019s best to have a bit of a sense of humor about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Chemists in the 18th and 19th century had collected a lot of data about how elements and compounds interacted. The best explanation that they had for their observations was that the smallest unit of an element was a single particle (an \u201catom\u201d), and compounds were formed by small collections of these elemental particles. Hydrogen gas was made of two particles of hydrogen; carbon dioxide had two particles of oxygen and one particle of carbon; baking soda has one particle of hydrogen, one of sodium, one of carbon, and three of oxygen, etc. So the idea that many had was the \u201catomic theory\u201d, that matter was made of atoms that were too small to see and were indivisible. Each element had a different type of atom, and compounds are made by atoms interacting. The rules for how atoms interacted were mostly known. But some didn\u2019t fully accept the atomic theory. The main problem was a lack of corroborating evidence for these particles that were too small to see. It explained things like how chemistry worked, but maybe it was all an accounting trick, and the actual atoms didn\u2019t really exist. Two things changed that. The first was in 1827 when Robert Brown looked at pollen through a microscope. It was floating in water, but it was dancing around, not staying put. The pollen grains would jiggle and jounce, apparently randomly, for no visible reason. Brown wrote up these observations, and the weird motion was studied with no explanation for the motion, for the rest of the century. The second was in 1905, when Albert Einstein wrote a paper that explained the Brownian motion using the atomic theory and statistical mechanics. The motion of the pollen grains was exactly what you would expect if the pollen was being randomly hit from all sides by fast-moving, small particles. By studying the statistics of the random motion (how far the grains would move in a straight line before being hit enough to change it\u2019s direction or speed, how fast the grains would move along its path, the average distance the grains would go over time, etc), Einstein was able to calculate the size and momentum of the small particles that were pushing the grains around. It was a close match to what the atomic theory said had to be the case for atoms and molecules. After Einstein\u2019s paper, the opposition to the atomic theory fell greatly, and it quickly became the scientific consensus. There were other experiments which cemented the issue, as well. ",

Tops and bottoms of spheres were to represent polarity, pink positive, blue negative.)  (Proton heart, shown without the outer shells. Blue is subspace field, red is n-space field, pink cone is inter dimensional energy transfer cone, black line under the blue toroid is subspace barrier.)  (Electron, large blue toroidal is n-space field, red subspace field is obscured by the blue toroid, square plane above tiny red, bottom toroid is subspace/n-space boundary. )  (Neutron heart, minus outer n-space field toroidal shells. Green ring is gravity ring formed by subspace bonding of both subspace fields of electron and proton. You can see a few more isotopes and pics of these on my imgur account gristlevonraben.) If you mean matter in general, there is no answer as to why; whether a hologram or not, that the basic levels of matter and existence are real is all that we will ever know, how and why, will always be a mystery. But, if you are asking how they are held together, my current theory is this: electrons and protons are polar, and attract each other. But they contain a repellant shell of tiny particles, this is how hydrogen atoms can exist and not be close enough to form a neutron. Under great pressure, a hydrogen atom loses those shells that keep electrons and protons apart, and so the two parts bond in subspace. When they bond, they reform their protective shell. The electron half can still attract other protons from its other pole. But the proton half is too weak to attract other electrons, instead, it is attracted to the electron in nearby neutrons. Also, based on my theory, a neutron puts quite a bit of its mass in subspace, and creates a tiny gravity ring around it. This gravity ring is attracted to other gravity rings in other neutrons. Basically, neutrons hold an atom together with their gravity rings. If pressure is put on a neutron, its gravity ring expands. The more pressure and the more neutrons, the more the gravity ring system grows. In a planet and star, a dense core can have an enormous gravity ring! The pressure is pushed into subspace parts of the neutron, it is 20 billion times smaller in area, in this subspace, but also 20 billion times closer together, and closer to other subspace roots of other particles, this is where gravity exists, moving at near the speed of light down in subspace, but seen as 20 billion times the speed of light in normal space, even though in reality it is only moving near the speed of light. Atoms are held together through gravity rings around neutrons, unless there is one or zero neutrons, in which case, the atomic core bond is nearly chemical in fashion, being mostly a valence bond. You can find a video on my theory at youtube, under gristlevonraben. ",

(Source 1) For some people, the simple (well, not-so-simple) invention of the atomic bomb is more than enough proof that atoms exist. (Source 2) Furthermore, scientists can even prove the existence of some even smaller particles, which make up the atom. Some of these particles are known as the \"lepton\" family: the electron, neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau, and tau neutrino. (Sources 3) Another likewise smaller particle is known as the \"hadron\" family, starting with what is most likely familiar to you: protons, neutrons, anti-protons, lambda, and omega (Source 4) Even more, scientists can prove some of and others they cannot prove, of the following theoretical particles known as \"quarks\" (these particles are what make up the \"hadrons\" [like a proton or neutron]): (in order of size, the largest first): up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom. (Sources 5) The \"charm\" and the \"strange\" quarks are not yet proven, but the other quarks are proven. (Source 6) There are a large number of other very small particles, especially according to a theory called the \"String Theory\", but most of them were \"invented\" to help solve equations, but are actually believed to exist even though current technology does not allow these extremely small particles to be seen. (Source 7) Some of the smallest particles do not actually exist on Earth except when created by what is called a \"particle accelerator\" (which speeds individual particles towards each other, sometimes as fast as close to light speed, and 'steer' them to collide into each other to break them apart and sometimes create new particles.

            "answer_text": "Good question but indeed it seems like you wanna point at something else anyways am just gonna answer this question In most of the answers you can see an explanation like how is the structure of atom, its properties, etc. But the reality is a bit different So we are talking about atoms, right? It refers to micro world. It means here we can apply quantum mechanics. The question \u201chow do you know that atoms exists?\u201d comes from \u201cwhat will be the smallest particle you get by dividing any object unceasingly?\u201d Previously its was thought that atoms are one of elementary particles which are indivisible i.e, they are the smallest but later on subatomic particles were discovered(proton, electron and neutron) but now here is string theory which states that every single object in this universe is made of ridiculously tiny strings and if something is even smaller than that, it is yet to be discover. Atoms are also a part of this universe so they also interact with three of the four forces of universe (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong interaction and weak interaction). There structure is based on electromagnetic force, strong interaction and weak interaction Atoms consist of nucleus (proton+neutron) and electon.  (But this model doesn't represents an atom completely I will discuss about that later) Electrons are negetively charged particles which are hold by positively charged protons in the nucleus by electromagnetic force [note:neutrons are neutrally charged particles which means they posses neither negative(-) nor positive(+) so they don't contribute anything in attracting electrons]. As it is easy to make out cause we know that in a magnet unlike charges attract each other(for example north pole attracts south pole). So the number of electrons can be placed in an atom fully depends on the number of protons in nucleus (not neutrons). But the mystery why electrons don't approach the nucleus is like \u201cwhy planets don't approach their stars?\u201d. It had been theorized that electrons unlike other objects in the macroworld don't ceases to be in their ground state (they always posses at least a tiny amount of energy). Take it simply, usually if you lift an object from ground to a certain height (here the energy potential energy) and release it then it will simply smash into the ground (the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and after reaching to ground it loses energy in form of sound, heat and a really tiny amount of light) hence it tends to be in lowest energy level as possible but electrons in the micro world don't do the same they like to harness at least a tiny amount of energy and so wins in keeping distance from nucleus by surpassing electromagnetic force (but not too much or it will be kicked out of the atom) Now the next stop is nucleus, but there seems a problem according to electromagnetic force like charges must repel(\u2018+\u2019 must repel \u2018+\u2019) but here we can see protons lying tightly held. Here we can blame strong interaction which acts between considerably small distances and is the strongest of all the four forces of the universe. Atoms of different elements forms in the core of a star by a process called nuclear fission where atoms come to close to each other that it surpasses the electromagnetic force and collides two positive nucleus into one But the mass of nucleus is roughly more than double than the sum of the mass of all electrons. This is because of neutrons. But, how can we know that how much neutron must be there? Generally neutrons are double in number as compared to protons [note:as the atom contains equal number of protons and electrons it is considered as a whole to be neutral]. But if they are forming by colliding two nucleus into one then here questions may arise \u201cwhy all atoms of a specific element contains even/certain number of protons and neutrons?\u201d Here you can blame another force called weak interaction which has the power to turn neutrons into protons or vise versa. We call this process beta decay. But, here is a more realistic structure of atom  Indeed this has to do nothing to your question. If you still wanna know about it just comment down below ",

            "answer_text": "If i explain it .it will take more time.I am telling in short First you should aware what is atom? Then we will come to your question. What is an atom? \u2013 an atom is the smallest possible amount associated with a chemical element. For example, an atom of gold can be called as the smallest quantity of gold you can feasibly have. The word \u2018small\u2019 literally points out to nanoscopically tiny! An atom is thousands of times smaller than a human hair.  Hence, there is no chance you can see one without the help of a supremely powerful electron microscope. If you rip apart a variety of things, it would be revealed that all matter present around us is formed from different types of atoms. For example, living things are usually made from atoms hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. It is vital to note that, these are only three of the 100 chemical elements which have been discovered by scientists. You can virtually think of making anything by joining atoms from different elements similar to LEGO blocks. Parts of An Atom Atoms hold three different subatomic particles present inside them; namely, protons, electrons, and neutrons. The neutrons and protons are wrapped together in the center of an atom. This region is called as the nucleus. On the other hand, the electrons that are quite smaller, speed around the outside. Whenever people draw structures of atoms, it is shown that electrons spin in orbits around the nucleus. To be precise, electrons move quickly that you\u2019ll never know where there are at different moments in time. If you are now familiar with \u2018What is an Atom?\u2019, then learning about associated concepts such as atomic number and atomic mass would enlighten you further. Do make a note that, the number of protons and electrons in an atom stays the same. Furthermore, the number of neutrons is almost the same to the number of protons, however, this situation stays slightly rare.The number of protons present in an atom leads to the term atomic number. An atomic number 1 points out that the atom is hydrogen. Similarly, an atomic number 2 reveals helium atom.The total number of neutrons and protons, when added together, gives us the relative atomic mass. For example, hydrogen holds a relative atomic mass of 1, whereas helium has a relative atomic mass 4. To state this in a precise manner, we can say that a helium atom is four times denser as than hydrogen atom.Finally we can answer your questionHow To Know If Atoms Exist? If we cannot see atoms, then how\u2019d we know it actually exists? Science is known to offer pieces of evidence for each of its concepts. Hence, the evidence to prove atoms really exist is offered in a variety of forms. Scientists have actively split big atoms into smaller versions. Based on a very popular series of experiments from the early 20th century, Ernest Rutherford led the team which fired particles towards atoms and observed them carefully. It revealed how orbits were arranged in the interior of a typical atom. Furthermore, some substances are known to be radioactive; that is, they naturally fragment into simpler substances and emit tiny particles in the process. Once again, all of this makes sense when atoms exist and they are made from smaller particles. In addition, there are numerous shreds of evidence to prove the presence of electron particles. Their contribution to power things like magnetism and electricity is quite renowned ",

As a number of people smarter than me have mentioned in other threads, science doesn't prove things; it observes phenomena, models them, and uses models to predict phenomena. Very powerful, but not proof of anything. In a more practical vein ... if you look at all the various phenomena that led to modern atomic theory, by far the simplest way to model them is to assume that atoms exist. If you come up with a better model, it'll rock the scientific world. But I'm not holding my breath. ",

            "answer_text": "How do atoms exist? It makes more sense if you were to continually cut something in half, you\u2019d never be able to stop. Well, when you get down to a certain point, you are not actually cutting something in half anymore. That only works when things are completely homogeneous. For example, if you have a house, you can tell its a house, it has a roof, floors, wall, doors and windows, etc. If you cut it in half, you can tell you have two half houses, but, not two houses. If you take one half a house, and cut it again, you have a quarter house, and so forth. At some point you get down to a brick over there, a piece of wood over here, a pane of glass, some mortar, a nail, a screw, etc\u2026 but, none of those things is \u201ca house\u201d. So, an atom of hydrogen for example, is just a proton and an electron\u2026 and, if you break it, there\u2019s no \u201chalf\u201d, as one part is a tiny electron and one part is a much much larger proton\u2026 \u2026 so, you get an electron, which is not hydrogen any more, and a proton, which is not hydrogen anymore. So, we CAN\u2019T break the electron down further, as it an elementary particle\u2026 we know of no \u201cparts\u201d for it. We CAN break down a proton, into 2 up quarks (u), and 1 down quark (d)\u2026 but, can\u2019t break THOSE down any further, as quarks are also elementary particles. So, yes, if things were 100% homogeneous, and, you were to keeping cutting them in half, you could just keep going, until perhaps a Planck length or so. :D ",

It is indeed true that they are too small to see even with the best optical instruments or to be felt or sensed in any corporeal form. But many things exist like that. The wind or air, for example, was thought to be an immaterial thing. Indirect observations proved otherwise. We see the effects of atoms but more importantly, we are able to predict their behavior and those effects. If you can do this successfully, then you know a great deal about your subject. I don't think you'd disagree that if I knew everything you were about to do or think, that I know a whole lot about you. A lot of precise (emphasis necessary) science rides on the existence and our model of atoms. The amount of trust you should give that model is about as much as you should trust our model of gravity or motion. Perhaps the most compelling evidence though is seeing them through electron tunneling microscopes and the fact that we piece together molecules and synthesize chemicals all the time all over the world. If our model didn't work... then why is all that working? ",

Einstein, 100 years later, looked at the phenomena we called Brownian Motion and mathematically analyzed it. From this analysis an experiment was performed and we were able to show the mass of smallest units of the formulations from 100 years earlier. The mass of atoms in each element were derived by experimental observations. This proved that atoms existed. This books explains the whole process: Jean Perrin and the triumph of the atomic doctrine.

What then, if the constituent particles are point particles is an atom? Your question has a very deep philosophical aspect.  What we can say for sure is that our atomic model of the world yields excellent prediction of how nature behaves. We can say the model exists and we can say it is very good. Using the model we can make engineer steel, flashlights, rockets, shoes, drugs, etc. I personally prefer to leave the question of existence to philosophers and am content with our model of nature including the model of atoms. When we say that we can see atoms through the scanning tunneling microscope, we really state that we use the effect of quantum tunneling to record an image on a computer screen whose photons our eyes can detect and our brain interprets as a picture that then the brain labels to be an atom. Does it mean the atom exist? It is a question for philosophers. ",

Some would pass straight through the spaces between atoms but some would bounce of the atoms. The pattern of some passing through and some bouncing off was observed, indicating that there was something to the theory. Had nothing passed through or had nothing been scattered the theory would have been disproved, perhaps proving that atoms did not exist, but the theory survived the test. Strictly speaking, it is not possible to prove atoms exist, but it is possible to predict what would happen if atoms do not exist (there would be no scattering or no pass-through). The theory that atoms do not exist was disproved, leaving the theory that atoms actually do exist.

I'll try all possibilities though, Most of the time, they exist in the form of Compounds. Every atom has a tendency to have a particular set of electrons, for stability purposes, and when they can't make it on their own, they search for others in hope to have collaboration, and get the required configuration. This results in formation of compounds.Some are born to be single. These atoms do have that particular set of electrons, that's why they don't need anyone, and live their life alone, forever! We call them noble elements.You can't talk about their phase, because phase is a macroscopic property which itself is the result of kind of collaborations atoms have. If they know each other very well, they'll bond up too strong that we name them as solids. And likewise other phases.Yes, they do exist as particle and wave, both! They are small enough to exhibit properties of both particles and waves.And the one and only, Hydrogen . It is the only element that is betrayed a lot. I mean, a plenty of times. It has no life, no parents, no wife, nothing! I mean he's like dhobi ka kutta na ghar ka na ghaat ka.

            "answer_text": "Can you effectively cut water in a glass in half with a knife? The issue here is that the smaller the things get the less tangible they become in nature. Subatomic particles really more resemble \u201cforcefields\u201d than anything else. Furthermore, these particles can lack a precise location at any given time and essentially exist in many locations at the same time. So, if something has such properties it would be rather challenging to \u201ccut\u201d it, if at all. It stands to reason that something which you are trying to cut should be thicker than the knife\u2019s edge. Now, atoms themselves exhibit forces which make these \u201cforcefields\u201d of subatomic particles stick together. And such forces can be overcome causing the atom to split up. That primarily is done by imparting great energies to the atom via shooting it with some particle making it unstable and causing it to break, rather than it being \u201ccut\u201d. So, it is more of a kick than a cut. But imparting such forces to subatomic particles becomes tricky. Just like it might be tricky to hit a golf ball with a 747 airplane. The things which we can effectively use to impart this energy become much bigger than the target, making it impossible to hit. And even if hit it would probably bounce off rather than break apart. ",
