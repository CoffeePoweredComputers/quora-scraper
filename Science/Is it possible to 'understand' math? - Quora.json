            "answer_text": "I just finished breathing in your question: is it possible to understand math? Allow me to breath out the answer I'm about to give. I should first of all start by saying that \"I'm not a math major nor some 'mathematical  genius' who has a high order ability to generate complex math solutions to every math problem.\" Math can be learnt, understood and applied as much as any other subject. You're failing to grasp math not because you're intellectually weak but because you're thinking math is \"impossible\" to grasp...it is a perceived reality. I'm a metallurgical engeering student at a university \u2014 and trust me, we use math much more than any other related subject area. There're many students in my class who really hate math; they regard it as a \"burden\" \u2014 an outright \"irrelevant\" subject. Many people hate math; many people think math can't be learnt or understood. There's a perceptive notion that \"math is too 'difficult'...and is meant to be tackled by 'gifted minds'.\" Of course \"you live the reality you perceive\"...if you think you're the \"fastest reader\" on earth, you'll surely act like it or at least try to. To tell why I'm qualified to answer this question, I'll confess in retrospection that I had this delusional belief just like most people that \"math is utterly impossible and useless.\" As a child, I had an enormous capacity and talent for reading and understanding; I had an intense interest in \"art\" (especially drawing). I would spend most of my time reading voraciously and sometimes drawing to sate my ever blazing curiosity to know. I wanted to turn into a \"knowledge archive\" that hands out any desired information at any instance of request \u2014 and to attain a somewhat \"omniscient\" awareness. I lived like a \"reading machine\"...in a self-created world/reality built entirely without math but only with \"words\", \"artistic imaginings\" and \"fictional parallels\". For me, math was nonexistent; my reality was my own: I needed no one to tell me what is interesting and what is not. I was never bored. My plight in math started to manifest when I went to my junior high school: I would barely sit down to learn math. I scored highly on other subjects that required comprehensive reading. I even hated math more when it degraded my impressive results. The more I avoided learning it, the badly I performed. It was later when I realized I had built an incomplete world; a world without without a mathematical structure. I was suddenly seized by a desire \u2014 a will \u2014 to rebuild my world again; I re-evolved to become mathematically-obsessed. I turned my reasoning faculties \u2014 those which I formerly wholly devoted to story-thinking and artististic daydreaming...in a new-found mathematical path. I realized that I could understand and reason with math...and that...I had consciously chosen not to learn or understand it. I began to excel equally well in math as any other subject I already had an acuity for. I'm telling you all this...not to impress you but to inspire and inform you. It is true some people show remarkableness in learning certain things \u2014 this doesn't logically imply that you have to be born a \"prodigy\" in a field before you become an expert. Don't regard math as a humdrum subject beyond comprehension...rather, practice it like a career. You need not be able to visualize graphs before you can draw them; do your reasoning in a systematic fashion. Take an area in math you're interested in and start your swotting thereof...solve all the problems that you stumble upon on your \"mathematical journey\". You'll realize that by starting with what you're interested in, your passion will expand and turn into an intense curiosity to swim deep into the unexplored areas.  An important point of note is that, it isn't the method of learning that matters (nobody cares), it is what you do with or what you're able to do with what you learn that matters most. People are best impressed by your \"outputs\" not your \"inputs\". Enjoy this journey... and I hope this answer really helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "I never remembered much at all in anything. I liked math partially because I was born very weak without being able to run a little fast and without good memory when I was a young kid.   So, I somehow built my very patience but keep doing something long and long time, often forgot many other stuffs. I was beaten by my harsh mother because of this. But, I managed to grow up and had a very good foundation in reading and math before and when I went to grade school. People mistakenly thought I was a genius.  I remember everything without memorizing at all, if only I paid an attention in studying the materials. For example, if anyone asked like on this site a question from Calculus, I do not need even thinking to give a rough idea how to deal with it, after more than 30 years. I never reread or redo those problems after I did in college, I do not need a book at all to give a lecture in Calculus or some other subjects as long as I had been studying it with my concentration.  I do not remember anything, I never tried to remember, but, the question would caught my eyes and reminds me right away in what to do in dealing with the problem. I still do not have the best memory, comparing to other people, partially due to my physical condition nobody else may notice, but I can feel; though I can do everything as long I am given enough time. Then, I may be able to give a lecture without looking at the book at all, even on a new subject, if only the material is accessible to me from my past experience. Concentration, motivation, patience, and practice  is (is: not a typo)  the trick. You would be able to do math like an athlete playing in the field, you do it without much thinking at all, as it becomes a part of you.   That is why I answered so many questions in a very short time, as well as because I typed also very fast. I was slow and actually very slow when I was a kid, but I learned to be quick for everything after then by practicing as much as my effort as the task needs. I learned the lesson that you can do it very well as long as you want to do so, and you can do very well if only you try to learn it very well without worrying about test or anything else not important. Then, you would be surprised to find out how much energy you have and how well you can in doing everything. TRUST ME, there is no genius in this world.  Let me tell you one secret between my son and me. I set a rule for him, he can play anything or fool himself the day before the test or anything like it, but he is not allowed to review math or read anything for any test!  WHY? You figure.  ",
