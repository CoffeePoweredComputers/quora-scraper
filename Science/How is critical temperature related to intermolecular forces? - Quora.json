            "answer_text": "Critical temperature is the temperature above which a gas can\u2019t be liquified. Now, by this hypothesis we mean that molecules of the gas come closer to each other and thus molecules attract towards each other.  So, more the magnitude of intermolecular force more will be the tendency of a gas to easily liquify and the critical temperature will substantially increase. Hope your doubt is clear. Feel free to comment back, suggestions are always invited. ",
