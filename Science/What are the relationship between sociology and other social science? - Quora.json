Sociology's subject matter is diverse, ranging from crime to religion, the family to the state, the divisions of race and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture, and from social stability to radical change in whole societies and the environment and the juxtaposition of humanity on the environment and\u2014plants, animals and all living things. Sociology provides a distinctive and enlightening methodology of seeing and understanding the world in which we live and which shapes our lives. Sociology looks beyond the indoctrinated and conditioned take-it-for-granted views of facts, to provide deeper, more illuminating and challenging understandings of the juxtapositions of life on this planet and the entire constellation of planets, star, sun and moon. Through its particular analytical perspective, social ideology, and research methods, Sociology is a discipline that expands our awareness and analysis of the human social relationships, cultures, and institutions that profoundly shape both our lives and history. The in depth definition of Sociology includes all social sciences. Sociological research focuses on only one aspect of the Social Sciences and its impact on and within all Social Sciences. Sociology research/study often brings up the dilemma of \u2018Which came first the chicken or the egg.\u2019 And therein lies the confusion and over simplification of the vastness of life in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th dimension. The first sociological dilemma was in the beginning. \u201cIn the beginning, that which Is is all there was, and there was nothing else. Yet, all That IS could not know itself\u2014because All That Is is all there was, and there was nothing else. And so All That is\u2026was not. For in the absence of something else. All That Is, is not.\u201d 1 \u201cThis is the great Is/Not Is to which mystics have referred from the beginning of time.\u201d 2 \u201cAll That Is knew that It was all there was\u2014but this was not enough for It could only know its utter magnificence conceptually, not experientially. Yet the experience of itself is that for which it longed, for it wanted to know what it felt like to be so magnificent. Still, this was impossible, because the term \u201cmagnificent\u201d is a relative term. All That Is could not know what it felt like to be magnificent unless that which is not showed up. In the absence of that which is not, that which IS, is not.\u201d 3 \u201cThe one thing that All That Is knew is that there was nothing else. And so it could, and would, never know itself from a reference point outside of itself. Such a point did not exist. Only one reference point existed and that was the single place within. The \u2018Is-Not-Is.\u2019 The Am-Not Am.\u201d 4 \u201cStill, the all of Everything chose to know Itself experientially.\u201d 5 \u201cThis energy\u2014this pure, unseen, unheard, unobserved, and therefore unknown-by-anyone-else vibration\u2014chose to experience Itself as the utter magnificence It was. In order to do this, It realized It would need to use a reference point within.\u201d6 \u201cIt reasoned, quite correctly, that any portion of Itself would necessarily need to be less than the whole, and that if It, thus simply divided Itself into portions, each portion, being less than the whole, could look back on the rest of Itself and see magnificence.\u201d 7 \u201cAnd so All That Is divided Itself\u2014becoming, in one magnificent moment, that which is this, and that which is that. For the first time, this and that existed, quite apart from each other. And still, both existed simultaneously. As did all that was neither.\u201d 8 \u201cThus, three elements suddenly existed: that which is here. That which is there. And that which is neither here nor there\u2014but which must exit for here and there to exist.\u201d 9 \u201cIt is the nothing which holds the everything, It is the non-space which holds the space. It is the all which holds the parts.\u201d 10 Thus, the construct of Sociology existed in one glorious millisecond\u2014the science of society, social institutions, and social relationships; specifically; the systematic study of the development, structure, interaction, and collective behavior of organized groups of human beings. Everything in the Universe is connected to the one source\u2026The All That Is that created everything. Everything impacts everything at the microscopic level. Source: Searching for answers when I was 7 years 9 months old, I asked the question\u2014\u201dWhat is this life about? What does God have to do with all this?\u201d I received this profound message from \u2018The Source\u2014 The Is.\u2019 Many decades later Neale Donald Walsch received the same message, which he wrote in his book\u2014\u201dConversations with God\u2014Book 1. Page 22 - 23.IbidIbidIbidIbidIbidIbidIbidIbidIbidThese 10 quotes took only a nano second to receive and comprehend. It was then that I knew why I was a \u2018strange duck\u2019 in my family. I had been receiving messages from The Source since I was 19 months old. I assumed everyone else did too, except they didn\u2019t talk about it. I chattered away thinking everyone would know the same things. My Mom often said, \u2018NOW, Dorothy don\u2019t get carried away.\u2019 I was confused because NO one talked about the things I knew and experienced. Later, I realized the majority of people are unaware of the magnificence of The Source. Then, I realized my Mom cautioned me not to get carried away so I wouldn\u2019t blurt out something that would cause people to think I was \u2018hallucinating or psychotic\u2019. And many people reading this now will think I am off in the bushes in \u2018craziness.\u2019 Thank you Arjhay Sonido for asking me to answer your question. I have enjoyed answering it. I am here only to be truly helpful. If you have a question contact me. ",

            "answer_text": "The teacher's pet answer to your question is that social studies is more rooted in the past which feeds the inspiration and drive to understand how we can scientifically tackle social issues now. But I fell very strongly that these terms are actually abuses of the English language meant to accomplish specific progressive agenda items. Here's why: Social Studies was the new age label given to the study of History because it has been viewed that history is only a study from 'one's own perspective.' In politically correct circles it is seen as virtue to say we that past xenophobia in the term History, is absolved by donning a sheepskin term like Social Studies. The real meaning behind the words Social Studies, is \"History is a racist term and we want to be globalist, so we will also throw statistical analysis and revisionism into our field to allow controversy which will make us feel like we are trying to be more attractive and not at all people who generally wear glasses while they read and write for a living.\" The people who have authority in this field are still called Historians, and they study History, and saying otherwise is a vanity project by people who want to sell you something. Social Science is of the two, the more nefarious and metaphysical of the two subjects. Social science assumes the mantle of scientific study, yet any scientific layman would tell you that Anthropology is the true study of humans and humanity in every truly scientific facet. Social science is based on human engineering. It's data is polling statistics, journals and findings which are anecdotal at best, and positions within the field can reverse months after they have reached a conclusion. This is because unlike the observable and experimental physical world; humanity doesn't actually follow laws and rules in such a predictable fashion. Political, Economic, Psychologic, and all sorts of other human fields have been studied and written about under the banner of 'Social Science' and in my experience these ideas and predictions put forth by the 'social scientists' of our time are largely false. Society has a real academic crisis on our hands, we are publishing and labeling many false and categorically untrue statements and conclusions with the sheep's skin of science when the conclusions are more entrenched with opinion than facts. The truth is that in this Age of Information, we can no longer decide what the truth is, because taking an authoritative absolute position is taboo. So anyone who is anyone can get a webcam and convice people of stupid things, like the earth being flat, or that man controls weather, or that Trump can never be president. The underbelly to having access to the thoughts of everyone in society is that some of those thoughts are wrong, and since we have established the rights of people to have wrong thoughts, we are cursed with the problem of sorting out which facts are in fact, good and true. Social studies and social science ought to be solving this problem, but I fear they have caused it to start and it will be other societal fields that solves it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the best way to understand the relationships and differences is to consider the central question each is trying to answer. Psychology is the study or science of the mind and asks questions about the individual and what shapes deeply personal traits like intelligence and personality. It also asks questions about the behavior of individuals, how that behavior is influenced and changed.  Economics studies the production, consumption and transfer of commodities and wealth. It asks a lot of questions about how people arrange exchanges of commodities  and they deal with scarcity and the desire for acquisition. Political Science focuses on systems of government and political activity and behavior. It asks questions about how governments arise, how they function, and the behavior of citizens.  Sociology studies the development, structure and functioning of human society. It asks questions about why and how human societies form, from nations to families. It asks how they function, and whether they function successfully. It asks questions about human behavior in groups and it's influences.  There is of course an enormous amount of crossover between the social sciences. Sociology, for example, has branches that include social psychology, economic sociology, and political sociology.  The other social sciences have branches, or at least specializations, that are concerned with social groups and behavior. The biggest difference is the focus.  Psychologists are going to be looking to answers through the lens of the individual mind. Economists may look for market based behavior. Political scientists will be looking for the impact of political action and government. Sociologists will be examining the relationships between individuals and groups. ",

Sociology makes regular use of statistics , biology, medicine, psychology, neuro-science, economics, and political science. I am sure I could think of many other direct ties if I put my mind to it. Other sciences utilize sociology even more than it uses them. Almost all clinical studies require at least some rudimentary understanding and implementation of sociological methods. Archaelology and zoology use it to some degree to understand behaviors of people in past civilations and animal behavior, respectively. One could even make a case for its usefulness in paleontology and anthropaleontology. I recently heard that physicists were experiementing with game theory to better understand subatomic particle behavior in our early universe, and though game theory is primarily a mathematical discipline, it also incorporates many sociological principles.

Dr.Jones's idea - and the term- was fairly well-received - but the reality was - secondary teachers were not grounded in the new social sciences and Social Studies was pushed down into elementary education and 'junior high' where it's basically history, a bit of geography, and some cultural studies.

Psychology is the study of what occurs on the individual level. The behavior of the individual informs society and vice versa, and that is how the two fields are interlinked. ",
