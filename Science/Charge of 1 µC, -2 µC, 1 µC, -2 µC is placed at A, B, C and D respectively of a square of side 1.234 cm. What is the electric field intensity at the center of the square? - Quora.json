            "answer_text": "Let us imagine a square of a side length L = 1.234 cm. The side length has been given up to three decimal places. This raises an intuition that this may not be a piece of useful information. Now look at the charges- they have been placed at the corners of square say ABCD. At A and C, the charge is equal and is q1= 1 microcoulomb. they are diagonally opposite and equidistant from the center (O)which is at the crossing point of diagonals. Note that in a square the diagonals cross through the center and divide themselves in half-length. so if one places a unit positive charge at center O to get the forces by charges at A and C, then charge q1 at A will push it towards C and C-charge q1 will push it towards A. Using coulombs law of electrostatics F due to A = k.q1 /(L/Sqrt(2))^2 this will act along OC as AO = (1/2) sqrt( L*2 + L^2) = L/Sqrt(2) ,where the rt angle triangle rule is used Force F due to C-charge will be of the same value but acting along OA ( as the charge and distance OC is the same as OA. this pair of charges will produce zero net force as the forces are equal and opposite. If one does a similar calculation of forces at O due to pair of charges at B and D. q2 = -2 micro-coulombs, one will find that B is pulling the unit positive charge along OB and D is pulling along OD but the distances being equal( L/Sqrt(2))and charges being the same the pulling force will cancel each other. Therefore the net force at center O will be zero. ",
