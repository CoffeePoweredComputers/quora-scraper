            "answer_text": "Cameras have limited High Dynamic Range. They are either set to capture dark details, in which case brighter objects blow out, or bright details, causing darker details to be crushed. If set toward the middle, then both the lightest and darkest details suffer possible clipping. This happens with all sorts of subjects. Look at photos of interior spaces and often the windows are flooded with so much light, that nothing outside the window is evident. If the camera is adjusted to see outside, the interior space suddenly becomes so dark, that the wall around the window turns into a black frame of sorts. To get an image that covers it all, multi-exposure methods are used for a single frame. These exposures are then composited together to create a High Dynamic Range Image (HDRI or HDR Image). NASA and other space exploration agencies blend multiple images in this manner to create the spectacular visages of nebula, stars, etc.. Not only do they blend multiple exposures, but different parts of the EM spectrum as well (visible light with X-Ray for instance or ultra-violet and/or infrared). It\u2019s an involved process, so typically not reasonable for many instances. Especially on journalistic style video cameras placed for capturing the everyday life of astronauts. Cameras mounted on the exterior are more about monitoring the vehicle, so their exposure is typically set to view the craft, not the stars. Being that most space vehicles are white, this puts a bias on capturing the brighter details, which means the background is often crushed to black. Only the brightest stars will survive the process. HDR technology is used extensively in the film industry to create many of the movies of late. Without it, the CG appears \u201coff\u201d. It\u2019s also being used in many video games. When done correctly, the results are seamless. It wasn\u2019t until this type of lighting solution was available that visual effects could be integrated into a shot so well. As consumer based computational power becomes more ubiquitous, HDR will too, and the value biased images of our generation will eventually have the affect that old monochromatic photos have on us today. Our images will eventually feel antiquated since people will be accustomed to images that have far more detail and imitate human vision far better. Many smart phone cameras already come with minor HDR capabilities (many are just using HDR as a marketing term though). Here\u2019s a link to the people that pioneered the process of capturing and utilizing HDR for film, TV, photography and video games\u2026 at least that I\u2019m aware of (corrections are welcome) : HDRLabs News ",

            "answer_text": "If it was a picture or video of space i'd expect to see stars and there are plenty of images that do, after all the Hubble space telescope only takes pictures of stars. However if the picture or video was taken from the ISS then I wouldn't expect to see stars because mostly what you are exposing for is parts of the exterior of the ISS or the surface of the Earth so any stars that happened to be in the frame of the picture would be completely underexposed and so not visible. But there are pictures of stars taken from the ISS like this Milky Way Viewed From the International Space Station Some people expect the pictures taken by astronauts on the Moon to have stars in the sky, after all the sky is black, and again the answer is that the photographs were taken of objects on the surface of the Moon and the sky is too underexposed to show the stars.
