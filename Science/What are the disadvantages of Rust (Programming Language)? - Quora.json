            "answer_text": "Here are some disadvantages of rust programming language: it does not have the level of monkeypatching supported by languages like Python or Perl.You cant develop code as \u2018fast\u2019 as scripting languages like Python or Ruby.You will have lots of \u2018fun\u2019 trying to get your code to actually compile.Because it is a new language, people still complain about syntax.its not webscale. /sIt\u2019s usually considered harder to write code that can\u2019t rely on garbage collection, even with the borrow checker helping you.Compared to C++ and especially C, Rust often produces larger binaries and less efficient code; the compiler is also considerably slower. I think Rust can overcome all of these issues in time, but for now\u2026",

            "answer_text": "At the start, let's say that we have more Advantages than disadvantages. And now, we\u2019ll talking about them. 1. IDE. Yeah, we have JetBrains for rust, some editors, etc. But we haven\u2019t equally comfort with them, like we have it with java (eclipse-jee, intellij) or C++ (visual studio, eclipse-cdt). 2. Standartization. Strict standard for this language. Yeah, you may see the pretty documentation with colored examples, but it isn\u2019t the same. 3. If Rust is your first programming language, it\u2019ll be easy for you, in my point of view, to learn it, and used to syntax. But if you\u2019ve already known java/C/C++/swift/python/etc. - you\u2019ll find that the syntax of Rust strange, at least. 4. Big base of development in enterprise systems. 5. When we\u2019ll have about 100k big/completed/succesfull/maintained/proprietary projects in Rust, we can talk about how we can get the profit with the knowledge of Rust. ",

It does have database drivers, but reusing project created for mysql with sqlite is not an easy task",

            "answer_text": "Programming in Rust is very verbose, because it demands explicit specifications for every action (even more so than C++, to enforce greater ownership safety).  And it involves a lot of time and thought wrestling with the compiler. Google \"rust fighting borrow checker\" or check out A Swift guide to Rust. Also the language is young so libraries are not yet as sleek as those available elsewhere. ",

Rust, like all programming languages has its strengths and weaknesses but that shouldn\u2019t impede writing software with it. With regards to the unsafe keyword, I haven\u2019t seen it too much in the wild. If you want to interact with Rust\u2019s FFI or Sync and Send traits then you will surely use unsafe code. The unsafe keyword can be seen in more detail with this link: Unsafe. Cyclical reference questions come up a lot and have an entry in the FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions. ",
