            "answer_text": "Q: Can gravity simply be the surface of the Earth accelerating upwards due the expanding universe? No. It can\u2019t. The math wouldn\u2019t come anywhere close to working out, for one thing, the the expansion of the universe doesn\u2019t affect gravitationally bound matter like the Earth for another. Here\u2019s what gravity seems to be, at least in the Einsteinian view: Matter warps spacetime\u2014notice, I didn\u2019t say space, but spacetime\u2014in a direction you can\u2019t see or really imagine. When people show the curvature of space by placing a bowling ball on a bedspread, you are right not to get it. That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s not it at all. Matter curves spacetime\u2014such that our forward motion through time no longer carries us straight through space. When we are at rest, say sitting in a beach chair on Earth, we are not really at rest, we are moving forward through time at the speed of light\u2014but spacetime is curved in such a way that \u201cforward\u201d through time curves \u201cdown\u201d through space toward the nearby mass. To sitting in our chair, sipping a drink, watching the waves, we careen \u201cdown\u201d through spacetime toward the Earth\u2014but our electrons can\u2019t get through its electrons, so we stop\u2014moving through space. But now the Earth is pushing us perpetually in a curved path through time, and motion along a curve is acceleration, which is why we experience gravity as an acceleration. ",

            "answer_text": "You are conflating 2 well known cosmological phenomena: gravity and the expansion of the Universe. Mass causes gravity and it only goes one way, so more mass attracts more mass, like the Earth. The Earth is in orbit around a much larger mass called the Sun, otherwise we would fall into it. Likewise, the Moon is orbiting the Earth without falling onto us. You can do a simple calculation using Newton\u2019s formula for gravity and the formula for centrifugal force to work out that they are perfectly balanced. However, notice the Moon rotates once with every revolution of Earth. This is because tidal effects from Earth\u2019s gravity gradually slowed it down till it only had one side facing the Earth at all times. Likewise the Sun is slowing the Earth\u2019s rotation down and has done to Mercury what Earth has done to the Moon. But the Moon\u2019s gravity creates tides on Earth and that means it is slowing down in its orbit and slowly moving away. None of this has anything to do with the expansion of the Universe, which is a consequence of the aftermath of inflation (according to current theories) following the Big Bang. Evidence for this is in the Cosmological Background Radiation. Recently, we\u2019ve discovered that the Universe\u2019s expansion is accelerating, which we\u2019ve enigmatically called \u2018Dark Energy\u2019. I\u2019m not sure if that has satisfactorily answered your question, but the \u2018surface of the Earth\u2019 is not accelerating upwards at all. ",

If you were to get in a spaceship and go up 7 miles a second, you\u2019d have as much measurable gravity then the entire earth.
