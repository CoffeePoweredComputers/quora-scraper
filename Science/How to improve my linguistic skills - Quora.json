            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Steps to improve your writing skills First, take a question seriously. Think thoroughly and deeply about the topic and try to reach the core of that question yourself. Discuss the problem with your own mind and prepare a solution.Your answers need to be precise and reviewed by you. Don't write unnecessary lengthy words. Try to read the mindset of the person who has asked the question - What type of answer he/she requires and will be satisfied with the same. Try to find out who are your actual audience; who likes to read answers from the particular topic.If you satisfy the readers then would like to read your answers further. Day by day, more and more of your answers will get audience calls.Try to scope on a particular region, people, nationality or culture, but remember that you should be secular with your answers and you have to keep your personal issues away from your answers which shouldn't reflect on your works.Divide some essays between the good and the bad ones. Don't praise the good things vociferously or criticize the bad with utter annoyance. Give equal importance to each of the sections.Do divide your writings into different subjects so that you can easily recall what you had written in the past. Try to brush up your memory and write affluently with meaningful rich words. Your answers must themselves grasp the eyesight of people. Motivate the readers with your phrases.Don't be nervous while writing an answer. Get relaxed before you write something. Keep your mind and soul cool and honest. Avoid all type of grammatical mistakes.Nervousness shouldn't be reflected in your answers. Don't be in a hurry when you write some important information. People may think some negative out of your answers.Don't write terrible hurried answers which soon be marked with negative impression by the readers and get a lot of downvotes and in the end get collapsed/deleted by Quora moderation.You should maintain a strong strategy in your answers. Lastly, ask yourself why should people prefer your answers.Success comes handy but not with the first attempt. Rome wasn't built in a fortnight. Hardwork and fortitude make your writing skillful, trustworthy and intelligent. You came to the Earth with some purposes. You can change the world in future. No one except you is your ideal. Practice makes perfect. One proverb is there: If you speak well, then your speeches are impressive. ",

            "answer_text": "There is \u201cNO Shortcut\u201d seriously. You will have to Read, Write, Listen and Speak. Make mistakes and look them up, language is something that cannot be learned without application, so speak as much as you can, think in the language your learning, surround yourself with people who speak that language. Listening is the key to getting a depth of the language, it teaches you pronunciation, intonation and how to lay emphasis in speech . Bit by bit increase your vocabulary, but pay attention to the simple vocabulary. Then later delve into the dialect and accent. Record yourself and listen if your making a mistake, because you may think your not making a mistake while speaking but you are, you will have a better understanding of the language gradually. Practice daily, indulge in phrases and quotes. Then read books or better yet newspapers. Enact a movie scene in the language, don\u2019t be monotonous. Listen to songs, read lyrics understand the meaning of words you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t be shy, be brave and make loads of mistakes because that is how you will learn but most importantly retain what you have learned. ",

            "answer_text": "I presume you mean how can you get better at using your native language. That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s interesting how we presume that out native language does not need improving/maintenance just because it\u2019s our native language. That is absolutely wrong. We always have to be reading, writing, and having challenging discussions with people. Talk to people who are in fields other than ours, ask them about their views and ideas for solutions to big problems. It\u2019s as such how you improve your language capabilities. If you sense or people have told you that you make grammatical mistakes in your native langauge, then the solution to that is to language a second language through its grammar, through professional language lessons. Along the way your native language\u2019s grammar will auto-correct while it\u2019s learning the second language. Good luck to you! It\u2019s a long journey but of course, worth all the effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Linguistics refers to not only knowing the daily usability of a language but having a varied knowledge of the language\u2019s grammar, phonetics, phonology, semantics, etc. But if you want to improve your language skills, then the best way is to be keen with your ears, as \u2018shruti\u2019 or your listening power will definitely help you do so. So read louder, listen more whatever you get to listen in your desired language from the internet, and practice in a closed space even reading out something you have written, or make a speech and practice with the right postures and gestures in front of a mirror. These will make your confidence grow day by day. Finally, friends can help in conversing with you in that particular language often, for your practice. ",

            "answer_text": "My linguistic professor taught us that the best thing to do to help young children become proficient high-level English speakers was require them to explain everything in detail. If you can explain everything in detail try writing down your ideas and compacting them. Learn what parts of your ideas you need to explain to get the whole point across and which don\u2019t. Also learn how to get high-information density with your words. Have other people read your explanations and have them communicate your ideas back to you. Then practice reading those words and you\u2019ll gain a new way of speaking you can use when needed. ",
