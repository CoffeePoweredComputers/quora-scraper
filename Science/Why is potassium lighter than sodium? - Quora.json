            "answer_text": "the potassium is lighter than sodium because increase in atomic volume overweighs the increase in atomic mass. There is an exception in the density trend between sodium and potassium. The exception is that although the atomic mass increases and the number of protons increase for potassium, its density is less than that for sodium. Density down a group generally increases, with the notable exception of potassium being less dense than sodium. Basically, in the case of sodium and potassium the increase in shell size outweighs the pull of the core on the outer shell electron and so potassium is less dense than sodium. In the sodium/potassium pair this effect counteracts the effect of increased nuclear mass. ",

            "answer_text": "It is true that the density of Alkaline metals increases as you go down the group, of course, due to the increasing number of protons and neutrons that increases the mass of the atoms proportionally more than the increase in the volume of the atom. So based on density = mass divided by volume, the density increases. Well for sodium and potassium, the increase in the mass of the potassium atom is less than the relative increase in its volume compared to the sodium atom increases in mass per unit volume. So basically, a potassium atom increase in mass is less than in volume IN PROPORTION to the sodium atom increase in mass per unit volume. Thus the mass per unit volume for potassium will be lower than the sodium\u2019s and the density of the sodium will be higher. ",
