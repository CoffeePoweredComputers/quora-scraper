            "answer_text": " There are two entities, in life. God and creation. Cessation of life of an individual, is not the end in itself. In fact, there is no end of anyone. We exist into eternity, without loosing our individuality, but at present we don't realises, it. We fear death, due to loss of physical form. But loss of physical form is not an end. As per the enlightened, Gurus, we have two more bodies, besides this physical body. These are subtle body and causal body. When, we leave our body in earthly journey. We go to the subtle realms, with these two bodies as per our karmas in earthly life. After we exhaust our good karmas, in heavenly abodes we come back to earth to fulfill our unfulfilled earthly karmas. This round of birth and death goes on till we get complete freedom from earthly desires. This freedom from desires, is called moksha in Hindu, Shastras. In this state we can also retain our individual identity, in heaven or may merge in God,who is eternal existence. Therefore, there is the importance of doing good karmas in Hindu dharma. They take us towards, freedom and enlightenment. Please, read the famous book, Autobiography of a Yogi, by Paramhansa Yoganandji,for more on this subject. ",
