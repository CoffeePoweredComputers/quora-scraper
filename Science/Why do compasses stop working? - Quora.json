            "answer_text": "First, the most common compass failure experienced by orienteers, who use their compasses every weekend, is a bubble forming in the liquid-filled capsule holding the needle. This causes the needle to take longer to settle and leads to immediate replacement of the compass, because impatience pretty much defines the sport of orienteering. Leaving your compass on the dashboard on a hot day is a popular way to induce a bubble. Second, the needle is fairly well protected, but it\u2019s well understood that a firm whack of a magnetised object against a hard surface will cause magnetisation to be lost or reversed. I have seen an orienteering compass which points south. Not good. Third, age and abuse can also cause the tiny magnet attached to the non-magnetic needle to become detached or misplaced. The compass now points in random directions. Fourth, a local magnetic field will overpower the earth\u2019s weak magnetic field and force the compass to point in the wrong direction. I\u2019ve personally experienced this in volcanic terrain in Auckland NZ where an underground lava tube has a local magnetic field. There is also an orienteering map near Wellington NZ which is crossed by the Benmore-Haywards HVDC line, an electricity transmission line between North Island and SI NZ which uses DC not AC and generates a massive static magnetic field. The line is understood to be usually inactive, but when active you can forget about using your compass. Finally, as a southern hemisphere orienteer I\u2019ll mention magnetic inclination (not declination.) Mag North isn\u2019t parallel to the ground, so a compass must be weighted to compensate. Northern hemisphere compasses are weighted in the wrong direction, so when a northern hemisphere compass used is used in the southern hemisphere the needle scrapes along the housing, and sticks or lags when settling. Recently manufactured compasses appear to counteract this in some manner.  ",
