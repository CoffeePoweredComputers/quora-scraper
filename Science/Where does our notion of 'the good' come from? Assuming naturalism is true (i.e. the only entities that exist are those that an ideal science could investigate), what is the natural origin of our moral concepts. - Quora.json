            "answer_text": "You have to look at features of human nature if you want to get a naturalistic morality. People like David Hume is wrong about certain things. It is in fact possible to deduce an \u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d. For example from facts about your biological health we can infer conclusions about what you ought to avoid or what you ought to do \u2014 because your health is an objective interest of yours, you have to be in good health to do whatever course of action in life you want to pursue. Among the relevant things about our nature is that humans are extremely interdependent. Our language ability which we have by nature facilitates a high level of cooperation and coordination in action, and greatly expands the capacity of humans to produce things that we might want. Another relevant feature of our nature is our ability to control own activity and develop goals for ourselves through thought. And we can also, through deliberation and discussion, develop common goals and agreements about common action. But human nature is also quite flexible. Athough we have the ability to learn, develop skills and cooperate, some humans have historically used their abilities to generate organizational structures in which a few oppress others, and dominate them and live off their labor. But this is not actually essential. In fact it ends up trampling the other aspect of human nature I mentioned \u2014 our ability to be self-governing in our ativities, in our labor and in skill development A natural principle of justice is that people should have control over the decisions that affect them \u2014 either individually or as a group. This is the concept of self-management or positive liberty. The problem with capitalism for example is that it tramples on this condition of natural justice, since it is based on forcing those without non-human means of production of their own to seek jobs from firms, and thus they can be subordinated under autocratic managerial bureaucracies where their natural capacity for self-management is trampled. Thus we can say this violates the condition of natural justice. In general systems of oppression and exploitation violate the conditions of natural justice. When people do exist under systems of oppression, if they resist and support each other in struggle against this \u2014 this is solidarity. Solidarity is morally justified because it helps to build the struggle against conditions of injustice, and thus helps to foster natural justice. So solidarity also has a natural moral value. ",

            "answer_text": "The concept of \u201cgoodness\u201d is a difficult one. G. E. Moore, considered the problem unsolvable within a naturalistic framework because \u201cgoodness\u201d cannot be reduced to a natural property. [1] Nevertheless people seem to understand goodness and know it when they experience it. Some philosophers have offered other synonyms for goodness such as \u201cwell-being\u201d (Sam Harris would be an example)[2] as substitutes, but not without criticism. If naturalism is true, then \u201cgoodness\u201d would have to be in nature. But where? John Rawls, in his Theory of Justice,[3] suggested an analogy between the ability of humans to acquire language and the ability of humans to be moral. Research has strongly suggested that there are language centers in the brain that make language acquisition an innate capacity of humans. This is the only way to explain how children acquire language without understanding any formal rules of grammar. Building off of this, John Mikhail has argued that there are moral centers of the brain as well. [4] There has been research on moral decision making within humans and the associated brain activity. This research has strongly suggested that morality is also an innate phenomenon\u2014that there is a \u201cUniversal Moral Grammar\u201d similar to language. In other words, humans are wired to be moral, to think in moral terms and to acquire moral beliefs. It is part of how we survive and makes us human. If this is true, then moral concepts like \u201cgoodness\u201d would have their origins in the moral centers of our brain. How does that account for differing moral systems? In a manner similar to language, humans are social creatures and depend on others to offer specific applications of these traits. We learn English, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, etc. Similarly, the exact expression of morality will vary from culture to culture, but they will still operate within the framework of the naturally determined ability. It may account for the similarities that many disparate cultures have regarding morality. They are \u201cuniversal\u201d as they are encoded in our brains.
