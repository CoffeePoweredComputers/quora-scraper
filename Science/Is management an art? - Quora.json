            "answer_text": "Yes, of course, Management is an Art. And if we see the wider side of t he concept it is an art, science, process, discipline, profession and much more. \"An art of getting things done by others\" This art requires: Personal SkillsPractical KnowledgeConcrete result-oriented approachDevelopment through practiceCreative PowerPersonal skill Although theoretical base may be same for every artist, but each one has his own style and approach towards his job. That is why the level of success and quality of performance differs from one person to another. Practical Knowledge Every art requires practical knowledge, therefore, learning of theory is not sufficient. It is very important to know practical application of theoretical principles. A manager can never be successful just by obtaining degree or diploma in management; he must have also know how to apply various principles in real situations by functioning in the capacity of manager. Concrete result-oriented approach Every art is result oriented as it seeks to achieve concrete results. In the same manner, management is also directed towards the accomplishment of pre-determined goals. Managers use various resources like men, money, material, machinery & methods to promote the growth of an organisation. Development through practice Practice makes a man perfect. Every artist becomes more and more proficient through constant practice. Similarly, managers learn through an art of trial and error initially but the application of management principles over the years makes them perfect for the job of managing. Creative power Every artist has an element of creativity in line. That is why he aims at producing something that has never existed before which requires the combination of intelligence & imagination. Management is also creative in nature like any other art. It combines human and non-human resources in a useful way so as to achieve desired results. It tries to produce sweet music by combining chords in an efficient manner. The person who has all these abilities and skill in the work is not doubt a born \u201cManager\u201d. He don\u2019t need any designation to proof others that he is a manage. I hope my answer lives up to your expectations :) Thanks for reading ",
