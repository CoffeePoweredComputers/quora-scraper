            "answer_text": "Is there a way to calculate temperature change and pressure change if volume is decreased? Most questions about the ideal gas law keep pressure or temperature constant. What happens if we let them both change if we decrease the temperature? There are many ways to change the volume. You need some additional relation between temperature and pressure in order to figure out what will happen. Another common assumption besides constant temperature and constant pressure is to assume no heat flow in or out. This is called adiabatic. In that case, the process is such that [math]\\frac{p}{\\rho^{\\gamma}} =[/math] constant, where [math]\\gamma[/math] is the ratio of specific heats, [math]C_p/C_v[/math]. Sometimes [math]\\gamma[/math] is replaced by k with a different value to account for some heat transfer. Then it\u2019s called a polytropic process. ",
