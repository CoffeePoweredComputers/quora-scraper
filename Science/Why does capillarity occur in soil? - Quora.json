            "answer_text": "Trees 'drink' from capillary water. Their instrument to drink from the capillary water is the primary root. On the picture below, you can see the primary roots going downwards to the dark soil. This soil is dark because of the water content in the capillary channels.  The darker the soil, the more capillary water you can find here. The tree 'drinks' the water through its tap roots. In soil, there are millions of vertical channels - pipes - these are called \"capillary tubes\". Whenever there is a downpour, excess water runs underground through these capillary tubes. When it is dry, these same tubes transport water to the surface. Trees have their roots in these capillary tubes - which also contain threads of fungi which are hygroscopic (attracting water); and with their lateral roots, they soak up capillary water when it is hot and dry. This is how a tree survives heat and drought. Even in rocks, minuscule and invisible fissures function as capillary tubes. For more information, you can also watch the below video.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because soil is made up of soil particles and organic matter. Yes they are too small but they Actually don't fit exactly to each other. This forms a gap among them and this gap is the reason of capillaries. It is exactly the same when you put sand in a glass up to their mouth and when you pour water on that water in seconds reaches to the Bottom of your glass. Because sand particals have large spaces among them. That is what exactly happens with soil. But soil is much more compact and is made up of small particals. ",
