            "answer_text": "What do we mean by boiling point? We mean the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the ambient pressure, and bubbles of vapour form directly in the liquid. And under conditions of REDUCED pressure, such as are imposed in a vacuum distillation, the boiling point should be REDUCED from the [math]\\text{normal boiling point}[/math], when the ambient pressure, by definition, and thus ALSO the vapour pressure of the boiling liquid is ONE ATMOSPHERE. And so clearly(?), if we INCREASE the AMBIENT PRESSURE, we INCREASE the boiling point. And usually, (if we are not using a pressure cooker), we are very circumspect when we increase the pressure while we heat something up. ",
