            "answer_text": "Here as you mentioned that you're working on some exercises in Stats, I will assume that you know the basics of Hypothesis Testing and terminology including what P-Value means and what are decision rules or boundaries and what is level of significance of the test. If you don't know these, I suggest you to learn them to understand the crux of what you're seeing in the results. Now, the value 2.2e-16 actually means 2.2 X 10 ^ -16. It is just a way R prints numbers that are either too big or too small. As you said that if the P-Value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis in case of test with 95% confidence or 5% significance. In general, we reject the null hypothesis when the P-value is less then the level of significance of the test. And if you're doing at test with 95% confidence or 5% significance, P-value of 2.2 X 10 ^-16 is very less compared to 5%=0.05. So you will reject the null hypothesis. Decision Rule in Hypothesis Testing using P-Value approach is: Reject null hypothesis if P-value is less than level of significance I.e. Alpha ",

This divisor is enormous. This tells you that your p value is < .00000000000000022 So yes: this p value is much smaller than the conventional value of .05 that is often used as a criterion for statistical significance. However, this p value is SO small that it makes me wonder if there is something odd going on. Perhaps the sample size is enormous or perhaps the routine that calculates p is incorrect. ",

You can reject a null statement with a mere chance of 1 over Quadrillion 1,000,000,000,000,000 if that make sense to disagree with. So, you either assume it is simply zero because we dont have more than 8 Billions people to disagree with one of them or you can say, the rejection of your null statement is a perfect situation, more ideally, so.

            "answer_text": "The p < 0.05 or < 0.01 guidelines you're seeing in the text are just guidelines. If we are testing to see if the null hypothesis can be rejected at a 95% confidence level, then we reject the null hypothesis if we get p < 0.05. Your p value does satisfy this condition, so if you were testing at a 95% confidence level, then you could say you reject the null hypothesis because p < 0.05. However, it's a bit painful to say that you reject the null hypothesis at 95% significance when your p value is as low as this one. So it's common for people to also report the p value itself, rather than just saying it's less than 0.05. One more push against the idea that 0.05 or 0.01 are somehow special - p is a continuous variable, and thus can take on any positive value less than 1 (of course it's not a property of continuous variables to all be less than 1, but p is calculated in such a way that 0 < p < 1). There is no reason to expect p to be near 0.05, or near 0.01 - as you've seen, it can turn out to be far smaller. ",
