            "answer_text": "There is an unfortunate sense that many people have when they first start studying quantum mechanics that it isn\u2019t really the way things are and if we only could understand simple things like position of a particle, we would get over the confusing nonsense. If you fall into this category, you are in good company, as Albert Einstein was troubled about things just as you are and he proposed some interesting scenarios to try to verify these troubling issues. But, the bottom line is that we have actually developed ways to test whether there could be more complex theories that incorporate more classical reasoning. The answer\u2014-we cannot. The quantum world, with its weirdness always wins out, and is always proven to be correct. The notion of the position of an electron in an atom, and precisely how it evolves in time, is a concept that we cannot answer. In the classical world, we can measure positions at different times and determine an orbit the particle takes. In the quantum world we cannot, because the position is only observed in a probabilistic way. It has no definite value, just a possibility of different values. This is like tossing a coin. We know it comes up heads or tails, we know for a fair coin, it is half heads and half tails, but we don\u2019t know which it will be on the next flip. And it isn\u2019t because we aren\u2019t looking hard enough, it is because we cannot answer such a question. The quantum world is the same. Particles do not move on well defined trajectories. So we cannot ask the question, what is the real position of the electron in an atom? It has no answer. It is analogous to the question what color is my age? The question cannot be answered. In quantum mechanics, we need to focus on the questions that can be answered. This involves things like the frequencies of light that are emitted when electrons have transitions between different energy levels. These frequencies can be measured very accurately, and in some cases, calculated accurately too. We understand much about the mechanism for how this occurs. We have no clear answer for how does the electron move in the atom to accomplish this. It is a question that does not have any simple measurement to verify it, so it cannot be answered. It is important in quantum mechanics to be sure to focus primarily on the questions that can be answered. We have to accept that there are many more questions similar to \u201cwhat color is my age\u201d, which we cannot answer. This is the way the real world is. Embrace the beauty and weirdness of quantum mechanics. It is wonderful. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr, zipping around the center of the atom (called the nucleus) in circular paths.   This is an artist's representation of an atom. It isn't to scale, and there are several inaccuracies, but it provides a reasonable mental image. From looking at the picture, there are two very distinct components to the atom. There's a big cluster of red and blue balls in the center, and there's a bunch of little things zipping around it in circular paths. Lets look at the center first.  That big cluster in the center of the atom is called the nucleus. It is made up of two different types of particles called protons and neutrons, represented as red and blue spheres in the image. The number of each is actually what determines the atomic number of an element. Both types of particles have different electromagnetic charge, and are held together in the nucleus by something called the strong nuclear force. We could go into much more detail, but the specifics aren't very pertinent to your question, so lets look at the second piece of the atom. The second piece of the atom is called an electron shell, or electron cloud. This is where you are going to find the electrons in an atom. Because of the electrical properties of nucleus, the electrons are pulled inwards, towards the center of the atom. The electromagnetic and gravitational force actually work very similarly, just on different scales. At extremely large scales, the gravitational force lends itself to orbits very well. This why you end up with planets orbiting around stars. The same can happen with the electromagnetic force, but at much smaller scales. This is what happens in atoms. The orbital system of an atom is similar to that of a planetary system, but with a few oddities. The first of these is that electrons can only orbit along certain paths. This is because of the nature of electrons. The energy of an electron varies depending on its orbit. An electron which occupies a high orbit, meaning that it is very far away from the nucleus, will be much more energetic than one with a lower orbit. As Neil Bohr figured out in the early 20th century, electrons can actually change between orbits. If an electron moves from a high orbit to a lower orbit, then its energy drops. That energy has to go somewhere though, so it is emitted as a photon. On the other hand, if a sufficiently energetic photon hits an electron, than it will actually jump up an orbit. At certain orbits, the electron will continue to emit photons (sort of) and will continue dropping until it settles into a stable orbit. The second oddity is that only two electrons can fit on any of those paths. The reason for this is a bit more complicated, but I will try to sum it up in a non-mathematical way. Electrons have certain properties, among them are their mass, energy, spin, etc. Two electrons cannot share exactly the same set of properties within the same atom, otherwise they would interfere. All but one of the properties are determined by the orbit that they are in, and that one property can only have two values. In other words, in any given orbit, there will only be two remaining possibilities for unique electrons. ",
