            "answer_text": "OP: Who first used the rainbow flag? The rainbow flag, the emblem of the LGBTQ+ community, was designed and first introduced by queer artist Gilbert Baker in 1978. It was at the request of, among others, Harvey Milk and Cleve Jones that Baker designed the iconic striped flag. Prior to the rainbow flag, the gay community was typically represented by the pink triangle, taken from the patch worn by gay prisoners in NAZI camps, and the Greek lowercase letter lambda \u03bb. Baker\u2019s flag design was originally an eight-colour emblem when it was first used in the 1978 San Francisco Pride march. It eventually evolved into the modern six-colour design seen across the world today. Please see the reply to the question also asked today here: What do the colours of the rainbow pride flag stand for, and why is it now 6 colours instead of the original 8? ",
