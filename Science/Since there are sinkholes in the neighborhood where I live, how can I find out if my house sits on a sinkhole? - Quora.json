            "answer_text": "Start by talking to your oldest neighbors. Ask them if your lot was not one of those built upon - during the \u2018first wave\u2019 of \u2018building\u2019 that took place in your subdivision. If you or your near neighbor\u2019s houses were built later, thus in-filling the few vacant lots left \u2026 it would suggest that there was \u2018a problem\u2019 with the land, like maybe a \u2018sinkhole\u2019 associated with your lot \u2026 which was maybe why the land wasn\u2019t built upon in the first go-around. (It's really easy for dump trucks to just show up one weekend, filling completely in a sinkhole to the top. Then, a bulldozer levels the ground; they lay a foundation and build a house \u2026 and it's now your problem.) If you can\u2019t find neighbors, check for ariel photographs that were taken before your subdivision/home was built upon. It there was a sinkhole there on your property, that later got \u2018filled in\u2019, it should show up. I\u2019ve got my own problem with a couple (3) small sinkholes on my lot. Turns out that it is a problem associated with 2 filled-in water cisterns and 1 basement - from the \u2018first age \u201cVictorian\u201d 1890 houses demolished on my property during 1970\u2019s urban renewal. (The church across the street had a cistern hole that settled a foot underneath within their parking lot.) If you are looking at buying such a lot as this to build your new house - but the property was used once before for housing \u2026 I would suggest that you \u2018spend 50% more than normal\u2019 on concrete for your new foundation \u2026 so that you \u2018bridge\u2019 across previous old cisterns and root cellars. (A neighbor tore down a dilapidated, 1890\u2019s Victorian home behind me and asked me if I had any concerns. I told him about a cistern underneath the old house and he should really consider spending 50% more on the concrete foundation. Well, he considered it \u2026 and then \u201cdoubled\u201d the concrete foundation normally used. A couple of years later the cistern settled and left a 15\u2033 tall gap underneath a wall of the house that was 4\u2032 wide! The foundation held though. There was no damage to the house itself.) ",

            "answer_text": "It would help if I knew the area that your home is located as the mechanism that causes sinkholes vary depending on the geology. What you are really asking is if your home sits above a shallow void where a sinkhole is likely to form, since you home is not currently sinking. There are some ways of testing for this in the order of reliability. Core drilling. - You can have a drilling company come and do core drilling. This is similar to drilling a well, but the hole is smaller. The cores from the drill are removed and inspected which will show what kind of rock/soil it passes through. If they hit a void, the drill drill will drop, showing the extent of the void. Several holes will have to be drilled around your home.Ground Penetrating Radar. - This only works in specific conditions and may not give you any results, but it is fast and in some cases less expensive.Shallow Seismic Surveys. - This technique also can have mixed results, but it shows voids well as a lack of reflection as long as the surrounding layers reflect.Existing Cave Maps - In some areas where we have access to caves, mapping is often done which will show if a section of cave is underneath you home. There is no guarantee that you don\u2019t have a void, but it could confirm that there is one. In Florida, there is pressure from different camps on making these maps available because it can ruin the price a developer gets for land.There is also the question of what would happen if you did find out your home is above a void. This would ruin the resale value of your home if known. If you keep it secret and sold the home, then your are opening yourself up to a law suit. If there is a void, this does not mean a sinkhole will develop. You could put money into preventing a sinkhole from forming, but these actions are far from certain and could trigger a sinkhole from forming. ",
