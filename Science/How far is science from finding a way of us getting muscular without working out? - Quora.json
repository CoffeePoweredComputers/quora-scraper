            "answer_text": "Q: How far is science from finding a way of us getting muscular without working out? For those yet to be embryos, the answer is now. Genetic engineering of zygotes has resulted in markedly muscular livestock, and dogs, without apparent side effects. They have larger and stronger muscles, heavier birth weights, and heavier adult weight due to higher proportions of muscular tissue. Visually the resulting phenotype is dramatically more muscular than normal\u2014comparable to a human professional bodybuilder. The genetic transformation can be both somatic and germ-line. Ignoring ethical concerns, this technology could be applied to humans zygotes today. ",
