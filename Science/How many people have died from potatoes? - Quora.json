            "answer_text": "At least one entire family has died from potatoes. It happened in Russia, where people tend to keep a stack of potatoes in their basement. Unknowing to the family, the potatoes in their basement had started rotting, spreading poisonous gasses. When one person from the family went into the basement to get some potatoes, he didn\u2019t come back. He was overwhelmed by the gasses and died immediately. This went unnoticed to the rest of the family above until they started missing him. The next person from the family also went into the basement and joined the faith of the first. This went on until there was only one person left alive in the house, a little girl. Fortunately for her, the last person to enter the basement (her grandmother) had left the hatch open so the poisonous gasses could get out. As the little girl entered the basement, she found the dead bodies of all of her family members. They had all died from potatoes. ",
