            "answer_text": "I am not sure what type of pH tester you have. One type has paper strips with different color codes at different pH ranges; when the test area at the bottom of a strip is put in a test solution for a short time and taken out, it takes a color that matches with the coded colors at different pH range in the strip. The other type is pH electrodes that is connected to a pH meter. When the electrode ( after standardizing ) is immersed in a test solution for a short time, its exact pH is shown on the scale of the pH meter. I think you can use either of them to measure pH of water. But you should recognize, pH of pure water is close to neutral; the pH of your test water will depend on the ions it has. ",

            "answer_text": "I had my well water tested by a lab. That test yielded a pH of 5.8. Some years later, I tested the water with a cheap kit intended for garden soil. It works by adding a few drops into a transparent vial full of water and comparing the color of the water with a card showing the colors that would correlate with a list of pH values. The pH values on the card did not go below 6.0, but the color of my sample was just slightly different from that of 6.0, so I felt comfortable taking the result from the kit as being pretty darn close to 5.8.

They look like this :These are absolutely & totally useless for knowing a pH either of soil or a water sample; don\u2019t even buy them. Models who look like this will do really measure pH of both ( humid) soil samples as of solutions in water too. :  ",

If you are looking for a general sense of the pH, get some indicator strips and read the instructions. Otherwise, get an electrical meter. ",
