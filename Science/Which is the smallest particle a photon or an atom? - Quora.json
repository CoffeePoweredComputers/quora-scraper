            "answer_text": "If you consider an optical photon, then it can only be localised to a spot size about half a wavelength, which is the diffraction limit. That would be hundreds of nanometers and this represents a fundamental resolution for optical microscopes. This is simply based on the optical properties of light. A photon is no smaller than what can be achieved with an optical beam, because a photon is just the lowest energy state of the field (above the vacuum level). As for an atom, they are only about one tenth of a nanometer, and so can\u2019t be resolved in an optical microscope. However, they can be resolved in an electron microscope. This would be similarly possible using high energy x-rays or gamma rays. However, the optical elements needed to focus high energy electromagnetic radiation do not exist, so we use the electron microscope instead. The size disparity between an optical photon and an atom is evidenced in what is called the absorption cross-section. The absorption cross-section for a single atom is extremely small, so much so that a single photon will most likely continue on its way. However, if you use a gas of atoms, then a single photon can be absorbed. In this case the single photon is interacting with a large number of atoms in the gas cloud. Under special conditions, such a cloud can be made to absorb and then re-emit the photon on demand. This is a coherent phenomenon involving collective behaviour across the atomic gas and is being investigated as a possible photon memory device, where the photon can be stored and retrieved at will. In short, photons are not light bullets. They are just fundamental excitations of the electromagnetic field. ",

            "answer_text": "A Photon is the Quantum of Electromagnetic Radiation while an atom is the fundamental constituent of all the Matter.If you imagine deeply and clearly then u will get to know that Photons are smaller as compared to an atom.Its size may be similar to the size of subatomic particles like Electron but it's smaller than an atom. I could say this because of a Quantum effect in nature called the Photoelectric effect in which electrons are ejected from atoms when Photons of Electromagnetic Radiation of a suitable frequency and energy fall on them.A single photon can eject only one electron, that's why we can say that Photons are similar in size to an electron.
