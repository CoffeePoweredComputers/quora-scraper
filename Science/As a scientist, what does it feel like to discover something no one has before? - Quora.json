            "answer_text": "This is not an everyday occurrence. In fact, many scientists spend years without making that breakthrough discovery. Some get scooped. Rarely do they receive any financial reward. The reward is the sense of accomplishment. For me, I had a few instances where I accomplished something new, but these were not really \u201cdiscoveries.\u201d They just moved the frontiers of my specialty ahead. Still, I had that incredible feeling of accomplishment, of doing something that no one else had ever done before. You may have spent years on it as I did in one case. In another, it was mere weeks of intense work. The funny thing about it all is that few others can even appreciate what you have done or can only slightly comprehend what you had to do to get to your goal. Later, you look for another such result, but they don\u2019t come on silver platters. I was like that and chose goals that were not realistic instead of building on what I had accomplished. Let this be a lesson to anyone reading. I could have taken that second accomplishment and built it into a nice (but not great) career. It is as though you have reached a summit and glimpse another in the distant clouds but also discover that the summit is not a peak at all but a high point that leads to a long, exhausting trail in a different direction. Tough trail or distant, dim peak? Which do you choose? You have had to master so many disciplines and work so hard to reach one place. Most people would have continued in the same direction. I chose to go another way after looking into that distant peak. I determined that I would try out many of life\u2019s opportunities until I found the one that truly fit me. You could look at me today and see mediocrity but not failure. I see something else. I see the joy of using what few talents I have constructively with the potential of making a real difference to the world. Had I continued on the road I began, I should have been a respected member of a small community of scholars. I just didn\u2019t see the fun in that. Today, I read voraciously, mostly science. I work on my business, the one that hopefully will impact millions of people with a quantum jump in science education for ages 8 through adult. Some days, I have to content myself with whacking away in the weeds, but on others, I have the opportunity to conceive new ideas and create new functionalities that improve learning measurably. I have designed, written the content for, and done the technical programming for over 300 online science lessons that use real experiments and hands-on measurement to deliver real science learning experiences across earth science, chemistry, physics, biology, anatomy, astronomy, and environmental science. I have enough moments of real joy to compensate for days of hard, complex, and intense work. I wish for all of you the opportunity for at least this modicum of self-fulfillment. Each advance I make gives me that wonderful sense of accomplishment. I am doing things never done before. Life should be a joyful voyage! ",

            "answer_text": "It really isn\u2019t a discovery until it is tested and proven. The highest level of knowledge discovery is physics. Everything else builds off that fundamental base. There is an enormous amount of technology developed over the past 100 years in the fields of engineering. Personally, I would not count that as discovery. Yes, people continue to find new and brilliant techniques that make it possible to reduce the size and increase the density of transistors in a CPU. These things do provide a huge sense of accomplishment. Along that same line I have been building a trading platform for the past 15 years that should eclipse the performance of the Medallion fund going forward. It is a sense of accomplishment, it\u2019s unique and clever, kind of cool to beat other market players, but I still would not call any of that a unique discovery. Unique discoveries are things like Einstien\u2019s general relativity and quantum mechanics. It\u2019s been awhile since we have had truly fundamental proven discoveries. It isn\u2019t over yet, still just the tip of the ice berg. There are still huge holes since those two theories are part of the same universe but no over lapping more general model has been found yet. There are three stages. Stage one, getting excited about something that may or may not be true. That feels kind of hollow initially, without having done the model and testing needed to rule something in or out. Stage two is decades of research and testing hoping that it will be possible to test a specific model. Sometimes, we just build interesting things without any new theory hoping to learn more. Like the LISA gravitational observatory launching in 2036. Those basic tools can help rule in or rule out dozen of speculative ideas, and generate dozens more new ideas that would never have been considered when that new observational data did not exist. Stage 3 is a positive result usually after many decades of testing, trials, tribulations, and some times much self doubt. Guessing the feeling at that point is more like \u201cwhatever!\u201d \u201cthat was vastly more difficult than I ever expected, and not sure I would have even tried if I knew what I was getting myself into!\u201d There is a discovery project that I have in mind, that I know will take that long, and that is how I would expect to feel with a discovery. I\u2019d feel a lot better ruling this theory out. Would you really want to know in advance if there was an active jet from a large black hole pointed directly at Earth, but the front wave of the blast just has not hit yet ? Thats not the case, but there could be something closer to home in this solar system, like a small primordial singularity in the core of Earth. It isn\u2019t the kind of discovery anyone would want to know about. And no, that has not been ruled out. It would be less than 1 milli meter in diameter, and it would be getting smaller not larger as it evaporates mass via Hawking radiation. The extreme thermo dynamics would not allow it to grow in the center of a planet, similar to how the jets of energy from active galactic cores reduce the mass of those black holes. Black holes are a lot more like engines of creation evaporating mass when you look at the physics closely. Better to forget about that research near term, focus on building a back up civilization on Mars as fast as possible first just to be on the safe side, without the stress of knowing it will be needed. We do not need to scan the core of Earth to know for sure, considering there is absolutely nothing that could be done to prevent it, or to react in any way if gets small enough to explode. The surface of Earth would become rapidly uninhabitable and the human race would be left with whatever we have build beyond Earth. It is best for people to think these ideas are crazy so they can live a stress free life while Earth continues to be the paradise that it is. At the same time work on space colonization at a deliberate stress free pace. ",

            "answer_text": "Frustrating. In Science as in any other area, if you make incremental improvements, people will pat you in the back, you might get a prize or a promotion\u2026:) I learned the hard way that if you do an amazing job, you will be placed in the basement. Your higher ups will hide you and take all the glory. Unfortunately, my contribution is always outstanding, so I felt the sting of doing way too good of a job. In Science, they will just not allow you to publish and wait you to die or give it up. They will try to recast your work on their logical framework and hope for the best. Unfortunately for the scientific community, I am not planning to die any time soon\u2026 and don\u2019t give up..:) In addition, my theory refutes General Relativity and so it is useless to try to cast my ideas onto the GR framework. Marco Pereira's answer to How would anyone defend general relativity from Marco Pereira's HU challenge? IN SUMMARY Discovering something that nobody discovered before is commanding. Once I realized that I could had discovered the theory of everything, I spent 6 month with my theory in the background of my brain. At any free time, my brain would work on it. The moment that I discovered I had something important was when I derived the Biot-Savart Law from first principles. That is a complex law and its derivation came together with the derivation of cosmological constants (\u03f50\u03f50 and \u03bc0\u03bc0). Of course, I was able to devote six months of my mind because this is the first time since we naked monkeys came down from our trees that we had a glimpse of how the Universe was created. It is amazing that it came up at this early stage of our development, but it turned out to be simple. So, discovering something important forces itself into the foreground of your thoughts. It is demanding and only a dutiful person would be able to polish the early ideas. In my case, it has been 14 years since I created the original seed idea. It is not clear that in the noisy environment with everyone (mostly stupid people) is pushing their nonsensical ideas, that Mankind will benefit from my effort. Mankind already wasted 14 of my years where I could help further development and application of this theory. That is a tremendous loss already. Mankind might lose 100%\u2026:) considering what naked monkeys are. ",

You see, when you\u2019re dealing with security/vulnerability research, a lot of times, the desired output is \u201cNothing\u201d. On those projects, when you actually discover something, and notices that no one has reported that before, we go \u201choly shit, I hope no one else has noticed this. Let me warn the responsible party so they can put a fix out\u201d because it\u2019s usually something that can be exploited for malicious reasons. It\u2019s quite common that the research for flaws start after something bad has happened, such as \u201chow did this malware manage to spread so quickly?\u201d So, in the end, there\u2019s a mix feeling\u2026 some accomplishment, some worries\u2026 if you find a big one, usually the worrying takes over the other ones\u2026 ",

One of the best known is Watson\u2019s book on the discovery of the structure and function of DNA. But there are many, and I recommend in particular some of the many stories written about the science of theoretical physics in the first quarter of the 20th Century. You will read not just a story about a unique discovery, but you will learn how the interactions of scientists proceeded, often with conflicts, on the way to such major discoveries as the basic knowledge of quantum theory, including such scientific giants as Einstein and Bohr.
