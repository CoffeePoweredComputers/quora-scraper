            "answer_text": "The wave number [math]k[/math] conveys wavelength [math]\\lambda[/math] and is a convenient parameter to use when calculating the wave with a cosine or sine function. [math]k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}[/math] [math]\\cos \\left( k z \\right)[/math] See how easy the cosine function is to write? Here is another way to look at wave number. The full equation for a wave would be something like [math]\\Psi \\left(t,z \\right) = A \\cos \\left( k z - \\omega t \\right)[/math] The parameter [math]\\omega[/math] is the angular frequency and it describes how quickly the wave oscillates with time so it multiples time [math]t[/math]. Similarly, the wave number [math]k[/math] describes how quickly the wave oscillates with distance so it multiplies [math]z[/math].

            "answer_text": "Any choice of units-of-measure is done for the convenience of the user. Light has been traditionally measured by wavelengths because we couldn\u2019t measure frequency back then. Frequency is a more convenient parameter because it is constant for a wave, while wavelength changes as the wave goes from medium to medium. Wavenumber is a frequency-like measure, for situations where you want some parameter, like energy, to increase when your independent variable (wavenumber) increases. ",
