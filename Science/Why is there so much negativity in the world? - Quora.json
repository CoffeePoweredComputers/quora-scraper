If we are happy with our own selves, we may not consume things the way which the powerful corporates wants us to be. How to make us use fairness creams? By making us believe that black skin tone will not be attractive to the opposite gender. How to make us buy expensive smart phones? By making us believe that it is a status symbol How to make us buy alcohol? By making us believe that drinking is the new cool factor How to make us buy that fattening expensive pizza ? By making an ambient setting for clicking pictures so that we can upload pictures in FB to make everyone believe that we are not lagging behind in enjoying life How to make us buy deodarants ? By making us believe that it increases our chances of reproduction. When the best minds of this era are at the behest of corporates and being paid hefty pay packages just to make us consume more, what else you can expect..?!?! ",

            "answer_text": "We notice ,that people who are negative by nature ,have an aura of power and authority in their image . Negative people are low on self esteem and self confidence and ,to keep the ego and false self image boosted , must ,criticise others ,put down people ,judge others ,blame,and complain,and thereby make the other person feel small and incompetent. Their,rudeness , truculence and aggressiveness ,makes them appear strong and powerful ,even thought they are not ,and good at drama and showmanship. But we by nature are vulnerable to get overwhelmed and influenced by such negative people , due to the power ,authority ,and control they have ,and how they wield this power cleverly ,to undermine the confidence of others and overwhelm people into acceptance and submission. We by default admire behaviours that are ,overbearing , overwhelming ,authoritative , and ominous ,and feel secure and safe with them ,and confident of their power to influence ,and get things done and dominate others to their advantage . Good natured positive people somehow do not appear powerful and tough ,like negative people. ",
