            "answer_text": "The elements are ordered in the Periodic Table by their valences. But here is the rule, and the direct answer to your question:The first column all have a valence of 1; this means, by the way, that they each have a single electron in their outer shell. 1. Hydrogen: 1 Valence Electron2. Helium: 0 Valence Electrons (It is a noble gas--and like all other elements in column 18, all its electrons are stable.)3. Lithium: 1 Valence Electron (again, it is in the first column.)4. Beryllium: 2 Valence Electrons (It is in the second column.)5. Boron: 3 Valence Electrons (It is in the third column of its row.)6. Carbon: 4 Valence Electrons (It is in the fourth column of its row.)7. Nitrogen: 5 Valence Electrons (It is in the fifth column.)8. Oxygen: 6 Valence Electrons (it is in the sixth column.)9. Fluorine: 7 Valence Electrons (it is in the seventh column.)10. Neon: 0 Valence Electrons (Again, this is a noble gas, and is non-reactive.)11. Sodium: 1 Valence Electron (first column.)12. Magnesium: 2 Valence Electrons (second column.)13. Aluminum: 3 Valence Electrons (third column.)14. Silicon: 4 Valence Electrons (fourth column.)15. Sulfur: 5 Valence Electrons (fifth column.)16. Phosphorous: 6 Valence Electrons (sixth column.)17. Chlorine: 7 Valence Electrons (sixth column.)18. Argon: 0 Valence Electrons (a stable noble gas.)19. Potassium: 1 Valence Electron (first column.)20. Calcium: 2 Valence Electrons (second column.)That's the first 20--but if you see the rule, you'll understand how valence electrons tell us how reactive a chemical is. Indeed, the word \"valence\" comes to us through the German word which means \"wield\" which really in this instance means \"power.\" (The Roman's wielding swords wielded with power over the Germans anciently.) The valence electrons wield the power of any chemical. And, the chemicals are listed by their similarities--or their ability to react (their power.) That power is what puts a chemical in its particular column--thus the valence electron determines the chemicals column placement. ",
