            "answer_text": "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a combustible material. This process happens naturally in the environment due to lightening, lava flows and just plain old spontaneous combustion given the right circumstances and therefore could not be \u201cinvented\u201d. I would however suggest that the most important invention to mankind would have to be the invention of reliable fire starting. Be it the clacking of flint against stone or rubbing two sticks together to produce a coal through friction.Whatever that first method was, having it would have meant life or well\u2026 death. Prehistoric man could not have always depended on maintaining a fire in whatever place of habitation he chose due to the elements, negligence to feed it or just plain bad luck. Finding fire out in the environment is pretty much like hitting the lottery. So if it\u2019s fire we needed then we also needed a method to make it on demand. Fire provides the following things: Heat - Living out in the wild without heat can be miserable. I\u2019ve done it. It ranks pretty high on the suckage meter. With a heated environment you eliminate hypothermia, reduce sickness and spend far less energy staying warm. Cooked foods - Raw foods= raw protein. Heated proteins are much easier to digest and again energy that can be put to other uses is saved. Also heat tends to destroy pathogens. Salmonella is not your friend. Not to mention that BBQ\u2019d antelope tastes better than raw, I\u2019m sure Anthony Bourdain would agree. Protection- I would imagine that humans were on the menu for quite a few predators for some time during our development. It\u2019s much easier for several puny humans to fend off a cave bear with flaming sticks when your fire provides enough light to see him by. Besides \u2026. bears don\u2019t like fire, it messes up their fur. Higher intelligence- Heat hardened spears made hunting more successful. More success = more protein. More protein = more energy and bigger brains. Bigger brains made language and problem solving possible. Communication made hunting and gathering more successful - and an upward spiral begins. Technology- Without fire there would be no technology. Without heat we wouldn\u2019t have the Iron or Bronze ages. Some chemical reactions are enhanced or wont occur at all without a little heat. Vacuum tubes, transistors and the microchip would not exist without that first invention that allowed sustainable fire. Steel, aluminum and all the other alloys we take for granted wouldn\u2019t exist. Cellphones, computers, ships and airplanes would all be science fiction\u2026assuming we were capable of spending the time to somehow write the dreams we dream down on paper we would not have. Conclusion: Is Fire the most important invention? No. Methods for creating and harnessing fire at will\u2026. Yes. ",

            "answer_text": "The ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans. Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food. The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. Evidence of cooked food is found from 1.9 million years ago,[19] although there is a theory that fire could have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago.[20][21] Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time.[20] The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago.[20] http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/glossary/pms205.pdf By the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management. These fires were typically controlled burns or \"cool fires\", as opposed to uncontrolled \"hot fires\", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. \"For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil,\" said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the Earth Institute\u2019s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation.[22] However this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere \u2013 and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometers \u2013 an area more than half the size of the United States \u2013 burns in a given year.[22]  Bushman starting a fire in Namibia Fire - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Fire is more of a discovery than invention because fire already existed in nature. However we can say that when early humans learned how to make fire when needed was an invention. And yes fire making was one of the most important and crucial inventions in human history. Fire making allowed humans to protest themselves from wild animals, see in the dark, cook their food, provide warmth during winters etc. ",
