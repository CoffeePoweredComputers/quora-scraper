            "answer_text": "There's a story that someone ran into an old physicist at a conference and asked him \"How's your wife?\"  To which the physicist replied \"Compared to what?\" Logically, the Planck mass can only be said to be large by comparison to something else.  In SI units (which is not what particle physicists or cosmologists normally use), it comes out to be about 20 micrograms, which is about the same as the mass of a flea's egg.  That's pretty small compared to the mass scales that we deal with in our everyday lives. So in what sense is the Planck mass so large?  It's very large compared to the mass scales that characterize the fundamental physical interactions, other than gravity.  In particular, it's much greater than the masses of the elementary particles that have been observed thus far. The usual definition of the Planck mass is[math]M_{\\rm Pl} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{G}}[/math]where [math]\\hbar[/math] is the reduced Planck's constant, [math]c[/math] is the speed of light in vacuum, and [math]G[/math] is Newton's universal constant for gravitation.  The \"largeness\" of [math]M_{\\rm Pl}[/math] is therefore a reflection of the \"smallness\" of Newton's [math]G[/math].  In other words, what is mysterious is the fact that gravity should be so weak.  But again, weak compared to what? To understand an atom, you only need to worry about the electromagnetic force that keeps the electrons orbiting around the nucleus, the strong nuclear force that keeps the protons and neutrons of the nucleus together, and the weak nuclear force that can cause a neutron in a radioactive nucleus to turn into a proton. Gravity is completely irrelevant at the level of the atom, because it is so much weaker than the other forces.  Gravity only becomes important for bodies composed of a great many atoms.  This is the sense in which gravity is \"weak\": it is weak compared to the other fundamental forces, at the length and energy scales of the atom.  This is the weakness that is reflected in the largeness of the Planck mass. So why is gravity so weak at the atomic scale?  We don't know, but there have been several decades worth of theoretical speculation on the subject.  Some aspects of this question are referred to by theoretical physicists as the \"gauge hierarchy problem\".  In the coming months and years, the data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN should be able to confirm or definitively rule out some of the ideas that physicists have proposed to resolve that problem.
