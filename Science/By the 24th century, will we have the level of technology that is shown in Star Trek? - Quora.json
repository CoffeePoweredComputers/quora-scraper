            "answer_text": "If we are still around in a few hundred years, I expect that at least in some respects we will be leaps and bounds ahead of Star Trek level technology. The thing about Star Trek tech is that it\u2019s mostly an extension of current technology with a dash of technobabble (magic) to make it work in exceptional ways. With relatively few exceptions (such as the transporter/replicator) the technologies featured in Trek are not novel concepts. Warp drive is just really fast engines. Energy shields are just \u2026 well, shields, made of energy instead of physical material. Phasers are amped up lasers. And so on. Trek - and mainstream, pulp sci-fi of the same era - often missed the mark on which direction technological advancement would happen. We were supposed to have flying cars and magic food tablets and personal robots to do all the menial stuff. But with the exception of some of those robots (hello Roomba) it turns out that stuff like flying cars and food tablets aren\u2019t really what we want. Instead we\u2019ve developed computing technology that they simply did not imagine back then. We may not have flying cars but we do have tiny glass rectangles that fit in our pockets attached to computers that run circles around the Enterprise computers, little glass rectangles that we can use to have video calls with friends on the other side of the planet and give us almost instant access to the sum of human knowledge. It seems mundane to us because we use it every day, but it\u2019s really quite amazing when you think about it. I suspect that technology is going to continue in that direction, at least for the foreseeable future. We may well be on the way to creating sentient AI within the lifetime of people who are around today; even if we don\u2019t stumble into true sentient AI, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we do have computers that are intelligent, problem solving machines that can rival the human mind and have the capacity to absolutely transform the landscape of human civilization (hopefully for the better!) . Imagine the possibilities if and when a neural interface with intelligent programming is achieved. Oh, sure, there\u2019s shades of the Matrix, but who needs holodecks and their crude use of forcefields and projections when you can just create entire worlds de novo in your computer and plug in your senses? Anyway, there\u2019s a point after which we can\u2019t really predict whats going to happen in terms of technology because it relies upon precursors that we haven\u2019t even dreamed up yet. Theres a name for that point - the technological singularity. I think that there is a nontrivial chance this will come to pass by the time the 24th century rolls around. Maybe we\u2019ll have licked FTL space travel and be jetting around the universe. Maybe we\u2019ll have come up with practically free and limitless energy that allows us to live in a utopian post-scarcity society. Maybe we\u2019ll have all hybridized ourselves with machines and become the Borg, or maybe we\u2019ll have grown tired of this reality and have just uploaded our consciousness into a vast supercomputer capable of creating whole custom universes for our minds to explore. Or, maybe it\u2019ll be something even weirder and stranger. Though of course we may well have killed ourselves off well before then. The whole point of the technological singularity theory is that we don\u2019t, and really can\u2019t, know what\u2019s going to happen beyond it. And I think that if we\u2019re still around in the 24th century, we\u2019ll be on the other side of a transformative singularity that means we\u2019ll be technologically far superior to the Trek universe in most ways.

It would have to run on antimatter, and we would have to come up with a much more efficient way of producing and storing antimatter.  (Theoretical design of a real warp-capable ship.) Replicators? No. Even if it were theoretically possible, it would never, ever be economical. Transporters? No. Holodecks? Not as depicted, but maybe something similar (and not as cool). ",
