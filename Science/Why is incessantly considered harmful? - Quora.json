            "answer_text": "The world incessantly in and of itself does not mean harmful. The word is typically used in a negative sense but the world itself isn\u2019t negative by nature. It really depends on what is being done incessantly. If someone is incessantly kind, incessantly gives compliments, or is incessantly a great listener then all of the three aforementioned situations are of course positive. However, if someone is incessantly late, incessantly has homicidal thoughts, or incessantly assaults people then yes, it would be negative. It truly depends on the situation in which the word is being used. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't believe incessantly is considered harmful. It may have a negative connotation but it is just an adverb used to show a non-stop flow of events or language or whatever and, due to the way English speakers feel about non-stop barrages of anything it has a somewhat negative connotation. But as an adverb and not a noun it isn't harmful nor is it viewed as being such. ",
