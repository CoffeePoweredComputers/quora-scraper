            "answer_text": "The response by both sides has been nothing short of predictable. What actually happened? Early in the Trump presidency, a pandemic office was closed for partisan reasons. Then The outbreak became problematic in China, China quarantined Wuhan. US was the first to get their citizens out, US was the first to restrict incoming travel from China. WHO, sucked up to China, afraid to piss off the mighty rising dragon nation. Finally, after it was too late, European nations restricted incoming travel from China. The virus began to spread elsewhere, South Korea, Japan, Italy. Because the US didn\u2019t stop Chinese travelers from connecting through other nations, infected people made it into the US. As the virus became problematic in Europe, European travelers who had been exposed in Europe, unknowingly spread the virus in America. Small pockets of cases popped up in the US. Markets freaked out, the Right claimed it was equivalent to the flu. The left freaked out, surprise surprise they spread stories about 1 million Americans dying. Yes they overdid it, but the right was just as culpable for saying the virus was nothing but a hoax to tank the Trump Economy. The Virus posed an imminent threat to the US, European numbers were rising rapidly. US had much less cases than Europe, even with a larger population. Trump Banned travel from Europe for 30 days. European leaders preventive measures still lagged behind, even though they were facing an imminent crisis. US COVID-19 test turned out to be a joke. US straight up botched it on that one, the US COVID-19 test kits had a manufacturing defect. The US took many actions, and made many recommendations to their citizens, told people to work from home, closed some businesses, canceled large events. America now seems to be taking the virus seriously. Did Trump and the CDC make mistakes early on, YES. Did the US left wing media fawn at the chance to smear Trump during a crisis, you betcha. US took preventative measures much quicker than the rest of the world, all except South Korea. Turns out, if you liked Trump before the outbreak, you probably still do. If you despised him before the outbreak, you definitely still do. Point is, it doesn\u2019t matter how effective the US and Trump response was or wasn\u2019t. The majority of people will just cherry pick positive or negative facts, to confirm the biases they already possessed. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it is not. In contrary, it seems that officials and media are deliberately obscuring the facts on the virus and its consequences from the public, to prevent panic and economic collapse. Currently, the COVID-19 virus already is pandemic, it is uncontainable and uncontrollable. Although the official reports show already vast numbers of infected people (70.000 on februari 16), no renowned expert will argue that this is actually true, in reality there are far more people infected. The fatality rate of the virus is often estimated at 2 percent. It is not. The current ratio between dead people and cured people show that the fatality rate is actually 14 percent, in a first world health care system. The estimate of a fatality rate of 2 percent is based on the flawed assumption that each and every currently infected person who is not deceased yet is going to be cured. The virus has already spread to 31 of the 31 Chinese provinces. Officially, the virus has also spread to 28 countries world wide. South America Is the only inhabited continent that has not reported an infection, but that will not be for long. Japan, with all its technology, knowledge and medical infrastructure is unable to properly handle a small outbreak (3500 people on a single cruise ship). So far, the Japanese medical workers were waiting at a safe distance from the ship and picking up passengers that collapsed, one collapse per 20 minutes, 24/7. Currently, they plan to bring the passengers to shore based facilities to better isolate them, preventing even more infections. Actually, scientist see the cruise ship as a Petri dish for the virus and this case will be subject of thousands of scientific papers. As the cruise ship case shows us: waiting for people to get sick and preventing them from escaping and infecting others is the currently the best protocol the world has to offer to infection zones. Slowing the spread of the virus can only be done by imposing martial laws on millions of people, while using huge medical resources and a high tech infrastructure. Apart from China and some small highly developed countries like Singapore, no other Asian countries will be able to limit or even slow the spread of infections in their country. The few Asian countries that have yet not reported infections like Myanmar, are actually not free of infections. These countries simply have no test sets available in any of their hospitals. It is likely that the virus is spreading in these countries like in the first weeks of the Wuhan outbreak. The first reports on the number of infections in these countries will be reports on unexplainable high numbers of deaths and photos of piles of bodies, made by citizen journalists who are not censored. I expect these to appear in media within a few weeks. To prevent a worldwide massacre where about 5 percent of the world population will die, a vaccin must be created soon, at all costs. The US government or the UN organisation should start a project like the Manhattan-project to find and produce a vaccin for billions of people. And parallel to that to get commercial parties on board, a reward must be created of 100 billion dollar for the company that first finds a vaccine and a feasible plan to produce 5 billion units. And the only way to buy enough time for these projects is to take draconic measures, like banning all flights except for medical and military personnel and closing of borders. Also, the world should send all worldwide available medical equipment and personal to the current hot zones and prepare the public for martial law in all mayor cities in the world like the current situation in Wuhan. Still, even that kind of measures will only buy the western world some months, and will be of little use for Asia. But I do not think this will be done. So perhaps it is now time to plan your sabbatical and leave for a secluded island while air travel is still possible and affordable, and hope that a vaccin will be found soon. Send me a postcard when you get there and thank me afterwards. ",
