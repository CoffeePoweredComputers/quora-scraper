            "answer_text": "The issue is fairly complicated, especially since there are two issues even in ranking \u201creactivity\u201d: kinetic and energetic. If there is a large generation of heat, even if the element is difficult to start and seems unreactive, once going it can be difficult to stop. An example is burning magnesium or aluminium; not easy to start but once going near impossible to put out. However, as a general rule, the minimum number of orbitals involved leads to more reactivity, the more directed the orbital leads to more reactivity, if the element tends to lose an electron in the reaction, the bigger it is, the more reactive, while if it shares an electron or accepts an electron, the smaller the orbital the more reactive (because everythiong happens at stronger net electric field). So caesium is probably the most reactive for forming cations, but otherwise the smaller atoms of a given structure are probably more reactive. There are some difficulties, thus where do you put silicon? Because it forms exceptionally strong bonds with oxygen, get it burning and it is very difficult to put out, but since it forms weaker bonds with most other elements, it might be seen as not very reactive. And just about everything is reactive with fluorine, so there is no simple answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Atomic radius - the distance between the outer shell electons and the nucleus. The larger the atomic radius (electrons further from the nucleus), the less is the reactivity of an element.Nuclear charge - the more protons there are in the nucleus of an atom, the greater the attraction between the nucleus and the outer shell electrons.Electron shielding - electrons are negatively charged, so inner-shell electrons repell outer-shell electrons. This repulsion reduces the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons, reducing reactivity, because there is less nuclear attraction to capture an electron from another species.",
