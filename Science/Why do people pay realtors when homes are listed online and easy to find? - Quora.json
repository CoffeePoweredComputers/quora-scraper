            "answer_text": "The buyer does not pay the realtor. The realtor lists a home at fair market value. To do that he has to research 10 similar homes that were sold in the previous 3 months as a rule to arrive at a fair market value of what a willing buyer will pay a willing seller for that particular type of a home in a given neighbourhood. The realtor would actually take the trouble to physically show a few comparable homes to the prospective buyer that are currently listed . There is a lot of coordination and structured timing involved in that. The realtor who has listed the home would have to show 10 similar homes on average (on his computer) to his prospective buyer, of homes that were over priced for the particular neighbourhood and the fact that the listing expired due to over pricing. There is a lot of research involved in that. The realtor would not be just providing all that information. He would also assist the buyer to have him prequalified to obtain a mortgage based on his income, his down payment, his credit rating , his current debt on hand and the time frame he has been employed at his particular job. The realtor would assist in recommending the most acceptable and appropriate lender. The realtor would also assist the buyer in recommending the most appropriate home inspector as well as any contract workers if a prospective buyer needed to obtain any estimates to make changes to the property such as painting, plumbing, carpentry, drywalling, electrical work and window replacement or roof work and so on. The realtor would recommend the most appropriate lawyer too. So you see there is a tremendous amount of work involved. It\u2019s always best to use the services of a professional real estate agent and be sure that at the time of buying the most expensive ticket item of your life you do not make any mistake as it could end up costing you a lot of money and aggravation even for small errors. Most of all your realtor will negotiate the best deal for you. He is there to protect your interest and gets paid by the seller. Always best to be safe than sorry ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking this question. Most folks think they're required by law to hire an agent, which isn't true at all. Real estate agents andor brokers are as simple as individual marketing & advertising contractors without any accountability of any transactions. NOT ALL PROPERTY FOR SALE ON THE INTERNET ARE LISTED WITH AN AGENT OR A PART OF ANY MLS SERVICE. When you sign a buyer or seller listing agreement you're also signing a harmless waiver that only protects the agent, not you. You like many are on the right path by asking this question \u201cWHY\u201d. Social Technologies are offering easy step-by-step features that includes legal contracts and other documents from licensed lawyers that any closing agencies and consumers can use. Financing/Funding, these features are also offering Prosperity Social Sharing that do not require financial information/credit or large down payments and fees. Technologies are dramatically changing the real estate industry That's more in favor of the public/consumer. Did you also know that if you hired a lawyer, closing agencies, mentor without all the financing fees/hidden fees it would be LESS than hiring and paying an agent commission? Lawyer; $250. Closing Agency; $150. Appraisal; $400. Your House Inspector; $150. To $500. A BONDED Host to Open Doors; $50. to $500. (Showing property NOT LISTED WITH AGENT'S) Mentor; $0. Posting on social sites; $0. Approximately $2,500. Total and you're done with the whole process. Pay Attention. Best of luck and follow us too. You're on the right path. ",
