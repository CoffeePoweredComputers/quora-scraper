            "answer_text": "The answer is both something and nothing. \u201cFrog\u201d and \u201ctoad\u201d are not defined by science, these are more common vernacular names for animals. To make matters more confusing, I suspect not all cultures use them similarly (for example, in my years in Brasil I encountered the words \u201cra\u201d and \u201csapo\u201d for Anurans, and I got rather different explanations as to what they pertained to depending on if I was talking to a student in general, or a professor who specialised in amphibians - whether I\u2019m correct or not, I think of \u201cra\u201d as what most call \u201cfrogs\u201d and \u201csapo\u201d as what most call \u201ctoads\u201d, but \u201csapo\u201d is used more frequently to describe the group as a whole). In amphibians there are three extant orders, Order Gymnophiona (the caecilians), Order Caudata/Urodela (the newts and salamanders), and Order Anura (the frogs and toads). There used to be specific genuses in the Order Anura that people would say were the \u201ctrue frogs\u201d or the \u201ctrue toads\u201d, but these have been split up and so it\u2019s really not accurate to say one genus is one or the other\u2026.and in which case, if we did, then we\u2019d also have to come up with a plethora of other common names to describe the rest (tree frog would be way too applicable for a lot of different genuses). In common English, though, \u201cfrog\u201d has typically become synonymous with the whole order - you can refer to any Anuran as a \u201cfrog\u201d, while \u201ctoad\u201d has become the vernacular to describe a subset of \u201cfrog\u201d that is usually described as having rough or bumpy skin. Some would say \u201ctoad\u201d is typically terrestrial forms and \u201cfrog\u201d more aquatic forms, but there are many exceptions. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the biggest difference between frogs and toads? There are quite a few differences between frogs and toads. However, one of the biggest notable differences is that frogs have moist, permeable skin. Toads have dry skin that is covered in warts. A lot of that has to do with the habitat each occupies. Frogs live in places that are quite damp, often near ponds, rivers, streams, lakes, and so forth. Some toads do like dampness, but for the most part, the only time toads go to bodies of water is to lay their eggs. Otherwise, they are often found in very dry areas. Frogs generally have long, powerful rear legs, well suited for jumping. Even tree frogs tend to be good jumpers. Toads have shorter legs and are designed to walk. When toads do jump, the jumping is normally weak. They are also different in defenses. For protection, frogs normally jump, often into the water. As already mentioned, toads have warty skin and the warts produce secretions that are either poisonous or distasteful. Additionally, frogs have fully webbed feet, made to aid in swimming. The feet of some toads might be partly webbed, but often the toes are separated and unwebbed. Toads can swim, but they normally spend so little time around water that they have no need for webbed toes. Still, one of the biggest noticeable differences is the skin. Since a frog\u2019s skin is smooth, damp, and permeable, frogs can take in air through the skin. If they are subjected to dry conditions, though, frogs can rapidly dehydrate and die. The dry, warty skin of a toad protects them from this liability. ",
