            "answer_text": "Heat kills bacteria living at room temperature by denaturing their proteins.  What I mean is that your question refers to mesophiles, bacteria living between 4 to 55 degrees Celsius.   Bacteria have the propensity of living in harsh conditions outside our comfort zone. Thermophilic bacteria, for example, love hotter climates (like... Boiling hot climates), such as the geothermal vents in the deep sea.  Going back to denaturing proteins, heat breaks down the hydrogen bonds holding the protein structure in shape, unfolding it like how you would take glue off cardboard boxes.  Once proteins are denatured it is very hard (but not impossible) to fold them back again. However without special proteins like chaperones, denatured protein will stay inactive and unfolded. Think of it like trying to uncook an egg. It's not impossible, but it isn't easy either. ",
