            "answer_text": "Every time I see someone answering this question with \u201cbecause it is too large\u201d a part of me dies, seriously. Starch consists of two polymers, amylose and amylopectin. They can be schematically presented like this: [1]  What\u2019s the average molecular weight of these polymers in starch (in this case some rice starch, it depends on origin)? [2]  They are indeed pretty big molecules, but what I want to point out, is that amylopectin is (on average) larger than amylase. And you know what? Amylopectin is soluble in water. Explained nicely in paper cited before: One theme which had been emphasized in the course was that molecular structure (not size\u2014note by KR) influences gross chemical properties. Consequently it was not surprising that the highly branched, open structure of amylopectin allowed easy access to hydrogen-bonding solvent molecules and accounted for its solubility in water. On the other hand, the tightly packed, linear, and coiled amylose structure encourages strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds and discourages access by solvent water molecules. Thus from their structures one would expect amylopectin to be more soluble in water than amylose. Clearly, size is not the most important factor. So how come starch, consisting mainly of soluble amylopectin, is poorly soluble? Starch actually exists in form of granules, in which amylopectin is present in a crystalline form. That\u2019s a tightly packed structure, with lots of hydrogen bonds between the chains and also within the chain (helices are formed). That makes it totally like amylose, right? So solubility drops.   There are more factors, like presence of lipids and proteins on the surface, so if you want to learn more, I recommend this position: BeMiller, J. N., & Whistler, R. L. (Eds.). (2009). Starch: chemistry and technology. Academic Press.
