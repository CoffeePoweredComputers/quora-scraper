            "answer_text": "Ahh. The age old struggle. Here\u2019s a bit of reframing: You feel like this, because you think that your dreams are unreachable with your perceived intelligence level. Dreams are such weird beasts. We hear stories of success everywhere, but never hear about the failures. We obsess over what natural talent + hard work can achieve, and then want the end result without even trying. If you were smarter, the things you worry about now would possibly become menial. Then you would get the next set of things that would \u201clet you be content in your life\u201d. You would wish to excel through sheer talent! Fine, assume you are given this talent. You find out you are missing the natural talent that makes people be the best in the field, and if only your hard work was supported by not just gifted level IQ, but genius level, you would succeed. You keep pushing the bar of what you need further and further, because, and here it is, you need to push the blame for why your life isn\u2019t working on something else. This is not an attack, since it is actually a thing most people go through. It is also illusory. People can be happy with so little, but the more intelligent they are, the more they can see ahead, they realize their limitations and wish for more. Then they think their current state is abominable, and suffer through their entire life. You know what I think the difference between successful people and mediocre people is? I believe that successful people are the ones who always sacrifice more than what they think their goal is worth. Visualizing your goals is one thing, but if you don\u2019t have a plan to get to them, it means you believe these goals are not worth your time. You want the end result, without sacrificing your life. You believe there is no point in sacrificing everything to get to the sweet spot. And that is the plague of mediocrity. People deeply believe that any goal they have isn\u2019t worth it. They lie to themselves about it, but that\u2019s the demon that hides in our souls (if you believe in that sort of thing). Changing IQ is impossible, unless you have a freak accident and a lot of luck. Even then, I am not sure if being a savant-level musician counts for changing intelligence levels. What you need to do is:a) Accept your limitations. There is no need to complain or be self-deprecating for something that doesn\u2019t change.b) Figure out quickly what your strengths are. Are you more motivated to work harder on specific problems? Maybe you hate math but you love the environment. Maybe you don\u2019t like stem fields because of your teachers. Maybe you prefer creating things than solving exercises. Find out where you can draw motivation from, and use it as a fountain of inspiration.c) Figure out if your goals are worth it. You need to drop your fake-dream-goals for more realistic, less glamorous targets that will actually lead you to happiness. The only true goal in life is to be happy, the rest are just social constructions and conditioning. Tl;dr: The goals presented by society are delusional attempts at impressing people, instead of being true dreams. Never chase something when you only want the end result. If your dreams are also about the process, then your dreams will come true every step of the way. ",

            "answer_text": "Originally answered here: Ashutosh Tripathi's answer to How can I improve myself in 6 months? Most of the answers here focus upon training your brain. Little do they realise that excessively training your brain and not making it create anything is the mother of all brain problems. There is one thing that I have noticed recently. It's about behavior of our brain. Excessive consumption of knowledge in a one way-fashion over a long period of time can make it lose its creativity and shine.  1. Our brain is just like our body. If you keep on feeding your body without expending any energy and making your body to do some work you will go obese or unhealthy. 2. It doesn't matter how nutritious your food is, how regularly you are consuming it, how good Your habitat is - if you don't move yourself around and sit all day at one place you'll go ill. 3. The same thing happens with our brain. In today's lifestyle our brain consumes a lot. A lot of messages(via whatsapp/messenger), a lot of pictures(intagram/facebook), a lot of videos(youtube/TV), a lot of random knowledge(via random quora browsing or book reading) and a lot of other stuff(newspapers, seminars, friendly advices, video games)  4. Now all this is totally fine if we do one thing - let our brain EXPRESS itself REGULARLY. 5. This round the clock consumption without creating something itself, makes our brain lose its shine, its power of creativity and its ability to create content. 6. All consumption and no creation makes our brain a dull boy/girl. 7. So the goal is to make our brain work. If it is consuming for 6 hours a day it also needs to express itself for at least one hour. 8. Here, by expressing I don\u2019t mean your mundane office work or your college studies. (Unless you do something creative enough in either case) 9. By letting your brain express itself, I mean letting your brain create content. Visible, Meaningful and Original content. Let that sink in. 10. Content could be anything. Even this Quora answer I am currently writing is a content: Make a drawing or painting. Not necessarily as good as the one below. It can be on your notebook or a canvas or chart paper. But whatever it is it has to be your best. Write an article, story or a travel experience in your Notebook. Or you can type in your Notepad. Remember the idea is just to create content. Try playing your favorite song on a musical instrument and record it. Download an app if you don't have an instrument). Don\u2019t know how to play? Learn that tune via Youtube and then create your recording.Make a handicraft work. Cook some new dish and write your experience, Translate a Quora answer you like into some other language and save it. Create a Youtube video on something you're good at.Start Writing Quora answer instead of just reading.11. I wanted to add \"learn something\" but if you just learn and don't create anything you won't get that satisfaction your brain needs. 12. Once you have created it, just look at it and think about ways you can improve it. Continue this practice over a period of time. 13. Your brain will slowly start regaining its shine, its creativity and its ability to create. 14. After some weeks/months you would have created a lot of things you and your little brain will feel proud of just by looking at them.  15. That, my friend, will be the point of ecstasy. For you and your brain. you both will congratulate each other for working together in creating those contents. 16. Congratulate yourself for waking up a sleeping giant, your brain, and making it realize what it can do. YOUR LIFE WILL START IMPROVING FROM THERE ON.  NOTE: When you start creating content, initially do not focus on excelling. Just focus on creating. Just do, create , save it somewhere. You will improve gradually and excel finally. ",
