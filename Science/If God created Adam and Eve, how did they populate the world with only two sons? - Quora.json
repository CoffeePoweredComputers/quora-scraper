            "answer_text": "If Adam and Eve were the first humans and only had 2 sons (with Abel dying) then who did Cain mate with? There is many ways you can interpret the bible when it comes to this part. but there is many evidence in genesis that Adam and Eve was not the first humans created. That he infact created other humans before them This is the common belief, thats what everyone gets told. Adam and Eve was the first and we all decend from them. Eve the mother of mankind. its neat, its simple and it unite everyone as we all would be related if that\u2019s the case. So i can fully understand that this is the way people want genesis to be read. But for this to be true we have to ignore contradictions in the genesis, And fill out plot holes with information that is not from the bible. Like where did the people that Cain met when he was banished come from?. There is no real explanation to this in the bible. There are sugestions Adam and Eve had many children before this happend and that they spread out and did multiply. But this require us to step outside the bible and make a lot of asumtions to fill this in. Like if Adam and Eve did get children why did not inbreeding become a problem? Well their gense was perfect back then, God made sure this did not happen and such things that actually have no suport from the bible. This all rely on later ideas, Most likely asumtions, guesses and ideas that came up as they tried to fill in this plot hole, trying to make any sense in it. The people god crated on day 6 was told to be fruitful, multiply and take dominion over the earth Another thing that talks against Adam and Eve was the first humans. The humans created on day 6 where told by god to multiply and spread and take dominion over the earth. God when creating Adam did place him in a garden, the garden of eden and then later made Eve. And it was ment they would live there. it was their paradise. They where not even aware of their own sexuality untill after they eaten the forbidden fruit. If this is the case, then WHY would he tell them to be fruitful and multiply, take dominion over the earth? that makes no sense at all really. Another hint is that during creatin in genesis 1 it is pretty obvius that things done is listed in the way he did them day after day so it is reasonable to believe that the things described each day is told in order to, the first things told would be the first thigns done that day and so on. In genesis 1 he create animals before humans. Then he create humans, both man and female. tells them to be fruitfull and spread, take dominion over the earth he created for them. He tells then that the frits from all trees and all plants are their food. no restrictions, no mention of any tree they can not eat from. Then follows the 7th day when he rest. In genesis 2 it makes it pretty clear that the whole creation is over, it is done and now the story continues. but still no mention of Adam and Eve, but now that parts come after it has been stated that the cretion is over and done. this is after day 7 so to say. And in genesis 2 we get told that god creates Adam and place him in a garden. Then AFTER he created Adam he creates the animals. a direct contradiction to genesis 1 the 6th day where he creates animals before man. and still he have not created the female. He makes the animals have Adam name them and so time passes and he se Adam is lonly. still no woman. Then he create Eve. And Eden is their home, they are not even aware of their sexuality so if telling them to be fruitfull and multiply spread over the earth would be a VERY strange thing to do. and see and behold there is no mention about this here. That was only mentioned on The humans created on day 6. And he tells them to NOT eat the fruit from the forbidden tree. this is a REALLy important thing. but remember this was never mentioned to the people created on day 6 Before Adam was created in genesis 2 it is mentioned there was no man to til the ground. This many take as a evidence there where no other humans. But remember there can be millions of humans and still no man to tile the ground if non of those humans have the knowlede to do so. So this does not mean there was no other humans only thing it means is that there was no one that could tile the ground. We do know that the first humans where gatherers and hunters. they did not live in cities because that was not possible untill we learned how to tile the ground and farm crops Time passes on they eat the fruit, they get punished and they get 2 sons Abel and Cain. Abel learns how to keep flock, rase animals and such things. Cain learns how to tile the ground and becomes a farmer. And later he got jealous of his brother and killed him. Then got bannished and was forced to head out in the world. So far there has not been a single mention of god creating ANY more humans after he made Eve. And no mentions of other children to Adam and Eve. so by all logic there would be no other humans on the earth yet. But still Cain is afraid to leave because he thinks that if he meet other people they will kill him for what he has done. Who would kill him there is no other people.. Oh wait yes there is. it turns out to be lots of people living outside of Eden. But no explanation at all to where they would come from, how they came to be. That is rather strange such an important thing you think should have been at least mentioned. This is very strange indeed. But wait\u2026 there is an explantion to this. remember the humans created on day 6? those that where created both male and female. told to be fruitful. multiply and take dominion over the earth. Taking all this in consideration could it possibly be that the story tells us those humans created on day 6 are the ones populating the world when cain is bannished? That Adam and eve was created later as a \u201cspecial\u201d project as they are the begining to the linage of christ? This explain all the plot holes the story have if trying to make Adam and Eve the first humans, That it was them that was created on day 6. For that to work you have to make a lot more assumtions make up answers that explain things that is not explained in genesis If the humans made on day 6 are the other ones those who obviosly lives outside of eden and Adam and Eve was created seperatly as special humans inside the garden of eden living there while the first humans did multiply and spread over the world. then you have all answers you need right there in genesis. Could it be so the whole \u201cAdam and Eve was first\u201d came later as a nice and neat way to make all humans to be related. It do have a nice touch to it so i can see why people would like it to be that way. As the book was written so long ago i would say that NO ONE can say for sure. If someone do claim to KNOW exactly how to interpret this and that they are 100% right. I would say that is a perfect example of extreme arrogance :) ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, Adam and Eve are not recorded as the 'first people', but only Adam is specified as 'First human being' when he was created. 'First' denotes that there is a second, as well as a millionth, but when Eve was then created the Bible does not speak of her as the second human being\u2026 meaning she possibly wasn't, nor was she the first female either. Why? Well i believe, since God was creating, he didn't stop on Adam, he created more as he would do Eve... Remember he said \u201clet us create man\u2026and let 'THEM' rule\u2026.\", So he created a lot of THEM beginning with Adam; do you think God created only one human being (Adam) and left him on the whole planet, earth with a population of one individual (where then would be the ..'THEM'...), then came Eve to make it a census if 2? The story of Adam & Eve gives impression as if they were the only 2 inhabitants of earth till they had children, well probably because only the account of these two's family is told. Why them you may ask, well, since they were a bit special by being the sole custodians of God's much loved garden of Eden, the garden which had the 2 Divine sacred trees now placed in heaven itself where God dwells. Adam & Eve become more notable also or primarily because we all then fall in their lineage as the rest of the story unfolds..... This would then answer the question, \"where did the other people possibly come from if not from Adam?\", E.g. city of Nod... Well, creation went on. EDIT:Gen 2v24When Eve was brought to Adam, the Bible quotes something important with regard to how Cain and siblings got married \"...a man shall leave his mother and father (parents/family)\", meaning there were other families/parents outside Eden to talk about, families to which Cain and siblings went and married e.g. in the city of Nod Gen 4v16 Gen 1v28The scripture \"...multiply and fill the earth...\" were given to 'THEM' all mankind, not specifically to Adam and Eve alone since they were not the only family/parents from creation.
