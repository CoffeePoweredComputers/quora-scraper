            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the wrong way to think about it. Instead of asking what keeps something going, you should ask what would stop it from its motion. Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s first law of motion tells us that: \u201cEvery object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.\u201d That tells us that a force is needed to accelerate an object. In fact, Newton\u2019s second law tells us that: \u201cForce is equal to the change in momentum (mV) per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration: F = ma.\u201d And his third law tells us that: \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite re-action.\u201d If an object starts moving faster, it is because of a force (or forces). All of the forces acting upon an object or being produced by an object are added together and their sum tells us how the body will react. If an object starts moving slower, it is because of a force. Absent any forces, the object maintains its state - either being at rest or being in uniform motion. This can become counter-intuitive to us because of our observations of the world around us. If you take your foot off of the accelerator pedal, you car slows down. That tells you that you have to continually provide a force to keep your car moving. And then you might extrapolate from that that a similar thing has to happen to an object in space - some force has to continually be applied to keep the object moving. But that\u2019s not what Sir Isaac Newton told us. So what are we missing? Why does our car slow down when we stop applying the force of the engine? That answer is in Newton\u2019s first law. The car is slowing down because some other force is causing it to slow down. All our effort of putting our foot on the accelerator pedal and making the engine run was doing was counteracting that unseen decelerating force. Rub your hand across a rough surface, like a brick wall. You\u2019ll find that it takes effort to move your hand and if you rub your hand back and forth quickly, your hand will get warm. Both of these occur because of a force called friction. When we drive a car along the road, the tires and road are rubbing against each other inducing friction. That friction slows down the car. In addition to the road, friction against the air will also slow the car a little. In space, there is no road and there is no air. There is nothing to induce friction. An object moving through the vacuum of space interacts with nothing that will slow it down or speed it up - well almost. There is one major force in space that affects the motion of an object - gravity. Gravity accelerates objects towards the source of that gravity - a large mass such as a planet or the Sun. It can change the path something follows and make it faster. The paths that result are called orbits. An orbit can be spherical, elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic. ",

            "answer_text": "A subtle point is how force is transmitted and how the object responds to force: there is no incrementalism in the transmission of force and once transmitted there is no leakage of vitality. In other words, the notion that 100 units of force are transmitted to an object and then \u201cused up\u201d over time is incorrect. At the particle level, force is not transmitted except by \u201ccontact\u201d of one particle with another (even if the size or location of particles is uncertain). And once transmitted, the force does not spontaneously \u201cleak out\u201d. This is part of the causal regularity of the way things are. Now \u201cmotion\u201d is just the energy state of a particle. If the kinetic energy is zero, the particle is \u201cstationary\u201d in a classical sense (but fluctuating in a quantum sense due to virtual particles around it). And a particle with kinetic energy > 0 is \u201cmoving\u201d. But because motion is relative, if both KE = 0 and KE > 0 particles are in isolation without reference to another particle, both are effectively \u201cstationary\u201d, just with different energies.
