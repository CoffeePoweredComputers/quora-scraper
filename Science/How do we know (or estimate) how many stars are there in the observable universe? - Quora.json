            "answer_text": "Counting the stars in the Universe is like trying to count the number of sand grains on a beach. We might do that by measuring the surface area of the beach, and determining the average depth of the sand layer. It is just not possible to count stars individually, instead, astronomers measure integrated quantities like the number and luminosity of galaxies. European Space Agency's infrared space observatory \"Herschel\" has made an important contribution by 'counting' galaxies in the infrared, and measuring their luminosity in this range \u2013 something never before attempted.  About  Knowing how fast stars form can bring more certainty to calculations, Herschel has also charted the formation rate of stars throughout cosmic history. If we can estimate the rate at which stars have formed, we will be able to estimate how many stars there are in the Universe today. You see,  dust clouds block the stars from view and convert their light into infrared radiation, making them invisible to the Hubble Telescope.. But Herschel could peer into this previously hidden Universe at infrared wavelengths, revealing many more stars then ever seen before.  There is another mission known as GAIA - launched in December 2013 - a global space astrometry mission, which will make the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of our Galaxy by surveying more than a thousand million stars. Gaia is monitoring each of its target stars about 70 times over a five-year period, precisely charting their positions, distances, movements, and changes in brightness. It is expected to discover hundreds of thousands of new celestial objects, such as extra-solar planets and brown dwarfs, and observe hundreds of thousands of asteroids within our own Solar System. The mission duration if five years. Gaia Mission Updates If you want to know the number of stars in the Universe, we can only use the galaxies as representative volumes.  There are an estimated 10^11 to 10^12 stars in our Galaxy, and there are perhaps something like 10^11 or 10^12 galaxies in the observable universe  as well.  With this simple calculation you get something like 10^22 to 10^24  stars in the Universe. This is only a rough number, as obviously not  all galaxies are the same, just like on a beach the depth of sand will  not be the same in different places.  :-) How many stars are there in the Universe?

            "answer_text": "This question is a search for limits. A more long winded answer follows, but in short, counting stars is like making a cake. I can\u2019t tell you how many individual grains of flower are in the cake. But I can, with great accuracy, tell you what percentage of the cake is made of flour. This is how you count the stars in the Universe, by calculating the percentage of the universe that is stars. The answer is a lot smaller than you might think, it has to be less than four percent of the universe because the other 96% is already claimed by things far more exotic. As numbers grow larger their meaning starts to become vague. This idea is best seen in the accounting of mega corporations. For instance, is there a notable difference between one billion dollars, 1,000,000,000.00, and one billion two thousand seventy five dollars and nine cents, 1,000,002,075.09? Corporations and the government don\u2019t really think so, which is why small numbers, especially change are often omitted in reports. This begins to make sense when those billions are added into trillions. At some point the smaller numbers just don\u2019t register as significant except in scale. Two thousand seventy five dollars and nine cents isn\u2019t significant across ten entities dealing with trillions of dollars. However, spread across a hundred million entities dealing with around one hundred thousand dollars it becomes a much more important figure. This is the mind set you have to take when you want to count large numbers in a meaningful way. This is the first limit we must consider when trying to count stars. A difference of a thousand, let alone a million, is meaningless on the scales we are talking about. The next limit is the unit we are going to use. Individual stars have a huge size range and represent massive differences in how long they live. Since size and age are very related in stars we have to consider whether or not the individual size of a star and the life span of a star matter. Is a red dwarf worth the same as a blue giant which has the same mass as millions of red dwarfs? Further does it matter that while the red dwarfs will live for billion of years the blue giant will live for less than a million? This makes individual counting difficult as stars are being born and dying rapidly and along massively different scales. The answer to this is to use percentages. We can accurately calculate the percentages of stars across vast distances, but even more importantly we can accurately calculate the percentages of galaxies that are made of stars. Now we come to the final and third limit. How big is the universe? Nobody actually knows. We can only see the edge of the visible universe. So this means we have to make a couple of assumptions. Big ones at that. First, we have to assume that the percentage of stars to other forms of matter outside of the visible universe is the same as the percentage within the visible universe. Second, we have to assume that the rules of the universe are consistent on both sides of the visible universe barrier. The good thing is that the second limit has already settled our unit and percentages are excellent for calculating when we know concentrations without knowing the size of the container. What does all of this lead us to? It leads us to the formula for estimating the amount of stars in the Universe. We start small and work our way big. Like all scientific calculations, this is done in ratios. We base this off of our best available information where we can make the most direct measurements, and we do our best to eliminate guess work from our equations but use significant digits to prevent us from having more accurate answers than our data. The end result is very complicated still and requires quite a bit of basic but detailed maths. To give you a rough idea of the challenges here are some important numbers from the calculation that needs to be done. 99.85% of the solar system is the sun, estimated. About 5% of our galaxy is stars\u2026the calculations are all over the place and very difficult so this is a very rough estimate. The numbers change depending on what method you use to calculate mass, the percentage of dark matter, dark energy, dust, gas, and the size of the super massive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the galaxy. So, lacking better data, five percent kinda averages out the uncertainty. Not well, but it gets the job done. Now, since we know that roughly 4% of the universe is normal matter and 5% of the milky way galaxy is stars and about .001% is the the SMBH, which means it is basically a non factor, we can start trying to crack the rest of the matter in the galaxy. It is about to get very theoretical here. Now 96% of the universe is other than normal matter, so far, and since that other stuff is included in our calculations, we need to figure out what percentage of the galaxy is that other stuff. I am going to use a median estimate of that which comes to about 40% of our galaxy. The results for our galaxy are as follows. 55% gas, dust, black holes, and other stuff not calculated, 40% Exotic matter, and 5% stars. There we finally have the golden ratio we needed. For our galaxy, there are 5 parts of star to every 60 parts normal matter, about 8%. Based on this golden ratio we are finally ready to estimate the amount of stars in our universe. The result is calculated by by taking 8% of 4% which comes to about .3%. That\u2019s right, about a third of a percent of the matter of the universe is in the form of a star. About 74% of the rest is hydrogen, 24% helium, and 1.6% everything else. We have gotten to that point where further accuracy doesn\u2019t really help because it wont change the answer by that much. The scales have gotten so large and the numbers so big that the errors have begun to eat up any attempt at further accuracy. Even so I don\u2019t believe my number is correct. I could be much more accurate by using better data and not using medians of data, I should have averaged many galaxy types together, I shouldn\u2019t have used our own galaxy (because it is very difficult to gather accurate information about our own galaxy), and I shouldn\u2019t have tried to do this on the back of a napkin. The truth of the matter is that the number can\u2019t be too much higher or too much lower anyways. It obviously can\u2019t be less than 0% and it certainly can\u2019t be more than 1% of the universe. So, .3%\u00b1.5% is the answer to the question, \u201cHow could we estimate the amount of stars in the Universe?\u201d and the rest is the answer to your question. It is complex, it is convoluted, it is full of conjectures, and confusions to be certain. It is also a very important question, the answer to which has great implications for the future understanding of astronomy. As of right now though, this is about the easiest way of going about the task. In honesty, it wasn\u2019t very easy to get here. For those curious, these are the numbers I used not explicitly stated above. Edit: The units for the below is in Solar Masses. Mass of stars in the Milky Way: 4.6 X 10^10 Mass of normal matter in the Milky Way: 8.5 X 10^11 Mass of exotic matter in the Milky Way: 2.0 X 10^12 Thanks for an interesting question. Not quite as easy as counting the number of stars in a patch of the sky and multiplying. ",
