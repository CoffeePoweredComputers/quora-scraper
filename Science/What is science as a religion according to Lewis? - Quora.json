            "answer_text": "\"As soon as we take the final step of reducing our own species to the level of mere nature, the whole process is stultified.... By treating human beings as the products of blind non-rational forces, scientific reductionism eliminates man as a rational moral agent. Man's final conquest has proved to be the abolition of man.\" CS Lewis, Abolition of Man It\u2019s probably the case that Lewis is making the case that scientism (not science itself). I would suggest there are three key claims with Lewis is advancing: Scientism is an idol, and as such operates at the level of desire and worship.Scientism has a totalitarian impulse without ethics or character. That is technology and power without accountability equals dehumanization, death, and domination. Hayek and others have made this argument as well.It is ideological and based on assumptionsCS Lewis illuminates the following: \u201cTo be incommunicable by Scientific language is, so far as I can judge, the normal state of experience\u2026.The very essence of our life as conscious beings, all day and every day, consists of something which cannot be communicated except by hints, similes, metaphors, and the use of those emotions\u2026which are pointers to it.\u201d What this is expressing is the that search for \u201cobjective\u201d truth leads us to distance ourselves from what makes us human. It undermines our knowledge from consciousness. It undermines human connection to meaning and purpose and conscience and ethics. Lewis is basically saying three things above: Science doesn\u2019t deal with all of life. Somethings can only be understood literarily. Somethings can only be understood in story, art, or history.Beyond that, that science undermines the basis for subjective personal data and experience (also called empiricism) which makes the work of the science possible in the first place, but also makes consciousness and love possible as well. Too much concern for the objectiveWe can see this overemphasis dramatized on Big Bang in the character of Sheldon, whose ideas of friendship and relationships with the opposite sex are awkward to say the least. The other example of over-rationalistic characters include both Spock and Data. Both yearn for relationships and love and humanity, and yet those are beyond their capacity. That is the scientific project ultimately undermines something of the human project, that is the humanist project.Unfortunately, scientism has the impact of undermining science, not furthering it. Scientism has the impact of undermining empiricism, not furthering it. In the same way that guardrails and the rules of the road aren\u2019t anti-car, but establish the limits to freedom but in a very real sense extend the possibility of the freedom to drive on the highway\u2014without anarchy.  Reflections on the Nature of Our \u201cReligions\u201d or \u201cReligious\u201d Lives: Atheists don\u2019t go to church every week, but might actually attend services more often by listening to podcasts or youtube or a message board. Our social media practices are deeply habitual based on our understandings of our highest ideological priorities for our lives. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t doing them. Moreover, it\u2019s easy to forget that 98% of religious practice takes place outside the church building. If we have 18 hour days x 7 days a week = 126. If we go to church for 90 minutes a week that\u2019s less than 2% of our time awake. Our lives are both spiritual and religious from the moment we get up to the moment we go to sleep. Actually even I suppose when we go to sleep, but I think for the purposes of making active choices, the 18 hour day makes the most sense. The use \u201che is religious about\u2026\u2026X\u201d I clarified this above, but I thought I would provide some sample definition by which to perhaps define religion. Initially here\u2019s one from Oxford: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance. \"consumerism is the new religion\" Similarly, there are also uses of this like work is our new religion. I would suggest this one from Merriam Webster is also helpful: a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith Scientism and/or materialism is certainly a principle and cause. And there are underlying assumptions and principles, even as they are like the elephants in the room that almost no one talks about. These all have the ring of the religious, even as there is no temple that people formally attend for Sunday service. The assumption that this kind of religious building is necessary is a kind of cultural confusion. It itself is a category mistake. As I think I\u2019m using religion in a slightly different meaning. However, the assumption that scientism doesn\u2019t have highest principles or people who are held up or deified (like Dawkins and Krauss) or symbolic reverence (for instance for anything Evolution or Darwin related). And there are various online versions of churches in the form of lectures and podcasts along with meetups and events which feature scientistic paraphanalia. Finally, I\u2019m sure an anthropologist or someone in communication theory (specifically rhetorical theory) could provide an explanation which provided the underlying aspects the way secularism, modernity, technocracy, and/or scientism had various other religious overtones. Let\u2019s define the limits of science. Dr. Peter Medewar, who incidentally wasn\u2019t a Christian and who won the Nobel Prize points out the following: \u201c That there is indeed a limit upon science is made very likely by the existence of questions that science cannot answer and that no conceivable advance of science would empower it to answer. These are the questions that children ask \u2013 the \u201cultimate questions\u201d of Karl Popper. I have in such questions as: How did everything begin? What are we all here for? What is the point of living?\u201d \u201c It is not to science, therefore but to metaphysics, imaginative literature or religion that we must turn for answers to questions having to do with first and last things.\u201d -- Sir Peter Medawar, The Limits of Science, (Oxford University Press, Oxford (1987)) And certainly those who over-priortize science outside of its domain and limits have turned it into a religious expedition\u2014in a way that resembles a destructive romance in which reduction after reduction and category mistake after category mistake ends up being made.  If you are interesting in researching scientism, here are a couple more articles on scientism by other folks: What is Scientism? (published for a science association/organization)What Is Scientism?10 Things You Should Know about ScientismHere are three articles on that topic: Blinded by ScientismC.S. Lewis' views on Science and ScientismC. S. Lewis and the Materialist Menace | John G. West Jr.C. S. Lewis and the Religion of Science | National Review (the book this is article is reviewing is quite good IMHO, but I\u2019m not 100% sure how useful the article itself is).Lewis advances this argument in five different works, initially The Abolition of Man along with That Hideous Strength and the Space Trilogy. He also speaks to a critique of reductive naturalism/materialism in his book on Miracles. Although a number of his other works point to the limits of materialism/naturalism/and scientism. ",
