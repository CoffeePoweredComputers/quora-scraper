            "answer_text": "You could use any of the following:- Oxidation with HCrO which produces Benzoic acid and then decarboxylation using Sodalime and heat which produces Benzene.Using Haloform reaction, I/NaOH , turns Acetophenone to Benzoate ion, which on mild acidification produces Benzoic acid. Decarboxylate it as mentioned above.You can also reduce the keto group using Zn(Hg)/HCl producing phenylethane which on oxidation with KMnO produces Benzoic acid which again on decarboxylation produces Benzene.",
