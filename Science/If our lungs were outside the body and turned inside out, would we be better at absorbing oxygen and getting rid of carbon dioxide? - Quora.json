            "answer_text": "Having our lungs on the outside of our bodies and inside out would indeed make absorption and release of gases more effective presuming we could keep those external lungs moist. In fact, some animals that live in low oxygen environments already do this:  Now, technically, those frill things are not their lungs, but they serve the same purpose and allows such a high gas transfer efficiency that they can breathe under water with them. There is good reason not to have external lungs though, and why most animals do not have them. They are easily damaged. Animals that do have them usually live in locations where they are unlikely to be damaged. In the case of the axolotl shown above, it is also capable of regeneration.The surface where gas exchange takes place has to be moist, or at the least have a high humidity. Your lungs already manage this effectively, but externally the surface would easily dry out and cause dehydration. The Axolotl above manages to avoid this by living in waterThey require to be spread out like a fan, this requires plenty of fragile structural supports\u2026 or zero gravity. The Axolotl manages it by letting them float freely in water.If it was not apparent, to have external lungs on Earth you need to live in water. You will find all the organisms with external lungs do exactly that\u2026 they live in water. So yes, external lungs would be far more efficient at gas exchange\u2026 but we would also need to live in water\u2026 or just walk around continually hosing our elaborate lung-fan displays. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have correctly covered the problems of the surface drying out. Another problem is getting sufficient surface area. The inside out lungs would instead of having little sacs - thewy would have little protrusions. I think gravity would hold these together - as well as surface tension so effectively reducing the surface area. Ani,als with equivalent strctures - like external gills live in water. These have pretty well neutral bouyancy so that gravity does not cause the structures to fall down, rest against each other and so reduce the surface area. So what is possible in water is not possible in air. ",
