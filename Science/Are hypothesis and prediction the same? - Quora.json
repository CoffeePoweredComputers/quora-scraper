            "answer_text": " Hypotheses are what we are considering to be correct. From the hypotheses, a logical framework is built which will yield predictions. The farther (less related) the hypotheses are from the predictions, the better the theory will be. For instance, L-CDM introduces Dark Matter and Dark Energy to explain the Type 1a Supernova distances versus Redshift z. So, the hypotheses (existence of Dark Matter and Dark Energy) is directly connected to the final \u201cprediction\u201d, which is really a FITTING. SO, that is an example of a weak theory since the hypotheses and the conclusions are connected by a fitting (optimization process). So, the tremendously important conclusion about Universe content (% of Dark Matter, % of Dark Energy\u2026etc) is connected to the hypotheses (existence of DM and DE) are connected just by a fitting and nothing else. IN SUMMARY Hypotheses are statements/constructs that we consider to be true. From that one derives laws (I did it), conclusions. The farther these conclusions (if they are confirmed) are from the hypotheses, the more likely the theory has predictive power. In my theory, the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU), I proposed three hypotheses: The Universe is a lightspeed expanding hyperspherical hypersurface/Universe (LEHU).Matter is made of polymers of the Fundamental Dilator (FD).FD obeys the Quantum Lagrangian PrincipleFrom those simple hypotheses, I derived the Laws of Nature:  As you can see, there is a cosmological distance between my hypotheses and the conclusions. Among the conclusions I reached are the refutal of General Relativity and L-CDM Marco Pereira's answer to How would anyone defend general relativity from Marco Pereira's HU challenge? Marco Pereira's answer to What is the status (as of 2019) of the search for dark matter? Other conclusions include the creation of the Universe (Big Pop Theory) and a clear explanation about the energy budget (our Universe has positive energy and the Lagging Dilation Layer has equal and negative energy). Cosmogenesis Fluctuations of Zero how the Universe was set to travel at the speed of light: Was the Creation of the Universe an Entropic Explosion - An Hyperspherical Prince Rupert\u2019s Drop ############################################ New model for matter, based upon the Fundamental Dilator: The-Fundamental-Dilator A little lesson on the Hypergeometrical Standard Model HERE IS THE SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL DILATOR/QLP HYPOTHESES A Fundamental Dilator approximation has been implemented physically and showed to display Quantum Mechanical Properties: Dr. Couder created a macroscopic implementation of the Fundamental Dilator Another remarkable evidence comes from the Strange Synchronization Conundrum discovered by Christiaan Huygens, some 350 years ago. Huygens notice that his Pendulum Clocks would synchronize spontaneously, no matter the initial relative phase they were set in. Marco Pereira's answer to Does the Huygens' Pendulum Synchronicity support the Quantum Lagrangian Principle? It just happens that his Pendulum Conundrum has the same mechanism as the Fundamental Dilator Quantum Lagrangian Principle and that pervades the Whole Universe and is the reason for the Quantum Mechanics Nature of Matter and the reason for Natural Laws. I derived Natural Laws from it and the Lightspeed Expanding Hyperspherical Universe topology.

The farther the hypotheses are from the \u201cpredictions\u201d, the better the theory is. ",

            "answer_text": "Not quite, although they are similar. A prediction is just that, a prediction as to what will happen under a given set of circumstances. It can be useful for testing hypotheses. A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for some observed phenomenon. So basically, a hypothesis is what you think is happening and the underlying mechanism. A prediction is what you get by using this hypothesis and applying it to a given situation. For instance, with gravity, suppose you were Isaac Newton a few years ago. Your hypothesis would be that objects exert a force on another that attracts objects based on mass. Using this hypothesis, you could make a prediction that a ball dropped from a certain height would accelerate at this rate. By testing the prediction against observations, you can test the underlying hypothesis. ",

            "answer_text": "Hypotheses are formalisms of the Scientific Method. A hypothesis is a proposed model of cause, classification, or localization that could be experimentally eliminated by contradiction. For example, suppose you are looking for your lost car keys (as a test for localization). You would synthesize places to look (i.e., hypotheses), which you would experimentally eliminate until you found your car keys. \u2018Prediction\u2019 is a broader term. A prediction is a model of future events. A prediction need not necessarily even be scientific; e.g., you could create predictive models in part by flipping a coin. ",
