            "answer_text": "You have to be more careful when using density d = mass/volume = m/V. In first place: the formula to calculate the density \"d\" ... OF WHAT ? The DENSITY d OF THE MATERIAL OF A SOLID HOMOGENEOUS BODY AND WITHOUT HOLES indeed is d = m / V, the quotient between the mass m and the volume V of a piece of that body. But this relationship does not work in all cases. If the body material is NOT HOMOGENEOUS, one must be careful when using d = m / V. The AVERAGE DENSITY OF A BODY, for example, includes the air spaces. A boat floats on water because its AVERAGE density is less than that of water. Clearly before using d = m / V in this case you have to think a little more. Another important example is when in Materials Science and Engineering the density of a pure metal is estimated, assumed with a perfect crystalline structure. The density is also calculated as \u201cd = mass / volume\u201d BUT ... what mass and what volume? the mass is that of all the atoms that are found in each cell that is repeated within the crystalline material, divided by the volume of this cell. IN ADDITION, we must remember that when we talk about using d = m/V many times we measure m weighing in air. Therefore, a CORRECTION is needed. The formula to calculate with more resolution the density of the material of a small body must consider the BOUYANCY that the volume V of the body submerged in air suffers. ",

(And myself who keeps answering the same question) Density = mass / volume Now, there are different conditions under which one might be interested in the density. For some materials (eg timber) it can make a big difference. For others (eg gold) it won\u2019t. For example; Oven dried, Saturated, surface dried Boiled However, let us pick the first. Weigh the oven dry specimen. Record the mass M(od) Now, we need the volume. There are 2 ways. Determine the 3 principle dimensions and multiply them. This works well for prismatic items. Hopelessly, otherwise. Record the dimensions and the volume V(meas)Weigh the item whilst it is suspended in water (but do, please keep the balance out of the water!!!). Record that weight (note I did not say \u201cmass\u201d) as M(imm). The volume will be V (imm) = (M(od) - M(imm)).Now, the Oven Dry Density = prefix x (M(od) / V(meas) or prefix x (M(od) / V(imm) The prefix is to account for shifting some number of decimal places, due to having weighed in units that do not produce the desired answer.

            "answer_text": "What factors are used to determine plant density?  I assume you mean how many plants to seed, or set, average per area of planting bed. There are a number of factors to consider: First: What are you growing? How big is the plant at maturity? How tall? How big is the root zone? Are you irrigating? Annual or Perennial? There will always be a limiting factor to growth. Plants need nutrients, water, sunlight, and space. They need air and doil temperatures within appropriate bounds. They need to be protected from disease, competition from undesirable weed species, and predation. If you plant too thickly, you spend too much on seed, and the plants compete with each other for resources. You plant too thin, and you encourage weeds. Yield goes down. If you are in a very dry climate, and pulling water from the soil to get your crop, as in dry land farming, then you need the plants far apart, and must till and/or mulch to prevent weeds and sun from taking moisture from the soil. Yield is limited by water availability. You have rich, bottom watered or irrigated soil. You are limited by available sunshine. You don't want plants competing with each other for sunlight. Every crop, or ornamental is different. You also need to consider your planting costs, fertilizer, water, labor, etc. If you were trying to plant a hayfield, a wheat field, maize, tomatoes, beans, or trees; they all have different needs.

Density = mass/volume =m/v Now when you move to a higher level of education the above formula is not completely true. For simplicity we assume mass is uniformly distributed hence the above relation works well. In reality density at every point will be different as the mass isn't uniformly distributed. So at any point on our object We will define point density as the ratio of mass of that point and volume occupied by it. D= dm/dv. So this is the general way of calculating it. Say your density comes out to be directly proportional to distance. The mass occupied increases as we move away from our point of reference. Cheers ",

Density is a characteristic property of a substance. The density of a substance is the relationship between the mass of the substance and how much space it takes up (volume). Density equals the mass of the substance divided by its volume; D = m/v. Objects with the same volume but different mass have different densities. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. Let us Consider ice cubes on the water we could see ice floats on water which tells us that water is denser than ice.  ",

To find the density of a substance find the mass of the substance and divide it by it's volume . Say you have a metal piece of 13.6 gram and it's volume is 1 cm^3 . Therefore the density is 13.6 gram /1 centimetre cube = 13.6 gram per centimetre cube. ",

For larger objects, you might have to do the same in a larger body of water, like a rectangular swimming pool, and multiply the height difference by the surface area to get the volume.Divide the mass by the volume to get the mass density.
