            "answer_text": "The value of gravitational acceleration above the surface is mandated by a one-over-distance-squared law: [math]g = \\frac{GM_{\\mathrm{Earth}}}{(r_s + R)^2},[/math] where [math]G[/math] is the gravitational constant, [math]M_{\\mathrm{Earth}}[/math] the mass of Earth and [math]r_s[/math] the distance from the surface of Earth and [math]R[/math] is its radius. This law follows from the fact that a massive body with spherical symmetry (such as the Earth) causes a gravitational field above its surface that is identical to that of a single point at its center. From the functional dependence you can clearly see that the gravitational acceleration is largest right at the surface ([math]r_s = 0[/math]). The value of the acceleration below the surface can again be easily calculated thanks to another interesting fact: thanks to the distance squared law of gravity, inside a massive spherical body the net gravitational force (and hence acceleration) is only due to the layers \u201cabove\u201d you. This results in a, more or less, linear dependence of the force on the distance from the center: [math]g \\propto r_c,[/math] where [math]r_c[/math] is the distance from the center. At the very center of Earth, gravitational acceleration vanishes, and it increases as you approach the surface. An exact shape of the function depends on the density and distribution of the matter inside Earth. If the inside of our planet was homogeneous (constant density), then the gravitational acceleration as the function of the distance from the center would look like the dark green linear curve in the following graphic:  Source: Gravity of Earth - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.svg) In case the Earth had constant density, the maximal gravitational acceleration would be right at the surface. However, if you take into account the fact that the inside of the Earth is made up of several layers, each with a successively higher density as you approach the center, the calculated gravitational acceleration can peek at some point inside Earth. In the graphic above, it corresponds to the Preliminary Reference Earth Model, which was constructed empirically based on plenty of seismic measurements. You can see that the maximal acceleration is found between the mantle and the outer core. ",

            "answer_text": "By universal law of gravitation ,if the radius will decrease force will increase and in north pole and south pole were earth's radius is sorter than equater the 'a'=10m/s2 and if we getting close to the centre of earth the 'a' will increase but if we reach at centre 'a' become 0. You can calculate f by F=G*M/r2 or F=G*M1*m2/r2 ",
