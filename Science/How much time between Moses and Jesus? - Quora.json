            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know exactly when Moses lived. We do know that the exodus and conquest stories are propagandistic fiction. Because the northern and southern kingdoms (10th to 8th centuries BCE) developed their own versions of those tales which share a common core, it\u2019s likely that the original versions were composed in order to fabricate a common history to unite the various tribes and their confederations under the United Monarchy established by Saul and his Shiloan Mushite priests in the late 11th century BCE. So Moses must have lived prior to that. We also know that the Israelite tribal groups didn\u2019t form until after the 14th century BCE because they do not appear in the records left by the Egyptian administrators of the region from that time. They arose sometime in the 13th century BCE and enter the historical record shortly before 1200. Some folks who have not studied the Ancient Near East are quick to assert that Moses did not exist because he appears in the fictional accounts of the exodus and conquest, but this is faulty reasoning. It\u2019s much more likely that these accounts were built around Moses and Aaron precisely because they did exist and were well known as the Hebrews\u2019 first lawmaker and, if not the first, then one of its most prominent High Priests respectively. The most convincing evidence that Moses existed is that he is credited, even by his political rivals, with promulgating the first written law code. There are no examples in the Ancient Near East of any ruler who promulgated a code of law claiming that the gods delivered that code to any person but himself. There must have been a decent span of time between the composition of the original exodus tale and Moses\u2019 lifetime. So I would estimate the life of the historical Moses at perhaps within the range of 1250\u20131150 BCE. If that estimation is accurate, then there would be approximately 1200 years between the lifetime of Moses and Jesus of Nazareth. ",
