            "answer_text": "String theory isn't a theory. It's a class of theories. Unlike most theories, which depend on one or two constants, string theory appears to be nearly infinitely tweakable to all sorts of universes, most of which we don't have. It's also such that it isn't really clear what it would mean if it were true. I think the XKCD comic pretty much nails it:   It's still probably useful as a framework to investigate. There are other such analogues in science. For example, the orbitals on atoms work like the patterns of vibration of a 3-D drum, or maybe some Jello or something, because drums are usually mostly 2-D unless you bang them really hard. This, of course, is like the non-time-dependent version of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with distribution functions visualized as similar to standing waves. But we already have the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Still, if it gets people to think in interesting new directions, I'm all for it. I haven't paid that much attention to it over the past few years, but back in the day when it was hot, I kept trying to get people to look into post-compex algebras for the extra dimensions, which may reduce to fewer by symmetry much the same way that the 16 coupled differential equations reduce to 10. But it was hard enough to describe quaternions to people, so I did other things. Maybe some bright person thinking along the lines of strings will come up with something amazing, but the promise kind of fizzled. At that time, I also told the following joke. A French particle physicist, a Russian nuclear physicist, and two American string theorists meet for drinks at a conference. The French particle physicist pours some champagne and then throws the bottle out the window, explaining, \"In France, we have so much champagne we can afford to waste it.\" Then the Russian nuclear physics pours some vodka and throws the bottle out the window. Then one of the American string theorists throws the other string theorist out the window. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not wrong. To be wrong, it would have to be falsified, that is, there would have to be an experiment whose result would contradict one of its testable predictions. Unfortunately, at this time, after over 30 years of development. string theory has yet to make any testable predictions, so it\u2019s not yet wrong. Stay tuned. However, string theory has proven useful in physics, because its mathematics have pointed the way to many other insights in physics, so the field is better off having it as an investigatory tool. ",
