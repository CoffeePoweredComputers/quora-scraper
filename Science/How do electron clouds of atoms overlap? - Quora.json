            "answer_text": "The \u2018electron cloud\u2019 is one way to visualize the orbital structure of an atom, but it can be a bit misleading, because it can sort of feel like we understand what an atom is like without actually giving us much real understanding. On this I think Bohr was perfectly correct when he said that \u201cWhen it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry.\u201d We should understand that the descriptions we give are imagery and imagination, not description. This is true of the phrase \u2018electron cloud\u2019. Personally I find the metaphor of a standing wave more helpful here, because we know what waves do\u2026 they combine and interfere. The electron cloud is a standing wave formed by the electron (which, remember, is a wave as well as a particle) and the image of it is just the image of the intensity of that wave at different points around the atom. Imagine a ball made of some soft material (in my cultural context I\u2019d say \u201cjello\u201d but you can use your substance of choice\u2026 something that jiggles. The ball can jiggle in many ways, some of which will be standing waves. For instance it could jiggle vertically, with the top moving out as the bottom moved in and vice versa, with the middle staying mostly in one place. If you graphed just the size of the displacement (maybe with colour to show what was moving in and out at the same time) you would get something that looked like this:  This is called a p-orbital, and the size of the oscillations is the probability of finding the electron at that point (well, the square of the size). So the first picture sort of shows the wave (or the sphere with displacements coloured) and the second shows where the displacements are big or small (so the \u2018waist\u2019 is tiny). Squaring the amplitude gives the familiar picture of the electron cloud for a p-orbital. I hope you sort of see how this picture of electron clouds corresponds to the wave picture. Now\u2026 we know what happens when waves overlap! They interfere! And the same thing happens with the electron waves. The two wave patterns will combine to make a new sort of pattern\u2026 and when that pattern is stable you will get a new kind of standing wave = electron cloud. This is called \u201chybridization\u201d and the new type of wave pattern is called a \u201cbond\u201d. You can see this in the following image from the wikipedia article on hybrid orbitals:  The top pictures are the regular orbitals/electron clouds. The ones on the bottom are showing the combined waves / electron clouds when you combine two s patterns, or two p-patterns in different ways (side to side or end to end, basically). There are lots of other things you can get! And of course the whole picture is rather more complex and interesting, but hopefully this gives you the basic idea\u2026 TL/DR: the wave functions combine to form a new kind of configuration and a new kind of \u2018electron cloud\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Hi there B\u00fcke, hope things in Istanbul are going well. The questions you come up with are sometimes down right spooky. So here we are with chemical bonding.   Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap OR  1 - Covalent Bonding - IGCSE Chemistry Chemical compounds are formed by the joining of two or more atoms (by their electron clouds). My alchemist friends, in their tower, tell me that a stable compound occurs when the total energy of the combination has lower energy than the separated atoms; that bound state implies a net attractive force between the atoms, i.e. a chemical bond. The two extreme cases of chemical bonds are: Covalent - Covalent chemical bonds involve the sharing of a pair of valence electron clouds by two atoms, (ignore this: in contrast to the transfer of electrons in ionic bonds). Covalent bonds lead to stable molecules if they share electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas (sounds cool doesn\u2019t it) configuration. There are also my favorites in which the sharing of the electron pair is unequal, with the electrons spending more time around the more nonmetallic atom. These guys are called polar covalent bonds. In such a bond there is a charge separation with one atom being slightly more positive and the other more negative, i.e., the bond will produce a dipole moment. The ability of an atom to attract electrons in the presence of another atom is a measurable property called electronegativity. (Just for fun you can repel or at least move an icicle suspended on a thread with a magnet\u2026 a good way to win a bet.) Regards ",

            "answer_text": "when two atoms come close together to form a bond , there electronic cloud over laps. this overlapping is explained by the phenomena called Hybridization . every atomic shell has its hybridization state. suppose two atoms of carbon have to make a covalent bond . this is created by hybridization of atomic orbitals. carbon have four electrons in its outer most shell and require four more to complete its configuration. In Hybridization 1s and 3p orbitals under goes int hybridization state and forms new shape which is the mixing of Spherical and dumbbell and results to half dumbbell and a small spherical. so four each of both of these atom now have same shape and now they overlap and form new covalent bond.

            "answer_text": "Yes they do overlap, there is no problem with that, moreover, electrons can even go through the atom\u2019s nucleus without any problems, still such probability is pretty small. If you will stop thinking about electrons (and even nucleus) as being balls, then it is easy to see how this happens. Just look at sky, and you will find lot of clouds overlapping, same is here. And there is no reason for them to collide, since the are not balls at first place! ",
