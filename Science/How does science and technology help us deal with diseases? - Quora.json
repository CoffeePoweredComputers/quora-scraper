            "answer_text": "By generating new knowledge and fueling innovation, science provides solutions to national and global health challenges. We live in an age in which the power of science becomes evident every day. From the global perspective, one of the most exciting prospects for the medical applications of DNA technology is in the field of communicable disease. Remarkable progress has been made in sequencing the genomes of bacteria, viruses, and other infective agents, and it will not be long before the genome sequence of most of the major infectious agents is available. Technology, which examines the pattern of expression of many different genes at the same time, is already providing valuable prognostic data for cancers of the breast, blood, and lymphatic system. This technology will become an integral part of diagnostic pathology in the future, and genomic approaches to the early diagnosis of cancer and to the identification of high-risk individuals will become part of clinical practice. Scientists have mapped the human genome and continue to study our genetics to help prevent disease or eliminate it completely. Genetic research has already made great advances in disease prevention and heredity and will continue to do so. From medications to technology and ongoing research, science is helping humans live longer. It was never before expected that humans will live longer than 60 or maybe 80 years. Science has brought us a long way and it will take us even further in the years to come. ",
