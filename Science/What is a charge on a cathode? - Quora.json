            "answer_text": "The cathode ( a metal rod)is connected to the negative terminal of the battery which is having negative potential. Metal rod contains equal no. of +ve ions and electrons. When the metal rod is connected to battery negative terminal , electrons from the battery terminal nullifies the +v ions and drives the free electrons to the far end of the cathode. So, the cathode contains only electrons and atoms of the metal.  ",
