The solute is the compound which is dissolved in the solvent (solute is a solid In our case).  If you add more solute to a solution, it will increase the concentration of the solution. If you add more solvent, it will decrease the concentration of the solution because of dilution.  ",

            "answer_text": "Shayan is right. In most cases. However, there are substances called surfactants that have an oily, water insoluble part of the molecule and a water soluble part. When surfactants dissolve in water, they appear to dissolve completely, sometimes forming a slight cloud. If you add an oil soluble dye such as lycopene (from tomatoes) to this solution and stir, it will slowly dissolve, whereas it will not dissolve at all in plain water. So, according to the definition of solvent and non-solvent, it could be argued that the solute, a surfactant, becomes a solvent for certain substances when it dissolves in water the solvent. ",
