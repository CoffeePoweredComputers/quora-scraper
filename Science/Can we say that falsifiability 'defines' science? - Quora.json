            "answer_text": "Clearly, falsifiability does not define science. There is far more to science than just falsifiability. Falsifiability is only one of several useful guidelines for science. My tax returns and my stories about my sports exploits also have falsifiability. They are not scientific by any means. You are right that it is critical though, falsifiability is an excellent way to weed out pseudo scientific theories about what should be and should not be included as valid scientific research. ",

Here\u2019s what Wikipedia has to say on the subject: \u201cThe concern with falsifiability gained attention by way of philosopher of science Karl Popper's scientific epistemology \"falsificationism\". Popper stresses the problem of demarcation\u2014distinguishing the scientific from the unscientific\u2014and makes falsifiability the demarcation criterion, such that what is unfalsifiable is classified as unscientific, and the practice of declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be scientifically true is pseudoscience.\u201d ",
