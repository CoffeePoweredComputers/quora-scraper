            "answer_text": "Consider these: Oxygen doesn't burn. It makes other gases burn. Oxygen has a -2 oxidation state in water, which is highly stable. In water both Hydrogen atoms already have +1 oxidation states which means they're already oxidised. So, according to your question that although water has both hydrogen and oxygen, why isn't it inflammable? Well the answer is simple, water is actually Oxidised Hydrogen, which means that Hydrogen is actually oxidised and is very stable.  Since hydrogen has only one valence electron, it exhibits only +1 oxidation state. Now you may ask why doesn't it get further oxidised to become Hydrogen Peroxide H2O2? The reason is simple, in Hydrogen Peroxide, both Oxygen atoms have -1 oxidation state which is less stable as compared to -2 oxidation state of Oxygen in water.  In fact, it's so unstable that it's used as an oxidising agent as it readily releases nascent oxygen and reduces itself to water H2O. Thus H2O is highly stable and would not oxidise under normal conditions and hence it's non inflammable.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because water and hydrogen are two completely different things. When you do a chemical reaction you break and reform bonds and the result is something completely different in every conceivable way. I mean, think about it: Why are there only 118 elements and billions of distinct compounds? Why are there only 4 nuclei acids and thousands or millions of different animal and vegetable species? Why is sodium a pyrophoric soft metal and chlorine a toxic gas, but sodium chloride is a preservative and flavorant? Why does spearmint and rye smell and taste completely different. They are the same molelcule! They are just arranged different in space (enantiomers). Chemical changes are real changes. It's not only the flammability. It's the melting point, the boiling point, the polarity, the physical state and just about every property that you can think of that is different. Different chemical species are different. That's why chemistry is so fascinating and so useful. ",
