            "answer_text": "As a mathematician, my feeling is that physics (along with further natural sciences) has cared much less about its own foundations. As a result, there is much less consensus about what\u2019s science and what\u2019s not. What\u2019s a mathematical theorem is (or should) be clear to every professional mathematician, and 99.9999% of the proofs I know of will be accepted by 99.9999% of the mathematicians I know of. So, in maths the word theory is mostly used as a synonym for \u201cresearch field\u201d. Graph theory is the branch of combinatorics dealing with graphs, operator theory is the branch of functional analysis dealing with operators, and so on. There is nothing speculative about that, it\u2019s all about an approach to some relevant problems that can be dealt with in an interesting way (that once novel once, but not any more). Some open problems of maths can be solved by looking at graphs, or operators, or whatever currently studied objects; if not, a mathematician will (hopefully) one day introduce fsditiegvjdflkvx, produce an interesting fsditiegvjdflkvx theory and eventually solve the problem. In comparison, when I look at physicists - my closest relatives in the evolutionary tree of science - I feel that borders are fuzzier. A quantum physicist will typically have axioms (say, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation) and theorems deduced from them; whereas high energy physics seems to have dropped any formal rigor and has turned into a statistical science instead. (I\u2019m not judging or favoring either way of doing physics, but they *are* different approaches, each of them tailored for specific epistemic needs.) In physics, a theory is a set of related conjectures that should ideally be validated by experiments and might be therefore rejected at any time (in contrast to theorems, which cannot ever become wrong). Thus, physical theories are never eternal, they are only meant to yield the best possible fitting of available data involving lowest possible explanatory complexity. To make an example: Newton\u2019s gravitation theory is a very simple but not so mighty explanation of the universe; string theory is a not-so-simple but potentially much mightier explanation; and experimental data are as mighty as possible, as the perfectly fit the reality - they are the reality! - but cannot be summarized in a compact way unless a robust pattern is discovered. I wouldn\u2019t call experimental data a theory, to be honest. ",

            "answer_text": "From metaphysical perspective Physics is a branch of Mathematics which in turn is a branch of Logic, which as X/not-X describe the dual branches of Possibility. In other words, Physics is derived from the probability function which is derived from Possibility while math is derived from base two 1/0 logic, literally something/nothing which is implied by Possibility since Possibility is both something and nothing (think Schrodinger\u2019s Cat as a description of Possibility.)
