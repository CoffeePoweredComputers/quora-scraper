            "answer_text": "A photon will tend to interact with the electrons around an atom. If the electrons can absorb the energy of the photon, they will. If they can\u2019t, then they dont. So oxygen and nitrogen molecules cant absorb photons of visible light- they have no mechanism for absorbing energy in these particular quantities. They can abdorb somne frequencies of UV because the photon energy can be used to make them vibrate more. They can absorb some photons of UV because they can promote electrons to higher energy levels. When metals reflect- the electrons can easily move, they can absorb almost any amount of energy that a photon might have. However, the energy makes the electron move and its acceleration caused the electron to emit a photon just like the one it absorbed - this is reflection So the air transmits visible light (not opaque), it absorbs some UV and IR frequencies - (is opaque to these) and metals tend to absorb and re-emit (reflect) pretty well all frequencies.

            "answer_text": "For something to interact with light, its size must be on the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of light, or greater. Atoms are considerably smaller than the wavelengths of light which is why you can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d atoms. Opacity or transparency is a bulk property and is observed only when there are \u201cgazillions\u201d of atoms. ",
