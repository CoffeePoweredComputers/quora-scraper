            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t quite the same thing. Charcoal (the hardwood kind, not briquettes) has to be inoculated, first, to become biochar. There are many videos of this easy process on YouTube, and it\u2019s vital to do this step if you want to use the biochar right away. The lazy alternative is to shove the char into a compost pile for a year, then use it. this works fairly well, since it won\u2019t be absorbing nutrients from the soil like straight char will, but it isn\u2019t quite as effective as inocculating it because it won\u2019t have the ideal fungal/bacterial mix for your particular soil and plants, at least not at first.
