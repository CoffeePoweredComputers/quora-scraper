            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking to build your personal brand and become an authority in a certain topic, then it\u2019s worth it to start a podcast and a YouTube channel. Here\u2019s why -- and how to avoid the pitfalls. To showcase your expertise and own your niche, you need to provide a steady supply of high quality content. The best way to do that is to collaborate with others whose expertise complements yours. A podcast allows you to book these folks as guests and engage in conversations in which they share their knowledge while you also highlight yours. For example, my expertise is in social selling -- using social media conversations to spur sales. For my podcast, Business Banter, I\u2019ve booked CEOs, CMOs, experts in other parts of the sales world, and more. In every conversation, I\u2019m able to talk about different elements from my own experience while also learning from guests about what they do. It\u2019s also a fantastic way to reach new audiences. When I book a guest, they share the podcast with their audience, so new people discover me. Your podcast can bring brand awareness that you wouldn\u2019t get otherwise. And within each episode you can encourage people to visit your website and sign up for your email list. You can also use your podcast as a prospecting strategy. Is there someone you may want to do business with? Instead of contacting them to pitch your services, contact them to invite them onto your show. Explain honestly how much you value their insight on a certain topic, and why. It\u2019s one of the best ways to strike up a business relationship. Your podcast can give you a sense of legitimacy as well. When you reach out to people for business reasons, they\u2019re likely to Google you. When they do, your podcast will turn up and they\u2019ll get a sense of the depth and breadth of your knowledge. When people listen to your podcast regularly, they come to feel that they know you. They develop trust in you. When they have needs that speak to what you offer, they're likely to want to hire you. And when they know people who have those needs, they\u2019re likely to recommend you. It\u2019s only worth doing all this, however, if you\u2019re ready to have thoughtful, engaging conversations. If your material is superficial or boring, or if you just haven\u2019t done your homework about the guest, then you won\u2019t come across well. You\u2019ll miss out on the benefits a great show can bring. You\u2019ll also need to make a time commitment. I recommend that people block off a day each month to do four interviews. Then, release one per week. Also, only about a third of the time commitment will be spent researching and contacting guests and recording the conversations. The other two-thirds will be spent marketing it. That\u2019s where the YouTube channel comes in. You can, and should, use a YouTube channel for various purposes, including sharing your podcast. With so much content being created and uploaded every day across the country and all over the world, it can be difficult to break through the noise and be heard. So you need to be creative about promoting your content. I put my podcasts across multiple platforms, including a dedicated YouTube channel. I also take snippets and post them on LinkedIn. I recommend doing some paid Facebook ads to market your podcast as well. You can even use these to target people who have visited your website, and people on your email list. But while marketing is important, it\u2019s also crucial not to get too caught up in a numbers game. Far too many people stop their podcasts because they aren\u2019t getting a huge audience. But you don\u2019t need one. As I explained in the New York Times, there\u2019s no actual business value in a number of followers. The same goes for a number of listeners or viewers under this model (it\u2019s different if you\u2019re looking to sell ads on your show). The key is to use all these platforms as opportunities to connect with the right people to enhance your business and career. So if you do this right, over a period of a few months you should start to find that the work you put into your podcast pays off -- and that your YouTube channel is one of the big reasons for its success.

            "answer_text": "The answer is very simply\u2026 DO ALL OF THE ABOVE! I dont know about you, but personally, recording audio is much easier. Just as FYI, audio gets like 60X the amount of people then video does which seems counter intuitive until you think about it Podcast you can listen to while walking, driving, working out at gym, etc Here is what I show my clients to do (I promise Im about to share formulas with you that you have NEVER HEARD ANYONE ELSE SHARE, well at least the tools are my secret weapons & FREE)\u2026 BUT PLEASE, obviously Im sharing publicly but please dont anyone who see\u2019s this go create content re-sharing what Im sharing because then it gets onto blackhat forums and we lose the privileges. I literally was reason for WikiHow changing their entire model for adding content (my content was so liked, black hat peeps get into my Amazon S3 buckets & downloaded EVERY THING 300GB\u2019s of stuff each which I couldnt stop at time, they left awesome comments, probably best testimonials to date but couldnt use em lmao. In all seriousness, Ill share things that\u2019ll allow you to instantly get things done FOR FREE that most will tell you to go pay $20\u201330 per video. But first things first\u2026 OK, so personally Ill use Screenflow to record an audio my Mac & upload to my favorite service Ill tell u about in a second. OR just download the anchor app on iPhone, iPad, whatever and record your podcast for free. ITS SO COOL! They have intro & outro music, sound effects (ie cartoon sounds). transition sounds. You can add multiple segments to create a show. Actually, I just recorded an entire video that walks you through every single step of how to launch one of the hottest podcasts in your niche. My videos are ranked in Top 3 already for keywords phrases I wanted but I was checking Google & came across this post in search results. lol OK, back to steps\u2026 Getting started on Anchor which I literally show you how to do that step by step here\u2026 *** Im Just Getting Back Into Teaching IM After Taking A Few Years Off To Dominate Day Trading Niche\u2026 I Dont Even Have A Single Salesletter, Because Ive Decided Ill Be Giving AWAY EVERYTHING I TEACH FOR FREE\u2026 FOREVER! How I took a struggling company making like $60k a year for 6 years but sales hit brick wall.. I came in as partner and we did 1.2 million in sales\u2026 ALL WITH FREE TRAFFIC! AND grew a side company called Real Traders Webinar (lookup YouTube channel, one w 10k subscribers\u2026 I hosted every webinar with a different experts (and those webinar replays that I SEO\u2019d til today generate 30\u201350 leads a day for free (you can verify on socialblade.com)\u2026 EVEN THOUGH those experts presented the same exact webinar 100 times for other events. BUT SEO IS KEY ;-) BUT MY POINT WAS I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO SELL! Dont want my passion for helping others to be mistaken for pitching anything which its all how to get shit for free so here we go! ;-P HERE IS A SHORT 13 MINUTE VIDEO THATS JUST ABOUT USING ANCHOR & HOW COOL IT IS\u2026 Now if you want everything from picking the right topic, formulas for creating a sick \u201cBig Idea\u201d, I show you the power of that and so much more. This is the full video and 1 hour and 20 minutes I believe.  OK, so once youre done recording your episode (which if you rather do on a software, a killer software thats completely free and open source is called \u201cAudacity\u201d and it rocks. Honestly, its better this one because in Anchor I dont believe your can trim audios on desktop (but I know mobile app is way nicer) Once its done I then upload it to Anchor - The best way to make your podcast NOW WHY SHOULD YOU BE USING Anchor TO LAUNCH YOUR PODCAST? A. 100% COMPLETELY FREE NOW & FOREVER! B. They make it SO SIMPLE to do joint podcasts, you can have listeners call in, record audios to send you and so much more I cover in video. C. Theres a library of tools like cool transitions and sound effects. ITS UNBELIEVABLE! Most importantly, it will automatically submit your podcast to 11 of the top platforms including Apple iTunes Store, Amazon Alexa, Spotify, Stitcher, etc etc. OH YEAH AND you can activate sponsorship so that your listeners can donate money to you (either $0.99, $4.99 or $9.99 monthly) Otherwise you use paypal. i show this is video. ALSO CHECK THIS OUT SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU\u2026 Anchor if used to record a short podcast like 3 minutes or less i believe\u2026 THEYLL AUTOMATICALLY TURN INTO A VIDEO WHERE EVERY WORD YOU SAY IS LIT UP ON SCREEN LIKE THOSE SALESLETTER VIDEOS THAT WORD CRAZY WELL! What if the video is longer than 3 minutes, what then? Glad you asked\u2026 Wavve is a new company, cheap, free account for 1 audio available I believe, owner is very approachable and I believe provides such a useful service which is you upload an image, it grabs a waveform you choose & color, place over image and it plays and make it a video. BUT HERE IS THE KEY WITH THIS\u2026 THEY HAVE SET IT UP WITH PERMISSION OF SOCIAL MEDIA SITES\u2026 SO THEY WILL ACTUALLY PLAY IN THE NEWSFEED OF SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS! Check it out here and let owner know Kevin from Viralizers sent you and he\u2019ll take care of you (again, its free or even upgraded is nothing but just so my appreciation to such an awesome service) https://www.Viralizers.com/wavve OR, YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF WHICH IM TRYING TO DO BECAUSE I WANT SPECIFIC STYLE\u2026 ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS\u2026 I CAN SHARE THE AFTER EFFECT PROJECT IM WORKING ON WITH YOU AND YOU CAN CHANGE THE IMAGE TO SHOW YOU & FONT YOUR COMPANY NAME AND BE GOOD TO GO! OR, you can get a little help by going too\u2026 Graphic River - Fonts, Logos & Icons from GraphicRiver (find a nice motion background by searching for keywords like \u201caudio spectrum\u201d or \u201caudio visualizer\u201d. Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects, etc - you can figure out how to do this for free. Im actually working on one myself right now where it just has an audio waveform that actually moves based on my speaking\u2026 And is a nice distraction and now you have a video. Put a nice pic of you, your company name and waveform.  Here is an example of a podcast Ill watch (YUP WATCH) on my Apple TV, thats just a pic & audio waveform. And im ADHD so itll work for anyone lol  AIGHT GUYS, YOU READY FOR THE BEST NINJA FORMULAS I HAVE YET TO SHARE PUBLICLY, NOT EVEN ON THE Viralizers - Blogging, Podcasting, Tribe Building & Money Making! WEBSITE YET! So, we all hear these Gurus talk about how you should transcribe your videos by going to like Fiverr (which is its a 30\u201360 minute video youre looking at least $50+ and itll take days at that)\u2026 Or they\u2019ll say use Rev transcription service which is $1 a minute and again wait for turnaround. GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT\u2026 THERE IS A WEBSITE FOR A BRAND NEW SERVICE THAT F\u2019IN ROCKS!!! IT NOT ONLY TRANSCRIBES YOUR VIDEO\u2026 BUT YOU CAN EXPORT IT AND IN A FORMAT THAT HAS THE SAME TIME CODES SO THAT IT CAN LIKE ANCHOR MATCH THE WORDS\u2026 AS YOU SAY THEM! Now, heres some NINJA FORMULAS you can use this service for (AGAIN FREE) A. You upload the transcription, put in your email addy & in 5 MINUTES ITS SITTING IN YOUR EMAIL INBOX! B. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT GUYS, make sure you look at spots you said your company name, your name OR MOST IMPORTANTLY\u2026 THE SEO PHRASE YOU WANT TO RANK FOR! Make sure the transcription has all the right words and the phrase you\u2019re trying to rank for in YouTube, Google, etc. Simplest way to do this is to do \u201cFIND ALL AND REPLACE\u201d. i.e. the name of my company & podcast is\u2026 \u201cVIP - Viralizers Insiders Podcast\u201d\u2026 But my website is just Viralizers - Blogging, Podcasting, Tribe Building & Money Making!. Well, Viralizers isnt a word which means i know they spell it wrong. Usually they spell it \u201cVitalize\u201d so I just do a simple \u201cfind & replace all\u201d. C. It transcribes and segment each individual speaker and labels them. You can easily go in and change the names of \u201cSpeaker 1\u201d etc. D. One of my FAVORITE STRATEGIES\u2026 You export the transcription\u2026 You want to export the \u201c.vtt\u201d format which time coded. Then go back to your video on YouTube, edit the video, go to advanced and where it says \u201cCaptions, Upload Captions\u201d\u2026 You simply upload it right there and again, the words will match what you are saying AS YOU SAY IT! E. OK, here are some other things you ABSOLUTELY MUST DO WITH TRANSCRIPTION TOO\u2026 Place it into the YouTube description of the video. Thats a ton of seo packed food for the search engines in a description that most dont think to put anything but call to action. ALSO, take that transcription and write an article on LinkedIn.com Publishing, on Medium, obviously you want to BOTH EMBED YOUR VIDEO AND TRANSCRIPTION UNDERNEATH THE VIDEO! *** Some NINJA FORMULAS for placing the transcription on your blog/site. Some people dont like to have all that text on their site. What you can do is place all that text in a hidden section that opens and closes with the click of a link you put under the video. WHICH IS GREAT 2 FOLD\u2026 GIVES THE VISITOR OPTION TO READ TRANSCRIPTION\u2026 AND EVEN THOUGH THAT BOX IS HIDDEN UNTIL CLICKED\u2026 THE SEARCH ENGINES WILL BE ABLE TO SEE EVERY WORD OF THAT TRANSCRIPTION! Finally, you can always use that transcription, when it comes to your website\u2026 As a thing they can get in exchange for opting into your list or something cool like that!OR YOU CAN OFFER THIS AS YOUR BAIT FOR EMAIL\u2026 Its the transcription on the website of this company, and as the words get highlighted as the video plays in the top right corner. Check this out!!!The name of the service/company, I love em\u2026 Audio to Text Transcription Service | temi.comSometimes it says they\u2019ll be starting to charge $0.10 per minute for transcription which is 10 times cheaper than other. BUT, if you are really strapped and on a budget (again only allow people truly hurting use this)\u2026 If you have a gmail account, just add \u201c+1\u201d to your email address, really and truly, you can add whichever & as many characters after that \u201c+\u201d which services see as a new email address\u2026 However, GMAIL only goes by the actual email address. So you can create 1000 email addys\u2026 But all the emails sent to you are captured in same inbox (pretty cool right? but this is type of trick that spreads like wildfire & then people complain to company and we all lose. ;-P Aight guys, Ive already shared more than I ever was thinking of sharing\u2026 But again I hope you crush it, as well as all who commented or our reading this at some time in the future. Here is an example of the sharable link Temi gives you to share with your followers, friends, etc that goes to a killer transcription. ANOTHER BONUS, that transciption is of a video I did on how to pick the absolute best topic for crushing it with YouTube, iTunes and so many more! AND TO BRING THIS FULL CIRCLE\u2026 YOU WANT TO BE EVERYWHERE! Ill give you a final tip Ill be teaching in this season of Viralizers Podcast which is something Im calling\u2026 \u201cViralcasts!\u201d These are basically like a Podcast, BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO CRAZY TRYING TO CREATE MULTIPLE PIECES OF CONTENT A DAY\u2026 You simply find a cool study, a video from a Guru in your niche, or something funny\u2026 As long as its valuable\u2026 AND THEN YOU RECORD A 30\u2013120 SECONDS AUDIO CLIP THAT SAYS\u2026 \u201cHey guys, Im kevin, as you know Im all about seeing my audience crush it online\u2026 And boy do I have something to share with you\u2026 Its a study just done by Harvard that reveals X, Y, Z and it leads to JAW DROPPING blah blah blah. Make sure you check it out and save it somewhere safe for the day you need it because I promise youll be able to use information exposed in there for years to come. Again my name is Kevin DaSilva, Founder of Viralizers and guys make sure you download this report at http://viralizers.com/havardreport\u201d AND BOOM, THAT SIMPLE AND NOW YOU HAVE A VIDEO SHOWING THEM THE REPORT AS YOU RECORD A LIL 90 SECOND THING SENDING THEM TO THE REPORT\u2026 BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY WE DO IT? EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDNT CREATE THE CONTENT YOURSELF, ITS YOUR VOICE TELLING THEM TO GO DO XYZ, SO YOU TRAINING THEM TO TRUST YOU AND DO THE THINGS YOU SUGGEST THAT THEY DO! ALL IN 90 SECONDS! ;-P Good I could keep going but jusy trying to stress\u2026 NEVER CHOOSE YOUTUBE OR PODCASTING. INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK. YOU MUST BE ON EVERY SITE\u2026 EACH ONE IS DIFFERENT AND YOU PLAY TO IT. Take a snapshot in middle of video and add a quote bubble and turn into a meme for Twitter. audio goes to podcast, videos get uploaded to YouTube, to Facebook & to Instagram as a IG story. Yeah its a lot BUT YOU WANNA CRUSH IT\u2026 YOU GOTT GIVE THIS ALL YOU GOT AND THEN SOME! EXTRA BONUS TIP: If youd like to automate the process of taking every podcast episode & turn it into a video with the audio waveform\u2026 AGAIN ON AUTO (and its only like $12 a month but first 4 ep\u2019s free)\u2026 Then go to https://www.Viralizers.com/repurposeio <not affiliate link, I just always use easy to remember links but youll see no referral codes or drops. BASICALLY THIS TAKES A PODCAST AND TURN IT INTO A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE AND CAN SEND TO FACEBOOK PAGES &/OR GROUPS, TWITTER, ETC\u2026 ON AUTOPILOT (AKA NO ADDITIONAL WORK AT ALL). LAST BONUS TIP: There is one killer last tool I use called Designrr and what it does is it will turn your podcast, video, blog post, etc\u2026 Into an ebook that can be used as a free giveaway to build your email list ;-) https://www.Viralizers.com/designrr BASICALLY THIS TOOL WILL TURN PODCAST INTO AN EBOOK OR BLOG POST SO YOU NOW HAVE AUDIO, VIDEO AND ALSO EBOOK & BLOG POSTS! Now, you now all the tricks to launching a podcast and also how you can use that podcast to dominate on EVERY social network using Video since it converts higher than any other modality Hope you enjoyed this and found it valuable. Sorry for the long post, I carried away because I love this stuff ;-P ~Kevin ",
