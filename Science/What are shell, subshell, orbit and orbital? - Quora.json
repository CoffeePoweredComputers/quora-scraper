            "answer_text": "I was going to write this as a comment, but thought it better as a separate answer to contrast with some of the other answers. These are often used in chemistry interchangeably, but their is a difference from a physics perspective. The concept of an orbit (such as a planet has) is a classical one, i.e. typically non-relativistic and large bodies). It describes a single trajectory periodically retraced by the object. Shells/orbitals are better representations of relativistic particles confined by the laws of quantum mechanics where their wave nature begins coming into play. Electrons inside an atom were first described to me in high school chemistry when I first learned about quantum numbers as a spherical standing wave surrounding the nucleus. I've found that an apt description for why a shell would be a more appropriate label than an orbit. ",
