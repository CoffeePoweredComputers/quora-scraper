            "answer_text": "Radio and gamma are just names we use to categorize the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and are defined arbitrarily.  The highest frequency (gamma) rays we've detected are at 10^27 Hz. They come from other galaxies and nebula. It is believed that cosmic rays may exist as high as 10^30 Hz, but we haven't been able to measure them past 10^24. Beyond that, we don't know. There may be higher frequency sources out there that haven't reached us, or it may be that beyond those incredibly high frequencies the physics of particle interactions breaks down, but there's no known theoretical limit. On the low frequency end (radio), the theoretical limit is 0 Hz (infinitely long wavelength) but radiation at this frequency would be very hard to detect. The lowest we can detect on earth from space is about 14 MHz (the atmosphere blocks the rest). The lowest we can likely detect traveling through space is 30 Hz because the interstellar medium will block anything lower. Lightning can make extremely low-frequency radiation on earth at about 7.8 Hz. ",
