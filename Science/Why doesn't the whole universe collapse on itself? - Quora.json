            "answer_text": "In short we do not know. The universe is currently expanding and this should not be the case if gravity is the only factor. This is what \"Dark Energy\" and \"Dark Matter\" are they are names, place-holders if you will for whatever it is that is causing the expansion and causing it to speed up.(Dark Matter more deals with the unseen mass specifically) Also we know so very little about gravity and how it functions especially at very large scales, so maybe gravity does not work like we expect it to or it fluctuates in power at great distances in some undefined manner. More info on Dark Energy > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energyMore info on discrepancies of gravity on galactic scales > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_problem Also see > Ariel Williams's answer to Will dark energy ever be convertible to usable energy?
