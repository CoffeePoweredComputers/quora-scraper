Its safe and effective and critical to the economy U.S. Manufacturing costs are almost as low as China\u2019s, and that\u2019s a very big deal \u201cMade in the U.S.A\u201d is becoming more affordable. The reason? Fracking. U.S. Manufacturing costs are almost as low as China\u2019s, and that\u2019s a very big deal You don\u2019t need to a Nobel Prize in economics to know that the fracking revolution has been good for the U.S. What\u2019s not so well known is just how competitive cheap oil and gas has made American manufacturing. BCG, the Boston consultancy, estimates the average cost to manufacture goods in the U.S. is now only 5% higher than in China and is actually 10% to 20% lower than in major European economies. Even more striking: BCG projects that by 2018 it will be 2% to 3% cheaper to make stuff here than in China.

It is no more polluting than conventional rotary drilling. It is a combination of regular techniques to extract oil and gas from shale. It, like any other drilling technique has the slight potential to cause some harm but when well done is no more harmful than any other operation of its type. If it had been called regular offset shale extraction (ROSE) it would not be fodder for the professional alarmists. ",
