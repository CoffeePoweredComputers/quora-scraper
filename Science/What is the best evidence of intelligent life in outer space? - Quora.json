            "answer_text": "There is none other than the vast number of possibilities with 2 trillion Galaxies in the visible Universe , each with an average of 200 million or more stars. I feel that Intelligent Civilizations may be extremely rare , perhaps 1 in a trillion to 10 trillion Planets on average [ meaning far fewer than one Civilization in every Galaxy ]. We have only been an \u2018Advanced Civilization \u2018 for about 100 years so we have a limited search time and vast distances between Galaxies and the relatively slow speed of light which answer the \u2018 Fermi Paradox \u2018 - which starts with the assumption that \u2018Advanced Civilizations \u2018 are common with dozens or more \u2018Civilizations\u2019 per Galaxy. There may even be \u2018beacons \u2018 or traces of faster than light signals [which we can not yet detect nor understand ] used by \u2018Advanced Alien Civilizations \u2018 because we are not yet a truly\u2019 Advanced Civilization\u2019 ourselves\u2026 For example -I predicted that gravitational waves because they bend space would/could travel at faster than light speeds . This is probably why LIGO measured distant Gravitational Waves from a Neutron Star pair collision - and the gravitational waves arrived slightly earlier than the radiated energy . Truly \u2018Advanced Civilizations \u2018 may be able to create powerful Gravitational Waves by direct resonance without huge explosions is my point here. \u2018They\u2019 also may use quantum entanglement , etc. which we can not detect. \u2018They \u2018 have probably mastered gravitational fields so they have a local gravity in their \u2018 Spacecrafts\u2019 with fail safe layers of opposing gravity ( gravitational plywood) and don\u2019t experience G forces in these craft. They may have re-engineered their bodies to absorb radiation and convert it to energy - and no longer eat , and may have a solid state electrical nervous system , with a photosensitive type exoskeleton . They might look like large metallic insects with complex \u2018hands\u2019 to us . There are a growing number of military radar and visual encounters with UFOs by trained pilots which also raise the possibility - but do not prove the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. I think if there are enough of these credible recorded radar and visual encounters by pilots over the next 10 years or so , with additional verification, this might change . We have a growing ability to analyze Exoplanet atmospheres and eventually one will be detected with strong evidence of an industrial society ( with isotopes not found in nature , and other chemical signatures ,or perhaps a \u2018too clean filtered atmosphere \u2018 ) in the next 10 to 50 years , possibly . So far, we have no true scientific evidence , nor proof of extraterrestrial intelligent life, or any life beyond Earth. I think \u2018 simple life \u2018 will be much more common than the numbers I posted above - and get exponentionally more rare as the complexity of the organism(s) increases. We have merely speculation - like this posted answer. ",
