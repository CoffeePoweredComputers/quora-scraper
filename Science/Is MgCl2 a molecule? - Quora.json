            "answer_text": "The short answer: combining a metallic element (Mg) with a non-metallic element (Cl) leads to a transfer of elektrons. I this case from Mg to Cl. Mg is losing electrons, leaving positively charged entities called positive ions, and Cl is gaining electrons, leading to negatively charged particles, called negative ions. These positive and negative charged particles attract each other and are able to stack together in a regular manner to form compounds called salts. In a salt each positive ion is surrounded by a number negative ions, and each of the negative ions is surrounded by a number of positive ions. There is no exclusive kind of \u2018ownership\u2019. In this case there is no specific set of 1 Magnesium and 2 Chloride ions belonging together. In a molecule there is this specificity: e.g. CCl4: there is one C-atom surrounded by 4 Cl-atoms, bonded together via shared electron pairs within this special entity, called a molecule. The C-atom has no connection to a Cl-atom from a neighbouring molecule \u2192 1 C-atom combined with 4 designated Cl-atoms. ",
