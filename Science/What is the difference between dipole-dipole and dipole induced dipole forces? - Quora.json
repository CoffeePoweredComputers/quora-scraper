            "answer_text": "Consider HCl molecule is polar molecule and acts as dipole because Cl keep attracted shared electron hence partial -ve charge on Cl and partial +ve charge on H atom .. In Such these polarised HCl molecules, H+ of a molecule attracts e clouds of Cl- of other HCl molecules .. Other case where HCl gas it put with Non polar Cl2 gas (Cl-Cl) . If H+ of polarised HCl is near any Cl of Cl2, H+ attracts e from that particular Cl because having e deficient, then that particular Cl again attracts e from other bonded Cl and becomes partially -ve .. Thus polarity induced in nonpolar Cl2 because of polar HCl, this phenomenon is induced dipole .. (Cl---Cl) ( H+\u2014Cl-) => (Cl+\u2014Cl-) (H+\u2014Cl-) Polarity generated on non polar Cl2 is induced dipole here .. ",
