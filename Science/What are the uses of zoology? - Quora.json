            "answer_text": "Zoology includes: -The study of disease causing animals and how to prevent their spread. Dengue spreading mosquitoes, SARS virus from civets and bats, etc. Most human infectious diseases can be traced to an animal vector (malaria, plague) or an animal disease that jumped hosts (like SARS, or SIV from apes becoming HIV in humans), called zoonotic diseases. -Studying pests of plants and livestock. Same idea. -Animal identification. Was that snake that bit me venomous? Is this a termite or an ant? Was that a bear? Ask a zoologist. -Studies of animals we depend on. Fish, dogs, cows, horses, shrimps, cats. Especially those still hunted or fished from the wild: we need to study how they interact with the world, because what affects them affects us. -As a basic science. Think of all that genetics has given the world. We\u2019d have none of it without zoological studies of fruit flies and zebra fish that underpin it. Then there is evolution, the backbone of biology, which was based on studies of animal (and plant and fungal) diversity and physiology and development. -As an alternative to human studies. Animaks reproduce faster and many are seen as expendable, like mice. Better to test things on animals before trying them on humans, and sone experimemts just can\u2019t be done with people due to the time involved or sample sizes needed. Zoology helps interpret the data. -For joy. Do you have a favorite animal? Ever enjoyed a nature documentary? Ever saw an animated childrens film about animals? Zoology research underpinned it all.

            "answer_text": "Zoology in its broadest definition is all aspects of science that concern members of the animal kingdom. So it includes animal taxonomy (classification) and anatomy (including human anatomy), and physiology (again including humans), ornithology, mammology, ichtyology (remember Richard Dreyfuss in \u201cJaws\u201d?), entomology (insects), etc. As Matan has said, it tells us which species are friends or foes, it tells us a lot about our own health and that of the animals we depend on for food and other products. It also helps us to understand what we need to do to keep water clean and usable, and other things we need to know to ensure a clean environment for our own species. ",
