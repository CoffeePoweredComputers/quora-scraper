            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhich gases don't dissolve in water?\u201d The question is about the solubility of pure gases in water. Some pure gases dissolve in water at significant amounts, so we can consider them as water-soluble gases. Examples of water-soluble gases are: Carbon dioxide, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. But, some pure gases only dissolve in water at traces amounts, we can consider these gases as water-insoluble. Examples of water-insoluble gases: Hydrogen, nitrogen, helium, and methane. The solubility values of pure gases in water dramatically depend on the temperature (and pressure). For instance, the solubility values of carbon dioxide in water at 5 (refrigerator temperature) and 23 (room temperature) deg C are 3 and 1.5 g CO2/kg water, respectively. That is why when we move a bottle of soda drink out of fridge, lots of bubbles are formed and gas escapes out of bottle, because the solubility of CO2 in water drops to about half as a result of changing the conditions from refrigerator to ambient temperature.

            "answer_text": "The gases which will be most soluble in water are polar gases. Since water is polar, it can dissolve a polar gas as the \u201ccharged\u201d ends of water will pull apart the \u201ccharged\u201d ends of the gas. This is the concept of \u201clike dissolves like\u201d. (For an example of like dissolves like, see sodium chloride in water. NaCl has two very strong polar ends: Na+ and Cl-. Hence, the oxygen on water (negatively charged) will pull on the Na+, while the hydrogens on water (positively charged) will pull on the Cl-, and the NaCl will be pulled apart and dissolved.) On the flip side, with a non-polar gas, water has nothing charged to grab onto. Hence, a non-polar gas will not be dissolved by water (almost always; like all chemistry rules, there are a few exceptions to this). So - your question really is \u201cwhich gases are non-polar?\u201d That\u2019s something you can search online, but a sample includes: H2, N2, CO2, O2, CCl4, and CH4. A sample of polar gases, which therefore will dissolve in water, includes: NH3, SO2, H2S, and C2H6O. However, it is important to note: all gases dissolve in water, just to varying degrees. When we say a gas \u201cdoesn\u2019t dissolve\u201d in water, we really mean that it only slightly dissolves in water. Hence, we can still talk about CO2 and O2 dissolving in water, since they do dissolve\u2014slightly. In addition, the more pressure you apply on a gas, or the lower the temperature of the water is, the more of the gas will dissolve. So even the non-polar gases I listed above will significantly dissolve in water if the situation is right. ",
