            "answer_text": "Strongest theory?No, thus far, the most well proven theory of our more fundamental forces of the universe. Various quantum mechanical theories are nearing equality.We currently utilize electronic devices, such as tunneling diodes and well, most semiconductors, based upon quantum mechanical theory.Indeed, we have quantum computers, albeit quite crude. Relativity works well at extremes, extreme velocities, approaching the velocity of light in a vacuum, gravity around stars warping space-time, mass/energy equivalence being one thing, so that a fuckton of photons in a small area actually will gravitationally act and quantum mechanics still has yet to give an excellent solution, let alone a good one, but give things time, some group will eventually solve that issue. Oh, following the logic through and you realized that a small enough ball of photons or even a superenergetic photon could collapse into a black hole? Yeah.Yeah, stick a Planck hot photon within a Planck unit, within Planck time unit, you have a singularity, which would instantly evaporate.Put all of the Planck units together, our current models turn into poop, or maybe a big bang or puncture a metastability island of a metastable vacuum we\u2019re hanging around or something else.Likely, some still undiscovered or poorly illuminated part of physics.Who knows? This might give someone an idea to explore to solve some of these questions. Relativity, both general and special are important, but they\u2019re merely components of how everything works and that\u2019s something that is incessantly, with massive efforts, being worked upon. Relatively recently, the Higgs boson was revealed, that gives hints. Similar small things also help reveal other components of how our universe works. Nature bombards us with particles of higher energies than any physicist today could imagine creating here on earth, on orders of magnitude higher, (add another zero to the number or two, or occasionally, three or four) than what we can create in a collider. Disagree? Show me how a Zener diode works and how a tunneling diode works, then show me how a laser works.Two of those principles are root and key to making your computer work. The one not present is only disguised, via a more complex process. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure we should be trying to rank all theories in theoretical physics by rank or choosing any one of them as strongest. Relativity is however extremely strong, to the point of being typically being taken as a given by physicists, because of how much it explains. I say typically, because as always there is openness to better theories. It\u2019s just that physicists lack good leads for investigating how it might be incorrect, if it is. One way to see how strong relativity is, is to consider the relationship it has with all the rest of physics. Non-relativistic (Newtonian) mechanics is used a lot because it is simpler, but it is used in contexts where Newtonian mechanics is known to approximate relativistic mechanics very closely. Meanwhile, in cases where they disagree relativity has been extensively confirmed. So in this sense, relativity has become part of all the other theories, and confirmed along with them. Approximations which don\u2019t take it into account are used but not because there\u2019s evidence of their being correct where they diverge from it. (We can make a similar case for quantum theory. People do not use quantum versions of physical theories all the time, but when they don\u2019t, it is normally because it is simpler to ignore it.) Relativity is essentially a kind of symmetry that is imposed on all the other theories in physics. It is allowed to invent a \u201cnon-Lorenz invariant\u201d theory, but nobody has had any luck in explaining anything with one. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is one of the most precisely confirmed theories about a narrower range of phenomena. It was developed as a continuation of efforts to make a relativistic version of quantum mechanics. If any of its main ingredients- including both relativity and quantum theory- were fundamentally wrong, it\u2019s hard to imagine how it would succeed in being so close to correct in the answers it gives. Any serious challenge to relativity would have to explain the same experimental results, in effect showing why they act so much like QED is true. Particle accelerators provide fairly direct confirmation that particles going at close to the speed of light have a much higher momentum than [math]mv[/math] (where [math]m[/math] is the rest mass as usual, and [math]v[/math] is the velocity), closely matching in fact what relativity says it is. Recent measurements of gravitational radiation from colliding black holes and neutron stars has helped add to physicists\u2019 confidence in general relativity under the most extreme conditions. Gold is gold-colored because the innermost electrons in gold atoms are moving fast enough for relativity to affect their energy level in the atom. The GPS system has its clocks calibrated to compensate for the time-dilation effect of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. The spin-statistics theorem ( Spin\u2013statistics theorem - Wikipedia ) assumes relativity and concludes that bosons have integer spin, while fermions have spin of an integer plus [math]1/2[/math]. If relativity were not correct, it would be possible to have spin [math]0[/math] fermions. The fact that we don\u2019t see any seems explained by relativity being correct (at least up to a point). According to the Wikipedia article about CPT symmetry ( CPT symmetry - Wikipedia ) there has been controversy over whether it follows from relativity. Relativity seems at least to help explain it. Relativity and quantum theory have survived for a really long time, while the rest of physics has been reshaped, in large part because of them. It is certainly possible that they are wrong in some way, but I don\u2019t think one should assume so. ",
