            "answer_text": "A metallic bond has valence electrons free to move throughout the structure, leaving behind positive metal cations - this makes the metal malleable and conductive. They are formed by the attraction of a metallic cation with a mobile electron. Most bonds form due to elements try to achieve a stable valence shell like a noble gas and end up sharing outer shell electrons (or donating/accepting them for ionic) to achieve this. Halogens and alkali metals have a low ionization energy and easily gain or lose an electron, respectively, to form an ionic bond. The driving force is the attainment of the stable, noble gas configuration by 2 elements by donation or reception (not sharing) of valence electrons. Ionic bonds are polar and conduct electricity when in solution, since the ions are mobile in solution. Unlike metallic bonds, ionic bonded structures are brittle in the solid state because electrons are not mobile in the solid ionic compound (it's then an insulator in the solid state). Covalent bonds involve sharing of electrons to achieve a stable valence state. it is formed by 2 non- metallic elements of similar electronegativities - electrons are shared rather than donated. Covalent bonds are in a fixed orientation, such as tetrahedral for carbon (4 valence shell electrons) singly bonded with four other atoms to fill its valence shell with 8 electrons (carbon can also form double and triple bonds with different geometries, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of the question). Covalent compounds do not always or even usually form crystal lattices like ionic and metallic bonds. They can have dipole moments (partial charge on electronegatively different elements like in the C-O bond) and conduct electricity or be electrically neutral without much polarity in the structure.

            "answer_text": "Well, these all are chemical bonding. They concern with electrons only but not with the atomic nucleus. Similarities between these various types of bonding are : Valence electrons are involved.Some attractive force always exists.They follow octet or duplet rule.All lead the involving atom to stability.Yeilding compound always has different properties than the reactant.All bonds can influence the physical properties of the yeilding compound.In fact, all the properties of chemical bond are the similarities between these bondings. Edit: This is originally answered to the question asking for similarities of these bonding. And the content managing team of quora merged two different questions asking for similarities and differences. This must be revised. ",
