We don\u2019t \u201cpipe up\u201d and tell an non believer in a church that they\u2019re just flat out wrong because many if not all of those present agree in this particular non-belief and you know those people aren\u2019t constrained by reason in their reactions to such statements. Pragmatically and in view of everyone\u2019s right to speak their mind or their position on things including Science, we can reasonably restrict ourselves to rebuttals only when the person expressing non belief in Science is trying to cause a general reaction against Science and scientists. When someone does this: it\u2019s an action which may effect everyone negatively and we are part of \u201ceveryone\u201d in the United States. ",

What if it's someone you care about? What do you say to a science denier who is also your father? Your mother? Your best friend from college? Your roommate? What do you say when your dad thinks your girlfriend's gay brother is unnatural? When your roommate dumps used car oil in a drain, saying everything is fine from an idea that climate change and pollution are somehow myths? What do you say to someone who doesn't believe in science, that you still want to respect and love? ",

There is a story by the great Issac Asimov, about a robot who was built to have good \u201creasoning\u201d abilities, to enable the robot to replace humans on a special station. http://addsdonna.com/old-website/ADDS_DONNA/Science_Fiction_files/2_Asimov_Reason.pdf Show him the story, and I would suggest challenging him as to what he actually does believe, and figure out what he believes, and find out why he believes that. I suspect you\u2019ll find a lot of things in a very short period of time that he believes, but he would be incapable of testing them for himself. ",

You can\u2019t reason with science-deniers, because science is reason validated by experience. About all you can do is point out that the science denier could not listen to Rush Limbaugh or read Breitbart if not for science. While you walk away consider that the science denier might pull his/her genes out of the gene pool by not vaccinating their kids. ",
