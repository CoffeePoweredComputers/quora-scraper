            "answer_text": "I thought about this long and hard for many, many months before it became clear to me. I will attempt my best to convey my thoughts. Time is man-made. Asking for the start of time is actually irrelevant. (Stay with me.) Time is man-made in the sense, we invented a marking system. (As others here have answered.) We made a marking system by observing patterns in our sky (sun, stars etc.) That in turn, led us to predict in some sense what was to come next. Well, that is the point of observing patterns, isn\u2019t it? We defined 24 hours, with 60 minutes and 60 seconds in each, yes? What happens in a second, really? The earth moves a certain distance around the sun, the sun moves a certain distance around the galaxy core, the galaxy moves around in some orbit or even in a non-circular path, it doesn\u2019t matter. As well as light moves too, though at light speed. So for every inch that earth moves, light moves 3 * 10^8 kms. This happens repeatedly with no change \u2018perceived\u2019 in a significant way by earthlings. (Disclaimer: For the next part - for simplicity of calculation, I will use some example numbers which are nowhere near the actual numbers.) From the moment of conception of the universe assuming the big bang as our reference point and the formation of the sun, let\u2019s say the sun revolved around the galaxy core so far 10,000 times. During it\u2019s 2000th revolution, Earth was formed. Since then, Earth has made some 40000 revolutions. Man evolved during its 36000th revolution and he observed the first pattern during 38000.5th revolution of the earth around the sun and started to record TIME. So what we are saying now is the first ever RECORDED calendar day, the first ever RECORDED second is during the 38000.5th revolution of earth around the 2000th revolution of the sun around its galaxy core which has moved 365478 billion kilometers (linear) or 96000 revolutions(circular) around whatever it is revolving. How on earth was primitive man supposed to know it was the 38000.5th revolution of earth around the 2000th revolution of the sun around its galaxy core which has moved 365478 billion kilometers (linear) or 96000 revolutions(circular) around whatever it is revolving? We didn\u2019t. So we started from 1 using the concept of local time. According to us, we observed the first rotation of earth on its axis, the first revolution of earth around the sun etc. (Inserting approximate numbers for the next part) However with the discovery of atoms and radioactivity, the advent of atomic clocks, methods to calculate how far other galaxies are from us using light, mass, radiation etc. , we know what a second is made of - exactly how many cycles of radiation a Cesium atom has to give out between energy states to make one second (9,192,631,770 cycles) . We know that the calculated age of the universe is approximately 15 billion years i.e 9,192,631,770 * 15,000,000,000*365.25*24*60*60 cycles of a Cesium atom has to give out between energy states old. That my friend is what we call time. Every second we add 9,192,631,770 to this number and if we didn\u2019t invent hours, minutes, seconds and clocks, if we ever had to meet at an agreed upon \u2018time\u2019, without time I would say I would like to meet you at some A =(9,192,631,770 * 15,000,000,000*365.25*24*60*60+(9,192,631,770*n)) cycles where A has not yet occurred. Good luck figuring that out. Anywhooo, all this is to say that the \u2018start\u2019 of time is when the Cesium atom made its first repetitive motion. Or The first pattern of anything that ever occurred in the universe like an atom\u2019s spin or a quark\u2019s vibration. It is when the concept of time gained the ability to make sense. The first repetition of something was the second occurrence of that same thing, thus making counting a thing of sense. So given we are at (9,192,631,770 * 15,000,000,000*365.25*24*60*60+some x) cycles down from the start, it all started at 1. When is 1 ? :-) Does it make sense to ask that? It makes sense to ask which cycle we are in at the moment, given things started at 1 or (9,192,631,770 * 15,000,000,000*365.25*24*60*60+some x) ago. That\u2019s why asking what is the start of time is, is irrelevant. Because we would always say \u2018x many cycles ago from the present moment\u2019 and no matter what, its relative and absolute value will always be 1. Pattern - this is the key to everything. Life, death, everything! I hope to write more about this as well as time-dilation due to velocity on my personal blog. On a side note: Imagine living in a universe with no patterns. No single event would ever repeat itself, there is nothing common or associable about events happening now and events happening a second later. I could be in my bedroom this moment, drowning in the ocean the next, taking care of a pet the next and playing with my toy as a child in the next and in everyone of those moments, I am not the same person with the same qualities, I don\u2019t look or resemble my self in the previous moment. Like I said, nothing common. :) That is a truly \u2018timeless\u2019 universe. There is no concept of I, you, them because nothing is actually persistent except the quality of non-persistence. (In my mind, it\u2019s a beautiful space :-) ) Hope I didn\u2019t bore you to death. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "I just want to add a short perspective to the excellent answers already given by Jay Wacker and Alex Tamkin.  It starts like this... How do we know the direction of the arrow of time? Now, it's clear time has an arrow.  We measure time passing by various devices, by the expansion of the Universe, and each of us certainly subjectively perceives time passing.  But the laws of physics are mostly time-reversible, so the question is, where does the arrow of time come from? The most obvious place is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, one of the few physical laws that is not time-reversible (in other words, specifies a direction for the arrow of time).  It says that a system becomes more disordered as time passes.  And, in fact, every device we use to measure the passage of time relies on increased entropy in some way or other.  A spring winds down, sand or water flows downhill, an electric current is drawn from some source, or an unstable atom decays.  Even a pendulum clock, which at first glance doesn't appear to rely on increasing entropy, does so nonetheless -- with each swing the pendulum fractionally loses energy (it must, as it drives some mechanism to record the ticks).   So if time is measured as increasing disorder, it follows that the beginning of time was the point of maximum order in the Universe.  There could be no time \"before\" this time, because the way we measure the passage of time is increasing disorder, and there was no time of less disorder.  Defining the Big Bang as (by definition) the point of maximum order solves one of the mysteries of the Big Bang -- we know that it was a period of very low entropy, but there would seem to be no physical reason why the Big Bang should be a point of low entropy.  Unless, of course, it is  defined as the point of minimum entropy. Recently, a number of teams of physicists have looked at this problem, and done simulations with particles interacting gravitationally.  They find that such a system eventually reaches a point of minimum entropy, called the \"Janus point\".  This point has no past (no period when entropy increased to get to that point) and two futures -- both of which have increasing entropy).  It sounds insane -- our common sense tells us that one of the two \"futures\" of the Janus point is \"really its past\".  But any observer would see entropy increasing in the time direction towards the Janus point, and would therefore label the Janus point the \"beginning of time\".  See: The arrow of time ",
