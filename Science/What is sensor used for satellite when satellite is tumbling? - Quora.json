            "answer_text": "The sun sensor is most commonly used as an attitude reference. The sun is bright and easy to detect, so you rotate until you see the sun and then stabilize. The other thing for low earth orbit is a magnetometer. You can do what\u2019s called a Bdot process that attempts to reduce the rate of change of the magnetic field. If you\u2019re reasonably stable, the magnetic field as you orbit changes slowly (except over the poles), so detumbling by minimizing the magnitude of Bdot (the first derivative of the magnetic field vector B) that works fairly well. It\u2019s also handy because you can use magnetic torquers to generate the torques to do the move. ",
