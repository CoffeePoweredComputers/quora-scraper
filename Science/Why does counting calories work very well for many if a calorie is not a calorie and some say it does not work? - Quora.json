            "answer_text": "First of all, there is evidence that counting calories doesn\u2019t actually work all that well. There are lots of reasons. For instance, consider serving size. If you ignore everything but calories, you might prefer some relatively calorie dense but small serving of something to a relatively less dense but ultimately greater number of calories from a more satisfying food. Thus, it might be easy to win that immediate battle, but an hour later, you are looking for something else to eat, and end up eating as many or more calories than if you had just picked a different food to begin with. Just because a food has few calories doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy or should be preferred to other alternatives. I spent a lot of time eating Weight Watchers meals a few years ago. Now, they just make me sad. The reason I picked them was because it was literally easier to count. But in the grand scheme of things, I\u2019d probably be better off eating fresh fruit, vegetables and lean meats, and ignoring the counting almost entirely. Calorie counting also leads to unrealistic expectations. The phrase goes \u201c3500 calories == 1 pound.\u201d Thus, if you create a 500 calorie deficit per day, you lose a pound. But it never works that way. The Calorie Theory - prove it or lose it The phrase creates an unrealistic (and unsupported) expectation which can discourage dieters. It also leads to the idea that if cutting 500 calories from your diet is good, then cutting 700, or 1000 must be better and get you to your target weight faster. It reinforces a different kind of bad eating habit that does damage to your resting metabolism. Not good.  Counting calories can be helpful if not taken to extremes. Often, we don\u2019t understand the food choices that we make. For instance, imagine that you go out to eat at Macaroni Grill to celebrate with friends. Without an estimated calorie count, you have the entire menu of food, and no guidance as to what food might be the best thing to eat. As it happens, I like a lot of their food, and would probably be just as happy with any of several different dishes. For instance, if you were on a diet, would you pick Lobster Ravioli or Mushroom Ravioli? As it happens, Lobster Ravioli is only 600 calories, and Mushroom Ravioli is 930. As it happens, I like the Lobster Ravioli better, and can even have a glass of wine with it, and be pretty confident that I\u2019m on track. How about comparing Penne Rustica (chicken, shrimp, cream, pscuitto and parmesan) with Eggplant Parm? 950 to 1340 calories. Is that what you would guess? I like their Penne Rustica probably more than Eggplant Parm, but I\u2019ve had people recommend that latter because it \u201chas more vegetables.\u201d Additionally, tracking your food intake and counting calories can also simply keep you from eating out of boredom or habit. Thoughtless snacking can be a big problem and the kinds of food that we often have as snacks are more calorie dense, which makes the problem worse. Ultimately though, your body is more than your weight, and your diet is more than the sum of its calories. ",

            "answer_text": "A calorie is a calorie\u2014it\u2019s a constant value(of energy). Just as a centimeter will always be the same length, no matter what you measure, a calorie is the same, no matter what you eat. Just because a table might be very large or small, we don\u2019t argue that the centimeter is not a centimeter; and in the very same way, just because a cookie has more calories, it doesn\u2019t change the value of a calorie. In fact, the calorie was first used as a unit of measurement in physics. Why I bother arguing this I don\u2019t know, since there is, and I can\u2019t understand why, so much debate about it. So, what is really meant when you\u2019re told a bar of chocolate has more calories than a salad is that the chocolate bar provides more potential energy, to be released when we exercise(or otherwise metabolize). The calorie isn\u2019t a unit of fat, carb, or sugar, etc. , and just because some things have more calories doesn\u2019t change its value. The issue arises when we don\u2019t use that energy\u2014then it just sticks around for later use. Calorie counting is a very effective way of maintaining weight, so long as we do it\u2014as well as putting the information to good use. The reason why it is effective for me is because I know I must have certain food in my day to maintain health, but I cannot breach my calorie intake. I can eat a huge salad, with beans and avocado, as a 500 calorie (+/-) meal, that will give me all the nutrients I need with very little cost\u2014and I will be happily full. If I eat one whole chocolate bar (also around 500 calories), I won\u2019t have room for the salad, and, at a high caloric cost, I\u2019ll get very little nutrition. And, the chocolate bar is visually smaller than the salad, and will take less time to eat, so I won\u2019t feel as happy with my \u201csmall\u201d snack, and probably eat more. Turns out, that with an hour of strenuous exercise, plus the small physical tasks that everyone does in the day, I can have that chocolate bar as well as three healthy meals(pushing it a little if you eat dairy or meat in every meal). However, I can\u2019t have two. Thus, counting calories gives me a realistic perspective on the quantity of food I eat, as well as its effects. Calorie counting is time-consuming in the beginning. However, after you learn a rough estimate on how many calories your general foods have, it becomes easier to have a routine that doesn\u2019t require writing everything down and doing the math. ",
