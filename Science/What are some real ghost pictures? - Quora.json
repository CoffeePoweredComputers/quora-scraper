            "answer_text": "Are there any real ghost pictures? Yes there are. But you will never satisfy sceptics. I can offer you an image taken a very long time ago - about 100 years ago. Long before photoshop. The spirit is extremely clear, even though the image, having been scanned by me out of a book, is rather poor quality. The spirit is well known to \u201cus\u201d, having conversed many many times with the male in the photo who is her soul mate. So the male is Dr. Leslie Stone, a spiritualist all his life, and the spirit is Mary Kennedy. A large number of her communications are recorded on my web site.  Here is a typical lovely dovey message from Mary: Mary says that her soulmate love for Leslie is like a consuming flame. It is the one great love outside of the Father\u2019s Love. December 16th, 1916 Received by James Padgett Washington D.C. I am here, Mary Kennedy. Well, I will not be left tonight as I was a few nights ago when Kate wrote her message of love to her brother, for while I really enjoyed Kate\u2019s message of love, yet I was a little disappointed that I could not say a few words. Well, I know of no more interesting subject to me than that of love and I could write of it until you might become very tired. I mean physically tired, but I will not do so now, for while you may think I am selfish in this particular I really am not, and you will understand me when I tell you that this love is with me in such intensity that it is a consuming flame. I mean that it is the one great love outside the Father's Love that forms a part of my existence. Of course, you must not infer from this that I have not love for all mortals and spirits, be they relative or friends or not, for I have, and my work is in trying to help them in their unhappiness and sufferings. But as you have a soulmate who loves you and you have some of that soulmate love yourself, you will understand that it cannot be divided by any other love, and that it is only a little less than the Divine that can make two soulmates completely happy. Well, I heard you and I admit that I have it bad, and am glad of it, and would not lose one iota of it for all the world. Just you wait until you get it bad and then you will understand that I am not expressing to any very great degree how bad I have it. Well, as we are all in one boat, as the saying is, in this matter, I will not think that your expression means anything more than an approval of my feelings. I have enjoyed your conversation tonight and I am so happy that there is so much Love in your souls and that you are seeking for more. Persevere and you will not be disappointed, and you will find that it is not mere speculation but the great truth of the universe, or rather, the Celestial Spheres. Helen says that she agrees with all that I say and that she is glad that I. told you the truth when I said that she loves you with all her heart and soul. Well, I will not write more now. With my love, Mary. [1] [1] Mary says that her soulmate love for Leslie is like a consuming flame. ",

            "answer_text": "QUESTION: Has anyone gotten true ghost pictures you can show me? My God (Maybe yours too!). \u201cAre You Seriously asking this question?\u201d Here\u2019s the thing. I have been an interested party of all things Paranormal since my early teenage years. I am about 59 today. Studied Demonology under Ed & Lorraine Warren. Studied Near Death Experiences (NDE\u2019s) and what happens according to their testimonials after being revived back to life under Dr. Raymond Moody. Studied Spontaneous Combustion under Michael Harrison. Now I work with about 100 of the absolute best Paranormal Investigators in the english speaking world. Another hundred of the most stunning Psychics ever to read your/my mind. They tend to answer my questions on Facebook & Messenger before I finish typing them\u2026consistently. I am considered an extraordinary Paranormal Scientist and Investigator as well as a Medium with an unquestionable reputation. By who? A New Line Cinema Movie Producer who offered me my first movie deal for my Life Story. Gotta talk to the deceased everyday at least, right? Guess who? The Chorus; the most famous Spirit Team working on Paranormal Cases Worldwide! The Chorus lives with me 24 Hours a day. They talk just like your best friend. They are extremely intelligent, insightful, and knowledgeable. When I get upset, they rub my back. When I need to know what to do next, they share with me the immediate future which is usually about 90% correct. The Chorus project themselves to our case\u2019s haunted location in seconds. Even talk to the Haunting Entities to see if anything can be worked out before Spiritual Warfare/Exorcism has to begin. Check my Facebook Profile under PC Knickles. So the question is: Has anyone gotten true ghost pictures you can show me? Answer: My professional opinion is unequivocally : Yes. Without any question at all. How many photos? Several Hundreds of Thousands Worldwide. If you include Orbs which ARE Deceased Souls that some call \u201cGhost Orbs\u201d; INTENSELY UNLIMITED. In excess of 100 million from the 7.6 Billion Total World Population. I am not kidding. \u201cImagine That!\u201d. BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU! Prove it to yourself. Go to Google. Type in \u201cGhosts\u201d but hit \u201cimages\u201d instead of just \u201center\u201d. You will see so many true Ghost Photos, I am sure you will get bored to death (get it?) and stop looking. Let me assure you the vast majority are Real. They just aren\u2019t that many people that want to take the time to fake photos of any kind. It just isn\u2019t fun to do after your first few if any. P.S. If it still isn\u2019t enough, go to the other search Engines and do the same. Bing.Yahoo.Ask.comBaidu.Wolframalpha.DuckDuckGo.If it STILL IS NOT ENOUGH, go to other countries\u2019 Search Engines and do the Ghost Image Search on them! If you still need to talk to a human who can lead you to the Ghosts and help YOU take the photos, look up your closest local Paranormal Society at www.paranormalsocieties.com They are in every major city in the US. Contact one and hire their least competent Ghost Hunter to take you out to their least haunted local site where you will undoubtedly get so many photos you will walk away bored out of your mind. It is that common. Thank You for asking the question. You have given me a reason to live. -peter Oh Yeah\u2026 Here\u2019s one of my favorite Ghost Photos. Seems like the Ghost is still alive and kicking. Could that be true - still alive? Of course it is alive. Thus he (the ghost) still has to look at the pretty, somewhat undressed women. Let\u2019s call the photo: Hot Tub Ghosty Normally, you would owe me about two grand for solving your case in about 15 minutes. But I\u2019ll let it pass-on. (get it?)  ",
