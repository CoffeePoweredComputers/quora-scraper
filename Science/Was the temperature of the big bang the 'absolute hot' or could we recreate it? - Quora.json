            "answer_text": "Oddly, no one really answered the question with Quantum Field Theory, which is our best explanation (so far) of the Standard Model. At a hotter and then hotter temperature, the actual laws of physics start to merge- NOT break down! First, the Electromagnetic Field merges with the Weak Field. Then the Strong Field merges with them. It is presumed, that at a temperature 10^32 Kelvin (called the Planck Temp.) the final force of Gravity also merges with those three. Once you get your head around that- it is thought that the separation (or FREEZING-OUT the fields or forces) as the Universe cooled, locked in our particular laws and values of constants. We have no clue as to why these particular laws or constants, nor why at those cooler and cooler temps. The best thing we can really say, is at the Planck Temperature, all four forces (now called fields) were one. A concept called Symmetry Breaking, is that the Universe broke into separate components as it cooled off, and Gravity broke off first. By comparison, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland has achieved 10^13 K. It would be absurd to imagine that we could get to that high of and exponent, as the 13th power vs. the 32nd power is beyond any conceptual comprehension by any human. So, in conclusion, we can NEVER reach Planck\u2019s Temp., or \u201cabsolute hot.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If by absolute hot you mean Planck\u2019s Temperature, then yes. Planck\u2019s temperature is the maximum amount of heat that space can endure until it virtually collapses (1.42*10^32 Kelvin). I you think about the frequency of a photon (the particle responsible for heat) the energy which creates heat is so great that the frequency of the wave meets (or goes lower than) Planck\u2019s length, or the minimum size of an object in the universe. Basically, this states that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense singularity which gave rise to matter, which eventually cooled off. We can still see this heat from the early infancy of our universe by observing the cosmic microwave background in space. You could attempt to create such a temperature by colliding high energy particles to create a quark-gluon plasma, one of the highest energy states of matter\u2019s counterparts. ",
