            "answer_text": "We take ourselves to be human. But can the human be a human without the cells being cells, the molecules being molecules, the atoms being atoms, the quarks being quarks? Can the human be a human without belonging to a society of humans, without the atmosphere, the earth, the solar system, the galaxies, the stars? In close inspection of the human, he is only human when observed from a certain distance. Zoom in and you lose the human and find a patch of skin. Then organs. Then cells. Then molecules, and so on. Whatever you come up to, you lose.Zoom out from the observed human, and you will find his town, his continent, his planet (Earth), his solar system, and so on. So what is a thing? Is it not only what it appears to be depending on the distance it is observed from? Does it actually have its own independent existence \u2014 or is that an illusion? Can the human exist without everything that makes it up \u2014 within and without? Can anything at all exist independently or are all things interdependent? Isn\u2019t it an illusion, then that things exist (on their own)? Everything must essentially be one thing, its appearance changing depending on the distance it is observed from. The most fascinating question is \u2014 as we zoom in on the human and pass the molecules and atoms, reaching the quarks \u2014 what do we find at zero distance? What is at the very center of it all? Or, going the other direction, as we zoom out past the planet, solar system and eventually the universe in its entirely \u2014 what shall we find? Interestingly, I suggest we would find emptiness. If everything we close up on or move away from ceases being itself, at some point we must find no-thing: \u201cSomething\u201c that is not a thing and yet appears as things. Something illusive, ungraspable, yet not nothing. It, itSelf, is the true reality of all things. The reality behind their appearance, if you will. That one \u201cthing\u2019 (no-thing) that is everything. For more information on this, have a gander at this video:  And check out The Headless Way Blessings! ",

            "answer_text": "Great question and yes, absolutely! There are two sets of physics. There is the primary physics that is the real underlying mechanicsThere is the secondary physics, that which a conscious being or measuring device experiences. This secondary physics emerges from the primary and is the \u201cillusion\u201d that we experience as our world.The basis of our primary physics is the tiny exponential expansion of all matter - about 1 millionth of an atom\u2019s size per second squared. This expansion occurs perpetually in the frictionless environment of infinite empty space. This tiny dynamic is greatly leveraged and drives and animates our universe and all that we experience. Our senses and measuring equipment are calibrated to not directly feel or sense this expansion but we see and feel all of the effects of this primary physics as the instantaneous relative geometry of this expanding matter. This is the illusion we experience. I don\u2019t want you to take my word for it. I want you to deduce it all and picture it all yourself but I will give you just a tiny example to get you started. When you \u201csee it\u201d, you will ask yourself, \u201cWhy did I not see this all along?\u201d You will then also have the basis to see how everything can be and indeed is driven by this different set of underlying physics. The brief example I will give you is gravity. Science has been baffled by this red herring of an invisible magical pulling force that makes everything attract, including you being attracted to the earth, even though it defies the very basis of physics, the Conservation of Energy in that there is no visible power source. Instead, assume that all matter is expanding exponentially at this tiny rate. This would mean that the earth would be expanding outward like an inflating balloon. If it was, then you would feel this weight force from under your feet as the acceleration pushes you outward. So what do you feel when you are standing on earth? Was it just what I described? Now continue that expansion further as you drop a 100 pound ball and a 1 ounce ball\u2026 what happens? They suspend in space as the earth\u2019s surface continues outward to meet them at the same time. This is the paradox of equal acceleration of differing weight objects. Something that an invisible force or any force cannot do but you clearly can now see how it happens as the earth expands outwards. I have given you this example. It is up to you to now imagine and deduce all of the other consequences of this with your own thought experiments. The key is to put yourself outside the system and outside of what your senses are calibrated to. So in other words imagine yourself as a non-expanding being. Watch how you can now explain EVERYTHING around you without paradox just by accepting this primary underlying physics of exponentially expanding matter. We all experience the illusions it creates; visually, perceptually and sensationally. ",
