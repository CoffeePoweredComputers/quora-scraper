            "answer_text": "Comes down to what you b.l.e.v.e. is next for Earth. To me, there would be no next for Earth and sea-level is irrelevant.  Sorry. If that happened the Gamilons sucker punched Earth with all it\u2019s planet bombs all at once and our only hope rests with the valiant crew making the round trip to the planet Iskandar, one hundred and eighty six thousand light years away, and back in one year. (yeah, we\u2019re screwed)  Even on Starblazers(1979)/Space Battleship Yamato (Anime 1974, Live action movie 2010) the attack on Earth took years.  The transition of ice into water requires the combination of temperature and time. For it to occur faster requires more temperature. Which brings up a common question, what is heat and what is heat transfer? Have you ever melted snow on a winter campfire for a cup of powdered hot chocolate or a cup of tea? I have. Hope you\u2019re not in a hurry. Snow is insulating and ice doesn\u2019t have a great heat transfer coefficient. Heat isn\u2019t temperature but let\u2019s consider a thought exercise. Let\u2019s disregard the ice in the cirrus clouds and just stick with ice on the ground. Let\u2019s take a google average \u201cLapse rate\u201d of 6.5 \u00b0C/km.  I live in a place where when spring hits it hovers around 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) plus minus a few degrees day/night and it takes a couple months for the snow to melt. If it\u2019s warm enough for the top of Denali to be at or near freezing, I\u2019m a puddle on the floor. Most of the world\u2019s population are dead. Heat, heat flux and temperature are very different things. This isn\u2019t even considering the kilometers thick ice in Antarctica. For there to be enough heat to melt all ice on Earth overnight then likely there are parts of the Earth where lakes and rivers are literally boiling, the dry parts simply incinerate, and all life on Earth is destroyed. Even the oxygen reacts out and our Earth is a CO2 rustball. Sea-level is irrelevant. The oceans B.L.E.V.E. and the Earth is a deep fried frozen turkey.  (Water-bears and some bacteria deep in the crust might survive) ",

All the polar bears (and presumably penguins) died, all the ports on earth are now flooded, most of the arable land is laying waste, billions of people are starving to death, and civilization has collapsed. We are now living in a post apocalyptic world and no one is reading this question or answer\u2026. No\u2026wait\u2026the model he based his prediction on was wrong\u2026. The great collapse will happen in (what is it now?) eight or ten years per Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Honest\u2026this time the model is right.

This would produce a large tsunami that would cause massive damage to a large part of the world\u2019s coastal regions. The ocean would then rise by a meter or so, depending on how much fell into the ocean. NB. The ice would not need melt, only fall into the ocean. When it actually melts this does not raise the ocean level at all. ",
