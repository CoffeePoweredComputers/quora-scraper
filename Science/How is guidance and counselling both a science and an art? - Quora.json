Science is the AWARENESS of HOW a particular thing functions.  Art is the TALENT to MAKE a thing function in a Particular way.  \u201cHence it is\u201d the LOVING ADORATION of phrases like \u201cuh accident\u201d, \u201cunintended consequences\u201d, \u201cfell through the cracks\u201d and other such \u201cbe REASONABLE\u201d \u201cexplanations\u201d for when \u201ca(n incompetent) boy  is sent to do a (crafts)man\u2019s job\u201d.  so you get ten thousand \u201cGraduated\u201d \u201cQualified\u201d incompetents running around BELIEVING they\u2019re \u201cArtistic Scientists\u201d because they got pieces of paper that \u201csuggest\u201d \u201cguidance and counselling IS both a science and an art\u201d? Which CREATES AND MAINTAINS the very \u201cjobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the more-industrious and less informed part of the community\u201d from which the Towering, Loftiest Genius ARTISTS  MAKE THEIR LIVING  by MANUFACTURING all those \u201cuh accident\u201d, \u201cunintended consequences\u201d, \u201cfell through the cracks\u201d to \u201cinvestigate\u201d, \u201clook into\u201d, and \u201caddress\u201d.
