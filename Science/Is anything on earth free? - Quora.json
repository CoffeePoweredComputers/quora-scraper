            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Is there anything free in the world? What if I told you that you were one of the wealthiest people in the world? Before you scratch your head and check your wallet, pause for a moment and think about the assets in your life. Not just the dollar bills in the safe, but the other valuables you have. The ones that actually matter. Sure, money can buy a lot of things -- but that's it. They're just things. Material possessions are great, but happiness doesn't come from the items we own. It comes from a toddler's giggle or your mom's cooking. It shows up on a sunny day or seeing your best friend walk down the aisle. When it comes down to it, the riches in our bank accounts don't compare to the seven riches below. Here's evidence that the best things in life don't cost a single penny. Hugs.  Admit it, there's nothing like a warm hug from someone you care about. Hugs can do a lot more than just make you feel good for a split moment. Not bad for a small (and free!) gesture. Friends and family.  You can't put a price point on your loved ones. They're worth everything without costing a single penny (except for maybe those few bucks you let them borrow for that gifts when they were short). It's a small price to pay when you consider the real value they add to your life. Smiles.  The more you grin, the more joy you\u2019ll feel. According to one 2012 study, people who received a smile from strangers felt a greater sense of social connectedness. And who doesn't want to feel like they belong? Not to mention those \"knowing smiles\" you share with your best friends after an inside joke. Sleep.  Happiness is a satisfying nap or a good night's rest. Sometimes there's just no better feeling than crawling into a comfortable bed and letting our minds drift away to dreamland. Better health for just a little more sleep? That's invaluable. Laughter.  It's hard not to feel your absolute best when you're in the middle of a belly-aching fit of laughter. You have to admit that when the same events are remembered later, they bring unconditional happiness to you. Hey, the giggles look good on you (and they probably cost less than that shirt). Happy memories.  Let's be honest, who hasn't replayed some of their best times in their head? Nostalgia is one of our mind's greatest indulgences -- and it's totally OK to embrace it. Studies have found that nostalgia can decrease loneliness and anxiety. Think back on your perfect birthday party or your dayout with your loving friends. Love.  Feeling accepted is crucial to our emotional wellness. We're happier, our immune system is stronger and even our heart health is improved when we're around the people we love. Sounds like a richer, fuller life to us. So, go hug your best friend, kiss your significant other, create good memories with your family and make a stranger feel loved with a simple smile (and then go to sleep). All without draining your pocketbook. Hope you have got your answer. Upvote if you like it. Regards, Rungshit ",

            "answer_text": "No life had to pay for its birth. I think birth is the only event with no economic trade-off. According to economics, if you want something you have to lose something, either in terms of material, spiritual, temporal and/or spatial possessions. But what does one have to lose to be born? There is no lifeless state. Since you are born you lost you your state of lifelessness. If heaven or hell were real, then there is a trade-off. I think the person who gave the statement in economics that everything has a trade-off had to believe that heaven and hell were real. Else, birth would have been the only exception. I think the same holds for death too. One can do things to achieve death but in actuality, death is not assured. When one dies, they actually get it not because of their efforts but it is their time. Now there are 2 exceptions. And, if you believe in predestination, everything is free in this world. Also, if I think about it, Whatever abilities, attitude, qualities and skills I have I could develop because of my potential which was free for me. My potential manifests into money or other possessions which help me buy things. So, in essence, everything I get is free. ",
