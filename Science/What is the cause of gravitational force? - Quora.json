            "answer_text": "To find the main causes of gravitational force, probably the best way is analyzing the interaction between gravity and light. And from the point of view of quantum mechanics, we should focus on the interaction between gravitons and photons. Unification of gravitation and electromagnetism was actively pursued by several physicists such as Faraday and Einstein. Einstein believed there was a link between the need to resolve apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics and the need to unify electromagnetism and gravity. In quantum mechanics, the concept of a point particle is complicated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, because even an elementary particle, with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as electrons, photon or quarks, which have no internal structure, versus composite particles such as protons, which do have internal structure. According to the quantum mechanics that photon is an unstructured particle, how can we explain the relationship between the photon energy and frequency, and also pair production and decay? In recent decades, the structure of photon is discussed and physicists are studying the photon structure. In addition, some evidence shows the photon consists of a positive and a negative charges. For study and understanding the photon structure we need to describe relation between frequency and energy of photon. The change of frequency of the photon in the gravitational field has been demonstrated by the Pound-Rebka experiment. Photon structure When photon falls a distance equal toward the earth, according to conservation law of energy we have:  If we consider this phenomenon as another evidence to verify the general relativity, we will be stopped in the same old theories. Therefore, if we want to get a different result, we have to change our thoughts. The work that gravitational force does on the photon does not mean a simple concept of increasing in kinetic energy, but some deeper and more profound concepts are hidden beyond it. If we want to look at this phenomenon from the point of view of quantum field theory, we must accept that gravitons penetrate to the structure of the photon and in addition to the increasing its energy cause increasing electric and magnetic field intensity. Nevertheless, by considering the accepted concepts of quantum mechanics for gravitons, this phenomenon is not justifiable. Therefore, we need to reconsider the concepts of quantum mechanics about graviton and investigate about this phenomenon beyond quantum mechanics.  Gravitons bend the space Color-charges and magnetic-color A photon with the lowest possible energy also carries electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, the features of gravitons entered into the structure of the photon must behave in a way that along with explaining the energy of photon, describes increasing in intensity of electric and magnetic fields. In other words, some of these gravitons cause increasing the electric field of photon and some other gravitons increase the intensity of magnetic fields. Also, not only a photon at lowest level of its energy is formed by some of the gravitons, but also its formed members have electric and magnetic properties that is called color-charge and magnetic-color in CPH theory. The next step is to specify color-charges and magnetic-colors in which it is obtained by paying attention to at least change in energy of photon in a gravitational field while moving into blue shift of gravity. By producing positive and negative electric fields, two magnetic fields are produced around the electric fields do form. Therefore, it will be made two groups of magnetic-colors. So CPH matrix is defined as follows:  CPH matrix shows the least magnitude energy of a photon. Sub-Quantum Energy (SQE) We use CPH matrix to define positive and negative sub quantum energies as follow: The first column of CPH matrix is defined positive sub quantum energy and the second column of CPH matrix is defined negative sub quantum energy, so;  The amount of speed and energy of positive and negative sub quantum energies are equal, and the difference between them are only in the sign of their color-charges and magnetic-color flow direction. Virtual photons There are two types of virtual photons, positive and negative virtual photons which are defined as follows:  A real photon is formed of a positive virtual photon and a negative virtual photon:  Where, n and k are natural numbers. So far, the production of electromagnetic energy (photons) was described by using gravitational blue-shift, in reverse phenomena photons decay to negative and positive virtual photons. In redshift, virtual photons also decay to positive and negative sub quantum energies (SQEs), and sub quantum energies (SQEs) decay to color-charges and magnetic-colors, too. Color-charges and magnetic-colors away from each other, lose their effect on each other and become gravitons. So;  So, photons are combination of positive and negative virtual photons. Photon is a very weak electric dipole that is consistent with the experience and these articles are asserted. In addition, this property of photon (very weak electric dipole) can describe the absorption and emission energy by charged particles. According to above descriptions, it is observed that the energy is generated by field, and matter is generated by energy, so we can say that in CPH theory, energy is intensive field and matter is a dense energy. In addition, gravitational field is weakest field that is the main cause of physical existence.

            "answer_text": "This question has been answered differently throughout history. Aristotle argued that the different elements had their \"natural place\" which they tended to. Thus a rock, in which the \"element\" earth prevailed, fell because the natural place of that element is the bottom. Instead, fire had its natural place at the top, and so something like smoke tended to rise. This idea of \"natural places\" may seem naive to us today, but it prevailed for centuries. But better than showing a condescending attitude to such \"naive\" theories would be to understand that human beings are prone to accept as natural the theories prevalent in our time. To put it clearly, are we sure that our current understanding of gravity is the right one? Well, we must admit something, Newton's idea that between two bodies there is an attraction proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates them was, undoubtedly, the most important step in many centuries. Among other things because it allowed us to understand the reason for the elliptical orbits of the planets and, above all, to make precise calculations based on only two important variables: the mass and the distance that separates the bodies under consideration. Now, recognizing the practical superiority of Newton's model over Aristotle's, the question remains why does one object attract and, at the same time, is attracted by another? It seemed that we had left behind the Aristotelian idea of natural place, but in the end, had we? Newton, perhaps annoyed by the question of the origin of that attraction, wrote his famous phrase: hypotheses non fingo, \"I feign no hypotheses\" or, to put it another way: I do not know and I prefer not to propose hypotheses. I want to say with this that \"the gist\", the crux of the matter continued unexplained, in spite of the giant step that the Newtonian theory represented. And we all know how this story continues: with Einstein's general theory of relativity. Leaving aside the practical advantages of Einstein's theory, for instance, to be able to explain phenomena like the anomaly of the mercury orbit, I would like to focus on another point. Einstein, unlike Aristotle and Newton, was the first to propose that bodies, their mass in fact, provoked \"something\" in their surroundings and that this \"something\" was related to their attractive capacity. I want to emphasize the change of conception, which breaks decisively with the Newtonian idea that the gravitational interaction is something that happens between the bodies directly, an attraction in which the space is only a sort of passive setting. In that sense, Einstein's theory is a real paradigm shift, a really different way of conceiving gravity that, from now on, necessarily includes the characteristics of the space in which those bodies move. End of the story? Nothing like that! The basic question remains unanswered! If, on the one hand, Newton could not answer for the origin of that mysterious attractive power that bodies seem to possess, Einstein never answered the following question: why does the mass of a body produce the bending of space-time? As we see, it seems that the ultimate answer about the origin of gravity always doesn't escape, like sand between our fingers. And to make matters worse, we now know an important fact that Einstein did not know (let alone Newton): the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. This disconcerting fact further complicates the scenario. Is there perhaps a kind of negative gravity affecting the universe on a large scale? Explaining this fact is a new challenge, but, I wonder, is it not an opportunity? An opportunity for what? you may ask. An opportunity to explain, for the first time, the ultimate origin of that force we call gravity! How so? Let's see, Einstein says that mass produces a curvature in spacetime but also, with his \"strong\" equivalence principle that there seems to be a close relationship between what happens to a body in a gravitational field and what happens to that same body when it is subjected to an acceleration. And now we learn that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate! These facts seem unrelated, but they could give us the explanation we are looking for! As I propose in: Enrique Casanovas's answer to What could be the origin of gravity? I think the origin of gravity is explained by this accelerating expansion. But if you read my answer, you will see that I am not exactly talking about the expansion discovered in 1998, which is a 3D expansion. I think it is logical to assume the following: since Minkowski we know that our universe is 4D and therefore I think it is logical to assume that this 3D expansion is only the visible aspect of a 4D expansion. And that would be, finally, the answer. Why do bodies bend spacetime? Because of the inertial resistance to an impulse that accelerates them in that extra direction, the time direction! ",
