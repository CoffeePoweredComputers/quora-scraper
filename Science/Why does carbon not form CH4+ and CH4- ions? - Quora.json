            "answer_text": "In organic chemistry there\u2019s an mechanism called \u201chybridizing\u201d. It lets electrons to jump between orbitals in order to create orbitals with same energy level. For example I have an atom which has 2 electrons in its second s orbital (2s^2) and 1 electron in its second p orbitals (2p^1). One of the electrons in s orbital jumps into one of the following p orbitals (px, py or pz). Which creates a migration between s and p orbitals. From now on it has a orbital called sp. Carbon atoms can do sp, sp^2 and sp^3 hybridizing which lets it to create up to 4 individual bounds. This is why it can make 4 bounds. It can not make an ionised because in organic chemistry if we split a H+ ion from an organic chemistry it tends to create a -yl bridge components. Also carbon doesn\u2019t make a lot of ionic components. ",
