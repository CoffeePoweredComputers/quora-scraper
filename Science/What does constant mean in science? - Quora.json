            "answer_text": "The scientific method is a set of rules used to conduct experiments and test hypotheses. You can use many different methods to conduct an experiment, but to get valid results the experiment must follow the structure of the scientific method. When using the scientific method to carry out an experiment, you will need to keep several variables constant in order for the results and conclusions you draw from the experiment to be valid. A constant is a variable that does not change. While conducting an experiment, you will need to keep several variables constant for the experiment to produce valid results. In the example where you change the amount of exercise and measure heart rate, for example, you would need to keep the fitness level of the person constant, as well as the type of exercise they do and and the conditions in which they are exercising. Reasons for Keeping Variables Constant You need to keep all variables except the independent and dependent variables constant in order to produce results that you can use to test the initial hypothesis. This is because if other variables are not kept constant, there is no way to check which of the variables was affecting the outcome of the experiment. In the example, to conclude that exercise does or does not affect heart rate you must be sure that nothing except the amount of exercise has changed during the experiment. ",

            "answer_text": "The meanibg of constance, as the name suggests, it is the variable that the scientist wants to remain the same. Often, there is more than one control or constant variable in a scientific experiment. The scientist will want to observe these control variables as much as the dependent variable. But there are some fundamental constants found from nature, like c=3\u00d710^8 m/s, the speed of light in vacuum. Other constants are the gas constant R or Plancks constant h=6.62\u00d710^-34 J.s..
