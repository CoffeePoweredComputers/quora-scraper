            "answer_text": "An electrode is used as a diagnostic tool of many chemical experiments, however, in addition to their usefulness in the field of chemistry, they are widely used in our day-to-day life. An electrode is a charged or uncharged solid electric conductor that carries electric current through non-metallic solids, or liquids, or gases, or plasmas, or vacuums. An electrode can be either an anode or a cathode depending upon the behaviour of electrons. The anode is the one in which the electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs and it is indicated by a minus (-) symbol. On the contrary, a cathode is an electrode in which electrons enter the cell and reduction occurs. It is indicated by a plus (+) symbol. Furthermore, a bipolar electrode is an electrode that works as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell. Depending upon the reversibility of a reaction, electrodes are divided into primary and the secondary type. A primary cell is the one in which the reaction cannot be reversed, hence the identities of the anode and cathodes doesn\u2019t change (anode is always the negative electrode and vice-versa). A secondary cell is a rechargeable battery, where the anode becomes positive (+) and the cathode is negative (\u2212). On the other side, when the cell is being discharged, it is almost like a primary cell, with the anode behaving like negative and the cathode as the positive electrode.

            "answer_text": "An electrode is a solid electric conductor that carries electric current into non-metallic solids, or liquids, or gases, or plasmas, or vacuums. Electrodes are typically good electric conductors, but they need not be metals. In an electrochemical cell, reduction and oxidation reactions take place at the electrodes. The electrode at which reduction takes places is called the cathode. Oxidation takes place at the anode. Whether an electrode operates as a cathode or anode depends on the direction the cell is operating in. If a cell is switched from operating galvanically (i.e. outputting energy like a battery) to electrolysis (energy is input to the cell) then its cathode will become its anode and vice versa.
