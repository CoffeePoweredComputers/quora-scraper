            "answer_text": "It is not possible to give a definitive number to this. How many calories you burn lying down, doing nothing is your basal metabolic rate. This varies from person to person and even the same person can have variance in the number of calories they burn from day to day. We can also raise or lower this BMR by our way of eating. If a person has been suppressing their food intake, their body will down-regulate the number of calories they burn. This is to spare energy for vital functions like beating heart, brain cells and breathing. Some people have bodies so fabulously capable of protecting them from starvation, in this way, that they will end with a metabolic rate that allows them to gain weight eating 700-800 calories. Great, if you are in a real famine, but this is not optimal. The answer is, most of your calories are used for basal metabolic rate. Your body would love to be able to run all functions of the body at 200%, using key clamps, like enzymes, to bring function down to 100%, thus ensuring the body is never forced to operate below optimal level. The body has many, many things it can do with any excess calories, so getting enough for running a high metabolism should be the concern, not burning off excess consciously through exercise. If you have any calories \u201cto burn\" after your body has made optimal enzymes, hormones, synthesized vitamins and steroids, \u201cremodeled\" organs, bone, nerves, blood vessels, digestive tract, hair, nails, skin, teeth, digested your food, run brain activity and whatever else, it will make you move alright. If you have an infection to fight or a backlog of repairs to make, due to former calorie restriction, you will require more calories, and if they are forthcoming, your metabolic rate will increase. If you consistently eat all your body desires, you will burn more calories at rest all of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "A person will burn anywhere between 1200-1700 (or more or less) calories a day before factoring in any activity. The amount you burn isn't set in stone and is variable depending on a number of conditions. It's loosely based on your age, your lean body mass, your adipose mass, your gender, genetics, the weather, and various other lifestyle factors. Most of your Basal Metabolic Rate calories are burned by your brain, liver, kidneys and heart.   Your brain is a greedy organ requiring a TON of energy to help you live. Your brain is the nerve center of your body. There are nerves all over your body sending and receiving signals to and from the brain.  Your brain requires ATP to create and pump those signals out.[1] About 2/3 of your brain's caloric expenditure comes from sending and receiving signals: thoughts, movements, etc. The other 1/3 comes from maintenance activities, mainly recharging the electrolytes inside your cells and maintaining the balance of electrolytes to maintain a proper fluid balance inside and outside the cells[2] . Your liver is essential to nearly every metabolic process your body goes through. It filters the blood, it helps to regulate energy levels, it aids in digestion, everything is run through the liver. Your kidneys also do a lot of filtering. Your heart powers your blood stream. Without it, nothing would work. No energy would circulate, no nutrients would be available, no oxygen would get around for your cells to create energy. Maintenance of skeletal muscle tissue and the rest of the organs use the rest of your BMR calories.
