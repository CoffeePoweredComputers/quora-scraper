            "answer_text": "In absolute terms, it's about the charge of [math]6.241 \\times 10^{18}[/math] electrons, but unfortunately that probably doesn't give you much of an intuitive feel for it! We can try talking about how big a coulomb is relative to everyday things, and maybe that will bring it into focus? Unfortunately, even that approach can end up confounding our instincts.  For instance, according to Wikipedia, about 5000 C are released during the life of a typical AA battery, but only 15 C are transmitted by a typical lightening bolt!  (Coulomb in everyday terms) Sooooooooooo, where does that leave us?  What can we say, using familiar terms, about how big 1 coulomb is? Not much.  :-( The fact is that charge isn't a quantity that we have much direct interaction with.  We mostly experience charge indirectly, through it's effect on other things.  For instance, in the AA battery vs. lightening bolt example, the more important difference is not the amount of charge, but the amount of energy.  Of course, there's way more energy released by a lightning bolt than in the discharge of a AA battery, it's just that the work is being done by fewer electrons.  (About 9000 joules in a battery, about 5 billion joules in a lightening bolt.) So the lesson here, I think, is that the coulomb is a great unit for technical contexts, but a poor unit for conveying intuition. That's a bit of a wishy-washy answer, but I hope it provided some food for thought! ",

            "answer_text": "Did you mean, how wide is one coulomb, physically? We can answer that by looking at copper, looking at wires. Answer: a coulomb is roughly half a millimeter wide. (This only applies to the movable electrons found inside wires.) In copper metal, each atom donates one (conduction-band) outer electron to the common \u201csea of charge.\u201d The rest of copper atoms\u2019 electrons remain bound to each atom, all balanced by the opposite positive charge in the nucleus. We can view copper metal as containing an \u201celectron fluid,\u201d where the density of electrons is the same as the density of atoms in the metal: one free electron per atom. (So, we\u2019re only looking at the mobile coulombs of the copper; the coulombs which can participate in currents, rather than counting up the total coulombs present.) The atoms/cc density for copper is 8.5*10^22. That becomes our value for electrons/cc density. And, the charge of one electron is 1.6*10^-19 coulombs. Multiply together, and that gives us a charge density for copper: 13600 coulombs per cubic centimeter. Therefore one coulomb forms a cube about 0.4mm on a side: 1/(13600^1/3) = 0.42mm Aha! One coulomb is about the size of a small grain of salt! If we had some wire with a cross-section area of .42mm, then during a one-ampere current, the electrons would be moving along like little .42mm cubes, one little cube per second, a drift speed of .42mm/sec, or one inch per minute. (See, electric current in metals is quite slow.) Well, all this only applies to copper metal. In other metals it will be somewhat different, and in salt water or damp earth (or electron-beams in vacuum tubes) it will be very different: much wider coulombs, much faster currents. Heh, next ask yourself: if voltage is like pressure, then 1.0 volts is how many PSI? ",

            "answer_text": "To explore this question, let us look at it by means of force over a distance. Force between two charges separated with a distance \u201cr\u201dcan be calculated by: F=q1*q2/(4*pi*epsilon_0*r^2). Now, assume 1C of positive charge is placed 1 m away from another 1C of positive charge. These two set of charges would apply a force outward to each other. Now, if we want to keep them in place and we connect them with a steel rod of 1 m diameter (and the length of 1m), the force would be so large that is would tear apart this steel rod. The force would be a tremendous ~10^10 N! To keep them in place we need a thicker steel rod. (Ultimate tensile strength of steel ~1000 Mpa which means we need a rod of diameter of nearly 3.7 m to hold those two set of 1C charge, 1 m away from each other). From another view a coulomb of charge is not a big deal. Recall that a coulomb is the amount of electrons transferred in one second by a current of one ampere. This amount of charge can be transferred by a AA battery and a resistor. ",

But a more interesting answer would be, the charge of 1 electron is 1.6x10^(-19) coloumb. Thus we would need 10^(19) electrons to give 1.6 coloumbs of charge, now imagine 10^19 electrons. Although it seems like a big number, the number of atoms in a mole is about 6x(10^23) so in one mole of hydrogen gas we have 6x10^23 electrons, that is already about 40000 times more than required to make one 1.6 coloumb of charge.

            "answer_text": "1 C of unbalanced charge (all positive or all negative) is a really humungous charge in terms of its physical effects because it will suck the charge out of surrounding things to attempt to neutralize itself, so you don't want to be anywhere near it. A typical lightning bolt is only 15 C. However precisely because of that you rarely get unbalanced charge. For example, 1 kg of Iron is about 1000/55.845 = 17.9 moles of iron atoms, or about 17.9*26 moles of electrons plus the same number of positive charges. A mole is 6.02E23 (Avogadro constant) whereas a coulomb is 6.24E18 electrons, so that's 96500 C lurking. ",
