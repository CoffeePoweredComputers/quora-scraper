            "answer_text": "Silem's answer is very good, I'll just elaborate a little bit. Like Silem said Oxygen originates in stars. Oxygen was not present in the very early universe before stars formed, only Hydrogen, Helium and a small amount of Lithium condensed out of the hot early universe. Oxygen comes from massive stars that have fused these three components of the early universe into heavier elements like Oxygen. When these massive stars explode, they disperse heavier elements in clouds of gas and dust. The dust and gas clouds that formed our solar system were enriched with material from earlier massive stars that had exploded. That's how oxygen came to be part of the earth. Free oxygen in the atmosphere though, comes from photosynthesis. Oxygen is a very active element, it wants to combine with other elements. So the oxygen that was part of the earth's formation was in the form of chemical compounds like: Water, Carbon Dioxide, Silicates, Iron oxide, etc. it was almost never in it's \"free\" uncombined form. Photosynthesis frees oxygen that's combined with Hydrogen as Water, as Silem shows in his chemical equation. But for the first 2 Billion years the earth's early atmosphere had virtually no free oxygen in it. So it took photosynthesis by living organisms to create the free oxygen rich atmosphere that we now have on earth. These organisms that first used photosynthesis are called cyanobacteria. They don't need oxygen to live they just produce oxygen as a by-product of their biological energy making process. Bacteria that don\u2019t need oxygen are called anaerobic bacteria. Starting about 3 Billion years ago cyanobacteria began converting the earth's atmosphere from having no oxygen, to having the 21% oxygen we have today. This was called: \"The Great Oxygenation Event\" (GOE). Eventually other more complex organisms incorporated cyanobacteria symbiotically into themselves, these symbiotic cyanobacteria became the chloroplasts in plants, this is the part of the plant that actually carries out photosynthesis. The oxygen the cyanobacteria produced was toxic to the other anaerobic life that was living on the earth at the time. There was a huge extinction of many of these other anaerobic single celled organisms as a result of the introduction of oxygen to the atmosphere. although some of these early anaerobic bacteria survived and are with us today. But it gave rise to other forms of life that use the atmospheric oxygen biologically to make energy, a process called \u201caerobic respiration\u201d. One of the organisms that has benefited from this is us: humans. ",

            "answer_text": "Phytoplankton. Half of all the oxygen on Earth is produced by phytoplankton \u2014 microalgae growing in the upper few meters of the ocean (the photic zone). Approximately a quarter is made by kelp and other marine macro-plants and a quarter is made by all terrestrial sources.  On land, the biggest producer of oxygen are the tropical rain forests (40.8%) followed by tropical grasslands (31%) followed by croplands (14.8%) and all other sources. I\u2019m not sure where journalists get the oft-quoted figure that the Amazon makes 20% of the Earth\u2019s oxygen. It can\u2019t possibly, since all tropical forests make up only 40.8% of 25% or10%. Still, this is something we should pay attention to. Like anything else in life, Earth has an oxygen budget. The oxygen in our atmosphere is the sum of all the oxygen produced less all that is consumed. Mostly because of industrialization and the combustion of fossil fuels, the planet has had an oxygen deficient for about a century, and it\u2019s growing rapidly. Don\u2019t freak out though. Current projections are that by the end of the century the concentration of oxygen will drop from the current level of 20.946% to 20.825%. That\u2019s not likely to be particularly harmful, and by then we will be mostly out of fossil fuels to burn, like it or not.

Helium is 23 times more abundant; hydrogen is 71 times as much. Oxygen is followed by carbon, neon, iron, nitrogen, silicon, magnesium, and sulfur \u2014 in that order. All these elements are made inside stars. On Earth oxygen is the most common element on its surface of land and seas. Oxygen is so reactive that it would disappear into Earth\u2019s oceans and soils were it not continuously replaced in the atmosphere by the photosynthesis of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, which make oxygen from sunlight and carbon-dioxide\u2014a heavy gas that hugs Earth\u2019s surface to keep plants alive. Cold water holds free oxygen more easily than warm; it\u2019s why the biodiversity of oxygen dependent life is greater in northern oceans. If Earth\u2019s oxygen producing forests ever die, the atmosphere will quickly become depleted of oxygen; the depletion will kill all land-based, oxygen-dependent life including humans who don\u2019t carry oxygen tanks to breathe. Oxygen-dependent ocean life will continue to survive. Loss of oxygen in the atmosphere is one of 25 or so significant extinction-precipitating events we must avoid to save ourselves and Earth where we must live. The good news is that atmospheric oxygen-loss is not in the top ten list of bad things most likely to happen. RISK ",

            "answer_text": "There is only one source on earth. Photosynthesis. Elementally, (in the universe) oxygen is formed within the stars as they fuse protons. Three Helium nuclei combine to form Carbon. One more Helium then combines with this Carbon to form Oxygen. Fusing carbon requires a temperature of about one billion degrees! Most of the heavy elements, from oxygen up through iron, are thought to be produced in stars that contain at least ten times as much matter as our Sun. This process is referred to as the catalytic CNO cycle. Heavier elements, that come after iron, are produced during supernovas. Oxygen is earth\u2019s most abundant element comprising 49% by weight of our planet if you exclude the inner iron core. It is 30% of our planet in total weight if you include the iron core. However, free oxygen is not released by earth\u2019s mantle into the atmosphere, and volcanoes do not produce free oxygen as it is too reactive an element and is easily stored away. Free atmospheric oxygen therefore, comes about because of oxygen released by photosynthesis only. This is the surprising answer to the above question. The only source o free atmospheric oxygen is photosynthesis. So trees and land plants together are contributing to a quarter of the earth\u2019s oxygen. Phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, algae and kelp in the oceans produce three quarters of earth\u2019s oxygen, about 75%. So these photosynthetic living things are the source of Free Oxygen in the atmosphere. So there is only ONE source of free Oxygen and that is photosynthesis. We have 1,200,000,000,000,000,000 kg of Free Oxygen in our Atmosphere. Total Oxygen which is 30%, (almost 1/3rd the weight of our planet), of total earth\u2019s weight is 1,791,600,000, 000,000,000,000,000 kg Oxygen molecules on Earth So the % (percentage) of free atmospheric oxygen out of all the oxygen in our planet is only 0.000067% !!!! We do not fully understand the mechanism by which the free atmospheric oxygen appears to stabilise around the 21% mark. Unless the planet is extremely wet, very, very wet, the percentage of oxygen may not creep upwards as oxygen is very reactive and trees and other things will start spontaneously catching fire. I digress. Hopefully, I have given you a full answer :) Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Free oxygen in the atmosphere comes almost exclusively from photosynthesis. Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, so there\u2019s no shortage of the element on Earth; however, most of it is locked up in compounds like water and minerals. That\u2019s because oxygen is highly reactive. On a lifeless planet, you wouldn\u2019t expect a high concentration of free oxygen in the environment. When life evolved the ability to photosynthesize, it started to produce O[math]_2[/math] as a waste product. The basic equation is: 6CO[math]_2[/math] + 6H[math]_2[/math]O \u2192 C[math]_6[/math]H[math]_{12}[/math]O[math]_6[/math] + 6O[math]_2[/math] Obviously the real process is much more complicated, as it involves many enzymes and intermediary products, but that\u2019s not relevant right now. The first photosynthesizers produced free oxygen faster than it could react with the other elements in the environment; in fact, the so-called oxygen catastrophe killed a lot of organisms whose metabolism was not able to deal with such an excess of oxygen. Eventually, every exposed surface that was capable of reacting with oxygen had been duly oxidized, and the excess started to accumulate in the air and water. And that\u2019s where the current O[math]_2[/math] in the atmosphere comes from. Side note: Scientists think they could determine whether an alien planet has life by looking for the spectral signature of free oxygen in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. A large quantity of free oxygen would not be expected on a lifeless world. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is fascinating. This is a rough overview; you can get better details at wikipedia\u2019s geological history of oxygen. First you should recognize that nature likes things in their lowest energy state. Free oxygen is not energetically favorable, meaning it is hard to separate out from things like water H2O, carbon dioxide CO2, or rust. On the other hand, it is easy to take it out of the air by burning something or absorbing it into water or rusting something. So nature doesn\u2019t want to have oxygen in the atmosphere, and most planets (including Earth for the first 4 billion years) have little or no oxygen in their atmosphere. Then along comes plant life. Plants, especially on land, get so much energy from sunlight that they can afford to do things that cost them energy. Plants also need building material. Plants are made up of a lot of carbon (that\u2019s what burns when you burn wood). Where are they to get the carbon from? The answer is the air. About 650 million years ago, plant life exploded on the planet, and built trees and other plants by separating CO2, keeping the Carbon C, and releasing the oxygen O2. As a result, the oxygen content of air shot up (from too little for us to breathe to 35%, which is way more than today\u2019s 20%. That oxygen-rich atmosphere helped land life get a head start (because so much oxygen made it easier to burn fuel when eating plants) and allowed life to grow very big (like dinosaurs and 6\u2033 flying insects). See graph below from wikimedia commons.  (Clarification: photosynthetic (sun-based) life started in the oceans much earlier, and we got the initial oxygen appearing as early as 1 billion years into Earth\u2019s 4.55 billion year life so far. It took a long time for the small amount of oxygen production to finally saturate the oceans and rust all the stuff it could rust, and then at 650 million years, all the oxygen production went into the air, making our life possible.)

All stars spend the early parts of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, and when that is mostly gone they start fusing the helium into heavier elements including oxygen, carbon, silicon, iron, nickel, nitrogen, and all of the others. Stars that are somewhat bigger than our sun eventually end their lives in tremendous explosions called supernovas, scattering these chemical elements out across space in huge clouds. A part of one of these huge clouds of gas and stellar debris eventually collapsed to form our solar system. In the process some of it condensed to form Earth, which is why our planet is rich in all of the elements I mentioned above. Oxygen is actually the third most-abundant element in the Universe today, right after hydrogen and helium. Oxygen is also the most abundant element in Earth\u2019s crust.

            "answer_text": "As I understand it, the element Oxygen (atomic O) was formed in large stars and subsequent supernovae explosions in the vicinity of what would be our solar system sometime between 6Billion and 9 billion years ago. Oxygen16 is one alpha particle higher than Carbon12. After a large star burns almost all of its H to He at the star\u2019s core, it stars another fusion reaction called the \u201ctriple alpha process\u201d where 3 He atoms (alpha particles) fuse through a Be8 intermediary into a Carbon12 nucleus. Once the He is exhausted at the core of the large star (H is burning to He in an outer layer), the Carbon12 that has accumulated begins to burn with additional He4 into Oxygen. This \u201conion-skin\u201d process (nucleosynthesis) continues all the way up to Iron. WHen that happens, the star explodes in a few minutes in a Supernova explosion which spews the elements throughout the region (including the oxygen and carbon). In other words, we can thank a long-dead star for nearly all the atoms that make up our bodies and our world (except Hydrogen and maybe some He which formed at the moment of the Big Bang). Molecular Oxygen is formed the way the other experts below have mentioned. However, it might be worthwhile to mention that the Photosynthetic reaction center is an incredibly wonderful \u201csculpture\u201d with a \u201ccrown porphyrin\u201d surrounding a magnesium atom. It is incredibly efficient in converting the energy of sunlight into sugars and larger molecules (like cellulose - fiber for us). Also, it might be worthwhile mentioning that nearly all the mass of plants is water and the carbon dioxide from the air (and a little Hydrogen from water - the oxygen in water is released to the air as a \u201cwaste product\u201d from the plant - \u201clucky\u201d for us). Without CO2 we would be dead very quickly (no food for plants or for us). The recent increase in the last 50 years or so in CO2 levels is greening the planet and in particular the desert areas because the plants exchange water for CO2. With higher ambient concentrations of CO2 in the air, they do not need to loses as much water through transpiration. THank-God for the increase in CO2!!! ",

Most of Earth's oxygen comes from the tiny ocean plants \u2013 called phytoplankton \u2013 they live near the water's surface and drift with the currents. Like all plants, they photosynthesize \u2013 which means, they use sunlight and carbon dioxide to make food. And a by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release oxygen into the water. Half of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis. The other half is produced via photosynthesis on land by trees, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. ",

            "answer_text": "If we want to go very far back, a large portion of stars form oxygen from helium near the end of their lives, through the CNO (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle. Our own Sun will form it at its core in its final days. Larger stars form it more readily. Although there was no oxygen at the beginning of the universe, it is the third most abundant element today, thanks to stars. The first two are hydrogen and helium. Oxygen is also the most abundant element in Earth\u2019s crust. It combines with other elements to produce materials such as silicates, which we generally call rocks. It also combines with hydrogen to make water. Because oxygen is so reactive, it originally remained sequestered in the Earth\u2019s crust and in the form of other molecules like carbon dioxide. Early life did not breathe free atmospheric oxygen, but some produced it as a byproduct of photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria eventually became very efficient at this, reproducing massively. For a long time, the free oxygen produced by life continued to react with the material in Earth\u2019s crust and was sequestered. Eventually, the crust reached its saturation limit, and the oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Oxygen is very reactive \u2014 a poison really. In some ways we are all being poisoned by the oxygen we require to live, which contributes to our aging. When the atmosphere first became oxygenated in the Great Oxygenation Event due to photosynthesis, much of the life on Earth was wiped out by this poison. New lifeforms, however, emerged to tolerate the oxygen and use it as an effective way to extract energy from food. This turned out to be a boon for life as it freed it from direct dependence on sunlight and less efficient fermentation and anaerobic respiration processes. ",

Trees and other terrestrial plants are also contributing to the oxygen cycle through the same process of photosynthesis. Hope this helped\u2026. ",

What we humans take for granted is abundant oxygen and abundant food!! Where do they come from?? Green plants take in 2 substances at maximum entropy; carbon dioxide and hydrogen oxide (that is water, my friend!) and produce 2 substances with high enthalpy; food for all animals to eat and free oxygen for all animals to breathe!! Isn\u2019t Nature wonderful!! Earth is unique and distinct from other planets. Please read my other answers to know why and how Earth is unique. Thank you for your question. ",
