            "answer_text": "\u2018Probability\u2019 is mostly used in reference to \u2018probability theory\u2019,it is a mathematical-statistical way of calculating how probable it is for an event to happen or not happen. Probability will be expressed in numbers. \u2018Chance\u2019 is more used in common day language. Although it may refer to the same to express how likely it is for something to happen or not happen, it is often less specific and more of a (subjective) guess. For instance: A statistician would state the probability a coin would land heads or tails is 0.50 or the odds are 1 to 2. The probability for flipping two heads in a row is 0.50 * 0.50 = 0.25 or 1 in 4 trials. A layman would state the chance of winning the lottery is small. A statistician would state the odds of winning the lottery are for instance 1 in 300.000.000 (depending on the number of tickets you buy and the number of possible combinations in a given lottery). So \u2018chance\u2019 is used in a more general way, while \u2018probability\u2019 is a more exact expression in numbers of \u2018chance\u2019. Although \u2018probability\u2019 and \u2018chance\u2019 refer to the same (to assess how small or large the likelihood is for events to take place), someone using probability theory like a mathematician will calculate and express it in an exact figure, while \u2018chance\u2019 is often used in a more general way like \u2018my chances in life were not that great\u2019.

            "answer_text": "I would say that probability is a technical term with a precise mathematical definition formally based on measure theory. I would then say that chance is a non-mathematical term used to describe the reality that we experience when things happen that we feel unable to predict with certainty. We can mathematically model the experience of chance using the tools of probability, but reality may or may not have some physical reason to be connected in any way to the mathematics. ",
