            "answer_text": "\"Scientific Naming,\" aka \"Binomial nomenclature,\" is the official system for giving names to organisms.  They usually are derived from Latin. There are really a couple of advantages to the \"scientific\" naming system, and one disadvantage. First off, scientific naming is standardized.  Each creature has only one scientific name, and each name refers to only one creature.  This is of great advantage because it allows precision.  While most people might refer to a lot of things as a cat, there are big differences between house-cats and, say, lions.  This keeps generalities from skewing meaning. Secondly, what someone in your neck of the woods might call \"stink weed\" might be called \"skunk vine\" in another town, while \"skunk vine\" might refer to a creeping black and white flower someplace else.  Common names are only common to certain areas.  Think about how many people call it \"pop\" and how many call it \"soda.\"  Ask for soda in France and you might get soda water instead of Pepsi. Third, the scientific naming system allows people to see the relationship between animals.  Cats make a good example.  A housecat and a lion are both part of the family Felidae.  This would let you know, just by seeing the name, that the housecat and the lion are relatives.  But house-cats are part of the subfamily Felinae, and lions are part of the subgroup Panthera (not to be confused with the cheesy metal band Pantera.) This would let you know that while house-cats and lions are relatives, they are not closely similar; a tiger, though, also in the subfamily Panthera, is. The big drawback is that the names aren't as cool as \"stinkweed\" and so people can't remember them.  If you said you saw a felis leo in your back yard nobody would know what you were talking about, but if you yelled \"lion!\" they would. Hope my answer helped you.. ",

            "answer_text": "Scientific name enables a species to be identified along with other similar organisms Taxonomy - The method followed is binomial nomenclature, which has genus as the first name and species as the second name, knowing the genus name, we can say, to which Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order and Family, that the species belongs to.  Ecology - The grouping of organisms enables humans to frame a method of treatment to a particular species to overcome the damage created to the environment Physiology - It makes the study of organism\u2019s structure and physiology easy. For example: A species belonging to the domain Eukaryotes have cells with a well defined nucleus and other organelles enclosed within a cell membrane; an organism belonging to class mammalia have mammary glands. These need not be repeated when the organism is studied individually, as they are common characteristic of much larger group to which it is a part. Universality - These scientific names are globally accepted, and they are the same irrespective of the regional languages. They cannot be changed to our convenience. Red list - Help to understand biodiversity; we can infer which species of a particular genus is vulnerable, threatened, endangered and critically endangered. Genetics \u2013 In genetics, the Ribonucleic acids of a particular genus or family, can be correlated, thereby enabling to bring back some of the extinct species. For example: the recent news about bringing back the Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius ) through an Elephant (Elephus maximus). Both belongs to the order Proboscidea  Gene banks can be created for a specific species or genus or family. The names are effective for future reference. History \u2013 The evolution of a species can be derived using the scientific name, by comparing the characteristics of the present day organism and the organism of the past. Example: Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, could be referred as the step by step evolution of humans.  Economy \u2013 It enables to identify species having some specific purpose, useful for mankind. This means that all the species of a specific genus has one or other characteristic which can be domesticated and sustainably exploited for the good of mankind. Example: Ocimum tenuiflorum (Tulsi), Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil), have medicinal value. ",
