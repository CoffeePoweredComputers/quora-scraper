            "answer_text": "We have only 40 years (1979 - 2020) of real polar sea ice measurements. Since the satellite measurements started, the total areas were near-steady (slightly increasing) from 1979\u20131983 (4 years), then decreased from 1984 to 2006 (20 years), then have remained near-constant from 2007 through 2020 (14 years). We \u201ccould\u201d draw a simplistic straight line through all of the data points: If we did that, we must claim that every year before 1979 was setting a \u201cNew Record Highest-Ever\u201d for polar sea ice! If we drew a straight line from 1979 through 2020, we could loudly claim: \u201cPolar sea ice is disappearing! - But it is, instead, been steady for now 1/3 of the entire satellite record. It may continue decreasing, and may, or may not, go lower in the next few years. It may remain steady at 3.5 to 4 Million sq kilometers each September. Or it may increase again. From today\u2019s sea ice extents, more heat energy is lost from the newly-opened sea surface in the 8 months of zero and near-zero polar darkness after it melts than is absorbed from the faint polar sun for the the 4 months of the year that it is illuminated\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "There have been many times in the past where the ice caps have totally disappeared the most recent having been around 100,000 years ago. However only about 5,000 years ago the Arctic was close to ice free during the summer. NSIDC : Arctic Was Ice Free In The Past As to why they came back, that's easy but complicated. The Earth and the sun both go through cycles. The sun has it sunspot cycles of 14 years these relate to how much heat is released. These cycles themselves go through cycles in fact our sun is entering a solar minimum, where it's output will drop. Don't worry it will come back. Solar Minimum has Arrived As for the Earth are orbit isn't always the same, the tilt changes, among other things. This is known as the Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles. Milankovitch(Orbital) Cycles and Their Role in Earth's Climate \u2013 Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet Between these and other complexed natural events the Earth's climate changes. When it warms ice melts and our world greens. As it cools the ice comes back and areas of growth is lost. The world cooled, the snow fell, summers weren't as warm, winter's were colder and lasted longer, and the ice sheets grew back. ",

An Ice Age is characterized by 110K years of glaciers followed by 15K of temperate weather \u2014 like we\u2019re in now. An Ice Age is over when all the ice at the poles melts. ",
