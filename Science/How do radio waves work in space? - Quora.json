            "answer_text": "In ancient and medieval times scholars and philosophers believed that there was a medium which filled out the space of the universe. This medium was called aether or ether, or also quintessence. Later the concept of aether was employed in several theories to explain many natural phenomena, such as the traveling of gravity and light, and in general the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In the late 19th century, scientists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a vacuum. However evidence for the existance of such a medium was not found in the Michelson-Morley experiment performed in 1887. This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent aether theory, and started a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which rules out the existence of aether. In spite of experiments disproving the existence of aether, at the beginning of the 20th century the concept of eather was still widely used even by scientists to justify the propagation of electromagnetic waves. For instance, in Technical World Magazine, October 1912, Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the wireless telegraph, explained to the readers that \u201cWireless transmission is nothing more than a certain vibration of the ether. In the ether, when it is carrying the wireless message, a sort of invisible earthquake is set up. Etheric vibrations of four hundred billions of waves in a second produce red light, twice as fast violet, but vibrations of two hundred millions in a second produce the waves that carry the wireless message.\u201dMarconi's Plans for the World (1912) Nikola Tesla believed that electromagnetic waves propagate in aether and that gravitational and magnetic forces are all directly related to the aether. It took many years and many experiments, but now we know that, based on scientific evidence, electromagnetic waves do not need a medium to travel through.  ",

            "answer_text": "If I had my way I would rewrite the books which cover the nature of radio waves and how they work in space and what would we actually see if we had to see Radio waves which are electromagnetic waves. Let us start with the most important issue of Radio or Electromagnetic Waves. They need to go in pairs of loops, one loop is curling the other and that is the way it is, if a product needs to work using electromagnetic energy then the ELECTRIC FIELD and the MAGNETIC FIELD need to be always together, each forming a closed loop and the loop must always be interlaced and never parallel with each other as when two rings existing in parallel planes on top of one another. They are more like two chain rings inserted to CURL one another. Forming two loops with the tip of one thumb touching the respecting tip of the pointer finger in one hand and then linking the two loops up, one on each hand as two loops in a chain with a 90 space orientation between them for now, that would give an idea of the relation between the electro part and the magnetic part of the ELECTRO MAGNETIC WAVE! If one had to look at the interlinking and curling of chain links in the anchor of a ship or a boat, that relation between the looped links, in fact forms the basic relation between electric and magnetic paths in a transmitted wave through some mediums as a wave-guide, but it is not always like that. Note that one might say that it would be a better analogy to say that some electromagnetic transmission in some bounded medium is like links in an anchor chain WITH THE LINKS ROTATING WITHIN EACH OTHER. That is , it is a dynamic chain and not a static one. Let us now consider a dipole antenna radiating radio waves. The two vertical thin rods will at an instant carry, say a varying positive voltage on the upper rod and a varying negative voltage on the lower rod and so the medium at a distance around the rods will be stressed with this voltage, as if the medium was filled with a pressure or a temperature where, each point in the medium would suffer because somewhere else was being subjected to stress. In the case when this stress is varying in voltage, the stressed medium, though it is not a conductor, there will be a current flowing in it, surprising as it might seem, it is not exactly the voltage that causes the current to flow through the insulated medium, but it is the RATE OF CHANGE OF VOLTAGE. So when a dipole is excited with a varying voltage, there is an ELECTRIC LOOP going along one of the vertical copper rods then out to the atmosphere which turns to return through the other vertical loop. This loop, or loops in fact, all occurs along all the flat planes that pass through both copper rods making up the dipole. As these vertical electric loop are closed , conduction current will flow in the copper part due to voltage while a displacement current will flow through the atmosphere due to the rate of change of voltage. This electric current would give rise to a MAGNETIC FIELD whose loop form encircles the copper rods of the dipole. The Vertical loops representing the ELECTRIC field loop is said to be rotating in their vertical planes, all in the same manner as they leave one of the vertical rods, while the MAGNETIC field loop rotates horizontally around the vertical rods of the dipole. The direction of rotation of these Electric and Magnetic linked loops are retained for this particular cycle. Since the voltage applied to the dipole MUST be alternating there will come a time when the vertical rods have to change their polarity as they pass through zero voltage. By this time the horizontal old MAGNETIC field loop still rotating as in the previous direction will be pushed out to be replaced by another circular MAGNETIC field rotating in the opposite direction as the reverse voltage polarity and its rate of change alters to another polarity where the ELECTRIC vertical loops also change their rotation. When this repeated change of voltage polarity on the dipole and its voltage VARIATION proceeds for some time, the medium around the dipole would be filled with horizontal concentric MAGNETIC circles circulating in different direction. These concentric circles/loops of magnetic fields where the adjacent circular magnetic fields rotate/flow in different directions, these are accompanied by circles of electric field with a related rotation where each Electric/Magnetic pair is related exactly the same as one finds in a toroid ferrite wound inductor, where a circular magnetic path is over wound with a copper coil. Depending on the polarity applied to the wound copper coil loops ( the electric path) the direction of the magnetic field in the toroid would follow to suit. Thus the whole picture, if we could see it, would be a lot concentric giant toroids fitted into each other, all above our head emanating from the central dipole where the adjacent magnetic fields will rotate in opposite direction accompanied by a related direction of current in the \u201c invisible\u201d electric winding wound around the circles of magnetic fields and all this expanding out at the velocity of light. Considering the example we took, the vertical electric fields rotating about the axis of their respective magnetic flow direction, any two close electric fields would be as if they were geared together with meshed teeth so that if one rotates in one direction the other will be forced to rotate in the opposite direction, so all the existing concentric \u201c toroids\u201d remain linked to the original dipole excitation power. If one had to stand somewhere in the medium, he would be subjected to variations of magnetic and electric fields whose \u201cintensity of both ROTATIONS\u201d ( but not the real scenario) are related to the sinusoidal variations of the voltage applied to a dipole which mathematically speaking, are one projection of a rotation described by Re^jwt. ( At this stage readers should look at the air rotating loops that dolphins make and play about with underwater. One rotary looped bubble would represent one of the concentric toroids emanating from a dipole. Large Electromagnetic loops can also break into smaller rotating loops each loop rotating in two directions representing the E and H(M) field . Those dolphins know what they are doing in dealing with tools that may help us represent our travelling and standing waves) These giant \u201c wound torroids\u201d with their paired Magnetic and Electric field component will decay as their energy is a constant and while their circumference grows in size their magnetic and electric circulation must decay as they move out. Please note that what was described assumes there were no disturbances or reflection from any where, but life is not so perfect and if there was some obstruction in the way and a reflection took place, then the whole picture will change from an outward flowing electromagnetic field to one with a lot of vibrating patches of pairs of E and M fields oscillating or repeated reversed rotation, at the same location which we normally call standing waves. Still nature is not that bad to us and we can still use such standing or travelling waves even if they decay a little. If one at this stage had to refer to the pictures produces by sound waves in sheets as in Chladni\u2019s figure, one may slowly build an idea of what happens if that dipole we considered was placed in a closed volume with reflections. It would indeed be an elegant scenario with pairs of wedded E and M waves oscillating in space and time travelling and dancing at the same location, depending of the frequency and size of the dipole itself and the cavity that we are using. Such a beautiful picture can never be described by plotting a sine and a cosine wave saying that they represent the E and M wave at 90 degrees to one another. That is enough for now, may be I could build on this some other day. This video of Dolphin air rings may help readers to think of the ElectroMagnetic ring with two rotations that I have in mind.  ",

            "answer_text": "The same as they do on the planet. On the planet when a radio wave is transmitted the signal gets bounced around by particles in the air. Typically the more particles in the air the farther transmission will go. However in space because its a vacuum. Nothing is stopping the radio waves. They too will hit particles but there is non resistance. If say i broadcasted a show with an over the air transmitter today and say you're on the moon. With in just a few seconds with a powerful enough reciever. You can pick up those radio waves. ",
