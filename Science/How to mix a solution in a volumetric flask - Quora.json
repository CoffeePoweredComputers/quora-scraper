            "answer_text": "The solution must not be prepared initially in a volumetric flask, or in fact, any volumetric glassware. It must be prepared in a beaker, with stirring usually, and the solution allowed to reach room temperature. This is especially important for alkalies, which become hot on dilution with water. Volumetric glassware is damaged by hot solutions. Make the solution in a beaker, ensure completely dissolved, then pour solution into flask. Rinse beaker with deionised or distilled water into the flask. Repeat rinsing and adding. Then stopper the flask, mix by inverting, and allow liquid to drain off the sides and neck of the flask. Remove stopper and make up to the calibrated mark with water, then remix. Alkalies need to be standardised by titration because they absorb moisture on weighing and also carbon dioxide, but the latter will not effect phenolphthalein indicator. ",
