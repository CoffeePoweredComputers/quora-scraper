            "answer_text": "Mr. Patel, you\u2019ve probably heard the old expression, \u201cto stay with someone or something through thick and thin\u201d means you persevere through good times as well as bad times. While that usually deals with friendships, it can also deal with inanimate objects like blankets and pillows. So what does that have to do with thick or thin blankets? Haven\u2019t you ever had a favorite blanket that wasn\u2019t particularly warm, but just because you\u2019ve slept under it for a good number of years, it\u2019s become special to you. And in many cases, those old blankets give you a certain warmth that a thick blanket doesn\u2019t offer, even though they aren\u2019t particularly thick or heavy. There\u2019s a lot of things in life that are that way. Maybe your wife or girlfriend, your old hound dog of a fuzzy old cat\u2026 there\u2019s many things in life that can be thin and warm. ",

            "answer_text": "Blankets do not physically warm you \u2014 they just reduce the loss of body heat, and allow you to raise your skin temperature, hence you perceive warmth when lying under them. The retention of the heat is caused by the insulating value of the blanket. Some blanket materials have finer fibres than others, and so they much reduce heat loss caused by cold air convection within the material, this allows thinner blankets of fine fibres to compete successfully with thicker ones made of thicker fibres. What will physically warm you, of course, is an electric blanket, either under or over. In a cold room at night it\u2019s lovely to snuggle up without the expense of heating the whole room. It is a complete myth that artificial heating makes you soft and unable to tolerate tough conditions. the human body acclimatises rapidly no matter how you live. ",
