However, the construction of the rail bridge commenced only by 1911 and it was commissioned on February 24, 1914.  4/12 Bridge opens up to allow ferry movement BCCL German engineer Scherzer designed the central part of the bridge that opens up to allow ferry movement. On an average, 10 to 15 boats and small ships pass beneath the bridge every month.  5/12 Link between Rameswaram and the mainland BCCL The Pamban bridge was the only link between Rameswaram and the mainland until 1988 when a road bridge, running parallel to it, was built. Earlier, it used to transport hundreds of pilgrims everyday to the temple in the island.  6/12 New broad gauge line in 2007 BCCL The railways decided to close down the metre gauge rail as part of its gauge conversion plans. In fact, the railways had proposed to make it this line a unigauge, but then President A P J Abdul Kalam suggested that it be strengthened and converted into a broad gauge rail. Following it the new broad gauge line was thrown open for traffic in 2007.  7/12 Survived a major cyclone BCCL In 1964, the bridge survived a major cyclone that flattened Dhanushkodi, a thriving port town. E Sreedharan, the man behind the construction of the Delhi Metro, played a major role in bolstering the bridge within 46 days.  8/12 IIT-Madras experts to test strength BCCL Experts from IIT-Madras will carry out a study on the residual life of the Pamban Bridge. The experts will ascertain the strength, stability and extent of corrosion.  9/12 Vying for Unesco's world heritage list BCCL The bridge was further strengthened in 2009 for running goods traffic. Indian Railways is vying to bring the bridge in the Unesco's world heritage list.  10/12 Tourist attraction BCCL As India's first sea bridge, it has also become a tourist attraction by itself as people watch in awe when the two leaves of the bridge open up to let ships to pass through.

Another example of their engineering prowess is the 11-km-long tunnel across the treacherous Pir Panjal mountain range on the Banihal-Qazigund railway line in Jammu and Kashmir. It is the longest such transportation passage in India and second longest in Asia. About 1,300 workers and 150 engineers worked tirelessly overcoming all odds for the last seven years to accomplish the engineering marvel. The tunnel is totally water proof and equipped with a fire fighting system across the entire length of the tunnel.

The arch-shaped bridge across Chenab river-bed in Reasi district, which will be five times the height of Qutab Minar at 359 m above river bed, will connect Baramulla and Srinagar to Jammu via Udhampur-Katra-Qazigund covering the entire route in about seven hours. The 1,315-m-long engineering marvel would boast of several unique features. The design would ensure that it withstands blast and seismic activities, while the signalling arrangements would ensure the train does not encounter high wind velocity at that height.
