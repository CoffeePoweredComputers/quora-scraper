            "answer_text": "Frankly, I have no idea how busy they are, nor do I mix in their group or circles. Most will be post- doctoral academics. How well known they are or whether they include any well known scientists, I do not know. But being post - doctoral, will be known to the scientific community by the papers they had published. Academics from all around the globe visit the Vatican & especially the library & archives which are only open to academics. In the past, they have been open to general public but sadly items have been stolen & pages torn out of books. These are then lost to the scientific community. So now only varifiable academics are allowed access. I think the most famous academic was Copernicus as he was also a Catholic Priest. All academics are given access to Vatican library & archives irrespective of religion or none. Given that there are few sciences the Jesuits have not contributed to, over the past 300 years, is likely the Jesuits will have a presence. Which will be good for his Nibs seeing as he is a Jesuit! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a It might be worth asking Rev'd Fr Dr Francis Marsden here on Quora as he is a molecular chemist & he might be able to direct you further?
