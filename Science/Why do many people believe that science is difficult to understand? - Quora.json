            "answer_text": "QUESTION: Why do many people believe that science is difficult to understand? ANSWER: Because anything complex is difficult to understand if you have not studied the topic and learned the antecedents to the particular concepts you want to address. Say, for example, you are not in the construction field; then next time you are near a renovation or new-build project, pay attention to the conversations (that aren\u2019t just socializing, but are work-related). Perhaps visit a factory that makes trusses or a factory that constructs entire houses on the factory floor, before shipping to an installation site. You will hear terms and concepts that are meaningless to you. And it\u2019s not science. It\u2019s just building technology. For that matter, just go to your municipal archives and pull some civil permits for a substantial building project, and see how much you understand of the drawings (and their symbols) and of the terms that define adherence of the project to relevant codes. Hoo-boy! Merely read the official text of your state or provincial building codes and see how much of it is crystal clear to you. If you have no mechanical background, see if you can get a visitor pass to a tuner shop or, visit my brother where he disassembles his Mazda 3 every couple of winters and tunes and tickles and upgrades parts and makes it a deceptive little machine that regularly puts down supercars. See how much of what is going on you actually understand. \u201cWait, you mean you can\u2019t just squirt nitrous oxide into the air intake?\u201d Um, no. Again, it\u2019s not rocket surgery - it\u2019s a specialist pursuit. Just take some advanced math courses. Oh, wait. If you never had more than high-school pre-calculus, you\u2019ll be out of your depth until you have internalized the language and short-hand that mathematicians use at the undergraduate building-block levels, so that they can even talk about the more advanced concepts. And you don\u2019t get that by hearing it or reading it a couple of times. It takes months and years of hard work to get to where you can do the junior stuff (second-year, third-year, fourth-year math) routinely, so it is there and ready as a well-worn tool-set in your math toolbox, when you begin to tackle the more advanced material. Something that you jot down as a few little symbols represents actions and procedures that took a year to learn (just as those needed you to have mastered the previous year\u2019s work to learn). People who work in a specialized environment use jargon and specialized language that compresses and compacts large swaths of previous understanding (that they had to work for, often for years) into heavily loaded terms that convey huge amounts of related conceptualization into brief utterances. Nobody but another person with the same background has the same knowledge of what is meant by those terms, what is highly compressed into them. SOME people are able to unpack such advanced learning into expressions and diagrams and talks and writings and videos that make them understandable (to an extent) to a non-specialist audience. Think of Stephen Hawking, Richard Feynman, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, Richard Dawkins, Lawrence Krauss, Randall Monroe, and many more. ",

            "answer_text": "For a variety of reasons, some of which are: Many scientific theories are counter-intuitive. People have a sense of reality based on what they\u2019ve already learned and what they see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Science often challenges this sense of reality based on data collected by machines designed to avoid the inaccuracy of our preconceptions and senses.Science is based in a large part on mathematical principles most people don\u2019t grasp. It can be difficult for a person to come to terms with a claim made by science without understanding the underlying reasoning that led to it.Science isn\u2019t authoritative. It leaves the door open to the introduction of new evidence and the complete refutation of its existing set of established theories. Some people see that as casting doubts on these established theories, and regard science as a whole as an unreliable source of truth as a result.Science often doesn\u2019t provide answers, but instead only raises more questions. Many scientific endeavors end up making an important question less clear, rather than give a simple answer. Some people find that counter-productive.There is a vested political interest in some groups, among them the major religions, to cast aspersions on science when it challenges their tenets. As a result prominent figures have spoken out against scientific findings and attacked the scientific method and community to strengthen their own arguments. Some people don\u2019t want to choose between their own beliefs and scientific findings.",
