            "answer_text": "There is no term such as microsrophyte. In Pteridophytes like Selaginella some species bear unisporangiate spikes I. e they bear either microsporophylls or megasporophylls whichare leafy structures. Most species are bisporangiate, bearing both micro- and megasporangia.  Microsporangia are comparatively smaller in size and bear smaller sized spores which are called microspores. These on germination give rise to male gametophytes which bear antheridia. Microsporangia are borne in the axil of leafy structures called as microsporophyll.  spikes of Selaginella bearing microsporophylls and microsporophylls. Megasprangia are comparatively larger size. They contain lager sized and four megaspores. These on germination give rise to female gametophytes , which bear female gametes in archegonia. Megasporangia are borne in the axil of leafy structures called as megasporophylls.  As far as angiosperms and gymnosperms are concerned, microspores are called as pollen grains and megaspores are produced in ovules. In gymnosperms microsporangia containing pollen grains are borne on microsporophylls which form male cones. Ovules / megasporangia are borne on megasporophylls which are borne on female cones.    In Angiosperms microsporophylls are equivalent to stamens, which contain pollen grains/ microspores. Megaspore/ ovule is contained inside the ovary, which is a part of the carpels/ megasporophylls. . Both stamens and carpels are a part of flower.  A stamen of angiosperm.   A flower of angiosperm bearing stamens and carpel or pistil. ",

            "answer_text": "Microspore: Spore that develops into a microgametophyte. In seed plants, this is the pollen grain. Microsporangia are the structures that give rise to male gametes or microspores or pollen grains. Microsporangia is the plural form while microsporangium in the singular. Megasporangia are the structures that give rise to female gametes or megaspores or ovules Microsporophyll: Modified leaf that bears microsporangia. Examples from the seed plants include the stamens of flowers and the subunits of the pollen cones of conifers. A sporophyll is a leaf that bears sporangia. Both microphylls and megaphylls can be sporophylls. In heterosporous plants, sporophylls (whether they are microphylls or megaphylls) bear either megasporangia and thus are called megasporophylls, or microsporangia and are called microsporophylls. Microsporophyte -Microspores are spores which develop in the microsporangium and which will germinate and develop into the male gametophyte generation ",
