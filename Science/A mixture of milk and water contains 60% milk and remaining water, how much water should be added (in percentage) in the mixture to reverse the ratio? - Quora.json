            "answer_text": "Let there be 100- Litres of milk-water mixture, containing 60- Litres of milk and 40- Litres of water.Let \u201cV\u201d- Litres of water be added.So 40 + V= (100+ V) x 0.6So 0.4 V= 20So V= 20/0.4=200/4= 50- Litres. Therefore on adding 50- Litres of water to 100- Litres of milk-water mixture, the milk-water ratio will be reversed from 3:2 to 2: 3. OK.=\u00f7\u00d7=\u00f7\u00d7=\u00f7\u00d7=\u00f7\u00d7=\u00d7=\u00f7\u00d7=\u00d7=\u00f7\u00d7Another Simple Method:When the milk-water ratio is 3:2, 3- corresponds to 60- Litres.",

            "answer_text": "For the sake of the answer, I\u2019ll imagine that the mixture contains 60 cm3 of milk and 40 cm3 of water, making 100 cm3 in total. Now, you want to make it so it\u2019s 40% milk and 60% water by adding more water, so it\u2019s a matter of finding this out, 60 would be 40% of which number? If 60 is 40%, then 30 would be 20%. 30 x 5 would be 150 cm3, so to the mixture in my example, you would need to add 50 cm3 of water to reverse the ratio of milk to water. This would be an extra 50% of the total volume of the solution. ",

            "answer_text": "Use the simple dilution equation You have 60% milk. You want 40% milk Work on basis you have 100 L milk to start Equation: C1 * V1 = C2 * V2 40%* V1 = 60% * 100 L V1 = 60%* 100L / 40% V1 = 150 L Final volume must be 150L You must ass 50 L water to the milk OR: 50% of the original volume.
