            "answer_text": "NOTE: I challenge the use of the word \u201cbelieve\u201d. For purposes of this response, the I use the word \u201cbelieve\u201d as determining between something being true/real or false/a lie. I do not use in the sense of religious faith. Human beings have free will. One aspect of free will is that they can choose to believe whatever they want. The beauty of science is that it relies on observation and experimentation. Science is a process of discovery that allows people to link pieces of information/data into coherent understandings of the world around us. Science is observable, demonstrable, predictive, and repeatable. In some cases, the predictions of science may not be observable today but might be something we can see in the future. A good example of this are predictions derived from Einstein\u2019s theories weren\u2019t observable when Einstein made them due to limitations in technology at the time. Many of these predictions have only been observed recently. Despite all of that, people can choose to not believe science. Humans are creatures of instinct. We tend to believe the world in terms of our own senses and our own specific experiences. People can craft there own \u201cproven\u201d beliefs of the world around them and that guides their thinking. That can cause people to dismiss things that don\u2019t conform to their perception of the world. An example: many people deny climate change because, in their lifetime, it\u2019s always been cold November - February. Even though the data shows that global temperatures are rising, because it\u2019s still cold November - February, in their minds climate change is a farce. That keeps them from studying it, understanding it, understanding the science behind it. Ultimately, to trust science, you have to have an open mind. You have to be receptive to the data and the predictions to which that data guides us. If a person\u2019s mind is closed to this, it can be very difficult to convince them to believe in science. ",

            "answer_text": "No it is not. But just to be clear - the essence of the scientific worldview is not a bunch of stuff that \u201cscientists believe\u201d, it is a way THINKING logically about the physical world. And free Will (whether you believe in it on scientific grounds or simply experience it without question) makes it so that the very act of THINKING is a choice. You don't HAVE to think, especially about subjects that bother you, utterly fail to interest you, and in particular when failing to think about them does not directly lead to your discomfort or pain, as is the case with vast amounts of scientific knowledge. For example, the tragic hypothetical fate of Schrodinger's kitten - as fascinating as it is to those of us who can\u2019t help but be fascinated by it - is grossly irrelevant to 99.9999 % of humanity. As there is NO PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCE to failing to take any interest (let alone believe) in quantum superposition or its implications, many people chose not to think about it. They are therefore and will forever remain completely impervious to the application of logic on that subject, and by extension to the science. It is their choice. ",

            "answer_text": "You can present science in a clear and understandable fashion, marshal great amounts of evidence and yet some people will still choose not to even look at the evidence. Religion and superstition give set answers and some take comfort in the sureness, though wrong, of these answers. Saying God created the heaven and the earth in 7 days is a story told with certainty by the likes of Ken Ham. Even if you point out to people that the sun is a light and the moon is a rock and there is no firmament and stars are lights similar to the sun but much farther away than the moon, all in conflict with the bible, they will counter with more religious mumbo jumbo to cling to their superstitions rather than explain reality.

            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026 this is a bit tricky. My personal opinion is just give them enough rope to hang themselves. People who are so stuck on faith over scientific discovery, especially the Creationists, are never going to change until something literally earth shattering happens to their lives that shows them otherwise. A good example is how anti-vaxxer families quickly change their tune after their kids get measles, the mumps and even polio. It\u2019s not worth the effort on your end, really. Just let them believe what they will, and while you\u2019ll find yourself a bit frustrated at times, you\u2019ll be happier and a lot more stress free in the long run. Besides, faith in itself is a deeply personal thing that is very much intertwined with their personalities. When it comes to fundamental beliefs like religion and faith, it\u2019s better to just respect their choice to believe whatever they want, and let them ask you politely if they ever find themselves at lost for an explanation besides \u201cit\u2019s god\u201d.
