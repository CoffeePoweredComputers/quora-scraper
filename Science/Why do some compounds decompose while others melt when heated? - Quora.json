            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhy do some compounds decompose while others melt when heated?\u201d This question was answered correctly earlier, so I just explain it further in my words with different approach. Only thermoplastic and crystalline materials melt. Both melting and decomposition need energy to break down the crystalline structure (in melting) or the chemical structure (in decomposition). Which one takes place earlier, melting or decomposition? It depends on the amount of energy required for each process and reactions involved. If the amount of melting energy is smaller than decomposition energy, then the material will first melts and then decomposes (for instance, polyethylene, PE). Whereas, when the value of melting energy is greater than that for decomposition, then the material decomposes before reaching to the melting conditions (for example, cellulose). Cellulose is a natural thermoplastic linear macromolecule (polymer), so, we expect to see it melts through heating, but the weak chemical bonding of \u2014O\u2014 along the macromolecular chains are broken before it reaches to the melting point. That is why we never see cellulose to melt, because it decomposes to smaller macromolecules and molecules before melting. Why? Because of the differences in the strengths of the structures that must be broken down in these two processes. In melting, the crystalline structure of the material must be destroyed, while in decomposition, strong chemical bonds (covalent bonds, whatever) must be broken. Thanks for request to answer. ~ SD ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, all compounds decompose when heated to some point. It is just that some of them melt (and some even boil) before that decomposition temperature is reached. Compounds decompose thermally if one of the covalent bonds in the molecules is weak enough to break under the thermal motion. For very big and complex molecules, such weak bonds are more probable somewhere. The melting temperature of a compound is reached when the thermal motion can break the strictest inter-molecular interactions and molecules start flowing past each other. For bigger and bigger molecules, and for molecules with very strong inter-molecular interactions, the melting temperature can get very high. If you keep making the molecules bigger, at some point, the melting temperature would be higher than the decomposition temperature. If you heat such compounds, they decompose before they can melt. ",
