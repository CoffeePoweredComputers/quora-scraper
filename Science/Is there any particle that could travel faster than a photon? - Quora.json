            "answer_text": "Well, In general , no particle cannot travel at beyond the speed of light. But, there is an controversial particle called 'neutrino' l, that is theoritically proven to go beyond the persible limit. Now, you've to realize that this observation is only based on theoritical observation, and can't be applied in eiestien-driven physics era, as it would make the equation E=mc\u00b2 wrong. Now, this can't be done(being no alternative). That's why, you've to consider this particle as Figment of imagination. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking me to answer this. As others have said the short answer is no BUT it is possible for particles to go faster than photons through material! In my view it is a matter of semantics. I see the passage of photons through a material, such as glass, as the absorption of one photon being followed by the emission of another and this leads to the \u2018light\u2019 being slowed down. As neutrinos do not interact (much) with matter they may go faster than photons. Another issue is that if there were particles that go faster than light in a vacuum, then perhaps we would not notice OR at least not diagnose the speed correctly. ",
