            "answer_text": "Your question lacks clarity. Planetariums are machines which simulate the night sky, and are (or pre-COVID were) popular devices found in science museums, some universities, etc. I worked in planetariums for over 30 years, and India has nowhere near 8500 planetariums. Neither does the USA. Only Japan comes close to that number, thanks to their government having put one in every school in the country. Star formation has not ceased. Our galaxy forms about ten new stars per year. The Orion Nebula is a prime example of a star forming region that is reasonably near us. ",
