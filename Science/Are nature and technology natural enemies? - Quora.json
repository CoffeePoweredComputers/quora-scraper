            "answer_text": "Technology and nature are considered to be in a century-long boxing match, where the advancement in one acts as a downfall blow to the other. The technology-less era or the ancient era was the time where humans had no power over nature. Humans had to bow down to the whims of nature and had no means to escape the wrath of nature. The discovery of fire was probably the first step towards modernization and a realization that humans can harness the power of nature for their own good. Since then, the mankind has long been urging to break all the boundaries of human thinking and trying to stretch the possibility of achieving the impossible or improbable. Technolgy is nothing, but a reflection of human imagination. The machines, gadgets, software, etc -basically all that which can be termed as technology, are a reality because someone from our kind has imagined these. If we will observe carefully, we will notice that at the base of technology lies nature. The more the world is moving towards advancement, the more harm it is causing to nature. Development of infrastructure and hi-tech cities at the cost of forests, easy travel at the cost of ozone layer depletion, energy generation at the cost of non-renewable fossil fuels, are some of the examples which depict how technology and nature are century-long sparring partners. But, come to think of it, technology in itself is not the natural enemy of nature. It is the thought behind the development of technology, which is the actual enemy. The technology was developed with an intention of making humans more powerful. If instead, we try to develop technology, with an intention of making our nature more beautiful and less harmful to us, we will be able to see both technology and nature exist in tandem with each other. Smart cities, satellite weather coverage, Photovoltaic cells, Bio-fuel vehicles, are all examples where technology is being used to make up for the menace that had been done in the past. The relation between technology and nature, hence, clearly depends on the judicious use of it by humans. ",

            "answer_text": "Seeing the Global warming, Climate change, pollution, mass deforestation, species extinction etc, it is natural to assume that technology is at the base of nature's destruction. When the first motor car ran, no one could have imagined that vehicular emission would cause massive air pollution. Same is the case for fossil fuel burning in Thermal power plants.  When Alfred Nobel invented dynamite, it was for peaceful purpose in mining. But it ended up taking so many lives. But how are we solving the problem of Global warming and Climate change ? Through alternate means of energy like solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, hybrid cars, smart grid etc.. And at their very base is technology: solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, controlled nuclear chain reaction. It is technology itself (satellites and ground sensors) which provides us the information and means to tackle the harm done to the nature. When Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) affected the ozone layer, Hydrofluorocarbons came to the rescue. Smart cities and green buildings in urban areas and decentralized energy production in rural areas are helping us to mitigate the harm. It is thus not technology itself which is detrimental to nature, it is how we as humanity use it. And for problems created by humans, technology itself is the solution. Also, at the very base of destruction to nature is the very high population growth and unsustainable livelihoods. And this cannot be blamed on technology. In the end, it must be said that if human beings are an intelligent species, it is because of an inquisitive mind. If seen at a larger level, the harm to the nature is a mistake by us which will be corrected in time. Technology has changed our lives in amazing ways. Even to predict what lies 100 years ahead is difficult. With time as the fourth dimension, who knows what lies a 1000 years ahead :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Humans have always been part of nature. Being inquisitive and intelligent, they have craved leisure. They felt a need to improve or change the way nature works and have things according to their own desires. Different methods and processes to use and bend nature to their own will is what we know as technology. It can be rightly considered that technology was born to change the ways of nature, making it an enemy of the nature. Technology has always had an ill effect on nature in some way or the other. Consider an example of building a road. The road, winding it's way through the fields and hills, uproots the trees, destroys animal dwellings, diminishes the gargantuan hills into mere mounds. On top of this, technology uses nature itself for this destruction spree. The stones, tar, and metal needed for heavy machinery come from excavating deep into the womb of nature. Take any example, and it will enunciate the fact that nature always suffers a two-way blow from the advancements of technology. The working philosophy of nature and technology make each other their 'natural' opponents, pun intended. One's limitations give rise to the other and the other destroys the former. ",
