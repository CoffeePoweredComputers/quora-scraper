            "answer_text": "What functions were computers from the 80s' able to do? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re referring to home computers rather than mainframes and supercomputers. The home computer market of the 80\u2019s was very much in flux, with different computers offering different niches. Some did 2D gaming well. Others were fast at crunching numbers. Other technologies included MIDI interfaces, CD-ROM, modems, video editing, stereo sampling, voice synthesizing, multitasking, virtual memory, memory protection, networking\u2026 basically, anything you could name. And of course, most products were exclusive to a given platform, so you really had to choose your platform according to your needs. That\u2019s not the whole story, though. Even the most capable platform required you to purchase accessories in order to realize its potential. An unexpanded machine was rarely enough to let you do most of what the platform offered. Other than the advent of the Internet, 80\u2019s computers had what we have today, with three hefty caveats. They were less powerful. Constraints were (a lot) tighter back in the 80\u2019s. Today\u2019s typical home computer has vastly greater performance across the board (higher resolution, greater color depth, faster processor, lower latency, better sound, more RAM and storage space, etc) on every metric, at a relatively far cheaper price.They were less general. A given 80\u2019s computer would do a couple of things really well, but struggle in some areas. Today\u2019s computers enable you to do most of the things the typical user wants to do straight from the factory, so your choice of platform rarely the deal-breaker it used to be.Fewer and more expensive programs. If you wanted to do serious work back then, there was no open source movement to provide the software for free. Today\u2019s user has a vast library of available software that had no equivalent back then.",

            "answer_text": "As Chip indicated, in the 80\u2019s computers were mostly large business mainframes used for database and financial calculations. The personal computers were just taking hold in the early 80\u2019s. Being an engineer, I bought a TI 99/4A to learn Basic programming and wrote an electrical program for calculating fault currents which I was able to enter on the large mainframe at work through a teletype (no monitor) which we used for a few years until the hardware/software improved. In the early 80\u2019s, the first computer spreadsheet program was released called Visicalc (1979) and people began to using it in many new and novel ways, limited only by their imagination and need. Word processing programs like Word Perfect came out and the typewriter was left in the dust. So, to answer you question, anything that people saw the need for and the hardware was capable of. ",
