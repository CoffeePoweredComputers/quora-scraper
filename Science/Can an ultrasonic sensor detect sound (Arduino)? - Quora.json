            "answer_text": "Ultrasonic sensors are designed to listen for their frequency and ignore other frequencies. Basic Ultrasonic Sensor Operation To generate the ultrasonic wave, ultrasonic sensors use a vibrating device known as a transducer to emit ultrasonic pulses that travel in a cone-shaped beam. The range of an ultrasonic sensor is determined by the frequency of vibration of the transducer. As the frequency increases, the sound waves transmit for progressively shorter distances. Conversely, as the frequency decreases, the sound waves transmit for progressively longer distances. Thus, long-range ultrasonic sensors work best at lower frequencies, and short-range ultrasonic sensors work best at higher frequencies. How Do Ultrasonic Sensors Work? ",

            "answer_text": "Last night, I put an ultrasound capable piezoelectric speaker in front of an ultrasound \u201cgenerator\u201d then I used a scope to see if any voltage would appear at the terminals. Yes, it did but the voltage was in the order of millivolts. However, using the ultrasound driver to be operated as a ultrasound source AND putting the aforementioned speaker in front of the ultrasound driver, well I did expect no extra voltage waveform and I did not get any waveforms. You can only operate the ultrasound driver one way at the time. I was a bit surprised to get any waveform at the terminal, but I did. I only tried one type of driver so I am not informed of this being possible for other drivers. ",

            "answer_text": "An ultrasonic sensor is optimized to detect sound in a narrow band above human hearing. It may detect components of the environment that produce ultrasonic sounds. Depending on the sensor, it may include high and low pass filters to clip off the sound outside it\u2019s designed parameters. Since the job of an ultrasonic sensor is normally to pick up a signal coming from a matching transmitter, these filters are designed to minimize false positive detection caused by noise outside the designed range.
