            "answer_text": "Science promises truth and wants to be the primary source of it. As many answers here on Quora attest, it can't deliver absolute truth, but if nothing else can either, so what? Science is the best we have. Of course, it needs at least one little assumption, that of \"scientific naturalism\", and maybe a couple of others. Scientific naturalism rejects the possibility of supernatural causes for the purposes of scientific investigation. This introduces an interesting potential conflict. What if there ever was a supernatural cause and science rejected it a priori because of the assumption of scientific naturalism? How would we even consider the possibility without science? How would we weigh the evidence if it could mean anything in light of supernatural influence? I argue that the use of science and some form of scientific naturalism, properly applied, are very reasonable and appropriate. The primary problem is that they are being used to investigate purposes for which they are inadequate. Science is best used in cases where experiments can be repeated to test their assumptions. It is best used to falsify a hypothesis, rather than to prove one true. This isn't to say that it can't be applied to cases with more abstract assumptions or to help prove something true. It should just be acknowledged that in those cases, it is much weaker. What we really need to do is apply science (empiricism) with assumptions and arguments (rationalism) as well as personal experience (existentialism). In doing so, science gives up its claims to (complete) objectivity. Science needs to always be considered within the context of a larger philosophy of knowledge and be balanced against other perspectives.  It is extremely powerful for the purposes of falsifying hypotheses and verifying repeatable experiments. It quickly steps beyond its bounds when it starts dealing with assumptions that can't be easily verified, like in nutrition, climate, economics, or sociology. Christians question the assumption of scientific naturalism specifically in the case of ancient history. They want to believe in the miracles of the Bible as well God's personal creation of the universe and all living things. Rather than arguing against it, scientific naturalism rejects it out of hand. It claims its own conclusions as objective knowledge. If it was just framing this hypothetically with respect to the stated assumptions, it could be useful as an alternative hypothesis, even for Christians who otherwise reject the conclusion. Of course, by taking the assumption of scientific naturalism, they beg the question in deciding between these two historical narratives. When that fails, they claim science as a more primary mode of inquiry and ridicule Christians as if they had rejected it. The proper view, however, is to consider science as a tool within a larger framework of philosophy and inquiry, also including our personal experiences. Christians do not reject science just because they do not use it as a more primary mode of inquiry above everything else. Outside of the context of the Biblical miracles and creation, Christians usually do believe in scientific naturalism, or at least something like it founded in the character of God. They seek to apply science appropriately where it fits best. They usually believe and agree with the data, but reject the assumptions and interpretation. In cases like this, it is perfectly reasonable to have multiple rational interpretations rather than forcing a scientific consensus. In conclusion, the problem isn't with scientific naturalism so much that many people use it and science to promise more than it can deliver. ",

            "answer_text": "The closest you are going to come to accurate critiques of naturalism are its unproveable assumptions. All systems of thought have them, since every complicated system is not strictly speaking proveably true in 100% of its assertions without going outside the system (see Godel's work on math). Think of Euclid's axioms as the unproveable foundation of a very strong system of geometry, as an example.  Naturalism has as assumptions things like \"causation\", \"localism\", \"rationality\", mathematics as an accurate representation of reality, \"continuity of reality\" and the like. The usefulness of naturalism is unique, despite these assumptions. So far the assumptions only break down in an observable way at the molecular or smaller level, and usually at the atomic or smaller level. \"Localism\" turns out not to observably apply to the way entangled particles act when separated at distances too far away for light or anything else to travel from one location to another. What it means to say something is \"real\" breaks down at such level, when only probability can be used to describe reality. At the very smallest level time and space are discrete, not continuous. You can think of these as creating a \"critique\" if you like, and probably is as close as you are going to get. Philosophy has yet to totally digest what such findings mean for the assumptions upon which science has been conducted as a naturalistic enterprise. The usefulness of scientific predictions continues despite the weirdness of its underlying assumptions at such levels, however. ",

I would also point that there are some critiques that come from critiques of technological thinking from both literature and from a number of non-Christians (and even some scientists) CS Lewis' Miracles and The Abolition of Man, and a number of CS Lewis' essays make a substantive critique of naturalism. Most of the critiques focus on the ways in which: 1)  Our experience of reality doesn't cohere to an \"its all chemistry\" that is the basis of naturalism. 2) Ethically naturalism doesn't measure up to human value, ethics, and relationships. 3) Naturalism is ultimately self-contradictory and it undermines its own premises.

            "answer_text": "If I understand the defintion, I think the primary critique is about its assumptions.  The process is fine because, scientific method, but the assumptions under which it is applied are simply chosen.  We are like the ant farm in which a few of the ants have concluded that the enclosed environment could not have come into being on its on, and that we cannot percieve the 6 people in the next room having happy hour.  But the majority, not wanting their sense of autonomy questioned, devise a way of looking at reality which says if one cannot touch a thing or reproduce evidence of it, it does not exist.  Scientific method is not a way of observing reality but of defining it.  Therefore, the guys with their martinis cannot exist.  The minority speak of the the glass wall beyond which they cannot see, the inherent longing for an existence beyond the glass, the morality which exists independent of themselves, and to the ant whose historical record requires a world beyond the glass.  The majority, however, has only to point to the tests which define reality and which can illuminate only the world inside the glass, and the minority are laughed at as irrational. ",

            "answer_text": "The best I've read is in the book Where the Conflict Really Lies by Alvin Plantinga. In the first half of the book he refutes any conflict between pure science and theism, by ripping into the arguments of Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Paul Draper, Philip Kitcher and others. But even more interesting is his final chapter, in which he presents a very compelling case that there is deep and irreconcilable conflict between naturalism and science! This is quite ironic (and refreshing) considering the number of times I've been told belief in God is unscientific. ",
