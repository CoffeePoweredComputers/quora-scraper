            "answer_text": "I think it would depend on the circumstances of what you need to be considered clean in a specific environment. It\u2019s fairly relative. For instance, you wash your hands before you leave the bathroom. Is that sufficiently hygienic? Maybe, often times not though, unless one washes properly and long enough. Let\u2019s assume you was properly and then sit sown to eat a meal. Your hygienically sufficiently clean for that circumstance. But not for doing surgery let\u2019s say. It\u2019s interesting to note that if we look at history, the nation of Israel was commanded to bury their waste, something the nations around them did not normally do. It was for the purposes of hygiene. You can reference that as a historical fact at Deuteronomy 23: 13. There are some really excellent articles on standards of cleanliness on jw.org that I think you\u2019d find very informative and interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, certainly we have ways of measuring \u201ccontaminants\u201d or materials you don't want in/on something. But you have to define what contaminants are important to count/measure, since it's possible there could be billions of various foreign matter to detect. ",
