            "answer_text": "Is falsifiability a strange concept of limited use in science? No. It\u2019s pivotal. A person who thinks he is never wrong will never learn. Learning has a feedback loop where one knows adjustment is needed when one is wrong. Falsifiability is a property of a theory. All theories are regarded by scientists falsifiable because there is no way to improve our understanding if you will never allow a theory to be found to be wrong (or inadequate, or imperfect) at some future time. The ability to be falsified allows theories to be improved upon or be replaced with better ones. As for \u201climited use\u201d, falsifiability applies to each of us. In order to learn we have to allow all the knowledge in our head to be falsifiable. For example: Some of us were taught in school that there\u2019s no logarithm of a negative number. Teachers would say this either because they don\u2019t know better or they are simply keeping us temporarily focused so that we won\u2019t get confused.But it is incorrect. Once you learn Euler\u2019s identity you learn not only how to get the logarithm of a negative number, but you can even get the logarithm of a complex number. Our previous knowledge gets falsified and replaced with improved information.Also whenever you are doing any kind of trial and error you are effectively falsifying older conclusions in favor of better ones. To add: When a theory is improved upon, the older stuff is not necessarily thrown out. It would be thrown out only if it\u2019s really wrong. A lot of stuff we keep because they are still useful for the most part but there would be improved versions that take into account more factors or new findings. ",

            "answer_text": "It is critical. The idea is that a theory invariably states that if the theory is correct, you will see a certain set of predicted outcomes of experiments. If the predictions come right, so far, so good, but that does not mean the theory is correct because a different theory could also give the same results. However, if a theory is true, it cannot give a false prediction, so if we find an outcome that is false in the predicted set, the theory must be wrong. That is the ideal, anyway. In actual fact, what usually happens is the theory is tweaked, or a term is added, or something is changed to accommodate the new observation. Alternatively, the problem is ignored. An example of the latter is that quantum field theory predicts a value for the cosmological constant that is out by 120 orders of magnitude. That should put QFT to bed, but it doesn\u2019t. Much better to ignore what proves you are wrong than admit it and actually go back to the beginning and start again. ",

Falsifiability is a concept from philosophy of science that says that it is possible to prove that a theory is wrong. There are different ways in which can be done. The easiest way to do it is to find an example where the theory should apply, but somehow does not. So if there is no way to demonstrate it is wrong, there is a problem. This IMO makes a lot of sense. Think on it.. If there is no method or way to show that something *could* be wrong\u2026. how can you determine if it is true? ",

            "answer_text": "The concept of falsifiability simply means that a claim cannot be considered science unless it is possible to show it false. It is a basic requirement of science. The strange concept is that if we measure something that is accepted by science and find it false, that scientists refuse to accept or even address the reality. For example, if we compare the results of a ball on a string demonstration of conservation of angular momentum to evaluated predictions instead of accepting that \u201cit spins faster\u201d which is infantile and idiotic, we find that angular momentum is not conserved. This means that the law of conservation of angular momentum is falsified. Scientists are unable to comprehend or accept that simple fact which makes the concept of falsifiability limited in use. ",

            "answer_text": "No! Falsifiability is absolutely crucial to science. Even elegant and aesthetically pleasing concepts such as \u2018String Theory\u201d must be rigorously tested against objective evidence. Conjectures about theory provide \u2018falsifiable\u2019 proposals. This is a major issue in modern Physics, Supersymmetry would solve many a QED and \u2018Standard Model\u2019 problems- but, so far, rigorous efforts have not demonstrated experimental proof or provided\u2018falsifiable\u2019 conjectures. The available evidence in the \u2018Standard Model\u2019 and Astronomy strongly suggest our Earth and our physics are unique- in the words of King Mongkut, \u201cIt is a puzzlement.\u201d Sorry \u2019bout that chief.
