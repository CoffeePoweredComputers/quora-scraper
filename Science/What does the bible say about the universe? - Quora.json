            "answer_text": "When I was a kid, probably about 7 I was sitting in church one day and realized it really bothered me that nothing anyone said there made any sense. Gods and holy ghosts and angels. I had never seen an angel or a ghost. I thought, \"maybe I should start with the bible.\" So, right then and there I started reading the bible. Genesis chapter 1. Though I was young and a poor reader for my age I struggled through the first 5 chapters before I gave up. I remember at first feeling encouraged. \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" This is easy! I can understand this. I had questions about how but I figured it would explain all that eventually. Then I ran into some trouble at verse 6. \"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\" \"Firmament?\" What is a \"firmament?\" I asked my mom. She whispered that it was the sky or the stars, I don't remember, but I got the picture. It was the \"heavens.\" But something was funny about that word. The sky isn't firm, if anything it's just the opposite. I watched Bill Nye, I knew all about stars and planets and the solar system. What little science I could grasp at that age was my muse. Something was wrong. I came to understand that people who wrote the bible didn't understand what the sky was. Or perhaps they just don't speak clearly so I misunderstood them. Or perhaps everything I had been told about planets and stars was wrong. Or perhaps it just doesn't matter. That's the option I went with: it just didn't matter. Who cares about the inconsistencies? I went on trying to ignore the blatant contradictions between what I could see for myself and what my religion (which I was devoted to) had to teach for almost two decades. Eventually I realized the bible has nothing to say about the physical universe I live in. I wish I had been brave enough to face this truth at 7 rather than 25. Now when it comes to the metaphysical universe I live in; I think perhaps myth and legend of all cultures can, with some imagination, illuminate useful principles and ideas in that realm, but not even the Bible is a manual for that.

            "answer_text": "Well, I have to admit that some people here may not have read as discerningly. Even at the beginning the Bible, we have, \"In the beginning of God's creating the heavens and the earth...\" The Hebrew merism \"heavens and the earth\" would have meant, \"everything\" or \"all of creation.\" So the universe is God's creation. [I prefer the \"In the beginning of God's creating...\" rather than the usual KJV and all versions subsequently \"In the beginning, God created...\" as \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea (bereshit) is a participle.] Certainly the Bible does know of stars, and that there were many stars to the naked eye (e.g., Abraham 15:5; 22:17; 26:14). And of course the magi who came from the East followed a special star. \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05c1\u05bc\u05b8\u05de\u05b7\u0596\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd (ha'Shamaim) is translated \"skies, heavens, or Heaven\" and actually the Temple was supposed to be symbolic of not 7 heavens, but only 3: for instance, there was a curtain between the courtyard and the temple proper (the \"holy place\") which was a \"door\" -- a screen 30 feet long, woven of blue, purple and scarlet thread ... which was like the colors seen in the sky. Inside the Holy Place was a golden lampstand or menorah, which represented the \"large lights of the sky\"(moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn). So you've gone through the sky (the door/screen), into space / the heavens, and then the high priest could go into the Holy of Holies -- and this was symbolic of where God resided. The book of Job actually mentions a number of constellations (9:9: The Bear, Orion, Pleiades; as well as 38:31-32). As does Amos 5:8 (Pleiades, Orion); 2Kings 23:5 talks about \"constellations\". But the Bible is less interested in what's going on with neutron stars, novae, nebulae, quasars, pulsars, black holes, and so on. The Bible is not even a textbook on interplanetary travel! However, God is interested in making humankind, his vassal kings, rulers in His stead over creation. At the apex of creation, Genesis 1:26 reported, \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion (or let them rule) over the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and etc.\" and Genesis 1:28 \"And God said to [the humans], 'Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion/rule over ...etc.\" We call this the Cultural Mandate. It means humans were to learn to master of all of Creation -- the whole universe. ",
