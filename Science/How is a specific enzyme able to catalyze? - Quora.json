            "answer_text": "A specific enzyme is able to catalyse a reaction by lowering the activation energy required to complete the conversion of a substrate into its product. The activation energy on the other hand simply put, is the energy required to initiate a particular reaction. How does it do this? Well, different enzymes do it in a few different ways. But, the most common way is that when an enzyme binds to its substrate, it molecularly binds at the level of certain covalent and ionic chemical groups of compounds. When this binding occurs, it changes the conformation of these particular sites in such a way that molecules line up in different shapes. Now, chemistry has taught us that changing a shape of a compound temporarily can induce changes in certain properties such as aligning polarity of these molecules and giving them slightly acidic or basic nature. This, thereby makes a substrate more susceptible to certain reactions. Numerous changes such as this take place, thereby facilitating the flow of the reaction.
