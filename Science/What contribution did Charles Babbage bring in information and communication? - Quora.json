            "answer_text": "He basically invented the concept of a programmable calculating machine and inspired the first programmer to start think about how she would write code to run on such a machine. Unfortunately he never managed to actually build the machine he had imagined and so Ada never got to run the code. But one of his machines was eventually built and Ada got a programming language named after her. Notes: Difference Machine no. 2 is now on display at the London Science Museum. ",
