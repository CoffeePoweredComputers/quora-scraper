            "answer_text": "I was watching a post-apocalyptic show once, and two characters were talking about gathering supplies while they still could. One guy was going to the grocery store, but the other guy said he didn\u2019t need to. When asked by the first guy why he wasn\u2019t worried about supplies, the second guy said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got food. I\u2019ve got a gun. Which one of us do you think is going to starve?\u201d Anyway, if you\u2019re really concerned about \u201csurvival skills\u201d when \u201cclimate change strikes\u201d (which makes it sound like an asteroid impact and not a gradual change in weather patterns), your best bet is to invest in some guns, ammo, and target practice. Because plenty of your fellow Americans* are already working on that, too. Specifically, about 1/3 of your countrymen already own at least one gun, and most of them own more than one gun. They will likely be the last to starve, should it come to that. I also recommend, if you\u2019re seriously concerned about \u201csurviving\u201d climate change, you might want to try having some faith in God. Surviving just for the sake of surviving seems less important when you know what\u2019s waiting for you post-survival. If climate change really were like an asteroid strike, I\u2019d be in the crowd of people heading towards the estimated impact zone, not away from it. *Yes, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an American.

            "answer_text": "Mostly a little strategic insight. Climate change moves very slowly by human standards. That\u2019s part of the reason why so many of us have our heads stuck up the butts of fossil fuel PR flaks and Libertarian billionaires who have climate-change bunkers in New Zealand. The increase in severity and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, drought, floods and wildfires along with sea-level rise and loss of fresh water supplies is pretty easily predictable. The only question is when you get out of places like Arizona, southern Florida and pretty much every coastal community in the southern USA. Depending on your tolerance for risk and how much you can get for your house, the answers range from right now to 30 years. But pay attention. A bunch of places are going to suck more than they do right now, and involve enough more natural disasters of increasing severity that you have a better chance of being unborn prematurely. ",
