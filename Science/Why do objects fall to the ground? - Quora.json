            "answer_text": "If we want things to go up, we must add energy to the system. For instance, a high jumper must expend energy to lift his body over the bar. A rocket must have energy to overcome its own weight. How much energy must we add to make an object go up instead of down? The answer is simple: more energy in the \u201cup\u201d direction than is being lost in the \u201cdown\u201d direction. This gives us the answer to the question, \u201cwhat is the cause of gravity?\u201d There is more energy lost by the object in the \u201cdown\u201d direction than any other direction. Directional energy loss by objects of mass toward other mass is the root cause of gravitation, and it is the result of three coinciding situations. 1) All mass has at least some energy. 2) All mass tends toward a lower energy state, achieved primarily by radiating that energy away. 3) Radiation, once it has been emitted, bends slightly toward any mass it encounters along the way. The confluence of these three things results in all objects of mass in the universe losing energy preferentially in the direction of all other objects of mass in the universe. Thus all objects of mass have momentum toward all other objects of mass. This is gravitation. It is momentum, not a force. Since the effect is mediated by radiation, the intensity of gravitation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This leads to ever increasing momentum as two objects draw closer to each other, which results in the acceleration we attribute to gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "According to current physics theory that is applied to our universe, all things are attracted to each other by a mighty force called \u201cforce of attraction\u201d. The direction of movements caused by this force depend on the mass of the 2 objects and distance between them. Presuming the \u201cobjects\u201d that you\u2019re mentioning is \u201csmall things\u201d on Earth (apple, pencil, phones, cars, planes, etc) and \u201cground\u201d means the surface of planet Earth. The Earth is of course much larger than other \u201csmall things\u201d so they are attracted to the planet Earth. Under human perspective, these evens called \u201cfallings\u201d. ",
