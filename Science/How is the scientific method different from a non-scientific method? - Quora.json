            "answer_text": "How is the scientific method different from a non-scientific method? Well, first off, one needs to get a grasp on the very simple basics of the scientific method. Here's a grade school class poster used to explain and guide children through the simplest form of the method as an example that's obviously easy enough to understand and use.  Any method of investigation that isn't oriented to ask questions designed to objectively find measurable facts (that be be repeated by others using the same method), or that aren't designed or even meant to lead to the discovery of truth in the natural world or universe, or employed by those not willing to follow the answers, facts and truths wherever they lead and accept the answers \u2026even if the answers aren't what was expected or desired, is nonscientific. Unfortunately, there are those who actually strive to use nonscientific methods to uphold and maintain a belief system, worldview or ideology that they may find in conflict or contradicted if the scientific method is used versus their long held traditions, superstitions, conspiracy theories and/or belief system instead. In fact, there are even certain religious sects, for example, that have actually worked for years to develope a pseudoscience designed and intended to try and resemble science in order to appear as though such conflicts or contradictions simply don't exist or to \u201cprove\u201d the scientific facts or answers are actually \u201cfalse.\u201d Fortunately, pseudoscience is rather easy to identify and see through - unless one is already a part of such an indoctrinated worldview or sympathetic to their cause. In such cases, the comfort that pseudoscience may provide is far more important to resolving their cognitive dissonance when faced with scientific truth than is questioning or looking too closely at the \u201canswers\" such nonscientific methods pretend to offer.  Nonscientific methods, such a pseudoscience, are meant to preach to and comfort \u201cthe choir,\u201d not for serious or honest investigation, \u2026and it shows. Wow, how it shows! When set side by side, one can better see how easily the differences show up between how science, using the scientific method, stacks up against a nonscientific method like religious pseudoscience.  Science is questions in search of answers. Religion is answers that may not be questioned. And THAT'S the very possibly the very best demonstration of how the scientific method is vastly different from a non-scientific method. ",

            "answer_text": "I will give an example of a group of scientists trying to use the scientific method but failing and falling back on their emotional attachment to faith in an unverified computer simulation. The Story of a Boring Encounter with a Black Hole A group of astronomers saw a dot of light which was approaching what they assume is a large, completely invisible black hole at the center of our galaxy. The astronomers ran a simulation to make a prediction of what would happen as this dot of light got closer to the center of what they assumed to be a black hole. They predicted that there would be fireworks. They prepared to take measurements of this happening. They took the measurements. Their measurements didn\u2019t show them what they expected to see. There were no fireworks. Nothing really happened at all. So far, they are doing a great job of following the scientific method, but at this point, they mess up. The right thing to do would be to publish the negative result, \u201cWe thought we knew what was going to happen, but it didn\u2019t. There must be something wrong with our assumptions.\u201d But this isn\u2019t what they did. Instead, they ran new simulations until they recreated what they saw and they reported the agreement between their new simulations and the result they measured. They didn\u2019t question any of their assumptions about the properties of the invisible black hole, they merely increased the complexity of their assumptions about the properties of the dot of light, postulating a number of invisible entities to explain what was observed. to fit the observations, G2 cannot be solely a gas cloud. Instead, two components are likely needed: an extended, cold, low-mass gas cloud responsible for most of the emission before G2 approached pericenter, and a very compact component such as a dusty stellar object that dominates the emission observed since pericenter. What is wrong with this? A lot. It is astoundingly easy to run a simulation and change input parameters until it matches what you measured, but that is not science. Science requires making a prediction and then measuring it. Not the other way around. That is called reverse engineering and it isn\u2019t the same thing as the scientific method. It is one of the reasons that some people don\u2019t think that the standard model of particle physics is a scientific theory in accordance with the scientific method. If I were their professor, I wouldn\u2019t have let them publish the results of the simulation conducted after the measurement because it just adds distracting, unverified, hypothetical noise to the discussion. The purpose of peer review of publications is to only admit scientific results which contribute to a scientific discussion. Their after-the-fact simulation was unscientific, but it was published anyway, demonstrating that in a publish-or-perish academic climate, the scientific method often goes by the wayside. ",
