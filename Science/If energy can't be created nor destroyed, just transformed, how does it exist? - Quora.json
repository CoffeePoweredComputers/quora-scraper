            "answer_text": "Energy does not 'exist' anywhere by itself since it is not a physical substance. There is no such thing as \"pure energy\". It is not tangible. A widely used definition of 'energy' is the capacity or ability to do work. One of most basic laws of science is the Law of the Conservation of Energy according to which energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another. Energy isn't a thing that things are made of. There's no such thing as pure energy, it is a quantity that things can have. Energy can be compared to other physical quantities like momentum, velocity, mass, volume, length, etc. It's a measurable property of a thing or system, but it's not a thing itself. E=mc\u00b2 says that mass and energy can be converted into each other, or more precisely, that mass is a form of stored energy. Therefore the question is really \"how did mass came into being?\". Once we answer this question, we know where energy came from. The Equivalence of Mass and Energy It is generally accepted that the Universe came to be from 'nothing'. The big bang is supported by plenty of evidence. Therefore, the currently accepted scientific theory is that that universe \u201cexploded\u201d into existence about 13.7 billion years ago. Gravitational waves, the cosmic microwave background, and the existence of primordial elements - all stand as proof of big bang. Quantum mechanics tells us that there is no such thing as \u2018empty space\u2019. Even the most perfect vacuum contains clouds of particles and antiparticles, which flare into existence and almost instantaneously fade back into nothingness. These are known as \u2018virtual particles\u2019 do not last long enough to be observed directly, but scientists know they exist - by studying their effects. Ask a Physicist Answers The theory is that, in just a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the quantum-sized universe expanded tremendously fast. In an incredibly brief moment, it went from being smaller than the nucleus of an atom to the size of a golf ball. When the expansion finally slowed, the force field that had powered it was transformed into the matter (and energy) that fill the universe today. Proof that the Universe Could have Come from Nothing?

            "answer_text": "Energy was created by the mathematicians who could not explain invisible phenomena such as light and the workings of the atom. There is no such THING as \u2018energy\u2019. In Mathematical \u2018physics\u2019 \u2013 which many confuse for Physics \u2013 energy is nothing more than a QUANTITY. For the purposes of Physics, however, energy is just another word for \u2018spirit\u2019. It has no meaning other than that. It is a convenient word that the mathematicians invented to give \u2018physical\u2019 interpretations to their equations. In genuine Physics, this abstraction does not help us explain any phenomenon of nature. Energy hides more than it reveals\u2026 much like the word \u2018spirit\u2019 of traditional religions\u2026 And just like the spirit of traditional religions, the mathematicians have morphed this concept into a physical object and use both the concept and the object at their convenience to explain away any and all phenomena. Spirit The word \u2018spirit\u2019 was invented in traditional religions to refer to the mind, conscience, soul \u2013 to the incorporeal ingredient inside humans that makes them tick. Spirit is the essence of man, his behavior, who he is. When a man dies, people have the physical image of him and remember his behavior and his actions. He lives in their memories. The word \u2018spirit\u2019 was invented to allude to this blend of image and behavior. The behavior morphed into a ghostly figure that continues to live in the minds of those he left behind. Energy The word \u2018energy\u2019 is a perfect synonym of \u2018spirit\u2019. The mathematicians could not imagine the vis viva that ran through an individual\u2019s veins and imbued him with life. What was that mystical unknown that marked the difference between the dog that was alive a minute ago and dead a minute later? What made those atoms and molecules and cells move? The traditional religions called it \u2018spirit\u2019. Secular researchers and theorists opted for the \u2018scientific\u2019 sounding word \u2018energy\u2019 instead. And to this day not one \u2018physicist\u2019 can tell you what this enigmatic unknown is\u2026 \u201cIt is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is.\" Richard Feynman, Feynman Lectures, p. 4-1 Energy the concept Officially, energy is defined as a concept. Energy is simply a property of something else. The mathematicians invoke this mystical word to refer to a quantity that they place in an equation. If energy remained as such \u2013 solely within the confines of Mathematics \u2013 the word energy would cause no trouble. It would just be that: a variable placed in an equation. However, the mathematicians were well aware that if they could not relate their equations to the real world, if they could not explain what those equations had to do with how the Universe worked, their discipline would be inconsequential. They had to assign some measure of physicality to energy in order to explain phenomena. They had to blend Mathematics with Physics. That is how these incompatible fields were merged into Mathematical Physics. The \u2018Mathematics\u2019 part of this incongruous hybrid is precise and consistent. It accurately describes behavior quantitatively. Its alter ego \u2013 the \u2018Physics\u2019 branch \u2013 predictably drifted ever more into irrationality. Today, the mathematical \u2018physicists\u2019 can only offer irrational explanations for any and all invisible phenomena (e.g., light, gravity, atomic structure, magnetism, electricity, black hole, dark matter, spacetime, etc.). Energy the object The word energy does not represent or refer to a physical medium. If you have doubts just try drawing a picture or making a statue of energy. What are you going to exhibit at the art gallery? But over the years, theorists gradually got into the bad habit of treating this concept as a physical entity. People picture a disintegrating cloud, a misty fog, a nebulous dance of particles and bright rays. In other words, they visualize a spirit. Nothing has changed in 10,000 years!  Energy is still officially defined as a property of an entity, as a quantity: \u201cthe capacity to\u2026\u201d The entire planet uses this versatile word to refer to a myriad of forms in which energy allegedly manifests itself, not realizing that all who invoke the term are merely using the same joker in different card games. But the theorists began to do scary things. They started transfering energy from A to B and converting energy into \u2018mass\u2019, insinuating that the ethereal spirit materialized into a solid that could now be touched and handled and transported. The word energy results in irrational explanations Of course, this duality was very \u2018useful\u2019 to theorists. This magical word enabled them to explain any and all phenomena\u2026 much like the word God of traditional religions. The loophole consisted in that the theorist did not have to justify, define, explain, or illustrate energy at the beginning or at the end of his presentation. He could just state in his closing arguments that \u201cWe have no idea what energy is. We are mere mortals. We don\u2019t know everything. But we\u2019re still investigating.\u201d To this day, the crowds still nod. They applaud the humility of the speaker. Energy gradually grew to become a catchall word. Today it is used even to compel you to pay your electricity bill. No one has any idea what the utility company delivered, but whatever \u2018it\u2019 was required that someone produce \u2018it\u2019 and send \u2018it\u2019 through the grid. Whatever \u2018it\u2019 is, \u2018it\u2019 runs your TV and makes the lights go on in your house. So obviously \u2018energy\u2019 must be some kind of physical entity that traveled from the producer to the consumer. The irrationality, then, consists in that we do NOT have an explanation for how anything in the modern day works because we have not identified this spirit that travels through all electronic devices and morphs into mass and powers the Sun. The word energy is simply a magical word of incantation. Its only purpose is to serve as an answer-all-questions word in case a nosy reporter asks one at the end of the presentation. Will we ever know what energy is? No! There is no one out there investigating the nature of energy. There are no funds allocated to researching this elusive spirit. And the mathematicians and theorists have convenient one-liners on hand to brush aside any questions as to the nature of energy. They have no incentive to get to the bottom of energy. . For those who have an open mind and still have a healthy measure of curiosity about physical phenomena, let\u2019s first make absolutely clear that matter was not created from \u2018energy\u2019 as alleged by mathematical \u2018physicists\u2019\u2026 \u201cparticles can be created out of energy in the form of particle/antiparticle pairs\u2026 The matter in the universe is made out of positive energy\u2026\u201d S. Hawking, A Brief History of Time, Chp 8 Matter cannot be created from concepts. Therefore, the mathematicians can either define the word energy precisely so that we are all on the same wavelength or we should not allow this spiritual word to be used to cover holes. If energy is a medium or entity or body, the onus is on the theorist to illustrate it for us. Indeed, matter cannot be created at all. No theorist will ever be able to rationalize how nothing somehow became something. Length, width, and height do not surreptitiously self-assemble from the void. Matter has always been there and will continue to be there when humans are gone. And for those who wish to understand the physical nature of what the mathematicians call \u2018energy\u2019 every time they invoke the word, we have an alternative for you to consider\u2026 . What does an atom look like? (look for video titled 30 The Neutron \u2013 Part 1) . . . ",
