            "answer_text": "This depends heavily on the school you\u2019re attending. At a lot of schools, a mix of the normal Computer Science and Applied Mathematics curriculum will get you the most exposure in class as an undergrad. However, there are some schools that offer degrees in Artificial Intelligence, other schools that offer a CS degree with a focus in AI, and depending on your specific interests, some schools offer cognitive science degrees, which borrows quite a bit from AI in some cases. Ultimately, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single answer to this question, it depends on the school you\u2019ll be attending and your interests in the wide field of AI. ",

This is at least the case with Stanford, where I've done my masters work on AI. Another option would be Statistics, which is particularly relevant for Machine Learning, the area of AI that's had the most advancement and practical applications recently. ",
