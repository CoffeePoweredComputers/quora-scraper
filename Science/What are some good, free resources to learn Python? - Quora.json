            "answer_text": "There are plenty of free online tutorials and how-to\u2019s for learning Python. If you\u2019re just starting to code though, it might help to have an extra bit of guidance. If that\u2019s you, I\u2019d recommend looking into a few online courses. They helped me learn Python and, step by step, helped me build a solid foundation for computational thinking. One of the biggest benefits of these courses (relative to one-off tutorials and guides) is that they\u2019ve done a ton of legwork already for you. Some of the better courses undergo frequent updates so that you learn what\u2019s generally accepted as best practices today (and not, say, back in 2015). The better courses I\u2019ve seen also teach you useful skills outside of \u201cjust coding.\u201d A good course should reinforce good habits, like leaving comments, documenting your work, and how to debug and test code. Given this, I\u2019d recommend two courses in particular that are both free (paid if you want exams and certificates) and online: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python from MITCS50's Introduction to Computer Science from HarvardBoth courses are rigorous. Both focus on helping you learn how to solve problems through programming. Where they differ is the kinds of projects you\u2019ll work on and the tools you\u2019ll use. MIT\u2019s course is fairly heavy into using Python for data science and analysis. Harvard\u2019s, on the other hand, looks at a wide gamut of applications for programming, but relies on a suite of tools and programming languages (including C and JavaScript), so you\u2019re looking at getting a bit more than just Python. Paid courses I\u2019d recommend include: Python for Everybody from University of MichiganBuild a CRUD web app using Flask from UdemyAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming from UdemyPython: A 8-Course Paths from PluralsightBecome a Python Developer from LinkedIn LearningThe first two courses teach you how to use Python in context of building an app. #3 teaches you Python in context of automating away mundane tasks (e.g. combining Excel sheets from six different documents, formatting them properly, compiling it all into a PDF, and emailing it off to the team without you lifting a finger). The last two options come from Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning, two subscription learning platforms. These charge you a monthly fee. In exchange, you get access to a huge library of online courses. While I haven\u2019t taken these personally, various colleges, libraries, and employers provide free access to either. If you can\u2019t get access, both offer free trials that are long enough for you to complete these courses and then some. I\u2019ll end by saying that there are a few hundred online courses out there about Python. I\u2019ve only linked a few, which means I likely left a few other good options out. I invite you to visit the link below and run a search if you haven\u2019t found anything that appeals to you here. Happy learning!

            "answer_text": "I assume you want learn programming (using python) not just \u201cpython\u201d. What does this mean? There is a distinction between language syntax and concepts. Python is a language that has a syntax you need to know in order to implement the concepts. There are main concepts in computer science that are applicable nearly in every programming language. So when we say \u201cwe want to learn programming\u201d we mean we want to learn these concepts, and when we say \u201cwe want to learn python\u201d we mean we want to learn how to implement that particular concept in that language (AKA: syntax). So: First : take an introduction to computer science course . In this stage your main goals are: to comprehend the concepts and practice as much as possible. meet with others who are interested in CS, talk about it every where, and explain these concepts to others (even if they are not in CS field).you also need to focus on how you think about any problem you face in order to solve it, don\u2019t rush into searching for a solution online, try as hard as you can first then after that if you still stuck, you could search for online solutions.I recommend : introduction to computer science (from udacity.com)[free] and Foundations of programming with python (also from udacity.com)[free]. Or introduction to computer science and programming (from ocw.mit.edu)[free] there is an edx version of it but i do recommend the ocw version. Note : You must practice during the courses do the assignments and projects or you will learn nothing . You can make use of a book (which will prove useful after you finish them) and go through it in parallel with these courses , i recommend think python [free] or head first python [paid but you available as pdf]. Second : read the official documentation of the things you learned about in these courses , this will make things clearer in your mind and help you master this tools in less time . Third : take google python class it's a 2-day workshop for python it will recap most of the things you've learned in the past courses plus some very useful problems to solve . Now you will be able to understand most of the codes written by others , write your own code to automate many of the things you do on a daily basis , and even team up with others to build larger projects. At this point you will be able to guide yourself through the right way . Some hints : all Udacity - Free Online Classes & Nanodegrees courses are very good and free , as well as ocw mit so try them . These are good places to look at when planning your way after taking the courses above : Students - Guide to Technical Development - Google Careersopen-source-society/computer-scienceThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Python!jwasham/coding-interview-universityHave a happy learning.
