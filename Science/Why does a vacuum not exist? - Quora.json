            "answer_text": "The popular notion of a vacuum is the absence of air, which is still correct or astronauts would not carry breathing equipment. We also now know that fluids like air are not actually continuous, but are composed of very rapidly moving tiny particles called molecules. They collide randomly like balls in a pinball machine, and so manage to effectively occupy a volume in a time frame much shorter than you can blink your eye. If you think about it, they must be moving supersonic and colluding at very high rates, or they wouldn't be able to support sound waves. So there are no molecules between molecules but only over very short time frames. Physics has decided that it is seething with stuff, other than air molecules. So it very much does exist. Now, in fact if you supply enough energy the vacuum itself becomes very active and can pop out new particles. Yes, you heard me, creation of new particles, so creation of matter is not something you relegate should to the past, it is ever present in the universe. So not only does it exist, it is involved in the existence of matter. Your question can be looked at another way, why is all the air not spread everywhere equally? The answer to that is gravity, it holds the air to earth. Also the universe has greatly expanded so much that the hot dense material that once filled it has become very thin, both the pressure and temperature have plummeted. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Manny August. I would like to say because there is no absolute rest, therefore and succinctly, the notion of emptiness suggests space, and space is clearly a dimension only perceptible in reference to physical magnitudes. In the same way, when we think about how matter deforms the properties of space-time, we think or, at least I think space as the region of scope of the effects of physical events, either by massive bodies or by virtual points that mathematically describe a behavior that justifies, clearly and extensively, behavior at more experimental scales. But if we think of the existence of the absence of any natural form, including forms not yet known, it simply does not make sense, since said emptiness is not theorized or practicable in any sense. That emptiness is philosophically understood as nothing, the nothing. It involves more emotional connotations than objective even skeptical denotations. At this moment, I can only say: that region between two massive bodies, apparently devoid of mass similar to those of bodies, must be something since it is deformed in its minimal structure, modifying the measurement of important magnitudes, such as distance, local trajectory and time. Being something, I must make the conjecture that it is matter, since everything is matter: energy does not cease to be a mathematical quantity for the processes of interaction and transformation of matter. I hope I have answered something useful. Greetings. ",
