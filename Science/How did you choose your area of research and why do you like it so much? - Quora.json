            "answer_text": "Igor Markov and Ben Y. Zhao gave excellent answers from the viewpoint of professors who have many years of research experience. Let me offer a different perspective of a grad student who is still going through the PhD. When I entered grad school, I broadly knew I wanted to do work in systems and architecture. I preferred to build systems over something more theoretical like machine learning, and I liked thinking about how to make a system run faster, or consume less memory.  When I started working with Remzi and Andrea on systems research, I had no idea how to do research, so picking an area was not even something I thought about consciously. I took baby steps working with more senior grad students and helping out with their projects.  It was while helping out on one of these projects that I found I liked thinking about file-system consistency. At that point, I simply did not know that you are supposed to choose a topic based on its potential for growth, depth and so on. If I had known all that, it is likely I would have chosen to work on one of the current \"hot\" topics. But I didn't, so I chose to work on the classic problem of file-system consistency. But it didn't work out too badly since I was able to get two good papers out of it. These papers form the core of my PhD thesis, and I had a lot of fun working on these projects. As Ben Y. Zhao points out, the key to happiness is finding your own research style and goals, and I loved disproving long-held assumptions about file-system consistency (e.g.,  \"file systems cannot maintain consistency without ordering\", \"file systems cannot maintain consistency without flushing the disk cache\"). After a couple of years of doing full-time research, I'm more aware of the strategic and tactical things to consider before picking a topic. I think I'm making more informed decisions on what to work on.  As to why I love my area and my topic: system research forms the bedrock of many of the exciting things going on right now. Google/Amazon/Facebook all use extremely interesting systems internally, and have introduced great innovations in operating systems and distributed systems. With the explosion of data that is taking place, its becomes important to ensure the integrity of the data, while allowing systems to run at peak performance. This is a hard, interesting problem, and one that fundamentally affects the millions of people who use these systems. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great question.  The short version is that being successful in the long term requires one to stay relevant, by constantly adapt to changing trends in research and society. The longer version... My research history started by blind luck in grad school at Berkeley.  We were trying to build a global scale distributed file system, and I had been tasked with the problem of figuring out how to route between billions of machines with a deterministic and \"fast\" protocol.  None of the prior approaches (directories, hierarchical, random hashing, replication) worked.  My advisor and I bumped into a much older theory paper that hypothesized a fantastic distributed data structure, which seems impossible to build/maintain.  But if you could do it, it would provide logarithmic performance and scale to billions+ node networks.  I figured out a distributed algorithm to build it and we later proved its performance bounds. Turns out we tripped over a whole new way of doing large scale networks (structured peer-to-peer systems, now commonly known as DHTs), and a crapload of papers, ideas, citations just fell into my lap. The bigger challenge happened when I became a faculty member, and had to somehow try to replicate my prior success.  I knew P2P was on the way out, but didn't find the right area that A) piqued and sustained my interest, B) was relevant to the world and had real impact, and C) had enough fresh problems to sustain multiple years of active (and hopefully productive) research.  I dabbled in multiple areas, multimedia networking, anonymous communication, reputation systems etc...   Finally I gave up trying to find a topic, and instead looked inside to what I really enjoyed doing.  I had been trained as a computing systems researcher, but had been more or less fed up with building systems that no one used for years (DHTs being the exception, but it still took 10 years for them to really get used everywhere).  I was also unhappy with what I saw as a growing number of research areas that had less and less to do with reality and increasingly reliant on unrealistic assumptions.  So I made a decision to go after real data and use that as my basis for systems/networking research.  This was partly driven by the fact that more and more data was coming available everywhere, even back in 2008.   Turns out I stumbled into the whole big data shift, and things have been clicking ever since.  Now I get real satisfaction from disproving long held models and assumptions, and using thorough data-driven analyses to guide systems design.  The specific areas matter less (social networks, graphs, wireless, security), and I'll shift to different areas along the way.  But knowing my own preferred style, and the type of research that sustains my interest, that is the key to keeping me happy and active in research. EDIT: I'm adding a bit more here based on the new question edit, \"Especially in areas which are very competitive and funding is scarce.\"  Personally, I think it is very dangerous to choose an area based on funding and competition (i.e. hotness).  Simply put, if you go after areas that are \"hot\" and not based on fundamental reasons (some of which I suggest above), you're chasing.  By definition you're already behind the wave, and are likely chasing an area after it's already reached its peak.  Catching a research area on the way down is the last thing you want to do for your career. Instead, your ultimate goal should be creating or identifying the next hot area before everyone else jumps on board.  I know I know, easier said than done. But you'd be surprised at how well you can do if you use common sense, read a lot, and work with an advisor who understands the field.  I've seen it happen at least 3 times personally between myself and my colleague Prof. Heather Zheng, who was one of the pioneers in multiple areas, including software-defined radios and spectrum auctions. Another way to think about this is that finding research areas is like buying stocks.  If you buy the hot stock that's gone up a lot in the last year or two, it's already been bought by everybody, and is probably due for a correction/pullback.  Instead, you want to find that next little known stock ready to explode upwards.  So identifying great stocks by studying fundamentals is like searching for research areas based on potential impact, ripeness for sustained research problems, etc etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Serendipity! I did my undergrad in Civil Engineering. 3 semesters into it, I realized I don't want to do in anything remotely related to it. However, Fluid Mechanics fascinated me as it had the most math of all courses I took. The professor pointed out a few resources after seeing my genuine interest, and I was hooked. I ended up doing a summer research project after junior year on a very fundamental fluids project. On how I ended up on this project, well my advisor was the only one( among 30 others ) to reply positively to my email on my request to host me over the summer as an international exchange student. I ended up enjoying what I did and totally enjoyed working with him. He offered me a PhD position in his lab and I ended up coming back. After joining the PhD program, he let me chose between three different projects. I chose the project I am currently working on because I felt that it was the most interesting one. And it is not one bit related to anything I had ever worked on before, not even my summer project. Did I work with in other areas? I worked for the Satellite Team in my undergrad, where we built a Cubesat that was successfully launched into space by ISRO. The whole process excited me. However, I didn\u2019t see myself pursuing a PhD in this field because of citizenship restrictions on jobs in the US as well as the entirely applied nature of research (or so I thought). I have always been wanting to work in something extremely fundamental. Also, after working in Solid Mechanics on my senior year thesis, I sort of got the feeling that the field is near saturation and exciting stuff is now happening on Material Sciences end. Without the necessary background and guidance, I didn\u2019t want to jump into something unknown for my PhD. That is how I ended up in Fluid Mechanics. Why do I like it so much? As of today, with my background and experience, Fluid Mechanics is as fundamental and challenging as I can get; especially with turbulence and stability theory. Moreover, experimental studies really set the foundation in fluid mechanics because one set of experimental data can wipe out years of numerical data and set the base for a new theory. Numerical models are essentially built on base experiments as a we still don\u2019t have solutions to Navier Stokes Equations yet. That is why experimentation, even though time consuming, can be extremely rewarding if done right. This is what keeps me going! ",

            "answer_text": "Let me start with a few high-level considerations for selecting research area(s) and topic(s):A. It's important to enjoy the process of doing research in a given area ---    reading papers, solving problems and proving theorems,    developing algorithms, designing systems, writing software,    evaluating systems, running computational experiments,    working with data, writing papers and giving talks, collaborating    with others, keeping track of industry developments, etc.    Fortunately, I enjoy most of those activities, so I rotate between    several areas and roles, to get the right mix :)B. There should be growth in the area.C. Your skills and expertise should be adequate for success in this area    (but some studying is often needed anyway)D. You need to see the (potential) impact of your work    (be it software or theory)E. There should be possibilities to collaborate with others    and work with graduate students who are sharp, capable or both. F. When moving to a new area, it is very important to have someone    with different expertise who can constructively criticize your work. It is also a really good idea to create choices so that you can maximize these parameters. As tastes change, research directions come and go, and (most importantly) the reality evolves, Computer Science and Engineering allow for a huge amount of freedom for lateral and vertical movement, and also for technical growth (assuming broad interests, good technical background, and desire to learn). Keep in mind that maintaining freedom should not be to the detriment of productivity - if you have \"a fear of commitment\", you won't get much done and will not enjoy the process. Another consideration in my experience: Having strong links to applications (in some of my projects) helps with industry funding, which comes with fewer constraints than federal funding and adds to flexibility. As long as the work is in the general area for which the funding was allocated, I can assign students for a project within a month of coming up with an idea. Vice versa, if I realize that things don't work, we can turn around and work on something else. This allows to try risky ideas without getting bogged down in things that don't work. Contrast this with the usual grant proposal cycle, where principal investigators often promise \"safe\" things that can definitely be done (otherwise, there'd be too much risk in the proposal). Hopefully, this is the type of information you are looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a fantastic question and the short answer is more often you stumble upon an area rather than you choose one! Let me explain. I am a Civil Engineer and now I do research in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in Vision Lab of Computer Science department at UIUC. I would have never imagined this leap, as it appears to be, but it was always a constant progress moving forward in exploring new frontiers and that is what researchers do in general. I started with Earthquake Engineering to be my first research topic and did an internship at Earthquake Engineering Research Center of India at IIIT Hyderabad after the end of my sophomore year. After my internship, in 2013, 135 people died when two buildings collapsed in Mumbai, India. The condition exacerbated with the collapse of 5 more buildings within a span of 7 months. I wondered how so many lives are endangered in absence of a mechanism to check these catastrophic events and I realized that earthquakes were rare as compared to these incidents that occur every day around the world. My continuous pursuit for solutions to the structural health monitoring problem led me to an opportunity to work in Computational Sensor Laboratory (CSL) of Michigan State University (MSU), East Lansing, USA in Summer of 2014. During this time, I was exposed to the use of self-powered wireless sensors to diagnose damage in structures. The interdisciplinary research experience was enriching and I decided to pursue my MS in a cross-disciplinary program. I started my MS in an interdisciplinary program of Societal Risk Management in the Department of Civil Engineering at UIUC where I primarily focused on Statistical Reliability Analysis, Uncertainty Quantification and Compressed Sensing. During my first year at UIUC, as MS student in Civil Engineering, I was taking a lot of classes in Bayesian Statistics through which I got interested in Machine Learning. I have answered here in more detail how and why did I got into Machine Learning: Anand Bhattad's answer to What intrigues you about Machine Learning? What drew you into the space and how did you get started? In short (TL;DR)\u2014 I am curious about solving many problems like better rescue operations in disasters, monitor infrastructures health, robots in construction and manufacturing industries. Lately, I am more interested in Autonomous Generative Design and Geometric Modeling. All these problems that I wish to work on can be solved or progressed upon one common thread \u2014 Machine Learning. Computer Vision also has a broader outreach in these areas as compared to Wireless Embedded Sensors that I had initially started with. Transitioning from a Civil Engineering researcher to an AI and Computer Vision researcher is another story that I have described it in detail here: Anand Bhattad's answer to How feasible is the idea of having a second MS in Comp Science after an MS in Transportation (Civil) Engineering?  When I look back at my journey, I always remember the words of one of the wisest men of my country had ever said: Change is the nature of life, challenge is the aim of life. Challenge the changes but don't change the challenges! -APJ Abdul Kalam Even though I have seen many changes in my journey but one thing which has remained unchanged is about my end goal or the vision/purpose I have for my life. I know that change is inevitable and in this changing world, I have learned to be more adaptable and have the willingness to explore these changes. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh oh oh I know, easy, I\u2019ve been a metalhead since high school, easy as that. Jokes aside. During my five year degree in Materials Engineering at Politecnico, I, at a certain point, had to face a choice: (a) electronic/optoelectronic materials (b) polymers (c) metals (and partly ceramics). Although polymers are a modern interesting area of research dense with novelties, \u201cpure\u201d chemistry wasn\u2019t in my veins. I felt more vicinity towards physics of solid states. I chose the most physics of all engineering courses I had at hand, back then, and certainly not for being stuck trying to not understand how catalysts activate the transformation from monomers into polymers or why. Although being useful, polymers weren\u2019t clicking any magical sounds in my mind. Metals and ceramics were. And this is were I made a strategic choice. The area I decided to study in had old, established knowledge and interest in metal deformation, machining, joining and production and a much more recent, less valuable, knowledge on semiconductors. Nearly no knowledge on structural sintered ceramics. So I ended up having a bias and appreciation towards metals. I decided to accept a proposal for thesis I executed in a private company working on new welding machines that they were trying to introduce in automotive and house appliance production lines. I was almost in heaven of a materials engineer. A lab and a complete machine work to understand how things were built, how welding works and how to employ high power pulses to join metals. This I evolved directly into sintering powders with an original procedure and allowed me to write my first paper, before my PHD. I was proposed to apply for a Doctorate in Metallurgical Engineering and I qualified for a scholarship after an oral and written exam. I began studying my new toy and it was fun. I sintered metals, metal-ceramic composites and metal-metal composites. I learned to produce and characterize nanocrystalline metals and metal-ceramics. The natural consequence, given the economic potential of the procedure, was to start my own company, born to industrialize the procedure, machines and technology I developed. I\u2019ve coordinated european projects, industrial projects, a great team of engineers and technicians and am working with industries major multinationals on increasing areas of application. What can I ask more? Whatever it is I might ask, I know this is the route to reach it. Heavy Metaaaaaal, or no Metal at aaaalll ",

            "answer_text": "It had chosen me. Since my seventeen, I had had a seriously diseased heart due to untreated tonsilitis. Following 30+ years was full of my finding ways how to live with seriously failing heart and to study mathematics and physics along with numerical mathematics. That all beside counties heart operations and hospitalizations. Gradually, my interests in complex systems morphed into the research that is aiming to predict heart arrhythmias from ECG recording at least hours before their onset. This happened because of so many experiences with failing heart and how to avoid the onset of arrhythmias during 30+ years having them. I am sympathetic with all who suffer from ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias. Those are life-threatening arrhythmias requiring implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator device that helps to stop the onset of each instance of those arrhythmias. In any case, it is much easier to feel incoming arrhythmias as I am able. Not everyone is able to feel them. That is why a predictive software might be very useful. Because of this new filed, which I entered after heart transplantation less than five years ago, it was fundamental to make a thorough overview of the field.  The review paper named \u201cComplex Systems and Their Use in Medicine: Concepts, Methods, and Bio-Medical Applications\u201d is the output of this thorough overview and is currently available online to everyone interested in applications of complex systems in medicine on the ResearchGate portal, which serves to share research among researchers: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330546521_Complex_Systems_and_Their_Use_in_Medicine_Concepts_Methods_and_Bio-Medical_Applications/stats It is free to download! You can see yourself from the information covered there why I fell in love with complex systems and their applications in biology. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Last summer I did an internship at MSR which made me really like data mining.  Primarily because of who I worked with, but also because in data mining There are always more things to try, and you can use intuition to pick a direction to proceed in.  The problems are intuitive enough that you can even ask friends who know nothing about computer science and they'll give you interesting ideas for what to do next.In some fields there's a very limited set of tools and you only find out about them after taking a lot of classes and reading papers.  In data mining, you can draw inspiration from lots of places and solve problems in a lot of different ways.  (I've even used tools from real analysis, which I thought was going to be the most useless class ever once I stopped majoring in math.)Data mining is a really general tool and you can apply it to any problem you like that involves large amounts of data.  This means you can often mine data that you find personally interesting.  Your problem might even be interesting to your friends.",

I was then offered a place by my then-supervisor to expand on the project, using a different orchid hybrid. As I progressed with my research work, I slowly came to respect plants and their versatility in responding to many types of treatments. My current project also involves the propagation of wild orchids, and it is something that I enjoy immensely, as some wild orchids are extremely recalcitrant and are difficult to grow in vitro. To see them prosper in little glass tubes is very satisfying, akin to watching my children grow. Pure micropropagation studies are usually combined with other analytical techniques to boost results, relevance and funding prospects, especially since the boom in the biotechnological field. But I love growing plants, and this is the main reason why I like my research field. ",

            "answer_text": "In my case, it all started when I did my final year project in Computer Vision. I enjoyed it a lot and my Cryptography teacher encouraged me to do research. Right after I graduated, I worked on an augmented reality startup and I had the chance to apply Computer Vision algorithms in practice.  I got hooked to university and I missed it so much that I decided to go to graduate school and complete a MEng. (my Master's Thesis was about a problem I experienced in my augmented reality startup). Now I'm following with the PhD. The thing that I like so much about Computer Vision is that you are contributing to the most fundamental AI problem: Make computers as smart as a human being. And it is a field that touches many different fields, such as Computational Geometry, Optics, Machine Learning, etc., so you never cease to learn new things. ",
