            "answer_text": "Honestly most of it is just left their as it is too expensive to justify the cost of clearing it up. Rocket boosters and pieces that came loose from spacecraft, are some examples of the type of things orbit around the earth at high speeds. Some pieces of debris burn up on reentry to the earth but most is just left in orbit. The main problem with space trash is the danger it poses to working satellites and manned spacecraft as even small particles can do quite significant damage at high speeds so their are plans of a cooperative effort among the governments of many nations to stop littering space to avoid more getting into orbit. Honestly though, their are not very high chances of being hit by space junk in space as the volume of space just around the Earth is so massive.  ",

            "answer_text": "If it is in orbit around the earth, eventually the orbit will decay and the object will return to earth, and may burn up upon reentry into the atmosphere. It the object is in interplanetary space, and is not leaving the solar system at escape velocity, it will either get captured by a planet and crash into it or fall into the sun. Otherwise, it will wander in interstellar space until it is captured by some star somewhere. ",
