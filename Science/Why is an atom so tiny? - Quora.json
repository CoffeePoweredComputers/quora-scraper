            "answer_text": "Another way to ask this question is, 'why are we so big?'.  You and I are life-forms. Life is a super-complex biological system which is capable of sustaining itself through various activities. A single cell is a fully functioning life form - forget humans for now. A cell typically contains a 100 trillion atoms. It has various parts such as the nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm etc.. each having a unique function. A cell takes in matter and converts it into energy which is required to sustain it's life and reproduce. The whole process happens automatically. Now, why does a cell need 100 trillion atoms? For an organism to function, every process that happens inside that organism has to follow the same laws of physics. The process may be firing up of neurons, or exchange of Oxygen and Carbon di Oxide in the lungs, conversion of matter to energy... everything! In each of these processes a large number of atoms are involved. Suppose, only few atoms take part instead of a large number - what would happen? Then the process become so sensitive that small disturbance in few atoms affect the entire system in a large manner.  Now, a cell has 100 trillion atoms. A loss of few thousand atoms for some disturbance does not affect the process which happen inside a cell. Thus, a cell becomes robust enough that a loss of few thousand atoms hardly matters. Such loss happens when there is transfer of mass and energy to the surrounding. Thus, for a cell to function in a robust manner, it requires a large number of atoms. The same explanation can be scaled up to a human being, containing around 10 E 27 atoms. From an atom's perspective - a human being is a humongous system.  ",

            "answer_text": "After we(human beings) started to study the details of things around, we kept on investigating further and further into details of every material around us. We found the materials with resembling properties and gave them some group classifications on macroscopic level, like say states of matter- solids , liquids and gases. These all results lured us to lookup further in details of matter, why some matters have similar characteristics, what makes them behave the way they do, and so on. With our advancing knowledge and science, we moved towards study of chemical properties of material. All these investigations led us to find that it a very small entity - \u201cthe atom\u201d which is responsible for the properties of material. To the date we have above 100 known elements- \u2018different kinds of atoms\u2019. These different kinds of atoms, along with their bonding i.e. their configuration and the spacing between the atoms arranged in a matter give the materials their characteristic properties. Even the different kinds of atoms do also combine to generate molecules with the changed property, these combinations depend on the balance of forces between the atoms. So buddy this is why atoms are that small, because they are the basic building blocks of the materials, the entities we\u2019ve found only after entering the microscopic details of the matter. ",
