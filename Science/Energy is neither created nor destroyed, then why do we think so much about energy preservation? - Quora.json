            "answer_text": "Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but it is transformed, sometimes into a useful form other times into something not useful. Energy preservation is about not using useful energy to do something useless. For example, running the lights when the sun is beating into your bedroom window is a waste of electrical energy. The electrical energy passing through the light bulb is transformed into light and heat at a time when neither is needed. Energy preservation becomes important because that electrical energy was likely generated using chemical energy in a fossil fuel of some sort to heat water into steam and the steam is used to rotate a turbine generating electricity. Indirectly, running the light at a bad time is wasting the fossil fuels used to generate the electricity and fossil fuels are a limited resource. You also have to pay for electricity so \u201cpreserving energy\u201d is also saving money. ",

            "answer_text": "Energy is always conserved but its usefulness is not. For example, if you move block on a rough surface it stops after sometime as its kinetic energy is converted into thermal energyof the floor and block(Same principle applies when you rub your palms to make them warmer in winter). The kinetic energy of the block could've been used to generate electricity or some other utility, but the thermal energy cannot(atleast not completely). The difference between the two cases is entropy. Entropy is a measure of randomness or chaos of a system. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the universe must always keep increasing. In the first case there was low entropy and in the second entropy was high. The net entropy of the universe always goes up, so other forms of energy can be easily converted to thermal but the opposite is not true. This is why some forms of energy like solar and chemical energy are very useful to us while other forms of energy are not so easy to harness. Hope this helps Cheers! ",

Energy often becomes converted into useless forms, locked up into a form of potential energy (whether physical or chemical) or emitted as heat. Things like coal and oil run out, the energy in the universe stays constant. It's very possible for energy to become unusable but still exist. ",
