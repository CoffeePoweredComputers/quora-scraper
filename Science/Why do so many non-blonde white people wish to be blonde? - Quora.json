            "answer_text": "In a nutshell the reason is that it has been considered beautiful since time immemorial.  Gods and heroes in ancient Greece as far back as the Iliad in the 8th century BCE were described as blond to denote their beauty. The difficult part is why was blond hair considered beautiful in the first place? Usually what we consider beautiful is actually a manifestation of youth and good health. Good teeth, a clean complexion, a good physique. Our \"reptile brains\" interpret a proportionate body as a manifestation of good genes, ergo a good potential mate to father/mother your offspring. Blond hair isn't like that, it gives no clue about health or genes. My intuition says that because it was rare, it made people easier to notice and attract attention the same way multi-colored plumage works among exotic birds. It's rare, you stick out, someone notices, you get offspring.  I don't have the literature at hand but I read somewhere that in Europe blue eyes appeared first and blond hair followed (talking genetics). The blond hair spread very fast because it was selected for, i.e. men (and women) preferred blondes.  Since the higher classes got to choose who they married, the most beautiful among the lower classes, i.e. blonds would get selected and soon a link between higher status and blond hair formed reinforcing preference for blonds. P.S. Red hair is also rare but it is linked to skin that is very sensitive to the sun. As a genetic trait it is extremely unwanted if you live south of the Alps. ",

            "answer_text": " Due to the fact that in our modern Western society, blond/blondes were put on a pedestal sort to speak. Blondness has been equated with higher social status, intelligence due to the fact that today Germanic nations such as England and Germany were the domineering nations. Since light complexions such as blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin is common in Germanic nations, this has been preached as being the \u201cideal\u201d by media, literature. Thus influences everyone to aspire to that. Though in the Ancient Greek and Roman days, blonds were seen as ugly barbarians from the north. Things change. ",
