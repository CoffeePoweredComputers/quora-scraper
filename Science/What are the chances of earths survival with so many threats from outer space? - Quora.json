            "answer_text": "Frankly, I am more afraid of the Americans. Yes, there are threats from asteroids, meteors, comets - bodies from outside the earth which have caused wholesale extinctions in the distant past upon impact on our planet. International Asteroid Warning Network The IAWN was established in 2013 in response to a United Nations recommendation (at the 50th Session of the UNCOPUOS Scientific and Technical Subcommittee) to create an international group of organizations involved in detecting, tracking, and characterizing NEOs (Near Earth Objects). The IAWN is tasked with developing a strategy using well-defined communication plans and protocols to assist Governments in the analysis of asteroid impact consequences and in the planning of mitigation responses.  I really do not know how far they have gotten; with that idiot Ban Ki Moon in charge of the UN, it has been a dead body for years now. An asteroid impact is a possibility, a real possibility, but just a possibility. But death of the planet by American over-consumption and profligacy is a CERTAINTY. 5-door, 150000 gallon refrigerators. SUVs with every mom. Rank disregard for climate change and what it is doing to the world. And when they start making plans for habitation on other planets, the truth is out: their politicians are too scared to ask the people to give up a high carbon emission lifestyle, just as they are scared to tell their people that no other country allows its citizens to possess guns in such large quantities and sizes. You just have to look at Obama's pussyfooting on this issue. So, that is the plan: abuse Earth until it is no longer livable, and then move (Americans only) to the other planet. Let Earthlings be damned! ",
