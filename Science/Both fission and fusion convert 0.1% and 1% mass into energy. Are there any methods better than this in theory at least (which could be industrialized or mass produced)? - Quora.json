            "answer_text": "Yes. For example, when a radium nucleus decays into a radon nucleus and an alpha particle, the missing mass is only 0.0023% - thus, 1 kg of radium decays into 0.999977 kg of radon and the missing 0.000023 kg mass is converted to about 2x10^12 joules of energy! A fusion reaction yields more energy than this, but needs tremendous inputs of energy! As we may see, nothing comes free in nature \u2013 you have to put in so as to draw out! Radioactive matter was generated in the massive stars by putting in lots of gravitational energy, and these stars burst into pieces (supernovae) and some of the smaller pieces have become planets like earth, and we, the earthlings, are exploiting that energy now. Even in a fusion, as we know, we have to put in lots of energy to drive the process (as it is happening in our sun now). As we may say, there is no free meal in the universe! But then, presumably, we have some shortcuts: In my view, as anybody\u2019s guess, the most effective and complete source of energy theoretically would be particle annihilation \u2013 a matter particle colliding into an antimatter particle both decaying into energy. However, we have to make antimatter in our labs and that\u2019s no cheap \u2013 we have to put in tremendous amounts of energy initially. But, even so, this method may be our best bet to extract nuclear energy at present, if at all! Black holes may be another effective source of energy in the very distant future \u2013 the matter falling into a black hole splits at the event horizon, with a part falling into it and the other escaping out into the surroundings (\u2018ergosphere\u2019) generating some diabolical amounts of energy. So, we may create a black hole near our earth and harness that energy?! There may be other simpler sources to extract nuclear energy, but I have no idea. Finally, in my view, solar energy still stands out as our best bet to get some \u2018free energy\u2019 from nature \u2013 and it would be fine if we could harness it more effectively than we are doing now!
