It is interesting to note that Novichok-like compounds (Novichok is not really just ONE nerve agent) are stored and studied at Porton Down, near where the alleged Novichok poisoning cases took place.

The symptoms are pretty specific, dying being one of them. There are a myriad of chemical compounds that can kill, and are difficult or impossible to reverse. I reckon the Company has employed more than one. ",

It was not used by Russians to kill people in Salisbury if thats what you are talking about. Thats just more plotting by Britiain and the U.S. to blame Russia. It is easy to make Russia sinister and remind people of the Soviet period. \"Everyone\" would be dead if Russia led Novichok attack, victim told ",
