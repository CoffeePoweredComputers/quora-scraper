            "answer_text": "acetone is partially polar.but the answer of you question depends upon the field you are looking for. polarity can be described by various factors like dipole moment, dielectric constant, hildebrand parameter, kosower's Z scale and the grunwald winstein mY etc. acetone can dissolve in polar substance like water became it has a polar part (C=O) which can form hydrogen bond with water molecules   but it can also dissolve in non-polar substance like CCl4 . this is because the non polar methyl groups present in acetone. so in short : acetone dissolves in both polar and non-polar substances because it has both polar and non-polar parts . it has two methyl groups, which are non-polar , but it also has a polar carbonyl (C=O) group.
