            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you my perspective, although , in this politically correct era we are in my answer may be offensive to some . Look around the world both at modern prosperous countries and those that are not. Look at the cultures of each of these countries and compare this to the level of modernization and prosperity . Science starts with the philosophical underpinning of \u201cscientific method . \u201c Supporting the use of this methodology is the belief, (a presupposition really) that the laws of nature are uniform and results sre reproducible. Originally , this foundational presupposition resulted from another presuppositon that a rational creator made everything and designed consistency into creation . Many other beliefs also impact how a society accepts and utilizes scientific method . From this we can observe that what cultures believe at a fundamental level can influence their thinking about scientific method which is the foundation of science . Scientific discovery can also cause societal change . For example , although scientific method asserted itself during the Western Renaissance , it's results were sometimes not immediately welcomed . The Catholic Church was very much opposed to Galalio\u2019s assertion that the planets , including Earth revolved around the sun. Eventually m Western society has come to understand that Galalio was correct. So, here is an instance of science shaping society . One last thought is that at least one neurologist has suggested that technology , particularly the way it forces us to interact with it , tends to promote either right-brain weighted or left-brain weighted thinking . Technology is an offshoot of science and results from scientific discovery turned into practical application . If he is correct , the overall way a society thinks during any technological era is greatly influenced by the technology and how it affects brain development in society's members. He went so far as to argue that the god concepts of various societies throughout history , being masculine or femininine were a result of this interplay. Remember , how a society thinks also impacts how it utilizes science. Your question is insightful in that you recognized the fact that science and society mutually influence one another . ",
