            "answer_text": "The other answers are great. Here\u2019s a couple of tips. I have this little equation ready to go - moles = weight / molecular weight (I know it should all be mass, but in a lab, you weigh things). If you tell me what the chemical is - let\u2019s say water H2O I know (or find ) the molar mass (what I call molecular weight) 18 So now my formula is moles = Wt/18 ( weights are in grams - no need to keep saying it) You tell me weight, and I\u2019ll tell you the moles You tell me the moles, and I\u2019ll tell you the weight So, if you ask how many moles are 100 g H2O Immediately , I think 100/18 I see a bottle of sucrose, I look at the label, and I see 342 Immediately, I think moles = Wt/342 ",

            "answer_text": "Moles, grams and molar mass are all related and can be manipulated using the unit-factor method. We start out with an equivalency:1 mol \u2261 1 molar mass \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. molar mass is therefore, the mass in grams of 1 molFrom which we can construct two conversion factors:(1 mol X / m g X) \u2026 and \u2026 (m g X / 1 mol X) For example, consider water with a molar mass of 18.0 g/mol:___g H2O x (1 mol H2O / 18.0g H2O = ___ mol H2O___ mol H2O x (18.0g H2O / 1 mol H2O) = ___ g H2O (*) a conversion factor is a ratio of two equivalent quantities used so that one unit cancels out, leaving the desired unit.
