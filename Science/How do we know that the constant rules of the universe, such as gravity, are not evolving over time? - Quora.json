            "answer_text": "How do we know that the constant rules of the universe, such as gravity, are not evolving over time? We don\u2019t. But the evidence presently suggests that they are constant. As an example, a team of astronomers once looked for evidence that the fine structure constant which is about [math]\\alpha = \\dfrac{e^2}{\\hbar c} = \\dfrac{1}{137.036}[/math] By looking farther and farther away they could see further and further back in time. By examining spectra they determined that it was constant within experimental error. A former professor of mine said that laws of physics or constants changing is ridiculous, because then you\u2019d need laws to describe how those laws change, and so on. Make of that what you will. Hmmm. I\u2019m not sure if he meant to include constants, but pressed to guess I\u2019d say he probably did. ",

            "answer_text": "The way science thinks it can determine that is by observing light and such from far away. Once that light gets here, it appears to obey our rules and operate as we know things operate here. However, with space or time that cannot apply. We have no way to know that time exists the same out there. Therefore what time it may take light to move here, may not represent the time it would take light to move (or anything else to happen) out THERE! That means no one can claim light took billions of years to get here. Science does exactly that, and so science is speaking by faith alone. The only place time has been observed unfolding is here in this solar system area. ",
