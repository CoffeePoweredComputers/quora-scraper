            "answer_text": "The Nebular Hypothesis[1] is currently the most widely accepted hypothesis that explains the origins of our solar system, and possibly other planetary systems too. According to the Nebular Hypothesis, our solar system formed from material in a large nebula. The theory was first proposed by Immanuel Kant in his 1755 work \"Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens\". The word \u201cnebula\u201d is Latin for cloud, and this theory proposes that stars form inside of massive, dense clouds of molecular hydrogen. These clouds begin to rotate due to unstable gravity, and matter within them begins to gather together into smaller, distinct bodies. A star like our sun would take about a million years to form from one of these massive nebulas. Nebular theory explains three observable facts[2] about our solar system: All the planets rotate in the same direction.The planets all orbit within 6 degrees of a common plane.All the planets within the asteroid belt are rocky, while those outside of it are gaseous.Further Reading: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/159-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-solar-system/169-what-is-the-evidence-supporting-the-nebula-theory-of-solar-system-formation-intermediate Footnotes[1] Nebular hypothesis - Wikipedia[2] What Is the Nebular Theory?",

            "answer_text": "The nebular theory describes the formation of the sun, planets, moons and asteroids around 4.5 billion years ago from a nebula cloud comprising dust and gas, according to Universe Today. Gravity condensed the gas into dense regions, which grew into clumps of matter. The nebula cloud spread to form a rotating disk that became the plane of the solar system, which is still in evidence because all planets orbit around the sun in the same direction and plane. Formation of the sun The least amount of centripetal force was at the center of the rotating disk, so most of the mass from the nebula cloud became attracted to this area due to the force of gravity. Most of the material was hydrogen gas that came under intense pressure, which heated it to a critical point, leading to it fusing with another hydrogen atom, creating helium and giving birth to the sun. Formation of planets and the moon The clumps of matter grew in size to form,or early planets, slamming into one another as they orbited the early sun. According to nebular theory, an early form of planet Earth collided with an object, causing debris to fly into space, which then reformed within the Earth's gravitational field to form the moon. ",

            "answer_text": "In the past, there were a number of different hypotheses for the formation of the Solar System. Some suggested that the planets had spun out from the Sun, or that they had been captured, or that two stars had come together and shared their material. But the one that won out was the \u201cnebular hypothesis\u201d, which said that the Sun and the planets both formed from the collapse of a single giant cloud (called a nebula) that, as it contracted, flattened out (the same way that pizza dough flattens out when it\u2019s spun) and eventually coalesced into the planets, while the core collapsed into the Sun.
