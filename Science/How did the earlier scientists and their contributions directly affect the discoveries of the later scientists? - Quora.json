            "answer_text": "They are the central \u201cscientists\u201d of modern science - but all they presented are theories that have no actual scientific proof and are essentially supported only by argument. Charles Darwin had a scientific education of his day, medical. In reaction to the death of his little daughter, he said that there could not be a Good God, and eliminated God from any place in his scientific world. The Bible Creation was rejected. His Theory of Evolution is the result of his rejection of God. After near 150 years, Evolution is yet unproven, no intermediate species have been found. Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution depends its time theory on James Hutton and Charles Lyell's Uniformitarianism (both only argued theories). James Hutton's \u201cTheory of the Earth\u201d (1785), proposed geological findings as being based on \u201clong periods of time\u201d. Charles Lyell was reacting to William Buckland of Oxford, and his Noah's Flood \u201cCatastrophism\u201d. Lyell denied All Catastrophes and his \u201cSteady State\u201d Uniformity theory (Uniformitarianism) says that there is little change over time in the geology and life of the earth, that changes occurred only by the same slow-moving forces in existence today, acting over a very long periods of time. While the denial of catastrophes was the central theme of Lyell\u2019s Uniformity, it has more recently been mostly rejected, the science has been forced to accept the concept of catastrophic events, with drastic changes resulting. All that is left is the \u201cSteady State Uniformity\u201d of \u201clong periods of time\u201d - which is expanded to \u201cmillions of years\u201d and even into the billions. Scientific findings have made by later scientists, who then make an effort to fit these into some form of this theory. Huge pictures have been built, and the school systems teach the future scientists of this as \u201cTruth\u201d. All discoveries since have been forced to fit into these two theories. Previous discoveries are argued and acclaimed as being proofs - Instead of actual scientific proof of the connection, the statement so often heard is \u201cIt just HAS to be \u2026..\u201d Any discovery that would oppose features of this theory are rejected, or argued and forgotten. Scientists who do not accept the theories, regularly lose their job. Upcoming students know that their acceptance of these theories directly affects their future. There are actual challenges to this \u201cscientific\u201d theory, they are ignored and refused. Science continues to promote \u201cEvolutionary Truth\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Earlier quantum physicist theorys, discoveries and findings were the stepping stones to later discoverys. Einstein's early acheivements were a result of the prior works of Max Planck, who had built upon his predecessors. Our current level of knowledge mostly follow this same pattern. This still does not mean 'all physicists theorys or ideas\u2019 are always correct, remember unless the entire quantum buliding blocks way I've mentioned here 'falls apart\u2019 - Einstien was wrong about 'dice play\u2019 and Niels Bohr was right. (No hidden variables.) Often modern day physicists do not view older paradigms in ways which allow them to be true but can still 'transend\u2019 there limits letting those discoveries stand on their own 'laurels\u2019 which are often times 'bendable\u2019 This is a HUGE mistake.
