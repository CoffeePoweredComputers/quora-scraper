            "answer_text": "I have a few experiences that have left an imprint. Experience 1: Red Roof Hotel in Indianapolis, Indiana. I had a family emergency and needed to fly to Indiana. No time to search for hotel with specific accommodations so I booked the closest place to where I needed to be. I learned that was a horrible decision. When I arrived, someone was smoking a weed blunt in the lobby. It appeared that he was there to see his girlfriend who was working at the front desk. They were playing music on a bluetooth speaker that was not appropriate for a hotel lobby. The front desk person was dressed very scantily. I got my key to the room. As soon as I opened the door I was devastated. There was blood in the sink, carpets were dirty and the bedding could not have been cleaned, ever. The smell was something I had never smelled before. It was a bitter, musty and almost a rotting smell. The room air was heavy humid, dark and gave me an eerie feeling. I was on the back side of the hotel where they were doing construction on the other rooms around this one. I went back to the front desk and asked for another room and mentioned something was horribly wrong with that room. They said they had no other rooms available. I did not see but a few cars parked at the hotel and could not believe what I got myself into. By this time more people were coming (no cars) and just hanging out smoking, talking and just staring at me. I asked to cancel my reservation as the room was not clean and the smell was unbearable. I spent the next hour there talking to their corporate office to get a refund. I left uneasy and traumatized. Experience 2: Many years ago, I was traveling to the Ocean Beach and along my way I stopped by my aunts house. As soon as she opened the door a very, very strong order hit my nose. I just about started to gag/vomit. I tried to conceal my dislike of the smell as much as possible and went inside the house. They had 6 small dogs or something like that. I gave my aunt a hug and the strongest smell was on her. She is extremely overweight and her body order smelled as if she was decaying. It was sweat, urine and poo smell all wrapped up in one package. All shades were drawn closed and no windows were open. This was in the summertime and it did not feel as they had air conditioning. I stated I was very warm and asked if we could keep the front door open. As I sat on the couch, I saw many areas of the carpet that had small dog poop just sitting there. I could not stay there more than 15 minutes before I helped myself toward the door and continued my conversation with my aunt/uncle outside. I have never gone back there again to visit. I just can\u2019t do it. Experience 3: When I was in my early 20\u2019s I lived in an apartment in Kent Washington. The rent was fairly cheap for my 2 bedroom place with my son. Someone 2 spaces down from me was silently murdered and no one found him for about a week. The smell in the common space was unbearable. No one could figure where the smell was coming from. Property management brought contractors in to see where the smell was coming from. They finally found the deceased person. The smell stayed around for a short while after Hazard people cleaned up. Death is one of the smells you never forget. ",

            "answer_text": "Marijuana. I was pregnant with my youngest daughter, and every morning I would do the school run to drop my eldest, run some errands and then return home. Between 11am and 4pm like clockwork there would always be this strange, overpowering, mouldy smell which I could never quite put my finger on. My husband would return from work, and I had hardly done anything besides sleep, as I suffered with such bad nausea and headaches (which I had put down to being pregnant). I kept raving about this awful smell, and my sensitive nose kept getting the blame! Until one day, my husband came home and he got a waft of it as he walked up the driveway. He popped round to see the two guys that we\u2019re renting the property next door, and told them that the smell was making me sick, they apologised profusely and said that it wouldn\u2019t happen again and they would cut down smoking so much. But it did happen again. Every. Single. Day. I was getting pretty pent up at this point, so I did a \u2018White Chicks\u2019 and wrote them a letter, pointing out how disgusting it was, and it was stinking out our entire house and that it was making me feel nauseous every day. They responded by agreeing to reseal their chimney breast, and we did the same. All was well for about a week. One day, my husband had to pop into the loft whilst I was out, and when I came home, he was shaking his head saying that the entire loft absolutely stunk of weed. No prizes for guessing what was going on next door. Luckily, one of our neighbours had also noticed the smell and worked in the police station. We were preparing party food for our daughter\u2019s birthday one sunny day in May, when something caught our eye in next door\u2019s back garden. It was one of the guys who lived there and he was sprinting down towards the back of the garden with two police officers in tow. They caught him and bundled him into a Police van. They had decided to raid the property and found over 200 marijuana plants all the way from the loft to lower floor of the house. No wonder I felt so sick all of the time and didn\u2019t want to come home every morning! ",
