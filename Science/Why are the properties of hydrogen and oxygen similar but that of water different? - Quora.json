            "answer_text": "Hydrogen gas is highly combustible in nature but it does not support combustion.For example, fill a glass jar with hydrogen gas and turn it upside down. Introduce a burning candle near the mouth of the jar. The gas at the jar burns but the burning candle gets put off. This shows that hydrogen gas is combustible but does not support combustion. Where in oxygen gas, is the one which makes combustion possible. And when these two gases combine together, they no longer possess their individual properties, because they form a molecule. Properties of water are implied due to hydrogen bond and not because of hydrogen and oxygen gases. ",

            "answer_text": "Properties of every material is a function of the structure of their smallest unit. For example, the properties of hydrogen is a result of the structure and configuration of the hydrogen atom, property of oxygen is a result of the structure and configuration of oxygen atom. For a compound, like water, the smallest unit is the molecule of water. If you split a molecule of water, it is no longer water, but simply two atoms of hydrogen and one atom oxygen. So, the properties of water will be based on the properties of the molecule of water, which is different from atom of oxygen of atom of hydrogen. Hence the difference in properties. ",
