            "answer_text": "In circular motion , the centripetal force is the force which is the cause for circular motion. This force must be from outside the body in motion. If v is the speed in a straight line, in order to make it move along a circular path of radius r, a force [math]m\\cdot{v^2}/r [/math]must act perpendicular to the straight path. And this force as mentioned above is the centripetal force. When a car is moving in a straight path with a speed v, one cannot apply a force from outside the car. We cannot use some string or rope or some other device to pull it toward the center of the arc of the circle along which we want the car to move. But we imagine, that by turning the steering to ward left or right, we can make the car to turn left or right. And in real life this happens. But that is not the reason for the car\u2019s circular motion. Though the wheels are turned toward left or right, If there were no friction, the wheels would follow the straight path and move forward , with the wheels sliding in the direct path. But that does not happen. This means that the friction acts in such a way as to make it move in an arc of a circle. Naturally , as already explained,we infer that it should act to ward the center of the arc. Otherwise it cannot move like that. Another way not to depend on friction is to bank the road which will tilt the car in a direction to which we wish to turn the car. The car tends to fall toward the center. And this force now acts as the centripetal force . The car with it's speed , though seemingly to fall, actually follows a circular arc. ",

            "answer_text": "If a body is undergoing circular motion then it is being acted upon by the centripetal force.Centripetal force is orthogonal to the motion of the body and towards the fixed point of instantaneous axis of rotation. And friction is the source for the centripetal force and so it acts in circular motion in central direction Consider an example where we are driving a vehicle. As we drive the vehicle the wheels of the vehicle are pushing backwards against the ground and friction is the opposing force that pushes the wheel forward enabling the vehicle to move forward. In similar way when we are turning left ,the wheels are pushing towards right against the ground.Static friction allows the ground to push back against the wheels allowing the vehicle to turn left. In this case the only force that is acting in the direction of turn(centripetal force) is the frictional force. As the floor is the only surface that is in contact with the car, friction is the only force that is acting on the car towards the centre of the turn, pushing the car towards the centre of the turn. So we can say that friction acts towards centre. ",
