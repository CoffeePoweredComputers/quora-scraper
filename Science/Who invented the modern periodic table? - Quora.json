            "answer_text": "There was no single discoverer, but Doebereiner in 1816 began arranging elements into Groups. One of his Triads was arranged by Atomic Weight, where he observed that Calcium ( Atomic Weight 27.5 ), Strontium ( Atomic Weight 50 ) and Barium ( AW 72.5 ) had very similar chemical properties, and were separated from each other by a difference of 22 Atomic Weight units. This was the discovery of the periodic nature of similar elements. Other chemists were prompted to search for other Triads, and they were soon found : Berzelius found these : Lithium / Sodium / Potassium , then Chlorine / Bromine / Iodine , then Sulfer / Selenium / Tellurium , and Manganese / Chromium / Iron. The Atomic Weight periodicity was a little different from Doebereiner\u2019s Triads, but they were close, and the chemical and physical properties seemed to match up very convincingly. In the coming decades of the nineteenth century, new elements had been discovered, and better values for the Atomic Weights could be measured. In 1863, Newlands organized the elements by what he called The Law Of Octaves. His proposal was that the periodicity repeated itself after each sequence of eight elements, ordered by Atomic Weight again. The arrangement was far from convincing, but as the number of new elements grew, they realized that any classification must leave blank spaces for undiscovered elements that would logically ( by Atomic Weight periodicity and similarity in chemical properties ) fit into those spaces. Mendeleev in the late ninteenth century arranged the growing number of elements into the form of a Table Of Data, with Eight Columns and eleven rows. Chemists would scarcely acknowledge that this was a very convincing display of periodicity, but Mendeleev di something that noone had done before: not only did he leave spaces in his listing for undiscovered elements, he also predicted the Atomic Weight and chemical properties of a few undiscovered elements. He foresaw that an element of Atomic Weight 69.9 would be found, and that it\u2019s properties would be quite similat to that of Aluminum ( Atomic Weight 27 ). When Gallium was discovered, Mendeleev was hailed as a genius. To this day, he is named as the discoverer of the Periodic Table. But he wasn\u2019t. The chemistry of the elements was clouded by several oddities in the arrangement, several elements did not fit into the neat Table of Data that Mendeleev had constructed, and a whole family of elements which had been unearthed in Northern Europe bore a striking similarity to one another - even though they had similar and consecutive Atomic Weights. Many chemists were not convinced of the validity of the arrangement, some suggesting sarcastically that they should try arranging the elements in alphabetical order. As the new twentieth century rolled around, the problems with the arrangement became more perplexing. In addition, there were many reports of new element discoveries that turned out to be false - they were all just elements that were already known. Simultaneously, the number of actual discoveries of new elements was slow in coming. Then in 1913 Henry Mosley began using various metals as targets in his X-Ray tubes. Mosely measured the wavelengths emitted from the metals under X-Ray bombardment. There seemed to be a systematic decrease in the wavelengths as the Atomic Weight increased. As he studied more of the known elements, a consistent relationship emerged. The wavelengths were a function of the Atomic Number of the elements, not their Atomic Weights. Mosely constructed the Periodic Table we use today. With this new ordering of the elements, several problems were solved. The Cobalt - Nickel anomaly was one where the earlier element ( Cobalt ) had a higher Atomic Weight than later Nickel. The puzzelling Lanthanide elements were shown to fall outside the accepted trends of elements lighter than Atomic Number 57. It became possible to identify an element from it\u2019s X-Ray Fluorescence spectrum, with a simple calculation of the Atomic number. In fact, several false claims of new elements were made. Of course, the blank spaces in Moseley\u2019s Periodic Table were eventually filled, and their identities confirmed y their Atomic Number. There was no one discoverer of the Periodic Table. Over a hundred years, more that fifty chemists contributed to it\u2019s construction. ",

            "answer_text": "The periodic tabble, also known as the periodic table of elements, is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The structure of the table shows periodic trends. The seven rows of the table, called periods, generally have metals on the left and non-metalson the right. The columns, called groups, contain elements with similar chemical behaviours. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals. The organization of the periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the various element properties, and also to predict chemical properties and behaviours of undiscovered or newly synthesized elements. Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first recognizable periodic table in 1869, developed mainly to illustrate periodic trends of the then-known elements. He also predicted some properties of unidentified elements that were expected to fill gaps within the table. Most of his forecasts proved to be correct. Mendeleev's idea has been slowly expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour. The modern periodic table now provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical reactions, and continues to be widely used in chemistry, nuclear physics and other sciences. The elements from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) through 118 (oganesson) have been discovered or synthesized, completing seven full rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements all occur naturally, though some are found only in trace amounts and a few were discovered in nature only after having first been synthesized. Elements 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors. The synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is currently being pursued: these elements would begin an eighth row, and theoretical work has been done to suggest possible candidates for this extension. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories. ",
