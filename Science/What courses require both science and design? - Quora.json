            "answer_text": "Architecture. On one hand, you have to design beautiful buildings and churn out new, never-before seen designs, ones that are truly mesmerizing:  That building there, It\u2019s Taipei 101 It\u2019s built in one of the most earthquake prone regions in the world. And that\u2019s were the science steps in! This building is built to resist an earthquake up to 8 on the Richter Scale, it has features that cannot be spotted by us ordinary folks, but subtly included in the building to make it more resistant to earthquakes and typhoons, like this huge 660 ton tuned mass damper:   and that\u2019t one of the few reasons I think architecture is that one course that involves both design and science, as it\u2019s not just about sketching amazing buildings but involves checking it\u2019s feasibility too, making sure the science checks out. And that\u2019s what separates architects from other designers. ",

            "answer_text": "Industrial design, is a bachelor's in science. In order to design a product You will have to learn how it\u2019s engineered. I studied it, never finished it, but I loved every minute of it. It always makes you think and try to come up with new ways and concepts on how a product should look and a lot of times how a product should function. You are not just an artist if you are an industrial designer, you are also responsible for the engineering of the product in some cases, Case in point the iPhone. Steve Jobs and his team of industrial designers dictated the design and how it should function and engineers worked on having function follow form. But designers had to also be aware and knowledgeable about engineering limitations and what can and cannot be implemented. Industrial design is engineered art. ",
