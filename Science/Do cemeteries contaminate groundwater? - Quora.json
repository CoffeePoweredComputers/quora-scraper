            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cDo cemeteries contaminate groundwater?\u201d Not particularly. The addition of new bodies is so slow and gradual over the years that their decomposition only adds to the fertility of the soil. If you have not heard, adding dead stuff to soils makes them more fertile and productive. Just keep a bit of sepatation in distance and time. Throwing a dead anyything into your well is not recommeneded. Groundwater is typically far deeper in the ground than where people bury carcasses. ",

            "answer_text": "Modern ones? Of course they do. Not only do you have the toxic embalming fluids, there are the ancillary contamination such as the decomposition products of the casket materials-of-construction, and the lead lining used in some caskets. There isn\u2019t much about any person, dead or alive, that doesn\u2019t make a negative contribution to the environment. ",
