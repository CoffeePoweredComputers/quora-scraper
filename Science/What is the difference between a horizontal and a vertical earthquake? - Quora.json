            "answer_text": "Try this simple experiment as an illustration.  Fill a flat bottomed tub, tray or basin with water. Place a flat plate on the bottom.  Slide the plate sideways and observe the water.  Lift the plate rapidly and observe the water.  You should see that horizontal movement does not displace much water and creates only a small wave while moving it vertically displaces a lot of water and creates a big wave.  Earth quakes are somewhat similar. There are types where two plates of land slip past each other and others where one plate slides under the other (resulting in vertical movement). The first is called slip-strike. The other is subduction.  ",

Vertical earthquake:- This earthquake is caused by the vertical movements of the tectonic plates.The earthquake caused by the Normal and reverse fault is known as a vertical earthquake. Vertical fault can become the cause of a tsunami. Want to know more about faults with infographics and images read this article: What is a fault? Normal, reverse and strike-slip faults ",
