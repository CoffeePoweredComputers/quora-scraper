            "answer_text": "Ok let\u2019s look at the biological markers and see if they tell us what has happened in the past. (1) Orange Trees have been driven south 350 miles in 120 years. (2) Greenland which had large stands of Aspen now has all trees extinct from freezing over the past 1020 years. (3) Our Crops are sprouting at about 50% of normal for this time due to cold. This is all time record cold. I think I settled if there is any evidence of global warming. NONE! I know all the talk of CO2. The meter sits on Mauna Loa. It is directly downwind of Hilo Hawaii. The city and suburban area has grown since 1950 from about 10,000 to nearly 200,000. That matches the CO2 curve so sink that one there is a finger on the scale. They cheated. All of the discussion of a 1C rise depends on proxy data. The problem is proxy data is not accurate like the biological markers I gave you. Thermographic records suffer much accuracy problems and adjustment which means they are fiction. Prior to about 1940 the US weather records accuracy is limited by the measuring devices to within 1C. Prior to 1900 it may even be 2C. Similarly the places we record temperature data are subject to errors. The Weather Service was almost exclusively established to support aviation. It measures at Airports. Airports have gotten bigger, Airplanes have gotten bigger. Industry has moved in. Simple that warms up the thermometers. There is no real warming! This is a heater on the thermometer. Glaciers and Ice levels are NOT retreating. At this time they are advancing significantly. Polar Ice in the north is at historic high levels now. Are oceans rising. Clearly the tide gages show a rise in many but not all places. The consistent factor on the tide gages is the withdrawal of freshwater from port cities or oil deposits in the area. This sinks land. Honestly there could be some rising but if it is, it has been slowing down from the time of the last glacial epoch. No man effect here. As an example of the position of NWS offices HSV getting heated up.  The NWS is in this picture. At the time it was built it was the only building there and there were no hangers etc. No freight terminal nothing. Now it is a busy airport especially at night. When it was built in 1969 the airport only had an occasional flight. Here is what the place looks like now when it used to be surrounded by cotton fields  Soon it will be built up even more. This is fairly typical of US NWS offices. You put a lot of buildings and jets around a NWS office and it is bound to see some warming. There is your whole story in two pictures. Global Warming IS A HOAX. ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t any. If there were evidence of man caused warming, the question asker would not have to ask this basic question. Hansen, Lebedeff et al 1988 was the seminal work on CO2 emissions based temperature forcing. Hansen missed the side of the barn in broad daylight with a shotgun. The man caused warming hoax required Hansen to be accurate, when anyone with eyesight can see his idea required +0.3\u00ba -0.5\u00baC decadal warming, after 1990 when his BAU \u201c scenario A\u201d hit 350ppm CO2 in 1990. Richard Feynman defined science, \u201c Now I am going to discuss how we would look for a new law. In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right. Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is - if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. That is all there is to it. \u201c Hansen guessed at CO2 emissions based temperature forcing, and got it wrong. That should have been the end of the story, but the dead horse of man caused global warming, morphed into a baseless propaganda campaign to sell another doom circus fiction simply titled, \u201c climate change\u201d. The fact that modern warming failed to meet scientific standards for the human emissions based control knob \u201c theory\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to bother ignorant sychophants parroting the misanthropic notion all negative consequences of weather, are to be blamed on humanity. Nevermind \u201c global warming\u201d isn\u2019t occurring at any kind of \u201c unprecedented\u201d rate. This world, and other worlds in this solar system are warming, and mankind has nothing whatsoever to do with that event. Human emissions of CO2 are guessed around 30 gigatons per year. Natural positive CO2 flux is guessed around 700 gigatons annually. 30/700+ 0.04 and is not the global control knob of anything, ever. It\u2019s less than errors in the guesstimate of natural flux, less than rounding errors, less than instrument calibration errors. Then there\u2019s volumes of actual science that shows natural forces like the sun, have been misrepresented by politically biased, public funded \u201c science\u201d.  Svensmark and Shaviv backed up their conclusions with the Cloud Chamber experiment at CERN in 2017 . ",

Or are you getting bored with the sheer volume of satellite IR thermographs lately being supplemented by the OCO satellite? Wanting to have the raw data predigested for you would be understandable if you only had access only to raw data. However, it also exists in analyzed form so what, exactly, are you hoping for? An answer relieving you of the responsibility to participate by adopting a modest lifestyle? For several years, flat earthers asked for evidence of a round earth. In response they are quickly buried in it and clearly, finding it all too complicated, have reverted to their default belief and to \u201crefining\u201d their preposterous model of how the physical world truly is shaped. What does this have to do with global heating? Not a thing. Rather, it has to do with the FACT, become ever-more clear, that we will believe only what we can comprehend AND that this aligns with our baseline prejudices (established, in the first place by God only knows what?). In other words, if all you (the \u201croyal you\u201d) needed was proof, we (the \u201croyal we\u201d) would have abandoned such discussions long ago. All I can hope for now is that the nul hypothesis will be re-introduced & understood correctly. Should that happen, many more conspiracies would be mortally challenged & die overnight. I'd need evidence of this happening long before believing it to have happened. While our level of sophistication seems to have evolved, we nonetheless display continuously a preference for explanations that leave us \u201cfeeling good\u201d and vindicated in our understanding. The latter appears to be particularly effective if it admits you to membership in a small, select group who \u201cknows the truth\u201d and is too clever to have bought into the lie being perpetrated. Why and how they do so is a glorious mystery, but simultaneously a terrifying truth just waiting for unsuspecting dupes to fall into the trap that \u201cthey\u201d uncovered and now serve as its' lighthouse, likely grounded in conspiracies ",

            "answer_text": "Glacial retreat, sea levels always rising faster than before, average temps increasing and the definite increase of carbon dioxide is proof that humanity is causing extra radiative forcing (global warming) which will cause the climate to change, however uncertain that is. To me, the proof was in the lab over a century ago when John Tyndall proved what a greenhouse gas is. And now, the greatest evidence is sea level rise because it is doing so at an exponential rate, not w linear rate! Look at the graphs at the following site. Draw a line from 1880 to about 1945. To be fair, end the line at the halfway point in the gaps (that go above or below normal). Now draw another line from that to the 1980\u2019s to the end at 2013. Now, look at the recent graph and see that in just the last 5 years, the line is going upwards even more! If we draw the line from the 1940\u2019s to now, we see that the dip below the line is more exaggerated towards the recent, meaning that the rate of increase is accelerating, whereas if we were still exiting Europe's little ice age, the increase would be slowing or just linear. Another piece of evidence, though probably not proof, is the \u201ccontrol Earth\u201d hypothesis. 3 million years ago during the Pliocene, the sea level was between 5\u201340 meters higher than it is today, depending upon the various different astronomical situations. The Isthmus of Panama was already in place (so no one can say \u201cthe world was a totally different place\u201d then). The sun wasn't much dimmer (like it was during the far longer ago geo times that skeptics do like to compare apples to oranges). Guess what, that Pliocene had about 400 parts per million CO2!

There are multiple times through out the history of the planet where the climate has drastically shifted, and truthfully - we don\u2019t even fully understand why it happened then either. We simply do not fully understand the effects or factors behind what governs the changes to the climate that occur. Nature is both extremely fragile while at the same time surprisingly robust. It is hard to say what influence humans do have because we barely understand our current climate as-is, let alone what each thing does to impact it. This ultimately is the problem with Climate Change\u2026 there is no concrete information which either conclusively proves or disproves Climate Change or that it is being caused by Humans\u2026 As such - this only leaves the extremes of either side of the discussion to bicker. Pro-climate change fear-mongering people into apocalyptic predictions which have consistently failed to come true, and anti-climate change which claim what is happening being good (greener, faster growing plants) while not looking at the bigger picture (they die faster too).
