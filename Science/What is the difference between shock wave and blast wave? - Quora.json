            "answer_text": "Shock wave:- Shock waves are large amplitude pressure waves produced by an object when source moving faster than the speed of sound in medium. Shock waves are generated.  Here Shock waves are generating by space shuttle in air medium. Blast wave:- A blast wave is an area of pressure expanding supersonically outward from the explosive core.(Example bomb explosion) In these explosion the large amount of shock wave passage outward from the explosive core only for a few milliseconds.(Example bomb explosion) blast wave also travels faster than the speed of sound.

            "answer_text": "What is the difference between shock wave and blast wave? Blast wave is a subset of shock wave. A shock wave is a sudden increase in pressure that is large enough that the wave travels at faster than the normal speed of sound. That\u2019s what a blast wave is too. It\u2019s just that a blast wave is caused by an explosion (a blast). There are other ways to create shock waves (such as by an object moving through the air at supersonic speeds). ",
