Instead, all he needs is to remember a couple of numbers and say them out loud. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m talking winning lottery numbers of course. Do it for 3 independent lotteries from accross the world. Not really hard to memorize 20 or so numbers. After that, everyone would believe his Trumprophecies\u2026 ",

In other words he does not travel through the same dimension, but to another one, one that is different to the one he is from. Also 2030 is only 12 years away. You think we\u2019re gonna make time travel possible by then? Even so, we can\u2019t go backwards, ever. ",
