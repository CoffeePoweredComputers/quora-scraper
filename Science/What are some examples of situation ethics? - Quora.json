            "answer_text": "I am actually heading out in a couple of minutes to teach my ethics course so little time to answer but if your question is about SITUATION ethics (as proposed by Joseph Fletcher) and not some generalized situational ethic then the answers here are missing that. Fletcher might have been paraphrasing the Beatles- \u2018all you need is love.\u201d He was trying to create a Christian ethic with only one rule\u2026 that of doing the loving thing. No time to go into the whole system here but the HOW you select the loving thing to do is both pragmatic and aspirational (what works and what goes beyond our normal responses). So how you show love will change. I might let one person get away with a crime and seek punishment for another. CANNOT give an example easily without\u2026are you ready?\u2026 going far deeper into the differing situations. Note that his definition of love was drawn from Christian scholarly tradition. ",

            "answer_text": "Just had one of those last night. We have a lot of panhandlers in the Denver area. I normally ignore them because I\u2019m aware that most of them just want money for alcohol and drugs, and I\u2019m not into enabling self-destructive behaviors. Last night, I went to the super market to pick up a few groceries. It was dark when I parked my car in the supermarket parking lot, got out and started walking toward the store. A black woman standing next to a car on the other side of the aisle I was in said, \u201cGood evening!\u201d I returned the comment and kept walking. She said, \u201cExcuse me, sir.\u201d I stopped, turned, and said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m asking for help,\u201d she said. She seemed to have a Bahamian accent. \u201cWhat kind of help do you need?\u201d \u201cI need money for food.\u201d Her eyes were pleading. This was legitimate. I pulled out my wallet and handed her $50, and said, \u201cI hope this helps.\u201d A short time later, while I was still shopping in the store, she came up to me with her shopping cart that included about a 1 yr old baby in the seat and thanked me again. It was good feeling. I had just traded some high priced tenderloins for some balogna to help a woman in need. ",
