            "answer_text": "Humanities, easily. The most complex question is the nature of the ideasthesia of our relations. The most pure of questions will always be metaphysical quandaries of epistemological or axiological references. You won\u2019t solve the mind-body problem, or the hard problem of consciousness, with anything less than a frightening mix of both, and I\u2019m putting my money on philosophers answering the ultimate question of human apprehensions and the metaphysical extensions of thought itself. It\u2019s a question of the breadth of knowledge. A polymath who trailblazes new truisms across a wide spread of the humanities; from axiology, epistemology, law and moral theory, pedagogy, theology, and more would necessarily be the greatest of human minds of our generation. That being said, because of that breadth of necessary revelations across so many facets that speak to a cosmic mutualism of a shared humanity, yet of lonely minds distant like stars in the void, it\u2019s also far harder than simply treading new ground into scientific endeavours. It is through the humanities that will bring lonely minds into union or division, and burn the brightest torch in the explorations of existence. Science is an assumption of epistemological virtues of things like the cosmological constant. The humanities encompasses not only a question of what epistemology is, but everything else that is recognizably human and outside the human. It\u2019s also a problem of \u2018cyphers of transmission\u2019 \u2026 Anybody can read a scientific paper. It\u2019s not actually that hard. Uniform formats, attempts at specificity. Mathematical proofs are difficult, but by necessity science must be a language through a consensus of knowing and a consensus of \u2018reasonable revelation\u2019 of mutual digestion. The humanities is similar in this sense \u2026 and yet it required a Kierkegaard to expound a revelation roughly 200 concise pages of very dry writing, digestible only if you\u2019ve read other philosophical works, in order to truly understand his theory of what would become one of the largest philosophical movements, and colour 200 years worth, of metaphysics and moral philosophy. The humanities is so very fucking difficult that three centuries on we\u2019re still not 100% sure what Hegel was getting at (only that he was really right, but just how right is he?) and you can spend 5 years at university and write a thesis on Hegelian dialectics and still not be able to sell it convincingly. Every humanities student should be an explorer into an unknown dimension of thought, or a critique of a model of presumption. Restless, and analyzing the unconscious biases accumulated through life with a fine-toothed comb. A person that must walk a tightrope of paradoxical conditions of skirting on the one hand manufactured virtues and, on the other, unintelligible diatribe. Stuff has to \u2018make sense\u2019 \u2026 and it can never do so with cold mathematics, nor treating an essay as if a Jackson Pollock. The scariest part of the humanities is you\u2019re guaranteed to fail. You will fall from that tightrope. All you can hope for is that you get \u2018further ahead\u2019 along that knife\u2019s edge than your peers. You can measure a good written work in the humanities by how many nods you see, before you see a grimace, in a peer\u2019s face. ",

            "answer_text": "Both. Science is about numbers. If you are bad at numbers, it will be hard for you. The humanities are about words. If you are bad at words ... You get the picture. For every humanities scholar who can't calculate himself out of a paper bag, there is a STEM scientist terrified of actually having to write down her findings. This was all exposed in 1959 in C P Snow's amusing little book  The Two Cultures. But even Snow saw the beginning of the Social Sciences, which straddles the divide between the two. ",
