            "answer_text": "No. Light and colors are subjective sensations of living creatures as a reaction to signals form their senses. When we sense light it is usually because our eyes are exposed to electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum, quite a monstrous term but this is the physical object which we perceive as light. Just to demonstrate a non-spectrum example, when we receive blunt hit in our head we sometime see flush of light. This is a real sensation yet no \u201cphysical light\u201d is involved. We do tend use the two terms interchangeably in everyday life and would call any power in the visible spectrum \u201clight\u201d. We say that \u201cthe sun emits light\u201d and here we do mean a physical object, although a physicist would rather call it \u201cpower spectrum\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Matter doesnt exist. only the energy and interactions of the energy born from the vacume of space. Which generates an energy. Anything that exist can develope wheather. The energy in space that comes from a vacume is balanced and everwhere. Matter in its originall form was infanent in sise and absolutly still. It would appear as a sea of glass. frozen at absolute zero and in balence. One could say in a perfect form. But with infanent time which actually does not exist. Accept in the human mind. But with infanent time and posibilities wheather or movment began. I believe in a wave or many or even infanant number of waves. As the waves collided. The collisions generated enough energy or heat to melt and facture the originall form of matter. Causing another new wave of the creation of the universe as we now know it. Imperfect and ever growing for all eternity at the speed of an imperfect universes spead of light. ",
