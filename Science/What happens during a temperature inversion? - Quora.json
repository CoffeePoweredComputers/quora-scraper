            "answer_text": "A weather, or \u201ctemperature\u201d inversion happens when air temperature increases with altitude, thus \u2018inverting\u201d the normal temperature pattern in the Troposphere. Since air will rise only when it is warmer than surrounding air, this situation essentially traps air, and air pollution near the ground. Denver and Salt Lake City often suffer their worst air quality under these circumstances. Where I live, in Nebraska, there are no mountains to exacerbate the problem, so the chief visible evidence of inversion is discharge from smoke stacks, and even residential chimneys will rise slightly and then simply lay flat, elongating with the prevailing wind.
