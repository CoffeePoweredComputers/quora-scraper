Neither one of those resulted in lawsuits that I could find, largely because they immediately admitted fault and paid to have the damages repaired. They had a few legal squabbles over the name \u201cMythBusters\u201d in various countries, all dismissed as far as I can see. Then there is some guy on the internet saying that the MythBusters stole content from him, and Discovery pulled multiple episodes because of it. I cannot find any substantiation of these claims ,and it looks like the issue was never taken to court. Most of the info I can find on the subject traces back to the Huffington Post, not exactly a bastion if integrity, so unless I see more solid evidence I am going to chalk it up to an inflated ego that got mad because the Mythbusters produced similar content.
