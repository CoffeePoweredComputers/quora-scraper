            "answer_text": "The forces within a molecule are generally based on covalent bonds, sharing electrons among the atoms in strong organic molecular bonds. Between molecules, for example proteins, we see hydrogen bonds and sulfur bonds, among others. These are mechanically weaker, but taken all together as a structural whole, they can be very strong too. Take spider web silk, which is in fact stronger and more flexible than steel. Or human hair, rich in sulfur bonding. Another reason is the physical, geometric structure of molecules, which mechanically support the maintenance of the integral organic structures of the whole organism. ",

            "answer_text": "Intramolecular force is stronger than intermolecular force. Intramolecular force is due to strong covalent bond or ionic bond. On the other hand intermolecular forces are very quick forces like London force,van dar wall force etc. ",
