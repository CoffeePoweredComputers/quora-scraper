            "answer_text": "Radio telescopes were used. Unlike an optical telescope, only one wavelength is detected. They used 1.3 mm. wavelength, which is not in the optical but in the radio range. One radio telescope can only measure the intensity and very roughly the direction it came from. As such, the result is more comparable to a radar image (but instead of depth, intensity is measured) Two telescopes can measure the time between arrival of a signal and with that you can calculate much more precisely where it came from along one axis. With even more telescopes the source of the signal can be pinpointed quite good Something comparable is radio triangulation used in navigation or to pinpoint the source of a broadcast. The big difference is the exact matching of the signal. For that each signal is recorded with a timestamp. Before the experiment was started, several sites received atomic clocks that were all set at the same time. The measured differences depend on the distance between the telescopes (makes it bigger) and the distance to the observed object (makes it smaller). With an object millions of light years away, the timing differences become so small that only regions with the size of millions of kilometers can be observed. The result is a map of locations and intensities. The telescopes only see a small part of that map at the same time. As the Earth is moving, other parts of that map are observed. So what the scientists actually had to work with, was a whole bunch of pictures of the M87 black hole, that only showed very small parts of it. The pictures were from different times, so they could not just overlay them but had to account for things that moved or changed. If two observed regions are very close, it is probably quite easy to fill in the blanks. But to construct a whole picture, a lot of work had to be done. After constructing the picture, observations were cross checked with theoretical models of black holes. This gave scientists the angle they were looking at the black hole and some properties of the black hole itself, like its size and rotation angle. Still not done, the scientists used that model to check if the observations from different times matched with what the model would predict how things should evolve in time. I could have elaborated more on the image processing (new ways of image processing were developed, that\u2019s once spin-off that might see use outside black-hole astronomy), the data transfer or other monumental tasks the team had to accomplish to make this picture. But the story is getting quite long. In very short: Work took over a year and hundreds of people. I guess the picture will win Guiness Book Title of most man hours per pixel. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. About a hundred years back in the year 1915-16, a guy from Germany (You know who.) presented a theory in an attempt to understand where gravity comes from and why does it make us move, the way we do! Back then all of it was on a piece of paper with some fancy math. The ideas were quite convoluted and against the conventional thought at the time. But after all these years the theory stands tall against all those who tried to prove it wrong. We made GPS, Rockets, Satellites using the theory and sure have come a long way. Until a decade ago when some guys decided to see the unseeable. Obtain an image, that wasn't just another piece of the human imagination and computer rendition but as real as it gets. They wanted to see the mysterious cosmic objects called Black Holes. Yeah! We did not have even a single real image of it yet we ponder over their dynamics and mesmerize over them in the movies. There's just a small problem with getting this image. You'll need a telescope the size of Earth to capture enough light which sure sounds easy, right? But then what's a challenge that's easy, so these guys probably made a phone call and talked to other guys. Those guys talked to some more guys. And after a decade in 2017, several universities across the globe in about 20 different regions got their high-end telescope connected to each other and looking up into depths of the universe, capturing data simultaneously and collecting up to 5 Petabytes which in essence, is about a billion mp3 songs. Then these images have to be stitched together which require us to bring that huge amount of data together which is done by the fastest way of data transfer for PBs of data, which is carrying the hard disks by airplane or any other fast processes to a common central location. After which multiple teams in different parts of world work independently to make a single image throughout the year. They reduce these Petabytes of data to few kilobytes. In this brilliant mechanism of collaboration, we end up seeing the invisible. Meanwhile, in fact, 55 Million years back a beam of light got deflected around this massive Black Hole at the center of M87 galaxy (yes gravity bends light) and these photons that got deflected by immense gravity started their journey to Milky Way, to our home, to our Earth. Traveled nearly 120 thousand years in their home galaxy, 54 million years more through Interstellar space entering Milky Way and traveling another 100 thousand years to reach us just in time. Just in time for the German physicist to present his theory. Just in time for us to build high-end telescopes, just in time for us to come over our differences, just in time for us to collaborate and build together, just in time for us to see the unseeable. ",
