            "answer_text": "I\u2019m using WolframAlpha to illustrate what positive and negative ions are: Wolfram|Alpha: Making the world\u2019s knowledge computable Just click on the link and you should see the cation (+) and anions (-) clearly displayed. A brief explanation: As Ca has 2+ charges, essentially it is missing electrons in it\u2019s outermost shell, and needs electrons to counter the + charge from it\u2019s nucleus. Therefore it is a cation.Each OH has a one negative charge. You can see from WolframAlpha that the negative charge is on the oxygen making it an anion. Why does the oxygen have an overall negative charge? Because it has one electron more than it needs and so as an anion it is not electrically balanced or said another way it has too many electrons for the Oxygen atom to handle. Think of handling a hot potato in your hands and you\u2019ll quickly feel for oxygen\u2019s effort to get rid of the extra charge.Carbon hydroxide forms because of Oxygen\u2019s dire need to find electrical balance. The extra electrons are donated to Ca and a new molecular orbital is formed around the new molecule that is carbon hydroxide.",

            "answer_text": "In the simplest sense, an atom consists of a nucleus containing positively charged protons and neutrons which have no net charge. The nucleus is also surrounded by electrons which have the same magnitude of charge as a proton but are negatively charged. Atoms have no net charge and so have the same number of electrons as protons. However if an electron is removed from the atom via a process such as ionisation or beta minus decay then the number of protons will be one greater than the number of electrons. This will cause the atom to now have a relative charge of 1+. The resulting particle will be known as an ion. If further electrons are lost then the resulting ion will have a charge of +2, +3 and so on. The total relative charge of the ion is equal to the total number of electrons removed from the atom. This is equal to the number of protons minus the number of electrons. Electrons can also be added to an atom in a process called electron affinity. If electrons are added to an atom then the atom will have a net negative charge and will become a negatively charged ion. If 1 electron is added the ion will have a relative charge of -1. ",

            "answer_text": "When a certain salt such as sodium chloride is added to water, ionization process of sodium chloride begins. A molecule of the salt becomes a positive ion and a negative ion This ions are charged particles. The sodium ion is positively-charged and the chlorine ion is negatively-charged. A positively-charged sodium ion lacks an electron while a negatively-charged chlorine ion has an excess of an electron. If two metallic electrodes of zinc and copper are immersed in the salt solution in both sides of the container, the negative ion chlorine will move towards the zinc electrode and deposit its extra electron on the neutral zinc thus making the electrode negatively-charged. The positive ion of sodium will move towards the copper electrode and remove an electron from copper to make it neutral atom. The copper electrode now becomes positively-charged. By connecting both electrodes to a voltmeter, the instrument ",

So it will be H+. Whereas in oxygen, the second orbit has a capacity of 8 electron, but it has 6. Therefore to stabilize itself, it can accept 2 electrons. So its 0-\u00b2 When these combine, one atom of oxygen combine with 2 hydrogen atoms hence completing their vacant orbits and forming H\u00b2O i.e. water which is a stable compound ",
