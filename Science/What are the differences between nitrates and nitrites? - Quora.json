            "answer_text": "Nitrites and nitrates are two different molecules that are made up of both nitrogen and oxygen. The chemical difference between nitrites and nitrates is how many oxygen atoms each compound contains. Nitrites have two oxygen atoms and one nitrogen, while nitrates have three oxygen atoms. It is possible for nitrates to turn into nitrites by losing an oxygen atom, and the reverse can happen as well. Nitrates are often found in fertilizers, and both nitrites and nitrates are commonly used in various food preservation processes such as sausage making. Both nitrites and nitrates are negatively charged ions, which means that the combined protons in these molecules are outnumbered by the electrons. This type of ion is referred to as an anion due to the negative electric charge. The other type of ion is the positively charged cation, which nitrite and nitrate molecules tend to be attracted to. That can allow the nitrite or nitrate molecule to attain a neutral balance of charge when combined with the cation. The other factor that these two molecules have in common is that they are both composed of nitrogen and oxygen. The most fundamental difference between nitrite and nitrate molecules is that while they both contain nitrogen and oxygen, the number of oxygen atoms is different. Both nitrate and nitrite molecules contain one nitrogen atom, but nitrates have three atoms of oxygen and nitrites have only two. Despite this difference, it is possible for nitrites and nitrates to each chemically change into the other by gaining or losing an oxygen molecule. Nitrates are most commonly used as a component in fertilizers, since they offer a form of nitrogen that is readily taken up by many plants. Other common uses include glass making and explosives, which is why fertilizer is sometimes used in improvised bombs. In the natural world, nitrates are produced by bacteria that bond nitrogen and oxygen atoms into molecules. These molecules are then used by plants and then later eaten by animals, which rely on nitrates to create proteins. Other microorganisms in the environment are capable of reducing nitrates into nitrites, and then into component nitrogen and oxygen atoms. One of the main uses for nitrites is in various food preservation processes. It is useful for curing meat due to the fact that it can keep bacteria from growing, and also has a secondary effect of turning the meat a reddish color. This is due to the way that the nitrites react to myoglobin present in meat. Nitrites can also have a reaction with hemoglobin within a human body, turning it into methemoglobin that is incapable of bonding with oxygen. The amount of nitrites present in food items is typically regulated for this reason. Both these words, nitrate and nitrate are used interchangeably as they have quite the similar pronunciation and spellings. They share many similarities and that is why they sometimes get intermix. Both of them are the inorganic chemical compounds that have composition of nitrogen and oxygen. The number of oxygen atoms in them actually bring out the difference as it changes their structure, shape and function. Nitrites have two oxygen atoms and one nitrogen, while nitrates have three oxygen atoms and a nitrogen atom. As there is only the difference of oxygen atom, a nitrate can become nitrite and the reverse can also happen as well. A nitrate can become nitrite with undergoing the process of reduction, whereas nitrites can become nitrate with undergoing the process of oxidization. Nitrate ions form nitric acid, which turns out to be a strong acid, on the other hand, nitrite ions form nitrous acid, which turns out to be a weaker acid. Comparison Chart Nitrate Nitrite Number of Atoms Nitrate is made up of three Oxygen atom and one Nitrogen atom. Nitrite is made up of one Nitrogen atom and two Oxygen atoms. Oxidation Number of Nitrogen In Nitrate the oxidation number of Nitrogen in +5. In nitrite the oxidation number of Nitrogen is +3. Acid Formed Nitrate ions form nitric acid, which turns out to be a strong acid. Nitrite ions form nitrous acid, which turns out to be a weaker acid. Usage The most common usages of nitrates are that they are used as an important component in the fertilizers and explosives. One of the most prominent usage of nitrites is that it is used as the useful component for food preservation. What is Nitrate? Nitrate is the polyatomic ion that is made up of nitrogen and oxygen. The \u2018N\u2019 in the beginning of \u2018nitrate\u2019 suggest the influence of Nitrogen atoms influence and dominate over the ion. It is made up of three Oxygen atom and one Nitrogen atom, and is highly stable as compare to the nitrite, and even the acid made from it, nitric acid is a strong acid. The most common usages of nitrates are that they are used as an important component in the fertilizers and explosives. Nitrate is essential for the growth of plants and before the stable industry of fertilizers, the livestock fecal matter was used for the growth of the plants as a fertilizer. The complete cycle beginning from bacteria\u2019s consumption of nitrogen from the atmosphere and then decaying of bacteria which results as absorbing of nitrate by the plants and later animal eat the plants and further passes on the nitrate through their feces. The structure of the nitrate ion makes it quite a more stable as it shapes like the trigonal planar geometry, the Nitrogen is present in the center and is bonded to the three oxygen atoms. What is Nitrite? Nitrite is the polyatomic ion that is made up of nitrogen and oxygen. The actual difference between nitrate and nitrite is that nitrite is made up of one Nitrogen atom and two Oxygen atoms. The structure it has makes nitrite ion less stable than the nitrate ions. Although, a nitrate can become nitrite with undergoing the process of reduction, whereas nitrites can become nitrate with undergoing the process of oxidization. The molecular formula of nitrite is NO2, and has a structure with Nitrogen atom between the two Oxygen atoms. It has a bent molecular geometry molecular shape. One of the most prominent usage of nitrites is that it is used as the useful component for food preservation. They have a strong ability to work as an antagonist against the bacteria that is why it is used in the process of curation of meat. It keeps the bacteria away from the meat and also have effect of turning the meat into reddish color.

            "answer_text": "Nitrite and nitrate are anions, negatively charged ions. Nitrite is NO2-, while nitrate is NO3-. Nitrites are ionic compounds composed of a cation (a positively charged ion) and nitrite. An example of this is sodium nitrite, NaNO2, used as a meat preservative and as part of an antidote to cyanide poisoning. (source) Nitrates are ionic compounds composed of a cation and nitrate. One example, sodium nitrate is used in solid propellants or fertilizers. (source) \u201cNitrates and nitrites are used in cured meat products, to control the growth of microorganisms, particularly to avoid the development of Clostridium botulinum, and also to serve as color and flavor fixatives. When added to meat, nitrate and nitrite react with the myoglobin and hemoglobin present in the trapped red blood cells, eventually producing nitric oxide myoglobin. After curing, almost all the nitrate and nitrite have reacted with the meat components, and only a very small residual amount of nitrite remains. The FDA allows the use of sodium nitrite in smoked cured fish products (from 10 to 200 \u03bcg /g) and in meat-curing preparations (< 200 \u03bcg/g, mixed with sodium nitrate, FDA 172.175). In the stomach, nitrite can produce dangerous carcinogenic nitrosamines; however, these reactions are inhibited in the presence of phenolic antioxidants, ascorbic acid, or other substances that are also added to food or are present in fruit and fresh vegetable juices that may be consumed with the cured meat. Furthermore, nitrite is naturally present in saliva, in concentrations higher than those found in cured meat products, and lettuce, spinach, beets, and many other vegetables contain nitrate, which is reduced in the mouth to nitrite by the action of bacteria. Therefore, the risks associated with the use of nitrate and nitrite in cured fish and meat products seem to be very small, whereas the benefits are large.\u201d (G. Ramis-Ramos, in Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003) ",
