            "answer_text": "Displacement reaction is where a much reactive element displace another from it\u2019s compound.You can see which one\u2019s more reactive than the other via the reactivity series-  In short,Potassium is able to displace all the metals below it,and the corresponding next next elements can displace the other metals below it.Gold is the least reactive and can never displace another element from it\u2019s compounds.Here is the equation of a displacement reaction:  If you look at this equation, you can see that the Cl and Br have swapped places. chlorine + sodium bromide \u2192 sodium chloride + bromine Cl2(aq) + 2NaBr(aq) \u2192 2NaCl(aq) + Br2(aq) [Balanced] Redox reaction is a reaction where both oxidation and reduction takes place.Oxidation is the gaining of oxygen and loss of electrons,and reduction is the loss of oxygen and the gaining of electrons.You could remember it as O I L R I G- Oxidation Is Loss of electrons,Reduction Is Gain of electrons.  Taking into the account of the previous example,the halogen chlorine is more reactive than the halogen bromine.Sodium gains electrons from Chlorine and gets reduced to Sodium Chloride and Chlorine becomes oxidised by losing its electrons. In other words,yes,displacement reactions are always redox since there is always an an exchange of electrons/charges. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, a single displacement reaction is also a redox reaction as it is always accompanied by oxidation-reduction.Example-1  2 KI + Cl2 = 2KCl + I2In this reaction, the more electronegative chlorine displaces iodine from its salt, potassium iodide. Chlorine is reduced from zero state to -1, and iodine is oxidised from -1 state to zero. Example-2 Zn + H2SO4 = ZnSO4 + H2Here, zinc is oxidised to +2 state from zero state, and hydrogen is reduced to zero state from +1 state. Zinc is more electropositive than hydrogen, and so it displaces hydrogen from the acid. In a simple displacement reaction, one of the reactants is always an element and it has to undergo either oxidation or reduction in the course of displacing another element from the latter\u2019s compound. Hence, such a reaction is invariably a redox reaction. On the other hand, double displacement reactions like precipitation reactions are non-redox in character. ",
