            "answer_text": "Q: Can a scientist invent things? A: This is Lev Sergeyevich Theremin:  He worked in a lot of fields, including x-ray diffraction in crystals, radio, and the relative permittivity in gasses. While doing this science, he invented the motion detector (using changes in the relative permittivity in gasses in a high-frequency electric field) as well as a passive radio listening device called \u201cThe Thing\u201d, which the Soviets used to bug the US ambassador\u2019s office for years. The Thing eventually led to the invention of RFID, although not by Lev (or L\u00e9on) Theremin. But the thing (hah!) that Lev Theremin is most famous for is the theremin, the first electronic musical instrument, possibly the only one with no moving parts, the staple of horror movie music from the 1950s and 1960s, and the theme of the Midsomer Murders.
