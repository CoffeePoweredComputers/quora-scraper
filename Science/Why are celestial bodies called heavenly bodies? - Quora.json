            "answer_text": "If they are being referred to as the same thing, it means the who ever said that essentially believed that \u201cHeaven\u201d is a planet or some extraterrestrial object (Or something like that). This is because of the three definitions: Celestial Bodies: Objects that exist in space, such as the moon, the sun or Earth. Heavenly Bodies: A being which exists in \u201cHeaven\u201dAn object which is in our atmosphere or the skyAnother reason why they would say they are the same thing is because the planets are above us (sometimes). I would say they are more celestial bodies though. I hope this helped, bye! ",

            "answer_text": "Celestial bodies are object existing in space, especially a planet, star (e.g. the Sun), or a satellite (e.g. the moon). Heaven, on the other hand, refers to the sky, firmament, or expanse of space surrounding the earth. Since the planets, stars, and their satellite are all in the heavens that is seemingly above us, it's safe to say they are heavenly bodies. ",
