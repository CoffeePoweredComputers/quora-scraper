            "answer_text": "Being oversensitive leaves you exposed to upset and stress. I like the fact that they care about equality and the earth. I am sceptical of the way they band together instantly to declare something or somebody \u201cunacceptable\u201d, often with no understanding of the context - for example Mark Twain, not that they will have read him when they are so busy listening to Cardy B or someone else who I personally find offensive. I am also worried that they do not think for themselves but follow the trends proffered by the Influencers and social media in their lives. It is OK if we are different. I don't have to like cross dressers but yes it's wrong to beat them up. I don't have to hate the Black and White Minstrels but I do. Gaslighting? We use electric. Memes? Cultural values and mores passed down. Icons? In churches. Yes the language is annoying. If you suggest something is immodest you are \u201cslutshaming\u201d. If you honestly can\u2019t tell what ethnic background someone is you are \u201cprejudiced\u201d. If you like wearing a Vietnamese rice hat to keep the sun off you are \u201cappropriating\u201d. \u201cFatshaming\u201d, \u201ctransphobia\u201d etc etc\u2026Toeing the party line and imposed conformity reminds me of the \u201cShunning\u201d which goes on among the Mennonites and Amish. PS I am not one of those who despises the youth and wears a teeshirt saying \u201csnowflakes don't last long in Texas\u201d. I like to think I am tolerant, it is the intolerance of the yoof which offends ME. God bless \u2018em. ",

Perfect example\u2026when President Trump was elected (thank God)we all remember that crazy person who fell on their knees and cried and screamed like a demon possessed!!. Truely a disturbing sight\u2026I hope she continues to receive the psychiatric help she needs\u2026. ",
