            "answer_text": "We can see in this report, that the original method from Raikov himself, does work:  This reportage which was made about 50 years ago . Raikov tells that people need to go to him about 30 times! The guy who is playing Piano is in a very deep hypnotic trance. The guy who plays violin says that he\u2019s been there for 9 years! Now a days, some companies release products under the name of Raikov. They call it \u201cThe new Raikov Method\u201d and use some NLP. If that really works? I still do not know! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Raikov effect refers to a person's ability to mimic and take on the mindset of another person. For example, by pretending and acting like Albert Einstein, we can take on his mindset and access his way of thinking\u201d, as per a Google statement. This only works if you are nude in the pale moonlight and click your ruby red sequined slippers together at the heels three times. ",
