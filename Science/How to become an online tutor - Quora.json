            "answer_text": "If you are an expert in a subject or good at teaching, online tutoring may just be for you. Many companies offer you jobs as online tutor. Some of them are quite well known like Chegg, Coursehero, Matr, Cuemath, Vedantu etc. You can also start online teaching through sites like Udemy or you can consider starting your own youtube channel for teaching a specific subject. However, sources like Udemy, Unacademy or Youtube don't give you the satisfaction of live interaction with your students. If you are someone who enjoy the thrill of teaching live and interacting with your students, and monitoring them regularly I would recommend Cuemath to you. With over 5000 centers, Cuemath is one of India's largest educational venture. It specialises in teaching Math to school going students from grades UKG to 10, with both offline and online centres. While the online centres caters to needs of students from across the globe, offline centers cater to the needs of the centre's neighborhood. According to a rough estimate, over 75% of school children go for tuition in Math, so the potential of Cuemath's growth is rich. Both students and teachers log into the online portal for their class. The class is moderated by Cuemath. They have their scientifically designed learning plan and lessons unlock accordingly. However, to qualify as an online teacher you will have to go through an in house screening test and training separately. Further, one needs to have a successful physical center running. The set up of offline centre is a low cost and hassle-free process as I will discuss here. Cuemath has grown exponentially since its inception just six years back. One of the main reasons for its success, apart from its well researched curriculum and world class content is that the amount of investment required to start a centre is very low. There is just a one time fee of Rs. 7000 which one needs to make for buying a math box, which is an essential tool for conducting the classes. Apart from this, you need to purchase a tablet (if you don't have one) to conduct your classes. Considering the investment, earning potential is great. Most teacher partners giving as little as 3 to 4 hours a day, earn as much as 40000 rupees a month. It is important to keep in mind that your earning, depends on the time and effort you put in. The physical centres are run on a franchise model, with the teacher and Cuemath sharing both responsibilities and earnings. A dedicated team is present 24\u00d77 to respond to all your queries and troubleshoot any business related problem. Besides, they also help in digital marketing of your centre. As for earnings, they are shared in a ratio of 60:40,with teacher retaining 60% of the share. Your share is transferred to your account in a timely manner and you get regular account statements from the finance team. They have recently entered the arena of online tutoring and are already doing great. Teachers are happy, so are the parents and students. You can read a few parent and teacher testimonials to know how satisfied they are of Cuemath. So, whether you are a parent looking for a great maths tutor for your kid or a teacher looking out for opportunity in online teaching, Cuemath can address all your concerns.

            "answer_text": "For years, whenever people wanted to earn some additional income, the easiest thing to do would be to turn to tutoring. If you were good at something, you could easily pass the knowledge onto someone else, right? Well, today\u2019s no different, except for the fact that technology has evolved and you now get to teach people online, as well, and not only in person. In some ways, it\u2019s a lot easier because you can do it from the comfort of your home, have a lot of resources available to you at all times, and can work through a variety of online learning platforms.  Now, with that in mind, what exactly do you need to do become an online tutor? Decide what it is that you want to teach other people. Are you good at a certain language? Do you want to teach people how to be more productive? Sit down and write down what you know you are the best at and then use that to come up with the concept of your online classes.Brush up on the skills you\u2019re going to use. Before you go out and start offering your knowledge to the rest of the world, you might want to polish it a bit. Unless you\u2019re already working as a teacher somewhere and are using these skills on a daily basis, this is not a bad idea!Find an online tutoring platform on which you\u2019ll offer your classes. Luckily, there\u2019s a whole variety of them out there, so you don\u2019t have to worry about whether or not you\u2019ll find the right one for you. Some of the most popular platforms are definitely Udemy, Coursera, Lynda, Zeqr, and SkillShare. They have their similarities, but also differences, so it\u2019s important to go through them carefully and choose which one would be the best fit for you.Register on your platform and create a class. Once you\u2019ve picked out the tutoring platform of your choice, you\u2019re going to want to create an account and your very first class. It might take some time for you to get students, but it\u2019s important not to give up!Of course, if you already have students and don\u2019t want to work with a platform, you can choose to become an independent tutor. This is the most difficult path, seeing that it\u2019s harder to get new students this way, and it takes a lot of dedication on your part. This is a good choice for someone who\u2019s already been tutoring for a while and is looking to separate themselves from a platform. So, there you have it! Hope you\u2019ll manage to find some great tutoring jobs soon enough and kick off your career! :) ",

This step-by-step guide may come in handy for you as it will help you understand better how to start your online tutoring journey without facing any hiccups and why you should embrace technology to move forward. 1. Initial Planning: Do not venture into online tutoring blindly without a concrete plan in place. From the choice of subject to the kind of students you want to teach, to even the time you want to spend teaching \u2013 everything needs to be planned. 2. Devise a Contract: It is a commitment by you to teach as it is for the learners and students to learn (and to pay you). 3. Go for an elearning tool: I would say that online tutoring has completely revolutionized the way teachers impart knowledge and reach out to their students.

            "answer_text": "To become an online tutor you should follow the few steps which will help you build a prominent career as an online tutor. So I recommend you the next steps: Determine your requirements which means that you need to find different and clear aspects, prerequisites, pros and cons of the online tutoring business before starting. Know your audience or in other words define your potential customer (age, gender, location, their needs, etc). The more details the better. Choose your subject. Maybe, the most important point in this list. I think you already know your strengths and have decided what you want to teach others. Prepare the materials that will help up teach students (books, articles, video, etc). Choose an online platform to promote your services and find students. This point is also very important although, at first glance, it seems not so important and difficult. There is a demand for online education that every year significantly grows, but the tutor doesn\u2019t have any conducted lessons. That\u2019s why you need to take some time and do deep research on online educational marketplaces and define where it\u2019s better to work and find students. 2 years ago I studied applied mathematic at university and had some spare time to make money. This is how I became a teacher, not for so long time but it was really unforgettable experience. I had been teaching math on Preply. I was lucky because in this field there was not so big competition but and demand was not so high as desired. I had earned not big money nevertheless, it was a good additional income to make livings at that time. ",

I live in Austin, Texas, which has 3 colleges that I regularly taught students of. ACC, UT, and St. Edwards. I find that you make the most money in person as a tutor for middle school-college students working on common subjects such as math, calculus, statistics, physics, chemistry etc\u2026 To start out use a site called university tutor with a premium $20/month account, I had the best students from that site, and their form forces people to give you relevant information early on so that you will spend less time figuring out what their needs are and schedule with 90% of people who contact you. The contact system will also email or send a message to your phone so that you can reply immediately, the first responder normally gets the gig and you only need so many weekly students to fill your schedule. You can also advertise on Craigslist but I had worse clients from Craigslist, they would call and ask questions and not schedule as frequently, they would ask for discounts, etc\u2026 I was making $30 an hour after I established myself because I would teach college kids engineering classes and math on campus, very efficient for me, schedule everything back to back on campus.

            "answer_text": "Easiest way to go about tutoring is still partnering with some company with their big marketing bucks - taking care of finding you students. And tipping your toe into freelancing when already established some client base. Simple googling gives you results on what market lead tutoring agencies pay their tutors. For example Chegg lists their hourly salary around $20/hour. Number one agency teaching English to the Asian market - VipKid - says their salaries fall between $14 and \u20ac22/hour. So you don\u2019t really have a choice there. However, what students are willing to pay depends on the specific economic region and purchasing power. Some averaging $60+/hour in New York. There are platforms, fortunately, allowing tutors more flexibility, where their hourly rates are more free. One giving tutors total freedom in setting their own hourly rates - Tutor.id. Working locally, you could earn a lot more working in New York or Los Angeles with Tutor.id than under a fixed-salaried agency. Another one I\u2019d suggest looking into is MyTutorLab, where your salary depends on your education level and teaching experience, leaving you more wiggle room. Although their current market seems to be limited to Florida and LA. Here\u2019s an article covering the most important questions to ask yourself if you\u2019re thinking of becoming an online tutor, what salary to expect and from where to start - How to become an online tutor and start earning within hours | Tutor.id I hope this gives you, aspiring tutors, some clarity on the next steps towards starting your tutoring hustle.

Coming to the question, You'll need to sign up on websites like, MyprivateTutor, BharatTutors, Tutorindia.net, as an online tutor, first create a profile listing the subjects or classes you want to teach. You'll need to add the experience you have, your qualifications and further required information. Once approved, You'll have to take an online test or give a telephonic interview (not sure) to get selected. If academic tutoring is not your cup of tea, portals like Udemy let you have your own virtual classroom for anything that can be taught. You can earn 100 to 200 Rupees per hour (Depends on your experience). If you are expert in it then it may also increase to 500. Hope this helps. Share the knowledge and get the knowledge. Happy and keep learning. Thanks. Regards, Rahul Sargam (\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0938\u0930\u0917\u092e) . ",
