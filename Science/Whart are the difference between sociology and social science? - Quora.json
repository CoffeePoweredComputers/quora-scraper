            "answer_text": "You would have to be more specific with regard to what other social sciences you are referring to. But basically sociology focuses more on groups rather than the individual. A lot of it is about statistics and perhaps how a community might respond to or affect an individual. It also does have a tendency to lean just a little bit more to the communal aspect of things. If you would like further clarification please let me know, but again I would need a little bit more information. Are you looking for a breakdown of sociology versus psychology, sociology vs. social work, etc? Please be sure to tag me directly if you'd like more information from me. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a complex question with no clear answer possible. It is quite impossible to give a clear definition of sociology to begin with. How would you define a science ? Through its object ? Sociology is the study, not of society itself, but of the \u201cfait social\u201d or \u201csocial facts\u201d, and about studying the social as something, as defined by Durkheim. It is supposed to differ from its cousin, social psychology, in that it does not study the an STATES really, it studies what, in French, we call \u201crapports\u201d, or \u201clinks\u201d, in that they are dynamic. I\u2019d say what differs between sociology and social psychology should thus be the fact that social psychology tries to study an influence of the mind on the social, or of the social on the mind, and thus studies STATES (ie, this situation makes the social organization of the group go from state A to state B), while sociology does not try to build actual causal relationships because it tries to make sense of dynamical systems of relationships. However, as you can see, this is unclear where to draw the line. There\u2019s also the problem that linguistics kind of does this through\u2026 sociolinguistics, and a lot of anthropology is basically sociology with another set of ressources and another set of paradigm.
