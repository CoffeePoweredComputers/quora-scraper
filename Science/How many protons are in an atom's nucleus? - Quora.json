            "answer_text": "The number of protons present in any atom nucleus is equal to its \u201cAtomic number(Z)\u201d. Electrons are present outside the nucleus in an orbit and are equal to number of proton in any neutral atom, so they can be easily removed or added to any neutral atom. Atom acquire positive charge when number of proton is greater than electron due to loss of electron,on the other hand atom acquire negative charge when number of electron is greater than proton due to gain of electron.

            "answer_text": "It all depends on the atom of interest. All the atoms are named by the number of protons which they contain in their nucleus, they are also grouped in the periodic table of elements according to the atomic number (Z). For example, the Hydrogen atom contains one proton hence it is the first element, Helium contains 2 protons and is therefore the second element in the periodic table and so on... ",
