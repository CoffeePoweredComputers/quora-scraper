            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a bit of yin and yang to the sci-fi and fantasy genres, isn\u2019t there? They\u2019re not related by accident. They aren\u2019t just the two genres that happen to be about things that are not real. No, there is some ouroboros, some magnetic dipole in the relationship, two things bound up in their opposites. It comes down to this: science fiction is a speculative literature of ideas, while fantasy is mythologizing self-expression. They are not mutually exclusive, but they are difficult to combine. The medieval and folkoric aesthetic of fantasy, and the technological aesthetic of sci-fi, are less fundamental to the genres than the italicized points I just mentioned. Sci-fi, fundamentally, is about taking an idea and then creating a context where that idea can reach full maturity. A good science fiction novel demonstrates an idea in precisely the same way that a physicist would demonstrate a law of physics using a hypothetical, but fictionalized. For example, take Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune. The driving idea behind Dune, it seems to me, is the limits of human potential: what can discipline allow a human being to do? How far can intense focus and self-denial take a person? Dune is full of people who are nearly superhuman, because Herbert created a context where the idea of discipline stretching the limits of human potential could reach full maturity. Herbert\u2019s universe spans thousands of years and multiple planets, and it\u2019s full of conflict, not scale for the sake of scale but to allow his primary idea to reach its highest point. What sort of universe would contain people who are nearly superhuman as a result of honing their potential scientifically? It would take thousands of years and huge swathes of space, and it would take bafflingly complex internecine wars and economic conflict to provide the \u201cDarwinian\u201d backdrop against which humans would be driven to make themselves as powerful as possible. Herbert\u2019s universe is deliberately constructed to create a context where human potential would be stretched to its limit, to give the underlying idea as much room as possible to stretch out and ramify into its full maturity. It is no different from Einstein day-dreaming that he\u2019s riding on a beam of light to demonstrate the principles of relativity.  That, by the way, is the key with sci-fi, and it\u2019s the reason why literary snobs often don\u2019t take science fiction seriously: the story, the characters and their motivations, the drama, are all secondary. Really, the story is just there to demonstrate the underlying idea. All of the psychological depth and personal resonance that is primary in \u201cserious\u201d literature takes a back seat in science fiction because sci-fi is a speculative literature of ideas first, and everything else second. Science fiction simply doesn\u2019t do the same thing that other literature does, although I think that Dune, at least, belongs in the canon with all the rest. Fantasy is a mythologizing self-expression \u2014 what J.R.R Tolkien called mythopoiesis \u2014 because the point of fantasy is to place an archetypal and mythological significance on whatever is of importance to the author. Like science fiction, fantasy does not do the same thing as other literature, but it is nevertheless a far more personal genre because it\u2019s not about ideas. Tolkien created an imaginary world to provide a mythological significance to the history and culture of Germanic peoples. There is already a Germanic mythology, of course, so Tolkien\u2019s work is, from one perspective, a rehabilitation of Nordic mythology. C.S. Lewis created his fantasy world to do the same thing for Christianity. Michael Ende wrote The Neverending Story as a means of mythologizing Anthroposophic thought. In each case, it\u2019s a matter of creating a mythology as a kind of self-revelation, a lifting of the curtain and showing the bare libidinal motions of one\u2019s deepest values. It would behoove me to say something about the significance of myth here. Mythology is not necessarily religion (many of the ancient Greeks did not literally believe in their gods), nor is it a set of fairy tales. Myth takes certain characters and events as convergence points, themes that are deeply important to a certain group of people. Superman, for example, is basically a character of American mythology; he\u2019s a symbol of hope, pure-hearted goodness, justice, and strength. What could possibly be more American than Superman? If you take everything that is important in the American self image and distill it down to its brass tacks, then stack it up in a fictional character, you get something very much like Superman. That\u2019s the significance of myth. Myth is a bare essence, if you\u2019re comfortable with that word, of something significant to a group of people. The mythopoietic nature of fantasy is that it takes whatever is most important to the author and demonstrates it, not intellectually or by way of explanation but by brute, gut-level emotional expression, in such a way that the values of the author can become important to everyone who reads the author\u2019s work. How many people have developed an appreciation for Nordic myth from reading Tolkien? Or even if they haven\u2019t, how many people have read Tolkien and then felt the same way about The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien felt about Beowulf? That\u2019s the key. If you read Tolkien and are moved by the strange sadness and vastness of Middle-Earth, then you are experiencing the same feelings that Tolkien had about Nordic myth, and you understand how he felt because now you\u2019ve felt that way, too. I said before that fantasy and science fiction are not mutually exclusive, and I think that there are cases where the lines blur. I\u2019m not talking about goofy steampunk novels with magical machine guns or whatever \u2014 that is just a vulgar merging of aesthetics that misses the underlying point. Again, I think that a better example is Dune. I speculate that Frank Herbert was awestruck by the possible futures that lay ahead of the human race, by the ways in which we could develop our potential, and Dune mythologizes this feeling by causing us to feel the same way. \u201cDude, the Bene Gesserit are so cool! I wonder if people could really do that?\u201d Herbert pulls back the curtain on himself by pulling back the curtain on possible future worlds. I further speculate that Herbert was the kind of person to whom ideas mattered a great deal, so the line between science fiction and fantasy blurs here. And for that matter, Tolkien\u2019s Elves are perhaps a bit of science fiction in Middle-Earth, inasmuch as the Elves are some idea that is given maximal room to come to maturity in Tolkien\u2019s universe. Of course, Tolkien was a different fellow from Herbert and his ideas are, as a rule, blurrier, more emotive and archetypal, more like misty watercolors than blueprints, but there is a bit of sci-fi in fantasy as well. As to how they\u2019re related \u2014 well, I think that writing fantasy does something different for the author than writing science fiction. But the best science fiction approaches fantastic mythopoiesis, and the best fantasy approaches the full and total development of ideas. Dune is a sci-fi novel that approaches the grandeur of myth, and The Lord of the Rings is a fantasy novel in which fictional races, languages, and cultures are allowed to flourish and decline just the way ideas do in science fiction. One last word. It seems to me that many fantasy worlds are really just science fiction with a medieval aesthetic. If you\u2019re reading a fantasy novel where there are definite rules for magic, and wizards use scientific research to figure out the best way to tap into the mana channels or whatever, then you\u2019re really just reading a sci-fi novel set in a medieval world, and the wizards are just physicists in pointy hats. Conversely, some science fiction is really just fantasy. What is Star Wars but George Lucas\u2019 vaguely New Age worldview, mythologized? What are the Jedi and Sith but good and bad wizards using a completely unexplained and mysterious Force? There\u2019s nothing \u201cscientific\u201d about it, and it\u2019s not meant to demonstrate some underlying idea, like an example given by a philosopher. Star Wars is not science fiction at all, but fantasy. Okay, you guys owe me for this one. If you can find a better compare and contrast piece on sci-fi and fantasy than this one, I will eat my hat.

            "answer_text": "To the layman, the difference is something like \u201cin fantasy, you say that the speculative elements come from magic or gods; in scifi, you say that the same storytelling device comes from technology, biology, etc. \u2018Cosmic energies\u2019 can go either way.\u201d That\u2019s fine if we\u2019re talking about the hard definition of the sub-genres, but I find it rather irritating the more I hear it, because I like to think of sci-fi and fantasy as proper genres as well. I put it this way: Science Fiction wants you to think. Fantasy just wants you to feel. Of course, all fiction plays with your emotions a little bit, because otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be entertaining. But \u2018hard\u2019 scifi like After Man has the distinction of being very cold and impersonal, whereas fantasy is ALL about making you feel things. Here are some notable examples of the genres and some funny exceptions to them:  Unlike the Thor movies, which are Fantasy movies that throw in scifi elements and buzzwords because the producers are ashamed to be making a Fantasy movie, the Doctor Strange movie is a rare example of Sci-Fantasy that is Fantasy on the surface, but has a scientific sentiment throughout. It imagines how an intelligent and skeptical person would react to irrefutable proof of the supernatural, and unlike the ghost movie cliche where the token skeptic exists only to be proven wrong and then killed, Dr. Strange not only accepts the new reality, but masters it though the intellect that initially caused him to deny it. It\u2019s a movie where the hero beats the bad guy, not by whacking him a bunch with sparkly effects or \u201cfinding inner strength/faith/hope/etc\u201d, but by having a great idea and trapping the bad guy with theoretical physics.  Here\u2019s an easy one. Inception is absolutely Science Fiction. It has a very emotional center, but the movie is peppered with philosophical/scientific debates, musings on the nature of emotion and existence, and plays around a lot with the logic of the speculative elements. It\u2019s very satisfying and very scifi.  And another easy one, in probably the most stereotypical modern Fantasy story/setting ever. The Lord of the Rings is about friends and strangers going on a perilous journey that will test the limits of their physical and emotional endurance. The speculative elements are there to enhance that feeling, and they do it pretty well.  I know it\u2019s cliche to bring up this series when talking about the difference between scifi and fantasy, but it\u2019s a great example. Star Wars is about some wizards/samurai getting into sword fights over control of an empire. That story is pure Fantasy, and just because the setting is \u201cspace\u201d doesn\u2019t make it any less Fantasy. The plot lines involve a little bit of the philosophy of martial arts and morality, but are primarily about the interpersonal relations and personal emotional and moral journeys of a small handful of characters. In other words, Star Wars wants you to feel things more than think, which gives it the spirit of a Fantasy story. The only reason Star Wars is considered science fiction is that there are spaceships instead of wooden ships and wagons and horses, energy weapons instead of historical(-ly inspired) weapons and \u201caliens\u201d and \u201cdroids\u201d instead of \u201cfairies\u201d or \u201cmonsters\u201d or \u201cdemons\u201d or whatever, which are hard details usually associated with science fiction.  The inverse of Star Wars would be a story containing hard details normally labeled as Fantasy, but has that spirit of inquiry that makes Science Fiction what it is. That\u2019s pretty rare. Initially this was the first good example I could think of, but I decided to put Doctor Strange at the top because I figured it would get the answer more attention that way. In Ocarina of Time, Link has to learn a magical song that caused a windmill to break. The windmill is broken in the \u201cfuture\u201d setting, but not initially broken in the \u201cpast\u201d setting. After Link learns the song from the caretaker of the broken windmill in the future, he goes back in time and plays the song which breaks the windmill in the past, which is the cause of the caretaker learning the song and thus being able to teach it to Link in the future, which is the past from Link\u2019s perspective. Meaning, the Song of Storms has no beginning or ending in this time loop. This is a commonly proposed time paradox, a very trippy concept that causes the audience to think about things in a logical way, essentially a Scifi story, made possible by the Fantasy plot device of a magical musical instrument.  The Alien series is set in a Scifi setting, but is fundamentally about Horror stories. You could argue according to my definition above that this makes it Fantasy, but of course we consider Horror to be a different subject from Adventure and The Hero\u2019s Journey, which is the kind of story we associate with Fantasy. Horror is about being scared, and Alien\u2019s solution is to use scientifically plausible ideas in lieu of magic and mysticism, because a believable horror sinks into you deeper than Fantasy Horror.  So those are all the most interesting examples I can think of, but essentially I think there is no \u201cline\u201d dividing Sci-Fi and Fantasy. The thing that\u2019s really important about the genres is applicable to either label and it would be interesting to see more deviations from the norm. ",
