            "answer_text": "Is electricity really just well organized lightning? Lightning is just an example of electricity. A voltage is created due to migration of charge between top and bottom of a large thundercloud, and a current flows as a result of this voltage. This is no different in principle from the voltage created by a battery migrating charge between its terminals, causing current to flow through a circuit. The significant difference is in our ability to control electricity in a battery powered circuit. The migration of charge within a cloud is caused by the weather, and the creation of a conductor through the air to carry the current of a lightning bolt is caused by an extremely large voltage, which separates electrons from air molecules to create charge carriers. The lightning bolt discharges the cloud, and charge then has to migrate within the cloud again to build up sufficient voltage before another bolt can occur. Conversely with a circuit we can create the voltage at will, and continuously in spite of current flowing. We also have control of the current size and location by using conducting materials, which inherently contain charge carriers without the need for a large voltage. It\u2019s this ability to control voltage and current in a circuit that initiated the modern era of electricity, allowing us to use electricity to do useful work for us. The key invention was the voltaic cell, aka the galvanic cell. This was the first battery, the invention of which was attributed to the Italian Alessandro Volta when he published his work in 1799. So back to the question, and rephrasing slightly, is our modern use of electricity just more organised than the electricity in lightning? Well yes I guess you could put it that way. Our control of modern electricity, controlling generation of voltage and the size and location of the resulting current, usually makes the result more organised than the uncontrolled electricity in lightning. Until of course we lose that control and sparks start flying!  Which of course serves to demonstrate that there\u2019s no fundamental difference between the two. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Both are two different subjects, altogether, except for a brief period in history (of a electrical nature), when Benjamin Franklin did interact with lightning, to prove his theory. His theory has stood the test of time, till physics and conductors and material behavior conspired to prove him wrong to the extent that electron flow is opposite to the positive > negative route he had postulated. Otherwise, we, humankind, would perhaps be happier if lightning, extreme weather conditions, also changing and making the world all that hotter, was conveniently wished to go away ? Electricity can be organized, more or less, from energy sources to utilization, through the flick of a switch. The switch to lightning is not in our control - even though our contribution to bring it to the present level of uncertainty is immense. Somewhere, along the line, we seem to have forgotten that we have only one world (to exist on, as of now) and left a harmonious co- existence only a possible dream. Anyway, have a better day ! ",

            "answer_text": "You could say that. If you were talking very high voltage DC electricity. The comparison in man made electricity is the arcing when an air break switch opens or the arcing in an arc furnace (when melting steel). Another man made example would be a Tesla coil discharge. Tesla coil - Wikipedia Most of mans use of electricity is pretty much controlled without the big flashy arc displays that Mother Nature puts on. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for the A2A. I think only one answer of the four now available is a no so I'll just weigh in for the good cause. I'm not english mother tongue, so I don't know whether there are some subtler meanings or conventions about the word, but \u201celectricity\u201d is the same as \u201celectrical phenomenon\u201d, a loose description of something involving electrical forces. Sure enough, lightning is an electrical phenomenon, but an electrical phenomenon is not necessarily a lightning. For instance, electro-plating is an electrical phenomenon, joule effect (i.e. heat production in wires where charges flow), are both electrical phenomena, i.e. \u201celectricity\u201d, but have nothing to do with lightning.
