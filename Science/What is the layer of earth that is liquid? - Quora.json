            "answer_text": "The only major layer of the earth that's liquid is the outter core, which is basically metal with the same composition of the inner core (mainly nickel and iron) but molten instead of solid. All the other major layers above and below it are though to be solid. It is, therefore, a misconception that the earth is mostly molten rock, or lava. Of course, if you consider the hidrosphere as a layer, then there is that one too.  The asthenosphere, which is the portion of the mantle below the lithosphere, is a deformable solid which \"flows\" over geologic time, but is not a liquid. In between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere, however, there is a small layer which is called the Low-velocity zone which contains liquid rock, although the degree of melting is probably in the order of magnitude of 1% (meaning, 1% of the rock is molten, and 99% of it is solid. So you can't properly call this a liquid layer either, it's simply a layer which contains liquid). ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm seems like all the \u201clayers\u201d have liquid in them. Rain in the air, water on the surface, lava and magma at some places just under the surface and in volcanoes, water and oil underground we drill holes to get, more molten rocks under that and various forms of liquid stuff all the way down to molten iron in the center. It is as many things are, more nuanced than a simple has or doesn\u2019t. ",
