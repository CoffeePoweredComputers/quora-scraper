            "answer_text": "We will never really run out. There will always be some petroleum or natural gas left on Earth, but the cost of recovering it will continually increase. The best analogy that I can give to this matter is that of a sponge that has been soaked in water and detergent. Try this at home with a large sponge and some dish-soap; you will find it instructive. The analogy is simplistic because, in reality there are multiple reservoirs in production at any given time but it is instructive. This simplification is necessary for the sake of clarity. When you first pick up the sponge, it is very easy to get soapy water out of it (lift it and soapy water runs out of it). Oil gushes out of the ground and is cheap, gasoline costs $0.25/gallon. At some point, you have to give the sponge a moderate squeeze to get soapy water out. This is analogous to primary recovery in a reservoir: you have to install a pump, and you have to actually do work to get the oil up out of the ground (gasoline just went up to $0.50/gallon). Pretty soon, you have to squeeze really hard to get more soapy water. This is analogous to stripper wells, which produce oil slowly. Gasoline now costs $1.00/gallon. So at some point, you can\u2019t squeeze hard enough to get one more drop of soapy water out, but you need more, and you have no more detergent, so you resort to soaking the sponge in some clear water, and squeeze again. Voila! you have more soapy water, although it is a little more diluted, so if you are washing dishes, you might have to scrub a little harder, or, you might use a bubbler/foam separation and collapse process to concentrate the detergent (this is laborious). This is akin to secondary recovery, where you inject water or gas to the reservoir in order to the reservoir in order to force the oil to flow more quickly towards the recovery well (the cost of gasoline just went up). Repeat the exercise with the sponge, and you will keep getting soapy water out of the sponge, but it will be increasingly more dilute, requiring more processing of the soapy water in order to make it useful. In the oil patch, this would be akin to thermal recovery or chemical addition, where you alter the physical properties of the remaining oil or bitumen in order to get more recovery. The product will require more wellhead separation equipment, will be more difficult to transport through pipelines and will require more processing at a refinery. The cost of gasoline went up again. At some point, you will be getting so little benefit out of extracting detergent from the sponge that you will just go to the store and buy another bottle of it, and you can start all over again. There is still a little bit of detergent in the sponge, though. This is much like an oil production company shutting in the wells in a reservoir and wildcatting to find a new one. There is a lot of oil still there, but they can\u2019t get it out cost effectively. We think of the detergent supply at the store as infinite: you don\u2019t normally think of ever being unable to find a bottle to buy, but it could happen. Even though we are still finding new petroleum and gas reservoirs, (and this will continue for a while) there is a finite amount of each of them on earth. We don\u2019t really know how much there is, but the supply is definitely finite, because nature is making more, but at a rate that is many orders of magnitude slower than our consumption rate. Natural gas generation is far more rapid than petroleum\u2019s, but is still dwarfed by our energy usage. So now, we have no outside source of detergent, but we REALLY need some. In our desperation, our calculus of how much effort is worth making to get just a little more detergent out of the sponge changes, so we try to get more out by maybe adding some alcohol to the water in which we soak the sponge once again. Of course, after we squeeze the mix out of the sponge, we will have to figure out how to concentrate the detergent and get the alcohol out of the mix. Oooof! that\u2019s a lot of effort for little return, but we gotta to do what we gotta do. The oil company, unable to find a new reservoir, and noticing that the demand for oil exceeds the supply remembers the old reservoir they shut in. They notice that now the price of oil is high enough to offset the higher cost of producing some of the remaining oil, so they do. So they start injecting surfactants and steam into the reservoir, increasing the costs of production and processing. Now the price of gasoline is $4.00. Even after all this, there will still be some detergent left in the sponge, and some oil left in the reservoir. The remaining amounts may be insignificant relative to our present and future energy needs, but nevertheless will approach zero asymptotically (ie; it will never really get there). ",

            "answer_text": "Anthony There is an actual question just not exactly what you are considering. I have read the previous entries but even they have not got the true sense of the future. Fuel, and this is everything from kerosene to gasoline, and as unlikely as this shall become will a new biological fuel. What then is the new car. What is the newest mode of transportation. What does the true future hold itself up for. NOTHING is our future mode of transport. Am I saying humanity is dead. No far from this. The old ones which were the hippy generation, have come almost full circle. Pure and deeply overcast today so I shall sit here and talk for a bit. You will begin to think of this as the \u201cend of times talk\u201d but not so. Ahead and ahead is always the next place to go. Lubricants as such are incredibly valuable. Yet which lubricant to use. Cosmolene or such as Silicone spray what will help and maintain almost any machine. We have the death obituaries of the dead horses which were never born because 7 billion people did not need a horse to guide them across their own universe every day and night. My own personal love was a 1967 Mustang. I was just 16 at the time. Working in a car wash was also lots of fun with so many companions just to make the car so super bright and nice. The future Anthony is what this about and not my own harping of past times of this or that. The past is almost ready to be dead. Everything is still related into Horse Power. This is now an antiquated system as Joules do have concepts. Prepare for the best because the new world does also begin again. Then will come the transition as cars line up at a fountain of bright lights with lots of available energy which comes out of an electric socket. In 5 minutes a battery recharges to 80 percent of capacity. Then what is required is the future to take a firm foot hold and never to look back. 400 kilometers is perhaps how far you would go and then find something like a road stop. They might even have lunches available inside. (if they have blueberry pie then have a slice for me also). You have a very large parking lot here> my vehicle is plugged into 47D. Do you require a 5 minute recharge or a full recharge. We do charge full price for coffee or tea, but soda pop is no longer sold here. The speaker turns on. The ovens are about to open all staff return to the kitchens now. When you pay then 47D will be turned on and not before. Anthony I show you the future because I can. Outrageous you say. This blueberry pie is exquisite. Please pay when served. 3 dollars electrics charges to 100 percent plus tea and our own very large piece of blueberry pies comes to 7 dollars. So you smile and so does everyone else at the table. May I please have the chefs home phone number because I would make her such a grand lover and to bring her to work each day would be glorious. I will ask HIM but he already has a very lovely affinity with another man. So I do believe Anthony that the question has now been maximized to the limit. ",
