            "answer_text": "There are two types of realities\u2014immaterial and material. Both are real and eternal. Both are required as darkness glorifies the light, and suffering glorifies the well-being. In other words, during night we crave for day, and vice versa; in rainy season we crave for summer; in suffering we crave for well-being. This is true of all pairs of opposites\u2014in small scale and in large scale. People swing between two opposites! This situation is required and it has to be so. The broader our perspective is the more firmly we would say the above. Imagine you are drinking a sweet juice. The more continuous your drinking is more diminishing will be its sweetness you feel. Now try this\u2014take a sip of juice, and eat two or three pieces of snacks or peanut, and again take a sip of juice and alternate the juice-drinking with snacks \u2026you will have the sweetness with each sip. That means opposite situations/feelings should alternate for life to be enjoyable. Now apply this in large scale. Infinity is a fact\u2014we have time, space, energy \u2026. If they remain as they are like infinite oceans, there is no fun, no charm. Energy should be transformed into various forms which brings beauty into universe. Light has meaning only when there is darkness. Consciousness has meaning only when there are things that are not conscious. So there should be spirit and matter. If spirit and matter remains as they are, then too there is no charm. They both should come in contact with each other. This lays the basis for all pairs of opposites. It\u2019s like you try to draw picture of a flower on any surface. After the completion of the painting, flower looks SOFT as its inherent feature is; yet while touching, it is as rough as the medium on which it is sustained. Your work is limited by the limitations of the medium you are using! Similarly, when Atma (spirit) comes in association with matter, it comes into a pair of opposites, which lays the ground for the appearance of a variety of pairs of opposites. Matter provides Atma pleasure which become pain in the end. Thus we have the situation where things come in pairs of opposites (such as pleasure-pain; happiness-sorrow; victory-defeat; day-night; life-death \u2026etc). One follows the other. History also comes in pairs of opposites, as an eternal cycle of two halves\u2014first half is earthly heaven and second half is earthly hell. This can be known from the very name, Duniya, by which this world is now called in many languages. DUNIYA is an interesting name. If you describe second half of a movie as boring, you obviously mean its first half was interesting. Similarly, if the second half of history is named as duniya [negative prefix + niya], it obviously mean first half of history was perfect, characterized by niya. To act with niya, in Arabic, means \u2018to act with loyalty and good faith, being led in righteousness\u2019 so naturally as though water flows downward. (Criminal Justice: Nomos XXVII edited by Ronald Pennock, John W. Chapman. page 58). Duniya means phase of history where people act mostly irrationally, as we find today polluting the air, water, and land as though cutting the branch one sits on. ",

            "answer_text": ">>>What is the nature of all things?<<< The nature-OF is synonymous with the existence-OF and is, unbeknownst to many, synonymous with the awarenesses-OF and with properties OF and with truths OF and with opinions-OF. It is all that our brain elicits, makes up, fabricates, FAKES - by, to, on, OF, from, about things - via an observation-process. The nature-OF is nondetectable, is - as such, it-self, on its own, in its own right individual, momentary, imaginaryiow non-universal, non real = immutabledoes not exist on its own iow can only be detectably uttered, proclaimed, asserted/exerted = symbolized, manifested, objectized, manifestedMy own, praeliminary listing of the \u201cnature-OF\u201d = thoughts = awarenesses = individual, momentary, imaginary inside brain effects = observed-HOODS = INFORMATIONS = properties fabricated by, to, on, OF, from, about Information-SOURCES (\u201cthings\u201d): All proclaimed sensations, emotions, problems, values (such as beauty and usefulness), ought-, should-, and must-HOODS, relevance, importance and necessity that is; meanings, intentions, purposes, desires-/ wills - and the respective counteremotions. Such as: Love and hate, appreciation and disgust, bright-NESS and dark-NESS.ALL proclaimed-, measurable parameters in the language of physics: MASS, distance, area, space, density, time, velocity, acceleration (gravity is an example), force, impulse, pressure, power, ENERGY, temperatureALL proclaimed numbers, Constants, Axioms, Fields in the language of physics. And all LAWS - of games, legislature, AND of logic, morality, physicsALL proclaimed G-Ds - such as YHWH, Jesus (THE) Christ, AllahThe imaginary (illusionary = non understandable) of a thought = an INFORMATION of a thingexistence = entirety of thoughts = entirety of INFORMATIONS of a particular thing (the nature of a thing that is)mind = entirety of thoughts = entirety of INFORMATIONS elicited in an individual brain at an instantfollows LOGICALLY from the consideration, that an INFORMATION is elicited, made up, fabricated INSIDE the brain: Yet, the brain will NEVER provide the INFORMATION, that any INFORMATION, as listed above, BE being elicited, made up, fabricated INSIDE the brain, inside it-self that is. It will rather provide the INFORMATION, that the INFORMATION be - ACCURATELY - located where the Information-SOURCE is physically located - outside the brain that is. In other words, the brain provides an illusion \u201cin order to make things right\u201d. This \u201cin order to\u201d is FAKE, it can be read as \u201cthe cause is the brain doing all that it does and the effect is survival\u201d - yet this assertion of \u201cin order to\u201d, it is called intentionality by Philosopher John Searle whom I admire and call INTELLIGENT for he\u2019s assertion!. To anyone who has a hard time to understand this last chapter, please consider an example: When you have a trauma on a limb, it is - beyond a shred of a doubt - your brain which is eliciting, making up, fabricating, faking the sensation which we proclaim as \u201cpain\u201d but it is not your brain which is \u201cin pain\u201d - no, it is accurately your limb. The information-SOURCE that is. BTW, did you ever learn about \u201cphantom sensations\u201d? Did you know that there is people who are having sensations on a missing limb, which limb they never had in the first place, due to malformation during embryogenesis? The human brain does not have the capacity of understanding existence: We do NOT understand HOW our brain allocates existence (imaginary inside brain effect) at the source of existence, its real outside-brain cause that is. Unfortunately people (nevertheless!) get angry about my listing. Not only are Theists angry at the proclamation that each and every PROCLAIMED G-D is elicited, made up, fabricated, FAKED by the brain, but certain \u201cScientists\u201d are trying to argue that any proclaimed parameter in the language of physics must exist as such, it-self, on its own, in its own rightbecause we can measure them very well if not even at the utmost precision. This is a non sequitur (Existence of a INFORMATION = property does not logically follow from the measurement of an INFORMATION = property) bcz any measurement is always an operation with things - it is only these things which DO exist and are being compared - one of them arbitrarily proclaimed for a \u201cstandard\u201d in the first place. The property at stake is NOT being discovered, detected, observed, on this occasion though - NOT as such, NOT it-self, NOT on its own, NOT in its own right",

            "answer_text": "A2A - What is the nature of all things? The nature of realityReality, whatever it is formed of, presents a persistent and consistent environment. Therefore, knowledge is possible. Knowledge of our environment provides information useful to us while we are embedded in our environment. Knowledge about reality, whatever it is formed of, does not necessarily provide useful information outside the framework of that reality. Reality includes an underlying physical perception. We perceive physical objects using our 5 senses. Furthermore, there are things that are intangible. For example: Beauty, Bravery, Brutality, Charity, Courage, Curiosity, Enthusiasm, Envy, Evil, Fear , Generosity, Goodness, Honesty, Honor , Hope, Humility, Jealousy , Kindness, Life, Loyalty, Patience, Sympathy, Talent, Tolerance, Trust, Warmth, Weakness, Wisdom, Amazement, Anger , Anxiety, Despair , Happiness, Hate, Joy , Love, Misery, Pain , Pleasure, Pride, Sadness, Satisfaction, Strength, Artistry, Awe, Belief, Faith, Forgiveness, Imagination, Luck, Mercy, Peace, Poverty, Truth, and Wealth. And though there are many, many more intangible objects, we find that they all are ideas or concepts existing in mankind\u2019s thoughts and may manifest themselves in mankind\u2019s deeds. ",

            "answer_text": "You ask what is the nature of all things. Thank you. What a wonderful question. One answer is in Genesis chapters 2 and 3. Another answer is in the Tao Te Ching: Naming is the origin of all particular things. The nature of all things is that each thing is separate from and exclusively not any other thing. Thus, in the world of things, a chair is not the rain, and I am not my coffee cup. This leads to some interesting situations. I cannot be a thing that I have, as I am not my coffee cup. Now, thinking about this, you think with your mind. Since you have a mind, you are not your mind. So, who has the mind that thinks it is you? This brings me back to Genesis 2\u20133. Our worldly mind separates all existence into separate things, and so it separates God as a separate thing. This is why we cannot see or find God, because \u201cI\u201d look always \u201cout there\u201d to find a God who is separated from \u201cme.\u201d That is the nature of all things. See what happens when you ask questions of deranged old men wandering the high valleys of Oregon? ",

In technical terms, Love is the class. Everything else is an object derived from that class. In short, Love is the blueprint of ALL that is, was and will be. Love is a timeless Truth- the Only Objective Truth. EVERYTHING ELSE(including time) is a setup of Love to experience Itself. All experience is based on duality, which Love uses to experience Itself.
