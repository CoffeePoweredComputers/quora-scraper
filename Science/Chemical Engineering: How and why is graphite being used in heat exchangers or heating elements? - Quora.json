            "answer_text": "Graphite materials are used in heat exchangers because they provide good refractory and mechanical properties but still maintain a high thermal conductivity.  Graphite heat exchangers provide excellent corrosion resistance to a wide variety of chemicals and are therefore commonly used in the following industries such as; chemical refining and processing, petrochemical, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, fertilizer, steel pickling, mining and metal finishing. Types of Graphite Heat Exchangers 1) Cubic Heat Exchangers Manufactured from a solid block of graphite with a square cross-section, the Cubic Block type heat exchangers is a simple design that is easy to maintain. The solid graphite block is kept in compression so this design is resistant to thermal and hydraulic shock as well as external loads.   Advantages No gaskets or cemented parts between flow channels.Resistant to thermal shockEasy cleaningshort channels simple dismantling and assembly2) Graphite Block Heat Exchangers  The main reason for employing Polybloc Graphite Block Heat Exchangers  is their great flexibility. Best described as a series of block heat exchangers staked together and installed in a shell, POLYBLOC\u00ae Heat Exchangers are modular which makes maintenance and expansion easy. Corrosive fluids contact only the impervious graphite blocks having complete resistance to all acids, alkalis and solvents with the exception of a few strong oxidizing agents. The POLYBLOC\u00ae steel shell can be lined with suitable material or furnished in alloy materials to resist practically all corrosives, thereby allowing handling of two corrosive fluids.    Advantages: Rapid replacement of damaged blocks due to compact modular designHigh thermal efficiency, flexible in design and Compact Easy maintenance (cleaning and block replacement are very simple / simple dismantling and assembly)Corrosive media can be used in both service and process sidesCapacity can be increased by adding block elements3) Polytube Graphite Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers ] Graphite shell and tube heat exchangers are used as heaters, coolers, condensers, falling-film coolers, evaporators and absorbers, especially in the treatment of: hydrolic acidsulphur acidhydroflouric acidphospheric acidchlorinated acidorganic and inorganic mediawaste acidscombustion gases   Advantages: Low pressure drops and high efficiencyLarge heat exchange areaExcellent resistant to stress and pressure surgesSpecial grades of tubes with higher strength and better corrosion resistance are availableThe units are easy to repair and bundles can be replaced",
