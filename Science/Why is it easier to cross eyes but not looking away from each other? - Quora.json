            "answer_text": "Your eyes are naturally pointed toward each other a tiny bit due to focusing on objects close and far. However, it is an oddity and also possibly harmful to use the outer muscles of your eyes to go the opposing direction as that is not the natural way they move. Once you do this, you are forming greater strength in the outer muscles and your eyes may become difficult to remain in good position after you train them to do other than what they naturally do. Unless this is a medical need, trying to look \u201cwall-eyed\u201d is not only difficult but could manage to change the natural musculature of your eyes to focus. Don\u2019t try this for fun. The problems in later life, if done to perfection, far outweigh any short term amusements. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Our eyes have to move in that way naturally (convergence; esodeviation, eyes turning inward) when focusing on things that are closer to us. So for reading, or looking at anything closer than 3\u20134 feet, our eyes have to turn inward to keep both eyes focused on the near object. That's not true for the eyes turning out (exodeviation, \u201cwall eye\u201d, exotropia). So pretty much only pathological conditions cause they eyes to exodeviate; it's not a natural condition like convergence. ",
