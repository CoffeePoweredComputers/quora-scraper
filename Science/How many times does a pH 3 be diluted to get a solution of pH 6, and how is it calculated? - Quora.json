            "answer_text": "First, it depends on what is in the solution. If it is a strong buffer at its pKa =3, dilution won\u2019t have much effect. If we assume it is a strong acid, such as HCl at a concentration of 10^-3 M, a thousand-fold dilution will bring you close to pH = 6, since each number on the pH scale represents a 10 fold change in hydrogen ion concentration pH = -log[H+] [math]-log 10^{-3} = --3 log 10 = 3, etc.[/math] But this is also a famous trick question in chemistry class. You are doing the dilution with pure water which always has a hydrogen ion concentration of 10^-7 M, not zero. These hydrogen ions add to the total. For this reason, a thousand fold dilution of HCl at a concentration of 10^-6 M does not produce a solution with [H+] = 10^-9 equal to pH 9, but pH = approximately 7. A precise solution to this problem is not as easy as it appears. It involves the solution of simultaneous equations, in this case the ion product of water and an equation balancing the charges of all ions. Kw = [H+][OH-] [H+] = [Cl-] + [OH-] I don\u2019t think this is part of the assignment, so the answer is probably 1000. Close enough. ",

            "answer_text": "If the pH of an acid solution is to increase by 1 unit it has to be diluted 10 times ie., 10^1 times. If the pH of an acid increases by 'n' units it has to be diluted to 10^n times. In the question to increase the pH of the solution from 3 to 6 it is to be diluted 10^3 times,. ie., 1000 times. To summarize the solution with pH=3 has to be diluted to 10^3 or 1000 times to get a solution of pH=6. Ok. ",
