            "answer_text": "Humans have many body parts including 206 bones and more than 600 muscles. Scientists discovered a new body part, a ligament in the knee now called anterolateral ligament. FULL ANSWER The anterolateral ligament knee ligament was found to play a crucial part in anterior cruciate ligament tears. New research is being done on the ligament.The skeletal system in the body is made up of 206 bones that are arranged in the axial skeletal system and the appendicular skeletal system. The axial skeletal system runs along the midline axis in the body and it is made up of 80 bones that include the skull, hyoid, auditory ossicles, ribs, sternum and vertebral column. The appendicular skeleton is made up of 126 bones that include the upper limbs, lower limbs, pelvic girdle and pectoral (shoulder) girdle.There are three types of muscle tissue (more than 600 muscles) in the body including skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle is the kind of muscle that helps to create movement in the body. The skeletal muscles make up 40 percent of a person's body weight. Cardiac muscle is involuntary muscle in the body and make up the muscles found in the heart cavity. Smooth muscle is also an involuntary muscle, but it makes up the walls of organs, blood vessels and respiratory passageways. ",

            "answer_text": "It is hard to answer because I don\u2019t know what exactly are you asking for. There are over 206 bones in our body, but they are compoded from 300 different pieces. Every piece has many parts. It has sides, angels, canals, holes, bumps and more. And then there is the inside part of the bone. So only there we go with circa 3000 names. Joints. Every joint has own name, couple of ligaments and burses. I counted about 500 names(parts). Muscles. In your body you can fing over 600 muscles, with their heads and parts. Each of them has their own start and end, but these are mostly bone parts. You can look an the inervation and find tons of cool stuff you can learn about it. Without histological study, we can say there are over 1000 parts. Capilars, nerves (over 3000) And finaly there are 79 organs. Every organ is special so it\u2019s hard to estimate the number. I assume that there could be about 2500 difeerent parts. Suma: over 10000 Hope I was helpful ",
