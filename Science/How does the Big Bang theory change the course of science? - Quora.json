            "answer_text": "How does the Big Bang theory change the course of science? First by the way this perferred by the logical scientific establishment theory can be used as a devise to ridicule, control mindsets and thus close avenues of potential investigational and experimental means to derive other theories conflicting with the Big Bang Theory and to further by an upheld deference to it's mechanistic, Newtonian underlying workings throw into question all other possiblities which ate not grounded in Newtonian form. It requires the younger up and coming scientist to agree with it's mechanistic logical premise or potentially be snubbed by the majority, to be viewed as naive or illogical in thought. A stirct adherence is created which thwarts any area's of possiblity to be looked into at odds with this majority believed theory or other concepts not conforming to this same standard. Second, a variance is likely in the mathematical underlying form of the theory. It exists in the form of the motion of the expanding Universe and it's constant relationship to gravity coinciding with an expansion of the Universe, gravity at all points minutely changes as the Universe expands, therefor gravity is not a constant but a variable which must be measured in compliance and with precision against this expansion. So to conclude, the course of science is diverted by the stranglehold of self created biases and a new gravitational model based on it's underlying inadequacies is just one of the possiblities hindered by it's almost religious-like expected adherence to, by what should be a fully open minded scientific community.

            "answer_text": "It changes everything we know about, well\u2026 everything. It says, in laymen terms, the universe was made from a break in logic (which is logic, also called a singularity) which means that matter is made from nothing. This was a incredible idea, because that was the second? idea that allowing matter to be made from nothing. (I do not know the other property name but I\u2019ll explain what it is at the bottom) This means that we could be from something deciding to be something. (A poetic event, or something like that. I suck at English, so let me know what the proper word is if you want) Basically, it means that their could be a \u201cGod\u201d or something that created itself from nothing. So the property that I don\u2019t know the name of, sorry, is about matter popping into existence with the exact clone but with it\u2019s negative matter version. This has been theorist for a decade from pops of power in empty space, then we did a experiment in a vacuum that proved the theory. I\u2019m sorry for the lack of a detailed explanation on this, but I haven\u2019t been able to find it for years. ",
