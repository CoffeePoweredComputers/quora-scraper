            "answer_text": "You\u2019d maybe think \u201cnot much\u201d other than some obvious letters, but there is a difference. First, lets address the spelling issue(s) that are evident. While gauidance (in the title) is an actual misspelling, the correct spelling is guidance.There\u2019s also two accepted spellings of Counselling, and counseling, with both meaning the same thing.  Now, to answer the main question, the \u2018differences\u2019. Guidance: To offer general information or help on a topic or question (as this answer is intended to be), to give personal assistance typically through opinion, direction, or lived experience. Example: Jeff gave guidance to his buddy Bob, in how to get down the road to that new fishing hole without losing his vehicle\u2019s oil-pan in the process.Counseling (Counselling): This type of help comes from people who have taken educational courses and training specific to the goal of assisting others in the many different areas counseling can be focused on. Used typically in a \u2018mental health\u2019, or personal \u2018crisis\u2019, setting. People who counsel, are people who have \u201ctrained\u201d for that position, and hold some kind of accreditation (Certificate, Degree, etc) Example: Using various counseling techniques, the mental health counselor assisted Steve in dealing with his anxiety attacks.PS:For reference and specific detailed information about the two words (guidance and counseling), I have linked them to the Oxford Dictionary.

            "answer_text": "The terms are sometimes used interchangeably and much depends upon the environment. Guidance, as I seem to remember from my grad school days, is directly related to a specific area. A student may receive advice from a guidance counselor as to what classes they should take or where they should go to college. You may get guidance in establishing a business or cleaning up your credit. You can get guidance from your mechanic about the best type of oil for your car. Counseling is more feeling based and exploratory. The two overlap when, for example, a guidance counselor needs to help a student explore why they are afraid to apply to college or what is keeping them from taking certain courses. In terms outside of education, a financial advisor may offer guidance as to the best investments, but a counselor may help an individual deal with compulsive spending or their need to spend money to impress others.
