            "answer_text": "What is dark matter? Nobody knows for sure. However, we do have some clues as to its makeup. Here\u2019s a summary of what we do know: The earliest evidence that dark matter existed came when astronomer Vera Rubin refined a technique to determine the rotation velocities of stars within spiral galaxies. After she and her team accounted for all of the visible material within galaxies (dust, gas, stars) it turned out that that the stars in the outer portions of galaxies were rotating at much higher velocities than would be expected. In this image of a galaxy, the upper line consists of the measured velocities of stars within that galaxy. Notice how they move faster and faster as one moves away from the bright inner, and presumably massive, inner core of the galaxy. The lower line represents the velocities that would be expected were visible matter the only thing acting gravitationally. We would expect that, as the hypothetical stars get further away from the massive center of the galaxy, they would move more slowly. But they don\u2019t.  There was, it seems, something else there. That something had mass but didn\u2019t show up in any surveys from across the electromagnetic spectrum. This \u201cwhatever it is\u201d was given the name \u201cdark matter.\u201d So, this tells us the first thing we know about it: It exists. What is it, though? Is it invisible particles, similar to neutrinos, that don\u2019t interact with the rest of the universe electromagnetically (thus producing light)? Or is gravity somehow weird at very large distances? (A hypothesis known as Modified Newtonian Dynamics: MOND) In an attempt to answer this question, astronomers have devised detectors and have taken images of galaxy clusters to observe how dark matter (particle or MOND) works. Gravity, according to general relativity, is the warping of space. As such, a massive object will tend to bend light around it like a lens. Astronomers can image very massive galaxy clusters and look at the warping effect they have on the light coming from distant galaxies beyond. This effect is known as gravitational lensing. In this Hubble Space Telescope image of a massive galaxy cluster, the thin arc shaped bands of light are the warped images of galaxies in the far distance- beyond the galaxy cluster.  By measuring the amount of warping, astronomers can determine the mass of the cluster. By imaging the cluster, astronomers can determine how much \u201cnormal\u201d matter there is. It turns out that this, and just about every other, galaxy cluster is a great deal more massive than can be accounted for just by looking at how many stars and how much gas and dust there is in this cluster. In fact, visible matter is a very small portion of the overall mass observed via gravitational lensing. This leads us to the second thing we know about dark matter: It\u2019s more common than \u201cnormal matter.\u201d As surveys of such massive clusters were undertaken, astronomers began to be able to work out, using gravitational lensing, the distribution of dark matter. It turns out that astronomers can not only figure out how much bending there is, but they can also work out, more or less, where the dark matter is in the cluster, in much the same way that one can determine the shape of a blob of glass by looking at the way it bends light.  One noted study compared the apparent distribution of dark matter, from lensing, to the distribution of hot hydrogen between the galaxies. Hot hydrogen permeates intergalactic space, and has a certain amount of mass on its own. The question was, would dark matter follow more or less the same \u201crules\u201d as normal matter? Here\u2019s one result:  This is an image of a pair of galaxy clusters that coming out of a long, slow motion collision. On this image are superimposed two colored blobs. The red blob is the measured distribution of intergalactic hydrogen. The blue blobs show evidence of where the dark matter is via gravitational lensing. This is worked out by subtracting out the effect from the visible normal matter. The stunning thing is that dark matter does not seem to have the same distribution as normal matter. Moreover, it behaves differently. While the hydrogen is \u201cleft behind\u201d somewhat after the collision- in other words, the hydrogen collides with itself and is slows down while the denser, less diffuse stellar matter moves on its merry way- the dark matter distribution seems to follow the average distribution of the cluster. This tells us the third thing we know about dark matter: it doesn\u2019t interact with regular matter or itself (very much) except gravitationally. Moreover, it acts \u201chot\u201d- that is \u201cfast moving\u201d, in that it doesn\u2019t clump up much on small scales but it is not \u201crelativistically hot\u201d in that it is moving at an significant percentage of the speed of light. Surveys of galaxies have allowed us to determine that the amount of dark matter doesn\u2019t always seem to have very much to do with the amount of normal matter in a galaxy. In many cases, for instance, small, low luminosity, dwarf galaxies have a great deal more dark matter relative to their apparent amount of normal matter than much larger galaxies.  This tells us the fourth thing we know: Dark matter is probably not the result of some weird trick that gravity is playing at massive distances. (But, that\u2019s still a remote possibility.) Finally, scientists have attempted, using various techniques, to detect the interaction of dark matter with normal matter in much the same way that neutrinos, particles that only very grudgingly interact with normal matter- (it is said that a neutrino can pass through a light year of lead without a collision) were detected. Here is the interior of a device using one such technique. Is a massive tank of ultra-pure water. Astronomers look for evidence of dark matter by looking for light flashes given off when particles collide with the fluid. Unfortunately, astronomers don\u2019t know precisely what they are looking for. This is complicated by the fact that neutrinos also, rather rarely, collide with particles in the fluid, making the parsing out of which events are neutrinos and which events are \u201cdark matter\u201d rather difficult. The globes around the edges are photomultiplier tubes. (Note the two technicians in the image for scale.)  These techniques, which are too varied and detailed to outline in single Quora post have come to a single result, to use a technical term: bupkis* *bupkis: Noun. Nada, Zilch, Nothing, Niente, Crickets\u2026This leads us to the last thing we know about dark matter, it\u2019s really aloof. So, what is it? We don\u2019t know yet. ",

            "answer_text": "What is dark matter? Dark matter is by definition that which causes the observed excess inward acceleration of galaxies, and gravitationally bound galaxy clusters. Physicists do not know the cause, of these dark matter effects. There are two categories of theories that have been exclusively, and extensively, investigated: No. 1. The dark matter effects are caused by the positive gravity of undetected positive masses; No. 2. Our theories of gravity are wrong. None of the theories, in either of these categories, has yielded a cause. That is because the cause is in an entirely different category, No. 3: The negative gravity of dark energy, and that category No. 3 yields neutrinos as the cause. For much more on dark energy and neutrinos, please see the below link, questions, and answers that follow: What is dark energy? Why does it matter? What is dark energy? Dark energy is comprised of neutrinos and neutrino-like particles that must travel at speeds faster than the speed of light. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05155...: On July 13, 2018, it was announced that the IceCube-170922A neutrino arrived about 10 days before electromagnetic signatures were received by telescopes from blazar TXS 0506+056, about 4 x 10\u2079 light-years distant. This is evidence that this neutrino traveled faster than the speed of light. These particles have so much energy-momentum because their Lorentz factors are always observed to be greater than 10\u2076. They cannot slow down to less than the speed of light, like ordinary positive-real matter must be able to do. For more on this, please see my answers below to the following questions: Is there anything faster than a ray of light? Yes! All observed neutrinos travel slightly faster than the speed of light. Dark energy consists of neutrinos and predicted neutrino-like quantum mechanical particles, with negative properties including gravity, that constitute a dark \u201cquantum universe\u201d symmetric, via \u201crelativistic mass symmetry,\u201d to the one we are familiar with. For more on this, please see my answers below to the following questions: What are the most prevalent current hypotheses concerning dark matter and dark energy? Unfortunately, there are no prevalent good hypotheses or theories concerning dark matter or dark energy. Physicists are at a roadblock, looking for dark matter WIMPS that don\u2019t exist; and stuck on the rejected by Einstein \u201ccosmological constant\u201d that would blow up our universe in a \u201cbig rip.\u201d But there is an excellent well-researched theory, encompassing both dark matter and dark energy, a draft of which was published on May 13, 2018: Dark Energy - Dark Matter, A Treatise on their Unified Cause and Effects A brief summary follows: Dark energy is the name given to that which causes the accelerated expansion of our universe. According to Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle of general relativity, acceleration is indistinguishable from gravity. So dark energy is also indistinguishable from gravity. Gravity is associated with mass, and negative gravity would be associated with negative mass. A result of Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity is that negative mass must travel at faster than the speed of light, and would have negative-imaginary rest mass. The only particles to be measured to travel at faster than the speed of light are the neutrinos. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05155...: On July 13, 2018, it was announced that the IceCube-170922A neutrino arrived about 10 days before electromagnetic signatures were received by telescopes from blazar TXS 0506+056, about 4 x 10\u2079 light-years distant. If they were initiated by the same rare event, as assumed, this is evidence that the neutrino traveled at infinitesimally greater than the speed of light. Also, neutrinos have the negative mass squared, that can only come from (negative)-imaginary rest mass: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/listings... Page 6: MASS SQUARED (electron based) = \u2212 0.6 \u00b1 1.9 eV^2 OUR AVERAGE, 12 negatives, all larger or equal to \u2212 0.6, 2 positive but with the highest probable errors. And there are many more symmetric particles that are predicted by \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d that have negative mass and gravity as well. The estimated 25% dark matter effect could simply be a \u201chole\u201d or \u201cdeficiency\u201d in dark energy, not a separate particle. In this case, dark energy would only have to overcome the 5% positive matter, not the 5% + 25% = 30% overestimated positive matter. Only a fraction of the estimated 70% dark energy would be needed. Neutrinos, and predicted symmetric neutrino-like negative gravity particles, explain it all. Physics is beautiful and, once you get it right, everything fits together in perfect harmony. If relativistic mass is an outdated concept then what is the status of the concept of rest mass? The status of the concept of Lorentz invariant \u201crest mass\u201d (m) is rock solid and here to stay. In 1989 an article in \u201cPhysics Today\u201d started a movement to abolish the teaching of \u201crelativistic mass\u201d (m\u03b3). This is still controversial. The concept of, \u201crelativistic mass\u201d is not yet outdated; it is temporarily out of fashion. The two can coexist as long as (m) is reserved for rest mass and the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is kept explicit in the equations. My discovery of \u201cRelativistic mass symmetry\u201d is revolutionary and will refocus the attention of theoretical physicists on relativistic mass and what mass fundamentally is. \u201cRelativistic mass\u201d has a deeper significance than ever imagined. The suppression of relativistic mass has contributed to the current impasse in physics where neutrinos\u2019 mass, dark energy, and dark matter have not been explained. Without the concept of \u201crelativistic mass\u201d it is virtually impossible to explain my discoveries of relativistic mass symmetry; the mass, properties, and behavior of neutrinos; the reversed gravitational acceleration of our universe; dark energy or dark matter. My explanations of these things follow. The postulates of Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity are: (1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. (2) The speed of light in a vacuum has the same value c in all inertial frames of reference. These postulates lead to the Lorentz transformation and the Lorentz factor, \u03b3 \u2261 1/\u221a[1 \u2013 (v/c)\u00b2]. The Lorentz transformation, in turn, leads to all of the special relativity predictions. They predict: (1) Positive-real rest mass particles (ordinary matter) must travel at less than the speed of light in a vacuum. (2) Zero rest mass particles (light photons) must travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. (3) Particles that travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum (neutrinos) must have mathematically negative-imaginary rest mass. These latter particles, like light, can't rest. Because their Lorentz factor is also negative-imaginary, \u03b3' = \u2013i x >10\u2076, their product relativistic mass (m'\u03b3'), is negative-real, as is their gravity. Due to their extreme velocity, negative-real relativistic mass neutrino particles are almost all energy. There is symmetry between ordinary particles that travel at less than the speed of light and neutrinos that travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. I call it, \u201crelativistic mass symmetry.\u201dRelativistic mass symmetry is symmetry between positive matter and negative (yes, negative) matter. It is highly improbable that it could exist between positive masses. Ordinary matter, which we can see, has positive-real relativistic masses (m\u03b3), rest masses (m), Lorentz factors (\u03b3), energies [E = c\u00b2m\u03b3], but negative Newtonian predicted gravitational accelerations [a = \u2013m\u03b3(vector r/r)/(r\u00b2)] because m\u03b3 is positive-real. Relativistic mass symmetry neutrinos are the hypothesized dark energy, cannot be seen, have negative relativistic masses (m'\u03b3' = \u2013 m\u03b3), negative-imaginary rest masses (m' = \u2013 m\u03b3/\u03b3'), Lorentz factors (\u03b3' = \u2013i x >10\u2076), and positive Newtonian predicted gravitational accelerations [a' = \u2013m'\u03b3'(vector r/r)/(r\u00b2)] because m'\u03b3' is negative-real and the double negatives become positive. I discovered, \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d when investigating negative relativistic mass (m'\u03b3') as a candidate for dark energy and found that neutrinos had its predicted properties. Relativistic mass symmetry not only predicts neutrinos and their properties, but also new additional neutrino-like particles. Here is the precise predicting equation for the neutrinos\u2019 and predicted neutrino-like particles\u2019 rest masses, in terms of their ordinary corresponding namesake particles\u2019 rest masses: m' = \u2013 m\u03b3/\u03b3', where m' is the negative-imaginary rest mass of the neutrinos; m is the rest mass of the neutrinos\u2019 corresponding namesake ordinary particle; \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor of the neutrinos\u2019 corresponding namesake ordinary particle, which is normally essentially equal to one \u03b3 \u2248 1.0; and \u03b3' is the neutrinos\u2019 negative-imaginary Lorentz factor, which is always \u03b3' = \u2013i x >10\u2076. The resulting precisely predicted neutrinos\u2019 rest masses are: Electron neutrino\u2019s rest mass = \u2013i x <0.511 eV/c\u00b2,Muon neutrino\u2019s rest mass = \u2013i x <105.7 eV/c\u00b2,Tau neutrino\u2019s rest mass = \u2013i x <1,777 eV/c\u00b2. Antineutrinos\u2019 predicted rest masses are the same. These predicted values are all somewhat less than their published upper limit values, calculated from their measured negative (yes, negative) mass squared (m'\u00b2) values. The square root of a negative number is \u00b1 an imaginary (yes, imaginary) number. Currently observed electron neutrino\u2019s masses are less than 1 eV and their energies are at least 1 MeV, so their Lorentz factors (\u03b3\u2019) calculated from the ratio <1 eV/>1 MeV = > 10\u2076 are: \u03b3' \u2261 1/\u221a[1 \u2013 (v'/c)\u00b2] = \u2013i x >10\u2076. The speeds |v'| of currently observed neutrinos can be precisely calculated from these Lorentz factors. They are in the range of: c < |v'| < (1 + 0.5 x 10 \u0304 \u00b9\u00b2) c. The latest CNGS2 (ICARUS) measured average speed differential was: (|v'| \u2013 c) = (0.04 \u00b1 0.28stat. \u00b1 0.98syst.) x 10 \u0304 \u2076 c, which is faster (yes, faster) than the speed of light in a vacuum. Special relativity\u2019s first postulate, the principle of relativity, indicates that multiple properties of neutrinos require them to travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. (1) Because neutrinos never stand still in any of our reference frames that travel at less than the speed of light, and they have mass so that they cannot travel at the speed of light, they must travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum, where they can stand still in their reference frame. (2) If neutrinos traveled at less than the speed of light in a vacuum there would be reference frames in which they changed helicity handedness. But neutrinos all have left-handed helicity, they never change helicity handedness. (3) For the principle of relativity and \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d to work between both electrons and their namesake electron neutrinos, one of them must travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. The laws of physics work in their reference frames and in our reference frames. In their reference frames, we are the ones always traveling at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. Dark energy is composed of these relativistic mass symmetry particles. On the other hand, dark matter, I have proposed, is a deficiency of these dark energy neutrinos. Having no dark matter particles reduces the required dark energy by a factor of 6.5. Our new frugal universe now contains three different types of rest mass: negative-imaginary, zero, and positive; proportioned as follows: 67.7% dark energy, 31.8% light photons, and ordinary matter. My revolutionary predictions are all solidly based on Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity and observational data. Since many neutrinos are already in the standard model of quantum mechanics, dark energy and dark matter are no longer unknown dark particles. Physics, astronomy, and cosmology are now solidly based on known and predicted quantum mechanical particles. ",
