            "answer_text": "As someone who is seeking to pursue medicine in the future (if everything works out), here\u2019s my own experience. This is obviously anecdotal but maybe some people will glean info from it. In high school, I absolutely loved chemistry. I thought understanding chemistry meant understanding why the world functions. So much can be derived from chemistry. And with my father having a PhD in organic chemistry, he helped instill a love of chemistry for me. I remember a lot of my friends saying the chemistry was hard in high school but I never could understand. I decided to use my AP Chem credit and skip gen chem and jump right into organic chemistry. Not only the \u201cpremed\u201d organic chemistry, but the \u201chonors\u201d organic chemistry meant for those interested in majoring in organic chemistry and going for a masters or PhD afterwards in chemistry. Then during the summer, I told some of my friends that were sophmores and juniors in college that I wanted to go medical school. Almost all of them replied, \u201cgood luck in Ochem\u201d or something of the sorts. I initially just ignored then but the repeated statements regarding Ochem started to get to me. I was thinking \u201cda*n ochem must be truly hell for so many people to comment on it.\u201d I saw some of my sophomore friends stop being premed because Ochem ruined them. With this, I kept worrying that I would join the many who got \u201cruined\u201d by Ochem. I now wanted to undo my AP credit and just do gen chem over again and avoid ochem for as long as possible. Luckily, my dad said that would be foolish and just go for it. He would be able to help me if I needed it. I\u2019m greatful I listened to him. Even still, I dreaded what awaited me. So day 1 of college, and I\u2019m the only freshman in a class of sophomores majoring in chemistry. Its reviewing resonance structures. I\u2019m like \u201cthis is soooo easy, what is the fuss? It\u2019s just gen chem again.\u201d But I also think \u201cthis is day 1 lets wait a month and see how I\u2019m feeling.\u201d So its the end of month 1, and we\u2019ve just had our first exam. I set the curve. I scored 99% raw score but actually got 113% after the curve is applied. Now, you might be thinking, well that\u2019s just cause this guy must be really good at ochem and has a father that major in organic chemistry. And guess what, you\u2019re wrong. I never asked my dad for any help but what I did do was study my \u201ca**\u201d off. Everyday, I would spend at least an hour reviewing what had been covered and really understanding what was going on. No I don\u2019t mean I memorized each reaction because guess what. That\u2019s not learning. Monkeys can be trained to regurgitate information. No, I really sat down and \u201cunderstood\u201d what was occurring. Say we learned that a grignard plus a ketone makes a tertiary alcohol after acid workup. What many would do is just \u201cmemorize\u201d this fact. Memorize. Rinse and repeat. Easy right? Well that\u2019t not how I thought about. I had so many questions. \u201cWell aldehydes are like ketones. Would they react similarly?\u201d \u201cWhy is an acid workup necessary?\u201d \u201cWhy did he say acid work up afterwards, what if I changed it and did an acid work up before?\u201d \u201cWhat if I changed the acid workup into a base workup?\u201d \u201cWhat is physically happening so that this reaction goes to completion? Why don\u2019t they just not react?\u201d So, instead of just \u201cmemorizing\u201d this fact and moving on. I dug in. I started looking up resources on \u201cgrignard reactions\u201d and found a treasure trove. Specifically, I really appreciated the \u201creaction mechanism\u201d of it. This is a procedure of drawing arrows and electrons that helps to explain what is occurring. I saw that the grignard is electron donating and makes the carbon effectively at like it was a carboanion. Of course, this is unstable so, it then moves this negative charge to the ketone. It attacks the carbon so that the double bond can be broken and the electrons then move onto the oxygen. Next, acid is added so that the negative oxygen can now be an alcohol. The reaction is now finished. This helped answer that aldehydes could react similar since the reasonable mechanism could be draw for them as well. It also explained why an acid was necessary. I also realized from it why an acid had to be added afterwards. Remember when I said that the grignard makes the carbon negative? Well, what else is negative? Bases!!!! I realize that grignards are also bases. So, if I add an acid, an acid base rxn would occur rather than the attack. So out of this you might be wondering. Why is it necessary to even consider this? Who honestly cares? You spend so much more time doing this then just memorizing. Well, on test day, we have a question. Say we have a grignard and a carboxylic acid. What would the product be? We had never been taught a grignard plus a carboxylic acid so I panic a little. But then after calming down, I thought about the question. Grignards generally attack a carbon and push electrons onto the oxygen. This could reasonable happen. Carboxylic acids has a similar double bonded oxygen. But then I also remeebr, carboxylic acids are called that because they are ACIDS. So recalling what I had realized earlier about acid work ups, I realized an acid base reaction would occur. I was one of the few on the test to get it right. If I were to guess, it would be something like this. 1/4 the class didn\u2019t know the answer cause we hadn\u2019t been taught this case. 1/2 the class thought the answer would be similar to an aldehyde or ketone and just add the grignard reagent onto the carboxylic acid. However, by truly understanding the rxn, I realized the real answer. And, from there, I just kept doing what I had been doing for grignards. Looking deeper. Now I\u2019m taking graduate classes in Ochem for \u201cfun\u201d my sophomore year and I am loving it. I\u2019m getting a ever greater understanding of why reactions occur. SOOOO. What can we get out of this anedote? Don\u2019t get pulled into the hype. Ochem isn\u2019t as hard as people say it is. Do your own thing and ignore everyone else.Study smarter not harder. Memorization is necessary for basic recall but it alone won\u2019t save you. Truly understanding concepts is how you do well in Ochem. Spend the time to really know why something is occurring not just accepting it for fact. This extends well beyond Ochem and this though pattern has been helping me ever since.Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Orgo, very often, is graded on a curve. 20\u201330% of a class will get a grade below B. Some colleges won\u2019t allow a pre-Med to continue with a grade below B. Even if allowed to continue, chances of obtaining a Med school admission will be jeopardized. The curve isn\u2019t arbitrary. Exams are just very hard. For most students, the material itself isn\u2019t particularly demanding. However, there is a lot of it and the student is expected to know all of it (my Orgo textbook was 1200 pages). In addition, they\u2019ll be required to integrate multiple concepts to solve problems. The first exam might have an average of, say, 65%. This is intended as a wake up call. Forewarned, students bear down harder for the second exam only to see an average of 45%. If a student falls behind, it\u2019s very, very hard to catch up. Some very bright students struggle with three-dimensional perception. Imagine a student who is used to all A\u2019s in both sciences and humanities not only flunking an exam but getting a grade of zero. Others seemed to have little common sense - trying to light a Bunsen burner that was spewing water instead of gas; trying to pull a vacuum through a solid glass rod instead of a hollow tube, etc. Students who are successful at Orgo put in a lot of time. I don\u2019t know anyone for whom Orgo was easy. If they liked it and were good at it, they still had to put in a lot of time. Three hours of study for each hour of class was the rule of thumb (not including labs, lab reports or preparation for quizzes and exams). For students who really wanted to do well, 5\u20137 hours was more typical. Pre meds have a reputation - deserved or not - of being grade grubbers. Many would appeal a grade of, say, 3 out of fifteen because someone else received a 4 or 5 for a very similar answer. One professor was getting appeals from two thirds of his students. He announced that he would still entertain appeals but would regrade the entire exam. Appeals fell over 90%. Orgo is said to be the closest comparison to Med school curriculum. Those who cannot do well in Orgo are unlikely to succeed in med school. Med schools know this and expect to see students who can master the subject. Rigorous pre med programs apply tough love. Those that use Orgo and other pre med courses to weed out the uncommitted have very high success rates(90+%) for Med school applicants (that is, those who survived the pre med gauntlet until Senior year). Not all programs do this. Annually, over 100,000 take the MCAT. Presumably, they all took the required courses, including Orgo. Only ~21,000 will earn admission. Of course, Orgo is just one course. Pre meds have to do well in their other courses at the same time! ",
