            "answer_text": "Why light (photons) cannot escape from a black-hole was formulated by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose who developed a new theory, in 1970, on how space-time singularities occur, this incorporated previous theoretical observations on the nature of the universe. Their theory demonstrates how black-holes result in a singularity (and that there was a singularity at the beginning of the universe). Their theorem implied that space-time singularities are evident if either the universe is spatially closed or if there is a star undergoing gravitational collapse. Energy is required to sustain fusion and when the energy source becomes exhausted, a heavy iron star core contracts under gravity, creating a neutron star, or if it is heavy enough, a black hole. Meanwhile, the outer layers of the star explode in a brilliant flash, observable as a supernova. However, some massive stars seem to completely disappear without any explosion. Theories suggest that these massive stars completely collapse into black-holes. The singularity theorem applies using four physical assumptions. The first is that Einstein\u2019s equations are not compromised with a zero or negative cosmological constant. The second is that energy-density is not less than minus for the principal pressure of the \"energy condition\". The third is that there are no closed time-like curves, and the fourth is that for every time-like or null-geodesic entering a region, the curvature must not be specially alined to the geodesic. The theoretical results of their theory are built on earlier results, the observations lead to time-like or null geodesic being incomplete, which gives an indication of the presence of space-time singularities. If, using null-geodesics, the paths of light rays are followed into the future, all the null-geodesics collide, there becomes no boundary to the future. Any outgoing light rays for any sphere inside the horizon of a black-hole are all converging, so none are escaping. In relativity, the Ricci curvature, which determines the collision properties of geodesics, is determined by the energy-tensor and its projection on light rays. This is equal to the null-projection of the energy\u2013momentum tensor and is always positive. This implies that the volume of a convergence of parallel null-geodesics once the volume starts decreasing, it will reach zero in a finite time. Once the volume is zero, it results in a collapse, so every geodesic intersects with neighbouring geodesics. Penrose stated that whenever there is a 'cube' where all the outgoing and ingoing light rays are initially converging, the boundary of the future of that region will end. This is one aspect of why time appears to cease inside a black hole, described by Hawking as the 'ultimate in entropy', It can be seen as a state of equilibrium, because it represents maximum entropy, once there photons and matter have nowhere else to go and entropy is not increasing or decreasing, this system has no \"arrow\" of time.

            "answer_text": "Because light is mediated by photons and photons are very closely related to space. Photons move at fixed speed relative to space. The forces (gravitational among the others) a black hole exerts are however huge and these forces affect space. When at low density areas a cosmic expansion (dark energy) affects space metrics to grow so that distances between objects seems larger; then at high density areas, such as black hole the metrics shrink, resulting in gravitational acceleration. Every new bit of matter-energy only increases that already enormous net force. So why cannot light pass the black hole at even shorter time than expected? Because light speed is also relative to environment. At everyday physics it doesnt matter really and we can say the speed of light from stars to Earth is c (the speed of light in vacuum), although the space between is not perfect vacuum. In black hole, a photon shifts away from space. It doesnt propagate at near c anymore, and eventually ceases to be a photon. The light already emitted gets extremely shifted too, and even when it could be carried away from BH area, we wouldnt be able to see it. ",
