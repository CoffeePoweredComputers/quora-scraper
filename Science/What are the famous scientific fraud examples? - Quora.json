            "answer_text": "What are the famous scientific fraud examples? The U.S. National Science Foundation defines three types of research misconduct: fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. Fabrication is making up results and recording or reporting them. The perception among many scientists is that cases of severe misconduct are relatively rare when held up against the sheer amount of scientific output. ... In the study, one per cent of scientists surveyed admitted to fabricating or falsifying their own data at least once in their career. Chemistry Claudio Airoldi (Brazil), former professor at the University of Campinas, and Denis de Jesus Lima Guerra (Brazil), former professor at the Federal University of Mato Grosso, have had 13 of their papers retracted[242] in what was reported as the biggest case of scientific fraud in Brazil.[243]Shigehito Isobe (Japan), professor at Hokkaido University, was found to have significant overlap with several publications by the authors in a 2010 paper that was later retracted.[244]The list is lengthy. When food is tied to performance things of this kind happen. Science and scientists are no exception to this. ",

The famous ( or infamous) Fleishman-Pons experiment of 1989 of cold fusion ( in analytical electrochemistry), met with criticism and was branded a fraud, even though the duo were leading electrochemists at that time. Their results couldn't be replicated by others. ",
