            "answer_text": "Launching from the stratosphere is an idea that has been around for some time, and if you look up Stratolaunch, they are indeed building an aircraft (completed, but not flown, by now) that will attempt to launch rockets from a higher altitude to save propellant. It will not save 90% since a large part of that propellant is required to achieve a velocity high enough to reach orbit, but it will save some fuel to overcome the massive drag in the lower atmosphere (and could potentially make the structure of the launcher lighter since the loads at \u201cmax q\u201d or maximum dynamic pressure are less). Other solutions are the ones that Virgin Galactic are working on for example, where you essentially have a hybrid between an aircraft and a rocket which can fly to a sufficient altitude to overcome most of the drag efficiently and then turn on the rocket engines and build up the velocity to reach orbit. The idea of a giant balloon/airship is an interesting one, however I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good reason that nobody has attempted it. Or is there\u2026? ",

            "answer_text": "Your premise is incorrect. About 10% of the fuel is used to reach orbital altitude. The other 90% is used to accelerate to orbital velocity. Launching from the height a balloon could reach - which is still significantly lower than orbital altitude - wouldn\u2019t save more than a few percent of the rocket size. There have been some experimental projects to launch rockets from balloons. The concept is known as a \u2018Rockoon\u2019. It doesn\u2019t save much fuel, and the additional difficulty and expense of the balloon means it\u2019s rarely worth doing. ",

Your idea has been around for quite awhile. Here is video from the 1950\u2019s where a rocket was launched from high altitude using a ballon. Note that the rocket here was a simple up-down flight. It didn\u2019t go into orbit.  Note the relative sizes between the balloon and the rocket. A rocket large enough to put a significant payload in orbit would need a balloon of impracticable size. A Stratolaunch type aircraft is a much better idea. ",

The number is closer to,the other way round = only about 10% is used to get to stratospheric altitude. Launching from up in the air would be a huge increase in complexity, adding more bits to go wrong. And you still have the problem of getting the airship down once it has launched - you would probably have to vent a huge amount of expensive helium. ",
