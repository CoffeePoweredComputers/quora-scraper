            "answer_text": "Because the energy absorbed by the electrons of two different elements is different. So naturally the energy released by them which forms line spectra will also be different. Hence line spectrum of each element is unique and does not correspond to any other element\u2019s spectrum.

            "answer_text": "Well lets look at this in this way. Two different elements have different nuclei. Hence different orbital energies. So if an electron from the 2 shell jumps to the first shell in both the elements..the energy gap isnt gonna be the same simply cuz the energy of the lower orbitals are different. Hence the wavelength emitted has to be different. ",
