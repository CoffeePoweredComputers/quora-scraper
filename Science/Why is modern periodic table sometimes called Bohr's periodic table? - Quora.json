            "answer_text": "Because people are mistaken. The periodic table was Medeleev\u2019s genius (first published in 1860) and came up with the arrangement we have even though, at the time it was \u2018invented\u2019 many of the elements were unknown. From the periodic table many trends were observed - melting points, boiling points (of both the elements and compounds containing them), reactivity, likely empirical formulas. It even aided in the discovery of unknown elements. In the early 1900\u2019s, Bohr came along and developed the theory of atomic structure with electrons located in \u2018shells\u2019 (e.g., 1s, 2s, 2p, etc) and this theory was extremely helpful for understanding many things (another story). Not too surprisingly, how these shells are organized is aligned with the arrangement of the atoms in the periodic table - which further points out just how powerful the periodic table is; many discoveries that came after the periodic table \u2018fit\u2019 in with the predictions of the table. I do not mean to diminish, in any way, the contributions that Bohr made, but only want to give credit where it is due, and for the periodic table it is Medeleev. ",
