Since replicator technology is similar to transporter technology why would it do one but not the other? This is the very thing that bothered me about TNG\u2019s Code of Honor. The vaccine arrived by transporter (albeit not the Enterprise transporter) but Crusher could not synthesize it. The difference between a transporter and a replicator would be energy consumption and perhaps resolution. A replicator might not be able to synthesize the vaccine but specialized use of the transporter should have been able to. So the answer to why is loopholes that come as a result of prioritizing the drama of the story. If I were in charge of that episode I would have had the vaccine arrive by shuttle then the kidnapping sequence of Tasha Yar can still be done by Ligonian transporter since Lutan had enough time to plan it. This way you can maintain that the vaccine cannot be synthesized and still have the quick kidnap sequence. They already established some things can\u2019t be replicated so I can run with that. ",
