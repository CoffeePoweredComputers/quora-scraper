            "answer_text": "The distance from the event-horizon of a black-hole to its center-point is the Schwarzschild radius, which must match the corresponding value of black-hole internal energy. The internal-energy of a black-hole does not necessarily have to be physically located at a center point in the form of a singularity, although the affects of this energy can mathematically be considered to be focused at the center point, as is the case with most stars.

            "answer_text": "In a simplistic, non-rotating black hole, this is the Schwarzschild radius given by  where  is Newton\u2019s gravitation constant,  is the black hole\u2019s mass, and  is the speed of light in a vacuum. For example if you plug in for the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, then you get about two million miles. But if our sun could form a black hole (it can\u2019t, it\u2019s too small so the astrophysics of its death aren\u2019t right) then it would only be about two miles. ",
