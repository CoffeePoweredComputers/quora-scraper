            "answer_text": "Not very far, as it can\u2019t answer the simple questions: 1. Is there or not human fecal dust* in hospital wards? 2. Is it or not a threat for patients, as causing HA Infection? (99.000 deaths /yr and 1.600.000 cases only in USA). 3. Is there a way to prevent its forming? *\u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics. Why a comparison is not made between a hospital, where all the special measures to prevent human fecal dust forming are taken and those, where no special care is taken, as the usual practice is, regarding the HA infection rates, so a safe scientific decision to be made about fecal dust\u2019s role on causing HA infection. On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong reasons that other interests, than public health protection, are guiding science research.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, it\u2019s important to adopt a data-driven approach. Let\u2019s touch this question by looking at technology first. To understand technological development - it\u2019s various inventions and innovations in the market. To be more specific, let\u2019s say technology is scientific knowledge applied for a practical purpose. This what inventions and innovations usually do. They take current things and introduce new and better ways of how to do them. To have a general idea we won\u2019t compare the impact of technological progress but rather quantify it in another way. Let\u2019s ignore impact for a moment because some technologies are more impactful than others. We will instead quantify the number of patents to see technological progress because they are connected to technological development. Some patents are minor and others are significant. Let\u2019s take a look at the patent graph to see the trend in technological development. But first, \u201cThere are three types of patents: 1) Utility patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, the machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof; 2) Design patents may be granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture; and 3) Plant patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant.\u201d Defined by US Patent & Trade office To visualise, the patent chart in the US looks like this:  Source: U.S. Patent Statistics Summary Table, Calendar Years 1963 to 2019, 05/2020 update This should help you to understand how well technology developed from 1963 up today. It grows nearly exponentially. When you think about scientific development - it\u2019s tied with technology. Because science backs it up. Having patent graph you can assume that science grows similarly. For example, take a look at this graph which should quantify scientific output.  Source from: Science Is Getting Less Bang for Its Buck What\u2019s important from is the purple graph which tells that the amount of scientific publications is increasing exponentially. This is development which gets funded too. Which seems like a similar trend in technology. Whether those publications are impactful - this is another question. Scientific output is growing after all. I hope this gives you a general picture and graphs help you understand how science and technology developed. You can read my other answers about similar topics. ",
