            "answer_text": "Scientists haven\u2019t found any practical way of detecting dark matter yet. That\u2019s exactly why we don't know much about it, as its undetectable as of present. Even electromagnetic radiations pass through it unaltered. The only proof we have of the existence of dark matter is the study in the difference of the visible mass and calculated mass of large heavenly bodies, as the visible mass is much smaller than the actual mass, proving the fact that the universe is constituted of invisible matter, namely dark matter.
