            "answer_text": "The energy of a particle (or unit system) is (clasically) defined to be a force, integrated over the distance along which the force is being exerted: [math] E = \\Int F(r) dr [/math]. Mind you, energy is not a real/tangible thing. It is just a purely mathematical construct which we use, because it simplifies calculation. This is because of the fact that this mathematical construct is conserved. To my knowledge, there is no deeper physical interpretation than just the abstract mathematical one. There are just 4 (known) forces in the universe: the strong force, weak force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force. And arguably the latter is not considered a force, but let's not dwell on the mystery of general relativity right now... Therefore, one could only discern 4 types of energy in the universe, each corresponding to one force. All \"different\" forms of energy boil down to being one of those four. They just seem different, because the system under consideration is complex and huge compared to single-particle systems, and because one can make a good statistical approximation of the system's energy by looking at macroscopic quantities, rather than working out the integral stated above, for each particle (or unit system) in the system under consideration. Take for instance a gas of particles in a container. Instead of measuring the electromagnetic forces exerted on each gas particle, integrating them along the pathway of each particle and then adding all these numbers, it seems way easier to just multiply the pressure and the volume of the gas, which - according to statistical thermodynamics - is equal to its energy.If you go and check out the theory of statistical thermodynamics, you will find that it is based on nothing but electromagnetic forces: particles repelling each other due to their electromagnetic charge! (Okay, originally it was based on Newtonian mechanics, but we now know that in this case Newtonian mechanics can be replaced by electromagnetism.)In fact, probably the majority of the \"different forms of energy\" you can think of are all electromagnetic in origin. Heat energy, chemical energy, you name it! Notable exceptions would be gravitational energy and nuclear (\"strong force\") energy. Another important statement is that - from the above viewpoint - the \"kinetic energy\" of a charged ball can be viewed as - for instance - either gravitational or electromagnetic energy, since the ball could have gotten it's energy either from a gravitational or electromagnetic force. But in fact it does not matter: energy is just a mathematical concept, and it's universal. There's no need for labeling energy as being of one type or the other. The latter I will explain in the following paragraph. Your question should now be reduced to: why are these four forms of energy equivalent, what is the physical proof that they be interchanged? This is where my knowledge gets less qualitative, but let me tell you this:1. All energies can still be expressed in units of [math] \\frac{kg \\cdot m}{s^2}[/math], so we safely add them and get a meaningful result.2. Whenever we do add them, their combination still seems to be conserved, no matter what we try*. Therefore, one could state that \"all energy is of the same form\". Because there's really no way to discern the different kinds once you realize they can be freely interchanged, in roughly the same way that \"all money is of the same form\". All currencies are just a different way of representing credit, just like all energies are a different way of representing... that mysterious mathematical construct which seems to be conserved at all times. *For instance, the amount of \"gravitational energy\" lost when dropping an positively charged ball into a large bowl which is slightly positively charged (only slightly, so the particle will actually fall into the bowl and not just be repelled so hard that it bounces off and away) can be empirically determined to be equal to the amount of electromagnetic energy won during the process.

            "answer_text": "It seems you are deriving from unit of energy kgm2/s2 that all energy must therefor be kinetic. That is not the case.We use different common measures for Energy. For electricity we use kWh (kilowatt hours). In high Energy physics, we use MeV (mega electron volts). The common unit for Energy is J (joule); 1 Joule = 1 kgm2/s2..I think the confusion you may have is the fact that every form of Energy, be it thermal, electric, gravitational, kinetic, heat can be converted into another form; by the \"energy conservation\" law, the sum of all types of energy must be conserved within a closed system. As such you can convert every energy unit into another. There are conversion factors from kWh to J; MeV to J; etc. they are all equivalent.An interesting observation is that heat energy is indeed kinetic energy. The underlying reason is that heat is in effect energy based on the atomic / molecular velocities of the associated mass. Go example the heat of a piece of metal is caused by the atoms \"wiggling\" around. They are wiggling faster if the piece of metal is hot. I should add this: Mathematically, Noether's theorem states: If a physical process exhibits the same outcomes regardless of place or time, then its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous translations in space and time: by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively. It is important to note here, that the fact that physical laws are invariant in space time directly leads to the conclusion that energy is conserved. In this view, the conservation of Energy is derived mathematically from the symmetry law stated above. In simple term the Langrangian is a function that states \"what effort does it take to move a particle from one place to another?\" - this is very simplified. ",
