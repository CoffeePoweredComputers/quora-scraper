            "answer_text": "This is an example of Charles\u2019 law, which states that the volume and temperature of a gas vary directly when mass and pressure are constant. This means that when the temperature increases, the volume also increases, and vice versa. The formula that allows us to calculate initial and final volume, and initial and final temperature is: V1/T1 = V2/T2 V1 = initial volume = 6.85 L T1 = initial temperature(K) = 299.8\u00b0C + 273.15 = 573.0K V2 = final volume = 9.25 L T2 = final temperature(K) = ?K Rearrange the formula to solve for the final temperature (T2). T2 = V2\u00b7T1/V1 = (9.25 L \u00d7 573.0K)/6.85 L = 774K to three significant figures The final temperature under the given conditions will be ~774K. V1/T1 = V2/T2 6.85/573 = 9.25/774 0.0112 = 0.0112 The Kelvin temperature and the volume increased at the same rate. 774K/573K = 1.35 9.25 L/6.85 L = 1.35 ",

            "answer_text": "500.5 \u00b0C PV=nRT is the general gas law which provides good approximations. P (pressure) remains constant. n (amount of substance) remains constant. R (ideal gas constant) obviously remains constant. Therefore, in our case, T will be directly proportional to the volume. (T\u221dV) The only thing you will have to keep in mind is to be consistent with the units. The general gas law refers to temperature in Kelvin. If you use any other temperature unit, you will be making a mistake. More importantly, something one should always ask himself: Does the answer make sense? The temperature increases from 300 to 500 \u00b0C. \u2013Casually speaking, pressure in this cases is basically a consequence of molecules \u201chitting\u201d their surroundings. The more molecules (n), the more \u201chitting\u201d -> more pressure. \u2013The molecules moving faster (higher temperature T) means hitting harder -> more pressure -The molecules being constrained in a smaller volume (V) naturally means more hitting -> more pressure \u2013We have the same amount of materia throughout the process. \u2013We give the molecules more space which at first sight should mean less pressure. \u2013However, the pressure remains constant. What is the only way for the same amount of molecules (n), having now more space (V), to still exert the same amount of \u201chitting\u201d (Pressure)? -> Moving faster! Which translates into a bigger temperature. ",
