DEVON AND CORNWALL NOTES & QUERIES. : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive One early account reports the Great Thunderstorm at a church in Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon, in England, on 21 October 1638. Four people died and approximately 60 were injured when, during a severe storm, an 8-foot (2.4 m) ball of fire was described as striking and entering the church, nearly destroying it. Large stones from the church walls were hurled into the ground and through large wooden beams. The ball of fire allegedly smashed the pews and many windows, and filled the church with a foul sulphurous odour and dark, thick smoke. The ball of fire reportedly divided into two segments, one exiting through a window by smashing it open, the other disappearing somewhere inside the church.

I knew a radio ham (in the 50s) who had the stuff come down his aerial, fizzle across the floor, squeezed under the door, along the floor, out through the wall and disappear into the ground at the base of a tree.
