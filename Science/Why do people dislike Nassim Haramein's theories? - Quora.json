His work simply isn\u2019t at the level of basic science. It is pseudo-science. His \u201cproofs\u201d quickly become circular and self-referential (i.e., without foundation, meaningless). There are a number of scientific web essays that address NH in detail, just Google around. It\u2019s not pretty. Wikipedia removed his entry because he claims to be a \u201cnoteworthy physicist,\u201d yet he has ZERO peer review. He has never published in a mainstream, peer-reviewed physics journal, partly because he\u2019s smart enough to know he would be immediately and formally exposed as a fraud by the world\u2019s science community. As \u201cnew age\u201d mythology, NH\u2019s work is quite good, and it\u2019s hooked a lot of people under its \u201cguru\u201d spell. But it\u2019s not science. He writes in glib cosmic double-speak sold by a huckster to low-information X-File fans who \u201cwant to believe.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of ear-tickling nonsense you hear on late-night \u201cUFO talk radio.\u201d Pure religious theater, like Christian \u201cintelligent design\u201d except far less coherent. NH does NOT allow debate or provide links to any criticisms about his work. Any comment on his website that even hints of valid scientific criticism is swiftly deleted. Read that again until it sinks in. This isn\u2019t the work of a truth-seeker. This isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s the opposite. This is what cults do: they quash all dissent, make the guru inviolable, teach people how to parrot the golden text, and extract money from the gullible. Say it over and over. This isn\u2019t science. Run, run away as fast as you can. ",

            "answer_text": "He's not an academic in the traditional sense, though to his credit, he has learned academic lingo well and shows to have conceptual understanding too.  He openly talks about being a ski instructor and a scuba instructor for many years.  Then he talks about coming upon certain realizations while living out of his van. He promotes meditation and critical thinking as a way of coming upon certain understanding. Essentially, he's self taught, and that is a risky place to stand when credibility is concerned. He also selects themes and topics that make him very easy to label a \"new ageist:\" Sacred Geometry, Cosmic Octaves, Infinite Energy, and a Conscious Living Universe, etc.  On the other hand, \"folk scientists\" in life do have real knowledge and even though they are self taught can surpass an academic in intuitive conceptual understanding.  A guy who has lived and worked in some remote riverside city may have a very sharp intuition about hydrodynamics and erosion, for instance.  He understands it in his own vocabulary and may benefit a formal academic scientist with his insights. But the problem with self taught scientists is that the system can't really gauge their merit when they're talking about things that don't have formal answers yet.  They can just be like \"maybe he's onto something, maybe he's not. Let him run his business, without disturbing our process of work...\" I did read Haramein's Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Mass, which shows that he is quite devoted to his theories penetrating the formal scientific world. I don't have the knowledge to say whether his theory is useful, but he claims to have made a prediction with his model that gives a radius for the proton that's within the acceptable margin to the number given by experiment. Apparently, the implications of that are trans-formative because it unites gravity and quantum physics, all within a brand campaign that blends archeology, sacred texts, spiritualism, and a bunch of credibility-killing themes.
