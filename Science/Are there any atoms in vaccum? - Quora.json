            "answer_text": "When things get a bit complicated, it becomes difficult to actually say which is a vacuum and which is not. If we consider the definition that says about the absence of matter, yes, there are no REGULAR ATOMS in such an evacuated place. But, if vacuum means devoid of ANYTHING like other particles that include neutrinos, we can't be sure whether any conventionally evacuated space has mass inside. The case could even become worse when we consider potentially UNDISCOVERED particles like DARK matter, which may be composed of other symmetrically similar 'atoms'. Theories suggest that dark matter is everywhere and we couldn't so far detect them.  For now, the best answer to this question can be that vacuum CAN contain atoms. ",

A)Absence of heat. 3.What is Vacuum? A)Absence of Matter.  You know matter is made up of molecules,atoms etc., As vacuum itself is called absence of matter there will not be any atoms.Strictly speaking, in a perfect vacuum, there is nothing.  But it's impossible to have a perfect vacuum and so in terms of the vacuum of space, yes there are atoms present.  ",

Actually even the vacuum of space is not empty, it contains 1 to 2 atoms per cubic centimeter. This can vary with area you are looking at. Intergalactic space has the least amount of free atoms, followed by interstellar space, which can have 5-10 atoms per cubic centimeter due to matter ejected by stars. A typical star with some planets around, like our Sun, the density is fairly large. You will not find a place completely empty, how hard you may try.  ",

Millions of particles pop out with their counterparts and then vanishes. Energy is distributed everywhere in the universe and where there is energy, there is particle and sometimes virtual particles ( particles with zero rest mass; like photons ) also occupy the place. But atoms does not exist in the vacuum. (particles do but atoms don't) . ",
