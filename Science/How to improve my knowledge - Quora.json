            "answer_text": "The most important thing I learned in school wasn\u2019t any single topic or piece of information. What I learned was how to go about learning. It sounds simplistic, but if you have that kind of mindset, much of the rest will follow. I learned how to organize my thoughts around questions and topics. Instead of taking a question as literal and simplistic, I learned to think about the question in context: who was asking, why were they asking, and what did I think they actually wanted to know from an answer? Only then would I start researching and developing an answer. I learned to explore around the edges of questions and topics. What other topics might be related, and how? Such explorations have often led me to completely new topics to learn about. Going back to basics: read. Be voracious about knowledge. Before the Internet, I read newspapers 7 days a week. Now I browse multiple online sources daily, and read numerous articles. If a topic is interesting, I\u2019ll save it, and follow up by doing additional searches and reading topical material in greater depth. If what you want to learn is related to a skill, then you must exercise that skill. The way to martial arts mastery is through practice - there is no substitute. If you want to learn about knife throwing, start practicing. Think about the topics you wish to learn. Search out sources, whether online, in books, via classes or on-the-job training, and find a way to immerse yourself. This has all be extremely general advice - but your question is also quite general. If you want to learn but don\u2019t know where to begin, I suspect you\u2019ll have to begin within, and try to figure out what it is you want to learn about. Once you\u2019ve identified at least a starting point, you can pursue some of the suggestions above to expand on that initial topic. ",

            "answer_text": "It's quite simple, actually! 1) Read, read, and read widely and deeply, all kinds of published works, mainstream as well as from  the  fringes, so that you can have sustainable intellectual horsepower. Always reflect on your reading, and think in terms of personal relevancy to action, as only action creates results. Knowledge is not measured by what's stored in the head; it's your productivity, i.e. what you do and what don't do! 2) Write, write, and write, so as to garner people's attention to your   evolving acumen and  growing expertise, which often can lead to more  public speaking gigs and consulting engagements. 3) Begin with a  warm, sincere and genuine interest in people all around  you, as people  are your greatest resource, as well as your wonderful  opportunities to learn, grow and change. 4) Don't forget to attend selected conferences, seminars and workshops to keep yourself abreast of trends and developments in your as well as outside your industry, as everything in business - as well as in life - is connected in some ways;  Naturally, don't hesitate to seek as much opportunities as possible to rub shoulders with like-minded professionals inside as well as outside your industry, with the longer-term view to gain diverse - or even contrarian - perspectives; 5) Always listen intently, and talk less. 6) Keep  learning - and doing - new things, so as to gain expanded  perspectives  and new experiences.  Evolving experiences = applied  knowledge! 7) Develop a idea/insight generating mindset and a  problem solving  attitude, so that folks around you can turn to you for  advice and help. Nevertheless, here are a few good tips for enhancing your idea/insight generation: - be acutely observant of your environment, by using all your senses;- be curious and inquisitive;- be open-minded to new and even radical possibilities;- suspend judgement;- make unlikely connections;- ask questions, all kinds, especially open-ended ones, like \"what if?\", \"why not?\",  \"So what?\", \"What now?\", etc.- think like a child, but don't be childish, so to develop the beginner's mindset;- learn to see things backwards, inside out, and upside down; inside the box as well as outside the box, plus no box at all;-   learn to see from atop; see ahead; see beyond; see behind; see   sideways; see beneath; see behind; see from within; and see through, so   as to develop multi-directional and multi-development viewpoints;- hitchhike; copycat; piggyback;  leapfrog on other peoples' ideas, as \"Ideas Build on Ideas\";- you can make use of the simple but proven SCAMPER technique [it dates back to the 1950's], to expand your idea generation;-  likewise, you may want to explore the more elaborate but proven CPSI  methodology of the US-based Creative Education Foundation, to expand  your idea generation;- for the more adventurous, you can also take a  look at the Synectics group brainstorming process, which also dates back  to the 1950's; 8) Go all out to share your knowledge, experience and acumen, locally and globally, orally or in written form, as \"Knowledge Shared is Power Squared\". 9) Make globetrotting a part of your expansive lifestyle, as continual interactions with diverse knowledgeable as well as ordinary folks around the globe often expand and rejuvenate your mental horizons. 10) Last but not least, be humble. Always remember, knowledge building and intelligence amplification is always a work in progress! ",

            "answer_text": "First, understand that \u201cknowledge\u201d is anything that is true\u2014and nothing that isn\u2019t true. More people than not believe many falsehoods to be true. This is so because many, influential and reputable sources are actively engaged in concealing important truths from as many people as will permit it. Don\u2019t permit it. The former group are established, institutionalized, and they have conspired for generations to grow obscenely wealthy by filling the world with lies. Go in search of knowledge\u2014but be warned. There is an unlimited number of wrong answers to every question. Not all popular theories are correct, and not all obscure or maligned theories are incorrect. To sort this out, you\u2019re going to need three things: Judgment. \u201cEducated\u201d only means that you have gone through a process. \u201cFormal education\u201d means it was a process of someone else\u2019s design that happened to acquire a good reputation. None of that guarantees that what you come away with was all that is known\u2014or could be known. You don\u2019t need to trust anyone if you know what they know; create your own belief set. Read, ponder, and re-read until you think you understand, then make your own decision\u2014but always be flexible enough to update your information and your belief set.Character. If you don\u2019t have the guts to stand up to people who are lying and/or are mindless followers, you don\u2019t deserve any truth. Ridicule is part of the standard package of deceivers tactics, so be prepared to stand alone while fools laugh at you. Don\u2019t believe or follow anyone because of who they are, what they own or what they seem to know. Neither do you want to identify yourself by what you know\u2014you are what you do. A collection of knowledge may give you advantages, but someone else always knows more than you.A guy could be right about 99 things, but wrong about one. Be your own man or you\u2019ll never know which one thing he is wrong about\u2014and you\u2019ll be wrong, too. A person of character won\u2019t be susceptible to ad-hominem attacks\u2014arguments that attack a person when his position is too strong to disprove logically. That means even the people you hate the most are probably right about something. Don\u2019t get caught up in joining groups or labeling people who hold opposing views. Learn your own truth.Research. True answers can be found anywhere\u2014but the best stuff is in the places that you\u2019re told not to look. In fact, the more the machine ridicules any particular idea or source\u2014that\u2019s the more you should be curious about what the\u2019re trying to hide. Truth can be concealed behind two things: 1) a lie 2) a person\u2019s desire for ignorance.With the advent of the internet, many great documentaries have become available, and some of us learned many things that government-accredited institutions had decided we didn\u2019t need to know. School is good for what it\u2019s good for, but I learned more from YouTube than I ever learned in a classroom.True answers aren\u2019t always easy, and easy answers aren\u2019t usually true. Pay the price, do the work\u2014or die a fool. Those are your choices. ",

            "answer_text": "I know a person who might seem like he doesn\u2019t know anything. You might be deceived into thinking that he has nothing to contribute. He is silent. He waits for others to speak up. You would think he has nothing to say. But wait for it \u2014\u2014- When he speaks - in his own time, he speaks like he is born to do it. How? How? How? How is he so knowledgeable about so many things? You wonder. Here is analogy for you that can describe my answer in a much better way. What will happen to a sponge when you pour water on it?  It soaks the water. it absorbs the water. That is how my friend gets his knowledge from. He has opened his mind. He listens. He learns from others. He reads and reads and reads as if the secret of the world is found on PAGES. He asks. He asks on things he does know. He asks on things he doesn't know. He chats with people who are much smarter than him all the time. He shares what he knows with others. He holds all sorts of journals and magazines with him all the time. He is a member of many social groups. He takes knowledge from all these things.  You might ask me what has a sponge got to do with my friend\u2019s knowledge. I use the analogy to describe the different ways my friend grasps knowledge. He is always ready and willing to learn. A person who doesn\u2019t read, doesn\u2019t ask, is not willing to learn from others, does not engage with others, does not continue with his/her learning, has stopped pouring knowledge from the outside world is the same as water being poured on to a stone. Everything is being wasted. In this case, not only does knowledge not improve - but the existing knowledge perishes. The most knowledgeable people are always willing to seek, seek knowledge from any external force. This sets them apart from the rest. The drive to seek and absorb new information makes their behavior like the behavior of a sponge. We can say that they are highly curious all the time. They observe their surroundings with a keen and open mind. Just like how a child perceives his environment. We lose this incredible ability as we grow older. We become bored. We become restless. We ignore all kinds of new and old knowledge that is surrounding us. So, I say to you the way to improve your knowledge is to be like a child who is always curious to know and know more or like a sponge that grasps anything from the outside world.  Chaw.

            "answer_text": "1. Read the newspaper. This will allow you to be up-to-date with the latest information and form your own opinions about the articles written. Furthermore, newspapers are a great way to acquire a wide variety of information- not just the ones that you are interested in. 2. Read daily. The best way- in my opinion- to increase your knowledge daily is definitely by reading. Whether you read fiction or non fiction, reading allows you to see things from a totally new perspective. Furthermore, nonfiction books could even be an opportunity for personal development and growth. 3. Watch documentaries or educational videos. I know, this sounds boring, but if you find the right thing to watch it might turn into the best hour you\u2019ve spent watching TV! Discovery Channel, for example, provides excellent documentaries that keep you engaged. If you hate reading, this is an excellent alternative to getting your daily dose of knowledge while still relaxing in your couch! 4. Subscribe to feeds of interesting information. Truth is that we spend hours daily on our phones- specially social media. Why not fill it up with information that will help you grow? Get smarter every day by following pages that post \u201cfun facts\u201d or the news. 5. Work out. Working out, specially doing cardio, is a great way to get your brain flowing and to keep your mental health in shape. It\u2019s also a great way to think through difficult decisions or process new information. 6. Hang out with people who are smarter than you. This may be a no brainer, but it is often overlooked. The people we surround ourselves impact us more than we think, so be sure to surround yourself with smart and motivated people! 7. Play \u201csmart\u201d games. For the competitive soul, I strongly recommend gathering up your friends and playing. It is challenging, including almost every area you can imagine. However, some games, like chess and Scrabble, expand your mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Read. Travel. Watch. Take classes. Talk to experts. Read selectively: Read non-fiction. There are tons of biographies written by authors of reliable standing. I recommend David McCullough and Erik Larson, but there\u2019s many others who write the facts of a person\u2019s life or events in history or science or any subject without including the deep-seated bias that some writers use. Travel: Tours are fine, but I never use them. Get out and meet the \u201cnatives\u201d, the people who actually live there. Talk to them on the train, as you\u2019re walking from one place to the other, on the subway, tube, or Metro. Don\u2019t be intrusive but just chat. It\u2019s interesting. I have taken tours but within the context of where I was. For example, when my daughter and I were at the Vatican, we signed up for a tour through it just to learn what it was we were observing. Same thing in Oxford, England. We signed up for a tour when we visited the Bodleian Library. Travel nearby: I live two hours from Washington, DC. I recently visited the capitol building. There\u2019s the Supreme Court building. Smithsonian, National Gallery, etc. All very broadening. Map out places of interest within a two-hour radius of where you live, make a list then visit them. Documentaries: You can watch documentaries by the hour. Just make sure they are produced, etc by those who have integrity in presenting the facts. Take classes: Be selective of what classes you take. There are community colleges or four-year colleges who allow you to monitor a class. You don\u2019t have to pay but you have the benefit of learning something from experts. Some years ago, an acquaintance of mine even went so far as to call the local high school and monitor a class on world history. She enjoyed it, but I\u2019m not sure many schools would permit it. Talk to experts: No doubt there are many people you know who have careers about which you know little or nothing about. Sit down and listen to what they do. You may be surprised at what you\u2019ll learn. ",

            "answer_text": " The way you improve your knowledge is by comparison. Learning a bunch of random facts or ideas is not going to improve your knowledge. I am making the assumption that what you want is to be wiser, to have more understanding. If I am mistaken in that and what you really want is to know more facts, all you need is an encyclopedia. Start with Volume 1 and read it enough times that you can recall the facts contained within that volume. Then move on to Volume 2. That\u2019s how you become Jeopardy smart. You know a bunch or random facts and can remember them at will. That has nothing to do with knowledge. Well, maybe they are related a little bit; you need to understand the language the facts are communicated with. Other than that, random bits of information do not constitute knowledge. Improving true knowledge is about knowing ideas and facts and then assembling them into an understanding of how the world works. Then the memory of those facts helps you create meaning in your life and helps you understand the world and how other people think. When you understand like that, you have no prejudice and no misunderstanding of how life works and you can live your life understanding how you and your thoughts fit into the world. It\u2019s not that learning a collection of facts is bad, it is a good thing. But it is only a good thing to begin with. True knowledge comes when you do not need to beat someone up with the things you remember and recite at will. True knowledge lets you understand the world. And that is pretty awesome. To increase true knowledge you need to do a few things, none of which are difficult, but all of which are necessary. First you need to realize you can\u2019t possibly know and remember all the discrete pieces of information in the world. There are way too many for anyone to remember and way, way, way too many for anyone to make contextual sense of. Instead, it is OK to realize you don\u2019t know everything, but are willing to lean about anything. That is most crucial idea for a scholar, that they are willing to learn new ideas. Once you accept that premise, the world will become open to you and your quest to make sense of the world. Second, you must be willing to let any piece of knowledge you encounter attach itself to any other piece of information you already know. For instance, if you were a fan of cooking competition TV shows, you know that once the competitors get their assignment for cooking , what they really do is race to get the best cooking utensils for themselves. Not only do they understand cooking, its chemistry and presentation facets, they know they have a much better chance of winning if they can use the best tools. The slower contestants who have not realized this yet, are left with the crappier utensils and almost always lose. They might be better chefs, but they lose the competitions because they cannot create the dishes in the best way possible with poor quality utensils. They already know they need not only f good ideas, but good presentation skills and the best pots and pans to win. They let those ideas hook themselves together without prejudice. Lastly, you need to be accepting of the idea that the way you have stitched your knowledge piece together might not be to your greatest understanding. And you must be willing to change. If you can\u2019t you will be left with trying to defend your system of understanding against competing knowledge frameworks. So that instead of pursuing new knowledge to add to your compendium, you will spend all your energy defending your initial beliefs. And that does not lead to any increase in your knowledge whatsoever. Keep your senses open to learning new ideas and accepting new pieces of data into your understanding of the world. Work with those new thoughts until they fit into your increasingly relevant view of the world, then be willing to present your ideas into the world as a whole. This system works and will help you create the new understandings that all true knowledge seekers aspire to. ",

            "answer_text": "I take the term \"general knowledge\" to mean something like \"knowing a little bit about a lot\". It's the ability to know a lot of details, some plain trivia, some actually meaningful, about a lot of subjects, nothing deep, and no relationship to deductive reasoning.  Eons ago, when I was a wee lad, the main college-admittance test in my country had a section for quantitative reasoning, a section for language arts and deductive reasoning (\"draw conclusions from the following article\"), and a section for \"general knowledge\" where you'd get asked things like \"which of the following composers was active during the Baroque period\" or \"what event triggered World War I\". I think this part was removed from the test, on the grounds that it tests trivial knowledge rather than an ability to think creatively.  Anyway, you gain general knowledge by reading, lots, both fiction and non-fiction. Having a good memory helps, but I don't know that there's much you can do to improve that. Just read. Wander about in Wikipedia, listen to NPR, read things like The Great Philosophers or 1001 Inventions That Changed the World. Those are very, very shallow books, but they throw lots of details at you and help you grow that \"general knowledge\" part of your intellectual arsenal.  My personal bias is that this is something that's useful for a child or teenager to do. Young people are very good at absorbing such details, plus there's the added benefit of stumbling upon something that actually interests them and helping them discover their passion. I think as we get older it's more useful to start going deep, learning the actual ideas in areas that interest us and starting to make deductions, come up with original thoughts, create. Having \"general knowledge\" isn't any of those things, but it's a nice thing to pursue early on. ",

            "answer_text": "I will first point out that there are three stages to understanding, and knowledge is only the first. There is knowledge, then competency then wisdom. In terms of knowledge alone, there are types of knowledge. Two of the most important types are  Descriptive knowledge, which is what we usually think of as knowledge, and Procedural knowledge, which is what you need to hit a ball or play the piano. Intuition (Mind) is very close to procedural knowledge but it can be considered a different type of knowledge in its own right. That being said, I personally started off as a kid reading the encyclopedia. It was my favorite book. Then I read anything I could get my hands on: fiction, science, history, and so on. In this day and age, you can do the same thing with Wikipedia, although I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica Junior, which was geared to eight to twelve year olds, which I was. This gives you a lot of declarative knowledge. But to go further, you need a guru or a teacher. This is because learning procedural knowledge has lots of frustrating dead ends, even for the naturally talented. Better to go through an apprenticeship with someone who has done it before. This is even true for the sciences as well as the arts. That is why there are labs and why graduate school is still a form of apprenticeship. You know you are getting somewhere when you can rely on your intuition. This means that your knowledge is so well integrated it comes naturally. I don't know of any royal road to that except for practice. But with practice you arrive at competence. As far as wisdom, well that is up to you. Some people never attain it. But wisdom is essentially competence transcended. It is competence with a deeper insight. For example, when I married my wife, she already had a nine year old daughter. I soon realized that she was a very gifted and wise parent. If I was puzzled about the way she did things, she could quote all of the texts and popular books on child rearing and why they suggested that they do things this way or that way. But she also knew when the book learning stops and she has to rely on her own hard-earned competence and intuition when the answers don't exactly apply. What she was doing is just the same as any artist or engineer. The book learning is the start, but true knowledge is when you transcend it. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to developing knowledge is really quite simple, and perhaps memorable. To begin, three words are key to this quest. These words are information, knowledge, and application. It is first helpful to determine your preference to for jotting down brief notes. Let us call this our data storage device. If you are the type of person who uses your smart phone for everything, a free notes application is all you need. If you are the type of person who prefers to write with pen, then establish a special notebook, one that will be with you always so make it comfortable. When the moment occurs, and you will know it, jot down anything you hear, see, feel, or read that you find interesting, or appears to you as having some value. I am referring to \u201cinformation\u201d that you can do nothing with at this time. Do not try to remember this information. Some people develop clever memory techniques. Memory is not required in this plan to develop knowledge. Next, you will encounter \u201cinformation\u201d that you can immediately apply. As an example, let us say you are a new mother and just now heard an expert say breast-feeding is healthier for your baby than other types of milk according to scientific research. There is no need to jot this information in your data storage device, nor is there any need to try to remember this information. This \u201cinformation\u201d just became \u201cknowledge\u201d because there was application. If a mathematical equation existed to provide a sum answer for knowledge, it would look like: information plus application equals knowledge. Lastly, what happens to all of those brief notes in your data storage device? As an example, I was asked if I knew the capital of Arkansas. The answer was on the tip of my tongue, but I could not return an answer. I felt foolish because I put myself in a position as knowing the answer, however, I could not produce because at the time of learning the answer I did not have an application, so I did not have this knowledge. Alas! I have a data storage device and I was faithful to record the information. After having been asked the question, I promptly opened my storage device and in alphabet order I found the heading \u201cArkansas Capital\u201d and replied, \u201cLittle Rock\u201d! I then deleted this information from my data storage device, as this \u201cinformation\u201d just became \u201cknowledge\u201d because there was \u201capplication\u201d. ",

I am not saying you to get knowledge with experience and make mistakes in life just look around yourself , try to learn from others mistakes. speak less and listen more . Be a patient listener. don\u2019t judge things too quickly, take time and decide. If you are talking about knowledge in general terms i.e current affairs and history Try to spend 15\u201320 minutes of your life by reading news papers or install any apps of news paper that you find relevant. consider this part of your life try to generate interest and love . don\u2019t consider this as any job otherwise you will get bored.

But learning is learning is learning, no matter what it is you want to learn. So, first of all, read. READ-READ-READ-READ-READ. Then read some more. Read everything. Even read stuff that you hate. Especially if you\u2019re interested in devisive subjects such as politics or religion. The only way to find out what the other side is thinking about a subject like, \u201cAre Republicans really as bad as they say?\u201d or \u201cIs it true that only current members of Westboro Baptist Church are going to heaven?\u201d (I just made those up, BTW), is to read stuff you may not agree with. Sometimes, if a good, logical, compelling argument can be made, you may even change your mind. So, read everything you can get your hands on. If something looks interesting, read more. If it still looks interesting, find a website that features/teaches about/discusses the topic at more length. If you\u2019re still intrigued, take an online class. If you still can\u2019t get enough, enroll at some sort of institute of higher learning; whether that be a trade-school or Harvard Law. Obviously, Harvard Law may have more stringent enrollment requirements than ABC School of Diesel Mechanics down at the local strip-mall. But that\u2019s beyond the scope of this comment. Once you\u2019ve learned everything you can, you may want to make whateveritis a career. Good on ya! Give it all you\u2019ve got. If not, find out everything you can about something else. Remember, learning doesn\u2019t mysteriously stop when you hit your mid-twenties, or early thirties, or late sixties for that matter. Learning is a lifetime endeavour. Contributing and distributing the end-result of that knowledge (with appropriate compensation of course) is also a lifetime endeavor. ",

Wake up a little earlier each day and put in some extra learning time.3. Play audio-books and other audio material in the car or in your headphones when commuting to work.4. Put up a message board where you will see it and constantly add new points to learn.5. Play audio material when doing other things like cooking, taking a bath and running.6. Make a deliberate decision to cut down on certain activities each week, especially procrastinating, and focusing a few hours on self teaching.7. Dedicate your lunch break or other eating break to a time for eating and learning. If you can stomach it \u2013 at the same time!8. Checking email is almost impossible to avoid these days (though reducing time spent reading them will help you make more time for learning), but you might consider building learning into your email-checking ritual.Send yourself an article or something interesting to watch or read every evening (ideally focusing on things that you are working on as part of your self-teaching), to be read at some point the next day.9. Replace TV with learning. Yes, that means turning off the tv and reading instead.10. Use a Kindle or other handheld book storage device, or bring a book around, and read whenever you have an appropriate spare moment.11. Teach others, perhaps even teach as a full-time career. This will make self-teaching part of what you do for a large chunk of the time.As a closing note, you will find it easier to self-teach when you are actually passionate about what it is you are learning, and you get into the habit of learning in a certain way, each day.And a final thought, make sure you allow yourself additional breathing space in the day, to relax or simply do nothing too. A packed day is overwhelming, so no need to over-do it, just take advantage of moments that would otherwise not be used effectively Enjoy! ",

You see, my sister read a lot that time at age 16 or 17, she would tell me whatever she was reading that time like this lady found in the woods , for instance, and couple who found her took care of her, but they were amazed because she would have nightmares in her sleep almost every night. She would talk and shout and scream in her sleep in different languages that they couldn\u2019t understand. Only to find our that she was once upon a time, a princes from a far away kingdom. They were amazed at her regal bearing, her porcelain complexion and her kindness. When I asked my sister - what happened next? She would looked gawked at me and sneered- \u201cRead. Find out yourself\u201d, as she turned her back queenlike. I would grit my teeth and got so fuming mad.

            "answer_text": "To Increase Your Knowledge 1. Read the newspaper. This will allow you to be up-to-date with the latest information and form your own opinions about the articles written. Furthermore, newspapers are a great way to acquire a wide variety of information- not just the ones that you are interested in. 2. Read daily. The best way- in my opinion- to increase your knowledge daily is definitely by reading. Whether you read fiction or non fiction, reading allows you to see things from a totally new perspective. Furthermore, nonfiction books could even be an opportunity for personal development and growth. 3. Watch documentaries or educational videos. I know, this sounds boring, but if you find the right thing to watch it might turn into the best hour you\u2019ve spent watching TV! Discovery Channel, for example, provides excellent documentaries that keep you engaged. If you hate reading, this is an excellent alternative to getting your daily dose of knowledge while still relaxing in your couch! 4. Subscribe to feeds of interesting information. Truth is that we spend hours daily on our phones- specially social media. Why not fill it up with information that will help you grow? Get smarter every day by following pages that post \u201cfun facts\u201d or the news. 5. Work out. Working out, specially doing cardio, is a great way to get your brain flowing and to keep your mental health in shape. It\u2019s also a great way to think through difficult decisions or process new information. 6. Hang out with people who are smarter than you. This may be a no brainer, but it is often overlooked. The people we surround ourselves impact us more than we think, so be sure to surround yourself with smart and motivated people! 7. Play \u201csmart\u201d games. For the competitive soul, I strongly recommend gathering up your friends and playing. It is challenging, including almost every area you can imagine. However, some games, like chess and Scrabble, expand your mind. ",

But he would give you the knowledge with which you could decide what would be best for you to do.Knowledge is NOT just knowing what is written in TEXTBOOKS it is beyond that\u2026 so try to mingle with everyone to gain more knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Read:- Sit down and peruse a journal. Journals typically provide academic research that are longer than magazine articles and use extensive citations. A journal contains very specific information about one particular discipline. Compared to books, newspapers, and magazines, journals are more difficult to access and are more expensive, but provide more detailed and proven information. Socialize with friends, colleagues, and professionals. The more people you come into contact with, the higher possibility to engage in intelligent and informative conversations where you can gain additional knowledge. Attend a seminar or conference. Listening to professionals conducting the seminar or conference will provide you the general knowledge presented a topic. This is important because the presenter is speaking professionally about the methods, approaches, and experiences they encountered while formulating an analysis that took several years to conduct and yield results. Join a book club or social group. Try to expand your experiences and friendships with people who are interested in doing the same thing. Discussing books, current events, history, or politics with others will force you to rely on your general knowledge and to synthesize new information. Play online games or programs that challenge your knowledge. Choose a game or program that involves learning new information, rules, or strategies. hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Essentially, to be knowledgeable, one has to sweat. It is not a thing which is provided to us on a platter. We are constrained to work for in order to enhance our knowledge base. Nobody can say he/she is a \u2018knowledgeable person\u2019 since there is a vast sea of knowledge which is available to be exploited. Only a speck of it is explored and attained. For the knowledge to be attained one has to introspect as to what sort of knowledge one wants to attain and the extent to which he/she is already having. If we want to specialise in one field, then, we can proceed and attain know-how in that field. There are vast sources of knowledge from where you can know about the things. Now a days, internet is one such media through which you can get knowledge on any subject you want. Then there are answer/questions sessions on a variety of subjects. Importantly, it is essential that, for knowledge to be attained one thing should be clear enough is that we have to be student. For that to be a reality, you can get knowledge from the following sources:- From the Informal Institutions such as temple, church, mosque etc.From formal institutions such as school, college, university or professional institutions.Transfer of value systems and traditional mores of behaviour from our family elders.Learning through interaction with others.Learning from the books - general nature, spiritual texts, particular streams etc. whatever our knowledge quest is.After having attained the knowledge, it is in the fitness of things to experience that knowledge practically otherwise knowledge would be of no use. It should always be remembered that mere attaining knowledge is not enough, experiencing the knowledge is a must in order to attain wisdom through its use. For example Demon King Ravana was a great knowledgeable person but did not use that knowledge properly and he committed a folly of abducting Sita Maata and became a cause of death of self and his entire family.

            "answer_text": "Here are the few things which I do prefer for increasing knowledge. 1. Read. Read. Read. You know how people say that the most successful people are always reading? It\u2019s true. Not only does reading expand your knowledge, it also keeps your brain active. You are constantly processing information, and this makes you quick on your feet when it comes to new ideas and innovations. 2. Try something new. Another way to expand your knowledge is to throw yourself into a new situation. By putting yourself in these slightly uncomfortable situations, you are challenging your mind and learning as you go. 3. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. This is the most important one (in my opinion): Ask everyone EVERYTHING. Ask them about their jobs, their hobbies and their interests. People love talking about themselves and what they're good at. You'd be surprised by how much you can learn from your best friend if you just ask the right questions. 4. Watch documentaries or educational videos. I know, this sounds boring, but if you find the right thing to watch it might turn into the best hour you\u2019ve spent watching TV! Discovery Channel, for example, provides excellent documentaries that keep you engaged. If you hate reading, this is an excellent alternative to getting your daily dose of knowledge while still relaxing in your couch! 5. Learn another language. New perspectives can also give you the ability to cross-pollinate cultural concepts and expand worldly inspiration. Sometimes reading a book in its original language will provide you with insights that might otherwise be lost in translation. Divyanshu kumar ",

            "answer_text": "Simple, read a lot of books! However focus on quality, not quantity. Nowadays we live in an era of information overload, and our outdated brain can only process a limited amount of information. So when you look for good books to read you have to do a great amount of filtering. The same is even more true of the internet: there is huge amount of information on the Web, but 99% is rubbish. So you need to proceed with prudence and a very critical mind. Asking the right questions is much more valuable than giving answers. Check all the sources and read a lot of reviews, always question everything. With time you will become better and better to discern good information from useless noise. As you are building up your knowledge, however, you will realise more and more the extent and depth of your ignorance! That is why you will come to appreciate wisdom and practical knowledge. Wisdom comes from a better knowledge of yourself, and it can only be acquired by practise and experience. This is a very valuable knowledge and you start acquiring it right now, by observing or reading about wise people, by writing your diary and by meditating on the meaning of life. I have written plenty of answers about wisdom, so I don't want to repeat myself. How do you become a wise person? Here I just want to point out that too much knowledge can be detrimental to wisdom, so do not fill your precious mind with a lot of useless notions, but focus on the best quality of knowledge. Be always humble and ready to learn new things: in books, during a discussion, in life experiences. There is always some lessons to learn from life, especially during hard times. Have a good path to knowledge! ",

            "answer_text": "Follow these 3 things and feel the difference. Read Books. The first and foremost thing that can help you enhance your knowledge is to read more and more books. You don\u2019t have to go through every single book you come across. Be selective in this case. Choose those books that pique your interest. Another most important thing that you have to keep in mind that, you must read books in your local language ( In case you aren\u2019t familiar with other languages).The purpose should be to enhance your knowledge by digesting more and more information. Learn from the surroundings. This is the most difficult thing is to be an observer. by observing your surroundings- you actually programme your mind to think sharply. This is the best exercise. Now you might be thinking how does observation increase knowledge? The answer of this question is very simple. When you observe, you actually feed your mind with different insight and perspective of life. And most importantly, there is always something to learn from every single thing. As they say: \u201c There is a story behind everything.\u2019 Be a social genius. Since I am a book lover and I do my best to take time for reading irrespective of many obstacles. But I must say what I have learnt from people and from their experiences is unbelievable. Yes, books teach you, but they cannot teach you everything you need in your life to survive. You need some people to change your life and the way you think. I prefer sitting with people who are better than me, and smarter than me. In this way, I get an opportunity of learning very different things from different people. Do remember, if you are sitting in a room and you\u2019re smarter than the people sitting there- it means you are in the wrong room. It means you must surround yourself with always intelligent, smart and sensible people in order to understand the different angle of life. This is what I will suggest you increase your knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "The best ways to gain knowledge ate many. For improving knowledge we cannot stick to just one approach. A few of them which I would like to suggest you are: READ, READ & READ: Pursue a habit of reading as much as you can. This way you will get to learn from other people and even people who existed before you. There is a saying \u201cLearn from other people\u2019s mistakes\u201d.So reading is the best way to do that.ASK PEOPLE: Asking your doubts to people on anything you have, without any hesitation of whether you may sound silly. If you don\u2019t ask then you don\u2019t know & you will always be at the rock-bottom of everything and you will never know the things that you actually didn\u2019t know. So simply ask because what\u2019s the worst that can happen, they may no but if they said \u2018yes\u2019 then you will know something more.TALK TO ELDERS: This is something that I admire the most which are taking to experienced elders who understand you and your generation. For example, Telling you personally, my grandfather is very understandable when it comes to issues that I face and he totally gets away with my ways of doing things. so I discuss issues and other relevant things and even take his pieces of advice on what I can improve in myself. So talk to some really experienced elders if you can.SPREAD YOUR KNOWLEDGE: The best way to gain more and more knowledge is to spread as much knowledge as you can because that will help you in getting your concepts clearer than before and you might learn some new things from the people whom you were actually trying to educate. Because it is always said, \u201cTwo minds are better than one\u201d. So things that are not in your knowledge might strike another person and you may get to know something different.So these were some approaches that I have adapted to in order to get as much knowledge as I can in my everyday life.

            "answer_text": "Get on Youtube! Here are some of my favourites for short videos that give you a buttload of fun facts and information: CrashCourseMinutePhysicsTom ScottVeritasium Most of these have a leaning towards sciency subjects, but that's okay. I loved John Green's \"World History Crash Course\" (top link) and he's expanded the series to include many other topics now (physics, chemistry, politics). You can also pick up magazines at any local/university library; stuff like Scientific American or New Scientist. Really, any non-tabloid magazine/periodical/news paper will give you small chunks of information on various subjects. There's a few things I love about these videos and articles: They're short and can hold my attention span (and I can fit them in while I'm trying to eat lunch at my desk)Typically, they're not too in-depth, so I can still watch them when I'm tired and don't want to concentrate too much. This is also by design, because if something grabs your interest you have some tools to go out there and start digging deeper.They get you thinking about deeper systems that the video's subject is apart of. For instance, I just watched a video about where our tax dollars go and it spoke about government subsidies to polluters versus renewable energy, so it made me wonder about the impact on jobs/the economy if we just cut one off cold-turkey and gave the cash to someone else - some would get new jobs, but others would lose them, so would local politicians allow this, etc, etc...Hope this helps!

All thanks to Tom &Jerry where declaration of americas independence celebration was featured ) If you look around with a curious mind you can increase your GK effectively. But don't forget to verify things in todays world where UNESCO announces best PM of the world. Follow some good fb pages With increased circulations of rumours on internet, fb , among all, has lost most credibility as a source of knowledge but it still can be a great source if you follow some good fb pages , such as The Logical Indian, instead of some shitty pages such as Unbelievable Facts, which quotes its on website as source to anything that it posts. Create your own fb page This thing is difficult and hardwork is required but once you manage to make build your own audience it can help you greatly. I once owned a fb page, General Knowledge, with the fan following of around 1 lakh people. And i was to able clear an entrance exam because of that. When you own a Gk page and you built a good audience, that page would keep you motivated to increase your knowledge base. When the time for making post will come and you wouldn't have anything to post you will search for like crazy, i used to read tons of Wikipedia and and other sources to just get that something. You can also conduct quiz section that also help in increasing your knowledge base News reading/watching These are indeed great sources if you want to increase your knowledge base but these are ,like other sources, are not perfect and need to accepted only after proper application of mind. If you read or see in News paper or on tv don't think that this must be true. The news can be moulded into something different undervthe influence of political parties or TRPs. Words of an anchor are not always absolutely true. Apps I would just add the name of few apps that i really think arevgreat for knowledge building purposeKnappily, Curiousity, In Shorts Gk books Buy only trusted publisher's books ",

            "answer_text": "Knowledge is a facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. To turn out to be an intelligent person, we must keep our mind open to accept new information. Every information is not a knowledge so we have to be selective for efficient reception of knowledge. Here are points I visualised which will surely help to increase the knowledge. Improve synchronisation between your mind and senses to have \u2018eyes\u2019 for the knowledge from experience. Training of mind for accurate observation, reading of situation help receive maximum knowledge in less time frame. Work to keep the focus and attention in the \u2018present\u2019.Main source of the knowledge is our experience. We need to accept new challenges in life to create opportunities, have new experience every time.One can spare slight time for \u2018observation\u2019 of situation handled by others in close environment. Observation practice is very useful and provide valuable knowledge in different subjects beyond imagination. Curious observation always help us to learn reading the situation\u2019 faster with accuracy. In my opinion, observation is one of the best way to improve the personal knowledge.Travelling, Journey, expeditions are nice source to improve knowledge. One can easily notice \u2018all round knowledge\u2019 of people travel more for their job vis-a-vis those who perform static job from home to office and back. We prefer to perform the journey only if we have reasons along with time, money and desire for travel. If anything is lacking then we avoid. Travelling to newer locations is challenge to every mind. It can be fun and excitement if we develop interest. We learn lot of new things from our travelling experience.Interaction. When we establish link with others mind through the interaction, we can learn new things, ideas and thoughts from others. People always gives their best during interaction process. We must volunteer to interact with our known and unknown people, listen to their ideas with patience. We can learn a lot. Select good people for interaction to avoid wasting time on meaningless talks.Reading nice books help us improve fast. Select books with best reviews and spare time to read them. Some all time great books provide us good knowledge of subject and language.Surfing. Yes, googling improves the knowledge. I don\u2019t think it need to explain. Type anything on google and you get lot of links. Different ideas and opinions absolutely free.Watching best-rated movies is fun with entertainment and it help us improve knowledge. Watching educational videos, TED talks etc is a nice source of knowledge. The videos provide us huge information, mind receive it using all the senses, we find lot of information from the same. It is similar to have \u2018live\u2019 experience of situation. We do not remember all the details of videos for long but the meaning extracted by mind stays in our mind for long.Have adequate rest, sleep well. Avoid drugs and addiction. No worries. Enjoy your present and be happy. Take healthy food. This points indirectly affect on functioning of our mind.Please note that doing only one selective thing \u2018all the time\u2019 from the above mention list will provide negative results because different source of knowledge provides different experience to our mind. All round knowledge comes from all the direction. Best way to improve the knowledge is to follow a simple rule in life : Live in present, speak less and listen more. take initiatives in life for positive things, ask more questions and keep the mind open to receive new information. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Good to hear that you're willing to increase knowledge. I'll share with you few things you can do regularly to increase general knowledge. These tricks I learned from one of my classmates, who is an excellent debater and a storehouse of knowledge. Read as much as you can- This is the most important thing if you want to increase knowledge. Read newspaper, it not only increases knowledge but reading skills and vocabulary too. Whenever you go to library, instead of reading novels and story books try reading the magazines there, they are even more interesting and informative. Express yourself and share your knowledge- You must have heard this that by sharing knowledge one enhances their own knowledge. I would suggest you to talk to people, share with them your knowledge. It not only gives you self confidence but improves socialising skills too. Maintain a small G.K notebook- This is really going to help! Maintain a small monthly or a yearly notebook and write something in it. Be it any article, a small paragraph or a piece of information. Then, do remember to take regular revisions. I've been doing this practice since the last 1 year or so and believe me it's worth doing. Join any educational site or subscribe to a YouTube channel- There are a plethora of educational sites you can join. Quora is also a good platform which can be of great help. Subscribe to YouTube channels like Ted Talks, Khan Academy, Unacademy, study IQ education etc, they are amazing. Don't hesitate to learn from someone- Yes, it's very important to develop a leaning attitude. Be it a younger person or an elderly, always try to learn from the them. Don't feel belittle when someone tries to teach you, instead be thankful to them. Talk to knowledgeable people- Find someone around you who has a good knowledge. Try to learn from them, examine what extra effort they put which makes them extraordinary. Thanks for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "To know more about yourself I suggest you attempt any / some or all of the following: Introspect - Sit down alone and visualize your journey through life thus far. Pay attention to the graces you are blessed with, the challenges that have impacted you, the great moments of your life, the lowest point of your life, the people who have had a significant impact in shaping you, the people who have had a more problematic relationships with etc. The idea is to capture significant touch points in your life and to become of how they have shaped you to be what you are today. Also visualize what you plan for yourself in the future, the critical milestones you have to focus on to achieve it, the metal blocks that are limiting your progress and the motivation and drive that is helping you pursue your dreams.Goal setting - Check out SMART goal setting and using that frame work write down your goals for your personal life, your professional life, your social life, your financial freedom, your self improvement plans, your relationships etc. Written goals will help you structure your thoughts more concretely, help you draft it appropriately and give you something tangible to work on and frequently looking it at will give you the impetus to keep focus and work towards your goals.Personal SWOT analysis - This is a variation of introspection but it will help you narrow your thinking into identifying your personal strengths and weakness based on which you can visualize the potential opportunities for you to explore and the possible threats because of your limitations that make you vulnerable. You can then work on leveraging your strengths and take action on overcoming your limitations that become a threat to your personal success and growth.JOHARI Window - This is a tool to self discovery. It helps you become aware of the OPEN BLIND FACADE and UNKNOWN aspects of yourself. While you can read up on it online, it is best you take the help of someone more knowledgeable about the technique to mentor / guide you in using it. You may make some surprising conscious discoveries about your own self in the process.There are other techniques / tools / systems / theories that require some expert help / guidance. Some of them include Transaction Analysis (T.A.) / Emotional Intelligence / DiSC profiling etc.What is more important is the action plan you have lined up post the self discovery process. It is how you proactively respond to the knowledge you have about yourself that will determine your success and happiness. I would also invite you to visit my Inspirational and Motivational Blog Actspot's Blog to get some additional inputs and also practical exercises for you to attempt and benefit from in the TRY THIS activities listed at the end of each blog post.

            "answer_text": "Personally, my experience has been that in order to acquire true knowledge, we must give up seeking. Seeking itself implies lack and can become habitual. I know. I have done it for years and years. It was not until I gave up seeking that I was able to begin interacting with truth. The best advice I can give is that true knowledge never comes in words. Words cannot express the inexpressible. Truth can be experienced and, if you are lucky, dwelt in but it can never be quantified or rationalized. The best we can do is paint pictures of it after-the-fact through words and art; however, these are only signs of truth's existence and a subjective rendition, one part but not the whole. True knowledge will be experienced and described differently by you than me but in true knowledge we are one and the same. Even my attempt at answering your question here is essentially meaningless. For me to encourage you to cease your seeking is a waste of time. Your seeking will end when you have exhausted all means and only then. It is at this end-of-the-line state of meaninglessness, this cry out to whatever, whoever is there in a state of desperation, which defies ones own beliefs even to get some answer that you have no choice but to give up. It is here that we are too exhausted to go on. It is here that we give up our seeking. It is here that we give up hope. It is here that we no longer attempt to conceptualize the truth. It is here we give up our version of it and space is created for the truth you seek to come in. We experience it first and then share it as best we can with the world. We cannot conceptualize it first and hope to ever experience it. I personally do not believe there is anything one can do to reach it. I believe we all must move forward in our journey, no shortcuts. We must walk our own personal path and there are no directions or handbook. Good luck on your journey. ",

Never expect things as it is! Work hard. Do whatever it takes! Learn from everyone! Never show ego. Share knowledge to others when you get it! Always try to be better. Never get satisfied!

Books- Books are an endless source of knowledge and it is not like Internet where you can will find Aliens are behind the recent Analytica scandal. While seeking out for knowledge, genuine sources are an important factor and nothing can be much more genuine from books. Read as many books as possible and don\u2019t try to remember everything written in the book but try to grab the things which matters the most. Like when we go near an Apple tree, we don\u2019t bring back everything from the tree like its branches, leaves, we only bring back what\u2019s important to us and that is the Apple. People- Nothing can teach you a better lesson than experience itself. Meeting people with great source of knowledge is an art of filling your brain of treasure with the pearls of information. They have real life experiences and nothing can beat that in terms of knowledge. So go out, meet people with specialization in the field of knowledge you want to seek. Talk to them, spend time with them and without any effort you will see the up gradation of knowledge in yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "The thought of increasing the knowledge in itself is the first step towards increasing your knowledge. I would suggest few methods I follow to increase my knowledge. Reading -This includes reading newspapers,books,magazines etc. Reading newspapers will increase your vocabulary and speed of reading. Novels be it fiction or non fiction especially biographies of renowned scientists or famous people would be a great start for an intermediate reader. Magazines like India Today, Sports Star etc. also gives a good amount of knowledge. One more advice on how to not lose motivation in reading books. Set an account on Goodreads. There you can set a target on how many books would you like to finish at the end of a year and keep updating it and try to gift yourself at the end of the year if you achieve it. Knowledge Transfer- Try to get knowledge transferred from your peers or colleagues or friends by interacting with them about the topics they are strong in.Keep yourself surrounded by knowledgable people. Don\u2019t let your ego come in the way of learning when the knowledge is from juniors or peers who are younger than you. Online Courses-If you are tech or engineering savvy, there are many online courses or commonly known as MOOC\u2019s in sites like Lynda, Coursera, Udemy, Khanacademy, MITCourseware etc. and register for the courses which you are interested in. Complete the course and get a certificate once you successfully complete it. Online videos- Subscribe to youtube channels like TED, Unacademy etc. and watch them whenever you are free. Blogs- Technical blogs also helps in increasing your knowledge by a huge amount. Medium and Wordpress are the best way to read and gain knowledge. Knowledge is not only limited to academics and books. Learning photoshop, drawing, painting etc. can increase creativity. Being said that these are few things which came to my mind. There might be other answer which would be interesting to you and you can always pursue whichever you want! :) ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s be clear, you mean \u201ceverything knowable.\u201d There are some things humans can\u2019t physically know. For a silly example, imagine having eyes on the sides of your head. Each eye would see a totally different thing. Human brains can\u2019t imagine that in any coherent way. The best we can do is imagine looking back and forth between two different pictures very rapidly. But that\u2019s not what bird brains do. They process those two images into one experience in a way that our brains simply can\u2019t. Second, to be sure, you mean \u201ceverything knowable in the time available.\u201d Obviously you aren\u2019t asking \u201chow do I find a perfect library with all the world\u2019s knowledge, so I can sit in it and read everything that\u2019s there until I die?\u201d The best response to that might be a link to some really comfortable reading chairs. But if you don\u2019t just want to read things until you die, you surely want some time left for doing other stuff. Third, I think it can be assumed, you mean \u201ceverything knowable in the time available apart from the other important things I want to do.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, if there are other important things you want to do, it\u2019s going to take time to learn about them, of course. So it actually comes to \u201ceverything knowable in the time available, apart from the other important things I want to do, and apart from the time necessary to learn how to do those things.\u201d In my humble opinion, there\u2019s not going to be a ton of time left over after learning how to do the things you want to do, and actually doing them. So little time will be left, I would guess, that the idea that you could pack \u201clearning everything\u201d into it would be highly unlikely. But there just might be enough time for Game of Thrones\u2026 ",

Let me tell you how. What you shouldn't read? Local political news, News regarding rapes, extra-marital affairs. Why? Such News are spiced up to attract people who touch Newspaper for time pass. It is obvious that there is no legitimate knowledge in such news. Also, don't read trending news and waste time. The news is trending already, most probably everybody around you knows about the news. They will be eager to discuss about the newly acquired knowledge about the trending news, so naturally you will get to know about it from them. Also, newspapers cover minute details of the trending news which I feel is not so important. Now coming to what should be read, Finance news, New plans and commissions by the ministry and government, News related to country's economy. Such things affect your life straightaway, so it is important to update yourself with it. If you are able to get the point in the heading of a News, then don't get it to minute details. It may take not more than half an hour to cover the entire Newspaper if you follow the above points, at the same time enriching your knowledge. If you want to develop knowledge in a particular field, then Books are the ultimate resource. Adding to that surrounding yourself with the people who are already in that field can do wonders to your knowledge. ",

I know lots of self proclaimed \u2018guru\u2019 Entrepreneurs claim they read a book a day, but that\u2019s technically impossible with the amount of time you have in a day. Social media is another great way. Read all the blog posts, tweets, facebook posts, of every major digital news magazine out there, like Wall Street Journal, Entrepreneur, etc - tho I am not a fan of their paywalls, you can get around it. Practicing new languages is another great way to not only learn new languages, but also learn cultures, histories and be appreciative more towards the whole world. I myself speak Japanese, Chinese, French, and learning Korean. I\u2019m told I also know English, but it\u2019s mostly gibberish, haha. A great way to also get knowledgeable is to network, meet new people, share stories. Grow your professional network. Learn what other people do, listen to their stories of their careers and lives.

You can do basic things and you will see that magically (ok not magically) you are slowly gathering information from various sources. The best, most accurate, most effective and efficient way is READING. Not that you've got to start reading articles to rocket science , start simply and slowly, read answers on qoura, google intriguing topics, follow the links you come up to in the process. You can read books ,that will help you with words and strengthen your vocabulary \u2026use a dictionary whenever you come across a new word . You can also search for an interesting topic for e.g. I find celestial bodies outer space theories etc interesting so sometimes I Google them , other times I find it on quora and so on . So now probably you get that reading in itself is sufficient. You can also follow newspaper or can keep a news app etc \u200bfor current affairs. Talking about stuff with people also can help to a great extent it's not the best of ways but doesn't harm to talk for sometime about random stuff. Basically that's it, all depends upon how you garner the information provided to you this is the most important thing. Well happy garnering ;-) Gracias. ",

            "answer_text": "We all acquire knowledge in a similar way. We don\u2019t have different learning styles, right/left brain advantages, photographic memories; nor speed reading advantages, or brain development inappropriateness. If you are eight years old you could be programming organs in RNA. You just need to master the prerequisites. [1] One of the most effective approaches to acquiring knowledge is teaching. This is how Richard Feynman acquired knowledge. He selected a concept then taught it to an imaginary person. He spoke, wrote, and drew the concept to his \u2018student\u2019. When he got stuck or felt that an explanation was too wordy, he went back to the reference material. He continued this process until he could recall everything using simple explanations and analogies. [2] The key is to acquire small chunks of knowledge and then apply them in different ways. Input, process, output. Teach, solve problems, or build something. Retrieving information from memory is the process of learning. When you use information in a new setting, that\u2019s when you start understanding it. [3] To strengthen this process you can leverage five principles: Take breaksPlan and structure your learningHook your knowledge into multiple pieces of informationCreate a system for identifying knowledge blind spotsLeverage your emotionsBreaks enable you to remember knowledge longer. When you first acquire a piece of knowledge it expires in a few seconds/hours. To increase the expiry time, retrieve the knowledge just as you are on the point of forgetting it. This will prolong your memory. In the beginning take minute-long breaks, then increase the knowledge-specific breaks to hours, days and months. [3] Breaks also enable you to process a broader set of information. Focus narrows the activity to a small part of your brain. Some problems and concepts require that you use a broader set of information to understand them. This happens when you take breaks. [4] Structuring your learning improves retention, motivation, and clarity. Steve Wozniak did this. First he mapped out the prerequisites to build a proof of concept, the Apple 1. Then, for each new iteration of the Mac he could reuse that knowledge. This enabled him to deepen his knowledge. Since he had the trunk of the knowledge \u2014 the 80% that mattered \u2014 he could also attach the branches and the leaves. [5] When you structure your learning, add the same lenses: Frequency, value, and prerequisites. Which concepts will you need 80% of the time? What is the quickest way to add genuine value? How can I map out the prerequisites that are specific to my challenge? [6] Hook your knowledge into more information so that accessing it becomes easier. This refers back to a discovery in neuroscience: neurons wire together if they fire together. [7] To use this facet, study in various differing environments, use multiple senses, and apply your knowledge in various ways. If you need to recall knowledge for a specific occasion \u2014 say a presentation \u2014 do the opposite; study in an environment similar to the one where the knowledge will be used. This will make it more accessible in that type of environment, but less retrievable otherwise. Knowledge blind spots create failures. You run out of motivation and resources while learning things that you don\u2019t need. They also decrease your knowledge acquisition. Your ability to acquire knowledge depends on your working memory, which becomes overloaded when you have significant gaps in your knowledge. This reduces your capacity to transfer knowledge to your long-term memory \u2014 your ability to acquire knowledge. [8] To avoid blind spots, take advantage of other\u2019s learning journeys, have mentors, and gain feedback. This is not news for many. Still, we seldom notice our blind spots. That\u2019s because we lack a prerequisite: Character. We are afraid of being vulnerable. [9] The final tactic for knowledge acquisition is controlling your emotions. What you find emotionally engaging is what you will think about, talk about, and work on. That\u2019s the knowledge you will retain. Memory champions leverage this. They symbolize numbers in shocking mental images. Then they place the images in an imaginary house and create a story line. This skill allows them to remember long sequences of numbers. It\u2019s a skill anyone can develop. [10] From a macro perspective, Steve Jobs took advantage of the same principle. He grew an emotional engagement to computers. He day-dreamed about them, talked about them, and worked on them. That\u2019s how he acquired and grew his knowledge of them. Let\u2019s sum it up: Acquire chunks of knowledge and apply them in different settings.Take breaks to improve your memory and your ability to solve problems.Structure your learning. Map out prerequisites, and start with concepts that you need 80% of the time. Prioritize knowledge that adds genuine, direct value.Learn in differing environments, work with knowledge in differing ways and use multiple senses.Read other\u2019s learning journeys, have mentors, and gain feedback. Work on your ability to be vulnerable in order to do all of this effectively.Leverage your emotions by making information and problems more engaging.

            "answer_text": "Personally, there are three basic ways to boost our knowledge. Read \u201cThe book is the ladder of the progress of mankind\u201d as Gorky said. So, how to interpret \u201cthe book\u201d here, I believe it\u2019s knowledge. However, we should see reading from two facets. On the one hand, for our career development or academic achievements, having some books with particular expertise is important, because we have to gain a deep understanding of professional knowledge and then make most use of it to better apply. On the other, a good read for our non-working life will help us become wise and open-minded. When I was little, I went to bookstores reading and got the general image outside of my small city. Four years before in my high school and then I got into a university, I started reading some masterpieces and books that I read before, I got a completely different feel about them, which partly indicated my knowledge had been improved that time. ( Unfortunately, it\u2019s been almost 3 years I read nothing because of my stupid pursuit of only-expertise and something to do with my personality. Luckily, after being enlightened by my dearest friend, I tried to start reading again) Communications We humans are social beings. In the workplace, we communicate information basically relevant with our expertise. Outside the work, we are supposed to meet more people in different fields. I have former classmates currently majoring in a wide range of areas, such as music, literature, finance,mathematics, biology, chemistry etc., I talked with them having fun and taking in much seemingly useless knowledge, which provided a unique lens for me to know the world and society. ( The reason why I adopted the past tense is I changed a lot and became more reserved recently. It\u2019s a shame that I can sense I lack some ability to interact with people and also, both the depth and breadth of knowledge I gained dropped apparently. Encouraged by the same person as mentioned above, I tried to reach out to people first.) Travel Compared with above ways, traveling may cost more, I mean, economically, but the upside is we can get first hand sources in person. My university is located in a metropolis, while my hometown is in a small city instead. I was amazed by the sense of a commercial district and impressed by the history wherever I had been to. Not only had I seen pictures or descriptions from a book, I was also able to touch the real existence of knowledge and relate to authors writing stuff their times. I\u2019m currently in Boston in the U.S., another country to me. I am completely attracted by the cultures and traditions of New England as well, prompting me to go check out new places on a regular or frequent basis and have in more knowledge to become knowledgeable both academically and in daily life.

Knowledge flows towards only those people who fall in love with it. Keep yourself consistently updated with all the hustle bustle happening around.2. Read as many books as you can. Best and reliable source of knowledge. One of the best ways to improve on your knowledge is to read the newspapers & magazines. Cultivating a habit of daily scanning the newspaper will keep you updated on the current events happening around the world. The Internet if used in a positive manner is a treasure trove of information. Sites like Wikipedia have lots of content which can be used to gain knowledge. Google has got answers for anything and everything. All you have to do is just google. 3. Try to share your thoughts to your friends or to whom you want. 4. While in breakfast, lunch and in your free time, Open YouTube and watch the live news channels, debates, video lectures, quality movies and National Geography channels. Watch documentaries about topics that interest you; watch TED talks. 5. Practice writing. Put your thoughts into writing. Writing helps to digest your knowledge better. 6. Interaction with people is another practical method of improving your knowledge graph. Every thing in the world provides you some kind of knowledge. No knowledge is valueless. So try to learn from everything you go through. Start doing! Start absorbing! Start learning. Gnandeep Chakri ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your interests and to a certain amount, your society and family. Knowledge = primarily scientific facts. You are capable of remembering a staggering amount of information. What you lose however, is the capability to access the info after not using it for a period of time. Furthermore, you cannot make long-term memory unless you short memory is excellent. If you do not re-enforce the info in your short-term memory within 24 hours, you lose 50% during the day after. I think it is best not to bother learning anything you are sure you will not need (this is difficult). You can improve gaining knowledge by reading source written papers and remembering it. Next, get as close to the source of knowledge as you can. If you can be in the area where knowledge is actually being discovered, you will learn and retain nearly all. If you have to get the same knowledge from a technical magazine or reports, you can only learn about 75% of what is required. If you read knowledge written by the individual who discovered it\u2014for example something in math, astronomy, particle physics, or something like that, you will understand it 5 times better than the same info from a popular magazine. If you are very young, copy this and keep it. It will make sense later and if your rather young, the truth is, you have about all you can handle right now. Absorb everything in school, but don\u2019t believe it is all the truth, question it a little. Try to figure out what career you want to follow as early as possible, remember: if you don\u2019t know where you are going, any path will take your there. Also, a job started, is half finished. ",

            "answer_text": "Warren Buffet once said : \u201cRead 500 pages everyday. That\u2019s how knowledge works. It builds up like compound interest.\u201d In order to improve your knowledge in any field you should read as much as you can regarding that particular topic. Let\u2019s take an example: Elon Musk, one of the greatest businessman of all time, in his young days used to read around 60 books in a month that makes 2 books a day. And by reading I not only mean reading your text books but also some other sources as well like newspapers etc.  Warren Buffet once quoted : \u201cIf book knowledge made great investors, then librarians would be all rich.\u201d You must have a keen interest in reading stuff about things as well. Because if you don\u2019t have interest it all goes in vain. At last I would sum up my answer by sharing this amazing quote with all you guys : \u201cWithout passion you don\u2019t have energy. Without energy, you have nothing.\u201d Thanks for reading. -Gaga ",

            "answer_text": "First ask yourself what you need to know. Then ask yourself a more probing question: what is it you don't know you need to know.  Then ask yourself how to find out what you don't know you need to know. When the process is under way, start asking yourself why you need to know what you know you need to know, but also why you need to know what you don't know you need to know. To do that you must come into contact, as intimately and honestly as possible, with other people, people you can trust and/or admire. If they are truly trustworthy, they will help you to understand what you need to know now and, more significantly, what you may need to know later. They won't tell you; they'll help you discover. They will also help you to understand the value of what you already know. They may be teachers, mentors, trainers, coaches, peers , friends or the myriad voices of authors you read, people you will never meet but with whom you may establish a deep communion. If they are trustworthy you will discover that they themselves are engaged in dialogue with their own teachers, mentors, peers etc. and their dialogue will teach you more about what you need to know. The dialogue may be with words, ideas, music or forms. It will engage your senses and define your ideals. You will never stop needing. You will never stop learning. To sum up,  learning is based on curiosity, then wonder (especially discovering what others find wonderful), then dialogue and therefore collaborative exchange. Learning is social as well as personal. It is, in itself, a culture (artistic, social, professional, spiritual) and it is the source of all future culture. ",

But there are different type of ways to be knowledgeable about something, the \"utilitarian\" way and the \"historical\" way.The first one has to do about knowing the limitations, benefits, conditions,logistics and economical aspects of something. The historical way would be know about its origin, line,upcoming versions, succesors, predecesors, and reasons why These Things happened. Even the Evolution of the topic is Knowledge that one can use to impress others. For example lets talk about Computer Components, first you would Need to learn the basic Details which includes: \"how does a computer work\" and \"what does every part of a computer does\". These are basic concepts that you will Need to grasp either way.So first you would Research that until you can talk about it comfortably, and then you will naturally move into either learning about the Computer Components Scene naturally wether it is the Evolution of the standards, or the limitations of older hardware. I am sure there is atleast one topic that is recurrent on your daily life, for example most people learn a lot about cars and smartphones because when they feel like spending money on something they usually Research their options deeply, since they want to buy the correct one. Everyone is an \"Expert\" in atleast one Topic be it shoes, cars, smartphones, Farming, Cooking, TV series, Cartoons, Computer Games, Makeup, Dogs, Local eatery, ETC. I personall always find myself reading random Things off Wikipedia be it about Biology, Medicine, History, Video Games, and Biographies. For example reading about Janis Babson was great, Reading about Sharks, and carnivorous whales is also great. Orcas are an amazing read everytime such amazing and unbelievable animals. With Wikipedia and Quora i would make sure to read only about strictly objective topics with a basis on science, this is because subjective topics go political pretty quickly and everybody is trying to convince with a mix of half trues and half lies. But do try to read about history, War History is an extremely addictive read.The Civil war is also a very interesting read because it breaks a lot of the preconceptions that the innocent contemporaneans might have about US politics. Slavery is also a great read, which were the first countries to abolish it, which countries practice it to this date etc. You are gonna have learn the expressions \"De Jure\" and also \"De Facto\".

Imho, the best and surest way to do that is to fight your way through a book by Dr. Miriam Joseph, The Trivium. It sure won\u2019t be easy, but if you do that and apply the lessons therein, you will be better educated than 95% of the public and 100% of Congress. And your command of language will astound others, and that\u2019s what makes one appear smart. And it damn sure won\u2019t hurt your future income options. Government enforced indoctrination institutes (schools) don\u2019t promote this because they are influenced by corrupt social controllers in order to keep their hidden agenda of suppressing the truth from the public. I did psychometric testing for 20 years and here\u2019s my take on assuring personal development. In the 60s when I was in grad school, the clinical definition of intelligence was \u201cthe ability to discern similarities and differences\u201d which cannot be accurately determined by a generalized numerical value such as IQ. Those tests are just not comprehensive enough to be of much value except perhaps to provide bragging rights for the class wise-ass. If you really want to know what your intellectual values are, spend a day and a half and pay $600 to take the comprehensive tests offered by the Johnson O\u2019Connor Foundation which puts a numerical value on 19 aptitudes (inborn talents) which together compose \u201cintelligence\u201d - along with lifetime institutional support. I have no connection to this foundation but I find their testing sooooo much better than the usual short and incomprehensive tests I was forced to administer by colleges and commercial personnel departments in the past. (Aptitude Testing and Research since 1922) The result is a comparative graphing of your talents that you can use for the rest of your life to guide you toward occupational and social successes leading to genuine feelings of accomplishment. It\u2019s actually one of the most life-enriching things I, and the rest of my family, have ever discovered. Btw, I get no benefit whether you do this or not - except for a good feeling if you let me know you took the tests. Best of luck. ",

For example if you want to know more about airplanes talk to a pilot that actually flies they may in turn refer you to yet another pilot who is in the field you are talking about. Remember what ever you want to know about get as close to the source as you can to ask questions. People involved in a particular area know the most about it. Sometimes people do not want to ask question\u2026so go to another person in the same field. For example if you want to know about a mental disease ask a doctor if possible if ask a psychologist. Learn by asking and writing down what you learn. People who actually are involved in what you want to know give the best answers. Otherwise go to a very good reference book. What is that?? That is where you find answers for questions. Also go to college to ask questions. Do not be put off you learn the most by not giving up. That is was a reporter does for his or her living and they go to no end to find out things. ",

This should lead you to learn almost everything that is possibly available. It's not necessary that all the questions have answers each time but the important part is the build the tree of knowledge. For example, you started learning the numbers. Let's say 0 is the first digit you've learnt. Now go with the framework. Who? Aryabhatta Why? Due to difficulty in counting ( leads to the next why\u2014 why was it difficult) Where? Somewhere in India (even I don't know the exact place but this tells you that aryabhatta was from India) When? Somewhere in between 476\u2013550 CE How was it discovered? No idea How was it used? The whole number system. This is probably the most important invention in mathematics. For every answer, ask the same questions again. Soon you'll see the tree of knowledge building. Everything will lead to everything else eventually. Happy learning. ",

(Maybe start with Bill Bryson's books) Audiobooks are the easier way to do books. You can play many of them on 1.5x speed to save time, and can multitask most books with most activities. I listen to books while I play games that don't have any cut scenes or important text I have to read. (It makes it easier to focus on the book without feeling bored) Documentaries are great. TED Talk videos are the easier way to do documentaries. Podcasts are great, but they should be followed up by talking to smart people whenever you get the chance, and then afterwards researching the claims those smart people made during the discussion. Same goes for the claims you hear made in podcast episodes. If you do this excessively for just 2 years, by the end of the two years you will have exceptional general knowledge and will be able to hold a conversation with nearly everyone on practically any subject. \"Yeah so I've recently got into sailing.\" \"Sailing?

            "answer_text": "Just use it. Seriously. Like your muscles, your brain is a use-it-or-lose-it kind of thing. The good news is, you don't have to go to a gym. First of all, you've got to accept that you're smarter than you think you are. For the past couple of generations, we've all been raised from the cradle having our intelligence insulted on a daily basis, from television, advertising, politicians, our less-than-shining school system, all the way down to signs telling us how to cross the street and cup lids warning us, in case we didn't know, that coffee is hot. What is a \"normal\" level of intelligence is higher than most people think it is. It's actually normal to be smart. Being stupid is not normal, it's just more common. Intelligence isn't about knowing stuff, it's about being able to learn stuff. You have to want to learn, to enjoy knowledge for its own sake. Knowing something is much more fun than not knowing something. When you see or read or hear a reference you don't know, look it up. Ever heard the word \"floccinaucinihilipilification?\" Have you ever seen a tardigrade? Do you know where the Pleiades are? Look them up. Seriously, look them up right now. Open a new tab in your browser and google them. Do it. Watch documentaries, especially science documentaries. Watch \"Q.I.\" also called \"Quite Interesting,\" possibly the greatest TV show of all time. You can find episodes of it on YouTube (a weird place to go to increase your intelligence!). Pick one at random and watch it. If that doesn't grab you (or if it does), try TEDtalks, Vsauce, The Slo Mo Guys, Smarter Every Day... Just don't read the comments. All much easier to understand than they sound. (You still have that tab open, right?) Don't be intimidated by technology, either. Get some piece of junk out of the trash and take it apart, see if you can figure out how it works. For extra credit, see if you can put it back together again without any parts left over (it's okay if it still doesn't work.) There's a great book called \"The Way Things Work,\" that explains pretty much everything in the world. Once a month, go to the library (they still exist) and pick any book at random, something you think you wouldn't be interested in, and read it anyway. \"Feel the burn.\" When you feel that point coming when you throw your hands up and go \"I don't know,\" work through that to the other side. Being confused doesn't feel very good. But it's better to work at a problem until you solve it, than to leave it forever unfinished. Puzzles are always good. Any kind of puzzle. Crosswords, Sudoku, Jumble, jigsaw puzzles, riddles, Where's Waldo, anything. (Except the Rubik's Cube. That thing is evil.) Think of knowledge as being like a martial art. You may never actually need it, but it feels good to walk into a bar and think to yourself, \"I could kick everybody's ass at chess.\" \"A simple rule that every great man knows by heart, 'It's smarter to be lucky than it is lucky to be smart.'\" ",

When one can easily recall pieces of memory to put them together in logical way, and it makes sense, one is generally knowledgeable or even a genius depends on the knowledge, whether it is about science, religion, or important issues needed in the right moment. Some people can store significant amount of knowledge (useful memory). Some people can store and recollect significant amount of knowledge at the right time. Some people can learn fast. Some have fast intellect. Some are good at recollecting. Some are good at logical thinking. People are not the same. Some are slow learner but good at critical thought, and vice versa. They just read, have experience, listen, see, think and analyse the information and keep both raw and refined information in their memory. Thus, they are the learned. One needs to understand one\u2019s strength. But young people cannot know themselves yet. It would be good if some adults in their lives realize their potentials. Knowing the truth is better than knowing a lot. One must be certain about the facts as the facts, fiction as fiction and falsies as falses. Usually, remembering everything is impossible so those people access to library, internet\u2026 They also have a collection of books\u2026 Having access to information is the key factor. Debate with adults or listening to the debates can increase knowledge fast too because the learned people know what to say. Debates are available on youtube\u2026 Internet gives access to various authors, debaters\u2026 Analyse the information, make research, seek for various sources\u2026 Here one needs to spend a lot of time doing these things in order to collect sufficient resources, including contradicting information.

No. But those who can, should. ",

Not only should you never stop asking questions\u2026 You should try to ask questions, to which people go, \u201cGood Question\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s a really good question.\u201d In other words, thoughtful questions. Of course, people will say, \u201cThere\u2019s no such a thing as a stupid question\u201d. But there are stupid questions. Asking people about their age, wage, income, marital status and wealth are some that come to mind. Keep in mind, stupid questions are all in the person realm. There\u2019s no stupid technical question. If you are trying to learn a trade or skill, or become familiar with the tasks in a job, ask any and every question that comes to your mind. Don\u2019t hold back, thinking \u201cThis is a stupid question.\u201d There are no stupid questions. Questions are related to curiosity. Curiosity can be healthy or unhealthy. For example, besides being curious about people\u2019s age, wage, income, marital status and wealth, you can be curious about the sensational. Or\u2026\u2026 you can be curious about something which will be useful and meaningful in your life. Which one do you think is better to feed your mind with? Which one do you think will expand your horizons? Aim for expanding your horizons. Because, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \u201cThe mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\u201d ",

Knowledge, if gained through your own conscious mind, it\u2019d prevail as long as possible and as best as possible. So buddy, if you want to increase your knowledge daily, just observe anything. For example, I just used my calculator which sucked a bit. I typed 54/4 on it and it got me the same 54/4 as a fraction. I had to use another function to get it in decimal form. So, I randomly started searching for the calculators out there and surprisingly found the current technological calculators which have reached such a level that you can do nearly anything in it. They\u2019re programmable plus, they\u2019re just awesome. So, whenever you find a problem and you want some free time, maybe search on other aspects of that problem as in just scrolling or browsing through some information or reading some books. Being curious about anything can gain you knowledge. So, just be curious at times and try to find something new everyday! Cheers! ",

Internal knowledge helps a person in thinking in his level best. External constitutes understanding nature. According to my experience we can better start working with ourselves first.after internal knowledge gain we can start learning about the subject.

Here are some of them: 1, Reading books: It\u2019s the best way to improve our knowledge, unfortunately, people now don\u2019t usually read books. Most of their time is spent on social network. You should choose a book that matches your knowledge level. If it is too complicated, you won\u2019t understand and learn anything. Try to read a book over and over again if you don\u2019t understand some parts of it. If you already understand it all, you should still read it more than two times. 2, Read newspapers and magazines: By doing this, you will not only enhance your knowledge but also keep up with all events in the world. It mainly improve your knowledge in politics, society and sports (also other aspects like economy ). 3, Make most use of the Internet: You can read news on the internet, subscribe for daily articles, join some courses online. Websites such as Khan Academy, Highbrow, Coursera, etc are very helpful. You can watch videos on Youtube, too. Some of my favorite chanels are Crash Course, SciShow, Ted-Ed, TED. You should have this app on your phone too: Curiosity - C\u00e1c \u1ee9ng d\u1ee5ng d\u00e0nh cho Android tr\u00ean Google Play 4, Do some trivia quizzes and share knowledge with friends: It\u2019s fun and help you relaxed while learning.

I give you eleven! 1. Read in bed before you fall asleep instead of watching films or tv. 2. Wake up a little earlier each day and put in some extra learning time. 3. Play audio-books and other audio material in the car or in your headphones when commuting to work. 4. Put up a message board where you will see it and constantly add new points to learn. 5. Play audio material when doing other things like cooking, taking a bath and running. 6. Make a deliberate decision to cut down on certain activities each week, especially procrastinating, and focusing a few hours on self teaching. 7. Dedicate your lunch break or other eating break to a time for eating and learning. If you can stomach it \u2013 at the same time! 8. Checking email is almost impossible to avoid these days (though reducing time spent reading them will help you make more time for learning), but you might consider building learning into your email-checking ritual. Send yourself an article or something interesting to watch or read every evening (ideally focusing on things that you are working on as part of your self-teaching), to be read at some point the next day. 9. Replace TV with learning. Yes, that means turning off the tv and reading instead. 10. Use a Kindle or other handheld book storage device, or bring a book around, and read whenever you have an appropriate spare moment. 11. Teach others, perhaps even teach as a full-time career. This will make self-teaching part of what you do for a large chunk of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "What knowledge you are referring. If it is divine knowledge then the answer is as follows: The divine knowledge exhibited by God is always true and infinite as said in the Veda (Satyam jnanam anantam...). The basic truth is very simple and can be presented briefly like this: \u201cThe absolute God being the creator of this space is beyond the spatial dimensions and is unimaginable. Such God gets Himself mediated through energetic form for the sake of souls existing in the energetic bodies in the upper world and such divine form is the energetic incarnation of God, which is relevant to the upper world only. Similarly, the same God is mediated in human form for the sake of souls in the human bodies on this earth and such divine form is called as the human incarnation. The main purpose of the mediation of God is to appear and talk with the devotees to direct them in spiritual path through clarification of doubts. The exhibition of His unimaginable powers through miracles is only to establish the basic fact that God is unimaginable. The duty of a devotee is to eradicate the ego and jealousy that resist the recognition of incarnation of God either here or in the upper world due to repulsion of the common media so that the right direction in the spiritual path can be always achieved by the soul. The creation is imaginable to the imaginable soul and is like the imaginary world of a soul to God. Hence, this creation is real and not imaginary to the soul. It is only imaginary to God\u201d. This is the divine knowledge in nut shell. Hence, the basic concept is finite in brief. But, the same divine knowledge becomes infinite when it clarifies the infinite number of doubts arising in the brains of the human beings of infinite number of generations. One should go through all these clarifications so that no doubt can come in his/her brain in future. When such full and infinite knowledge is assimilated, no preacher can confuse or trap his/her brain in wrong direction. The doubts are always new and hence, God takes up the new human incarnations continuously. The Veda says that the same single truth is explained by different human incarnations in different ways suitable to the then existing human beings (Ekam sat vipraah...). One human incarnation is not at all different from another human incarnation since the same absolute God exists in every human incarnation (Avibhaktam vibhakteshu... Gita). This statement should not be generalized to say that the same absolute God exists in every human being or living being. You can say that the same soul exists in every human being. The soul in every human being can be compared to the God in every human incarnation. Simile should be taken as simile only. When your concentration is on the internal God, you will not bother about the external human form and in such case, you will not be disturbed by ego and jealousy. But, you must eradicate ego and jealousy, which hinder your worship or service to God through the external human form. You cannot see or talk or worship or serve the internal unimaginable God. Even when you want to serve a soul, which is imaginable but invisible to naked eye, you have to serve the external human form of that soul only. When you apply the perfume to a soul that alone can enjoy it, you have to sprinkle the perfume on the external skin of the body only. You are not erasing the skin with the blade of a knife and sprinkle the perfume on the internal nerves in which the awareness (soul) is pervading. Even there, you cannot sprinkle the perfume directly on the invisible awareness except to sprinkle the same on the externally visible nerves only. Therefore, the external medium is inevitable and cannot be avoided in the service. Only practical service blended with sacrifice can please God (Pari prasnena sevaya... Gita). Such service can be done to the external medium only. Hence, the medium is unavoidable. Once, the medium comes in to the picture, the ego and jealousy come up. Therefore, if you concentrate on the internal God existing in the medium with full faith, ego and jealousy can be suppressed. Only clarifications through knowledge can give you the right direction. Therefore, when you are approaching another human incarnation, you are not leaving the God present in the earlier human incarnation. You are approaching the same God again existing in another human form. A person may be in red shirt today. Tomorrow, the same person may be in blue shirt. Does this mean that you have left the person, whom you met yesterday and approaching a new person today? The external human body is like the external dress as said in the Gita (Vaasaamsi jeernaani...). The main fundamental problem with maximum gravity is to accept the human incarnation after identification. Changing one human incarnation to the other is not a big problem if the common God in all the human incarnations is understood. Inclination to study is important and changing the colleges is not that much serious. If the devotee is fixed to one external human form only as God, the concept of human incarnation is not fulfilled. Such a blind devotee becomes rigid and worships the statue or photo of such one human incarnation, which passed away. In such case, the devotee is as good as the person not accepting the concept of human incarnation. The person not accepting human incarnation is worshiping the statues or photos of the energetic incarnations of the upper world. This devotee is also worshiping the statues and photos of past human incarnation. What is the difference between that person not accepting the human incarnation and this devotee rigid to one past human incarnation only since both are worshiping statues or photos only? The result in both cases is one and the same. The rigid devotees of Krishna (ISKCON) accept Bhagavatam as the highest scripture. They do not understand the case of Jambvan, a bear mentioned in that scripture. Jambvan was worshiping Rama only even after His demise. The bear famous for rigid grip indicates the rigid blind ignorance regarding one particular human incarnation only. Hence, Jambvan did not recognise Krishna, the other human incarnation. Afterwards, Jambvan realised his foolish blind belief in one external human form only and accepted Krishna also as God even though the same past human body of Rama is not existing in Krishna since the same God exists in both the human bodies. When Krishna told that He alone should be worshiped, it applies only to the devotees existing in His time. It also means that only alive human incarnations should be worshiped to receive the right spiritual direction. Moreover, Krishna did not say that people should worship the photos or statues representing His external body only even after His demise. In fact, Krishna told that He will be born again and again as per the necessity. Jesus also told that He will come again, which means that He will incarnate at any time as per the necessity. You cannot fix any time frame in the case of God. The main purpose of meeting God in human form is only to blast the basic knot of ignorance through clarification of doubts so that all the worldly activities cease since those are replaced by the activities of divine service because no soul can be absolutely inactive (tasmim drushteparavare). ------------ ",

            "answer_text": "This is a relatively lengthy answer on how I enhanced my knowledge. Hope this provides you with insight. Let me begin by asking: how did man decide to spread knowledge when he finally decided that speech was only limited to a certain amount of people at a time? How did the knowledge reserved only for the church and the privileged reach the masses? And how did we begin to define \u2018being educated\u2019? I know it as a fact that my personality was shaped by books. A book, is more than a bundle of pages bound together. It is absorbing. It is fascinating. It is thrilling and it is rejuvenating. They are a manifestation of the writer himself, containing a little part of the him and a little part of everyone who has ever read it. Amazed, astounded and astonished by books since I was 4 years old, I found books to be more than my best friends. In them I found my refuge. Whenever I grew tired from the cares of the world, I took refuge under the shelter of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Tolstoy, Crichton, Verne and Coelho. They became my inspiration, my motivation, my curiosity and instruments to imbibe information. In a way, they had become a part of me. We are humans; we need stories. We need something that will catapult our bourgeois existence into something magnificent. Countless hours are spent by a reader: first to read the book, then to absorb the depth of the depth of knowledge presented in such novel a way. The fact whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, comedy or thriller, scientific or philosophy doesn\u2019t hold much importance to an avid reader. For him, it just needs to be the right book. As one of my favorite quotes goes, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like books, you haven\u2019t read the right one.\u201d Of course, books have had a massive positive effect on me over the years. You get a general understanding of the people around you, once you become a vigorous reader. You begin to understand the depth of things, and begin to read between the lines and are able to debate anyone on almost anything. These packets of immense knowledge taught me about various people, and how they behave in certain surroundings. They made me mindful, attentive and understanding. I believe that books, exposing you to such a plethora of knowledge, make you tolerant and empathetic towards other people. I observe, absorb and contemplate everything that passes before my eyes. Books changed, or in a way shaped, how I view my surroundings. What is the sun and why does it burn so bright? Where does it go at night and where does the moon come from? Are stars really that small? How do snakes scratch their backs? My questions served, apart from a constant source of annoyance to my parents, to deepen my interest in the workings of the universe. My books taught me about humankind\u2019s history. They have served as a tool to bring accumulated knowledge from the privileged to the common man. Man can see who he will be, in who he has been. Or as I like to say, \u201cOur past is the prediction of our future\u201d. Uncomplaining, undemanding and patient, books have been by man\u2019s side throughout the centuries.

Regardless how much technology progresses, the written word will continue to dominate the avenues of intellectualism. For in books we trust. ",

In other words, keep your mind in a pristine, clear and noble state so that \u201cinfinite intelligence\u201d may be glimpsed and felt from time to time. Take notice of the intense and wonderful feeling that you get from having moments of relationship with \u201cInfinite Intelligence\u201d. Mind is a luminous, reflective, all pervasive force of the universe. It is \u201cthe force\u201d. Consciousness is our state of knowing. It is to be noted that of itself consciousness is unmoved. The void of mind is in a state of flux. Consciousness develops so that there is infinite consciousness potential. Man is endowed and endows himself with a conscious mind to direct the nature, shape and form of his creations. Form this perspective, knowledge is gained from experience. Books are OK for learning the different technologies that man has created but experience is always needed to find true knowledge. This is the big problem with Google. They are able to manipulate their knowledge by the use of words and phrases so that we get a biased view that we think is truth. Truth is love, and google loves money and power, not pristine human beings with loving hearts. Google does not have a heart, it is close to Artificial Intelligence. The \u201cOne Intelligent Energy\u201d that Infinite Intelligence created is All LOVE and the human heart can become open to it. You may gain knowledge by becoming aware of your own unique consciousness. If you develop your consciousness from unconditional love, you will also develop self-respect. From this perspective, true knowledge can be recognised and experienced. ",

(45+45=90. [90=90]. 90+90 =180 degrees. Also, 60+30=90. [90=90]. 90+90=180 degrees. Always true in any right-triangle).  Let\u2019s begin by comparing philosophy and science \u2014I believe that science will give you knowledge. Whereas, philosophy will arm you with wisdom. Why? \u2014Because science is the daughter of philosophy. After science we have art. The meaning of \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words.\u201d Now, what are the differences between knowledge and wisdom? \u2014Knowledge is knowing what to say. Wisdom is knowing how to say and do it at the right time. It seems like knowledge and wisdom differ only in the matter of timing \u2014It might cost your life when you decide to say a foolish thing at the wrong time. Same as music is good to those who are celebrating and bad to those who are mourning. What\u2019s the meaning of knowledge? \u2014How can you tell if you don\u2019t know in the first place?! Oh God! Knowing my date of birth is a type knowledge, but this is just hearsay knowledge \u2014It\u2019s not reliable. A physician knowing the medicines to be given to the patient after examination can be called knowledge. But this is just a type of knowledge gained from experience (science). A child given 2 (apples) + 2 (apples) will say he/she has got 4 (apples) in the hand. This type of knowledge can be easily proved and will remain to be true. Now, coming to your beautiful question\u2014 \u201cHow can I improve my knowledge?\u201d I will say that practical knowledge is more reliable than reading thousands of books and things that you can\u2019t prove yourself. Avoid fanaticism at any cost! Meaning, you must focus on increasing your intellect and putting the theoretical facts into action \u2014Focusing more upon principles and not facts!

            "answer_text": "There are multiple steps to gaining general knowledge about anything. The first and foremost step is to read. It doesn't have to be a book. You can simply read facts about all kinds of things, you can read studies and reports from studies. The key isn't really reading. The key is remembering what you have read. In high school and college many people read books and book passages for classes, but they fail to pass English class or History class. You need to read with the intention of remembering. You can remember by studying what you've read. Make flash cards and quiz yourself, read the same thing multiple times and actively think of it. Another way to gain general knowledge is to observe people and every day life objectively. When you walk into a store, look around and think critically. Politely listen to other people's conversations to gain insight about others. Actively collect subjective information so you can create a basis for objective information. Maybe you'll realize that people tend to go for cheaper products in a store even if they are bad for health. Maybe you'll see that that specific store pays poor and isn't worth supporting. To gain general knowledge means taking in alot of information about anything and everything. Being aware of how the world works and responds to thing will help you. Another way to grow in gaining general knowledge is to learn and understand many words. To do this you'd need to read a dictionary or other source that educates you on all kinds of words. Everyone in this world is different and many people use words you may have never heard of. When you learn and study new words, you gain something amazing. ",

Look for at least 3 different perspectives on the same subject, then think through and decide which one you agree with, disagree with, and most importantly WHY. Then look for 3 more different perspectives and see if you\u2019re perspective holds up or if it shifts. Find someone whose views are polar opposite of your own and interview them. Just interview them. Try to gain an understanding of why they think like they do. Listen to understand and learn. Keep your perspective to yourself throughout the interview.

Few people are more curious than children. I\u2019d bet that young kids increase their knowledge every day. Let me list a few ways kids use to increase their knowledge. I suggest you to use them too. They ask questions to themselves and to whoever they think might answer their questions, they pose their questions to different people in search of those whose answers sound more appealing.They are constantly exploring the world around them, they make experiments.They do all they can to get new skills and to develop the ones that they find most intriguing, interesting or amusing.As you grow you have access to more effective ways of answering your questions, acquiring new skills or improving those you have. Unfortunately, you may have been subject to influences that reduced your curiosity. My advice is to try to counteract that, and recover the curiosity you had when you were a child. My best wishes to your success. ",

Look upto people who are good at GK.Read at least one newspaper everyday. Believe me, it takes at least an hour to thoroughly read a newspaper. My personal favorite is The Hindu. Magazines like Outlook, The Economist etc. also help.The resource which aids the most is Wikipedia. It is one of the most reliable sources of information and the best thing is that it is free of cost. Start reading about the topics of your interest on Wikipedia. One topic(link) will lead to another. The \"See also\" section at the end of the page should be explored too. You'll be addicted to Wikipedia if you are really curious.Form a group of people who have the same goal. Discuss. Share.Once you start reading, start quizzing as well (both online and offline). Join Facebook pages for quizzing. You'll feel good answering questions. This will boost your confidence and will make you more committed.Maintain a notebook. Jot down stuff which you feel is important. Revise it weekly.Watch Hollywood movies and TV series.",

Please allow me to share my views! Dear Friend, Knowledge is that thing which can be questioned, reasoned and finally reached at a conclusion by your mind and soul! It is simply not any piece of writing that can be googled ( that is information ). So the best way to develop knowledge is to start questioning things rationally and understanding their sole purpose so that the piece of information gets assimilated by you! Hence reason out everything! Make it a food for thought! Marvel at the beauty of the beautiful things and eradicate the evil! ",

It's important to use your devices as the main sources of information. Instead of watching violent movies, helpless channels, follow time-consuming pages on Facebook, try to watch news, read books and articles on your TV and phones so that you van keep yourself up-to-date with new information.Try to use bookstore and library in your free time. Yes, it's true. Using your phone is a good way to gain knowledge but it's also disturbing. Try going to the library and bookstore, read books in your favorite topics first, after creating the habit of reading books, start looking for other topics one for gaining equally information from any fields.Last but not least, try doing workout. You mqy think this activity is needless but I would say that it's one of the factors that affect how fast you can working with information. With a healthier body, your mind will absorb information more rapidly and with more motivation. Start by doing cardio exercises for 2\u20133 times a week, combine with walking or cycling. If you want to have a chance to increase your muscles, try calisthenics for the best result. Don't forget to take rest because your muscles only heal and grow when you let it have a break.",

            "answer_text": "There are generally three means one acquire knowledge: Through inferences - one learns something from inferences, concepts that mimic the characteristics or qualities or functions of an object. To gain knowledge through this means one must make use of concepts, simile, metaphors, etc. and know how to compare and apply techniques of inference, extrapolation and intrapolation. And this knowledge is constructed and apprehended in mind, can be expanded by reasoning and elaboration with extensive conceptsz and through direct experience. Hence, it is also known as non-perceptual knowledge.Through direct perception/ experience. Briefly, this is a much more superior knowledge to the above inferential knowledge because one knows an object through direct contact with it with one's senses. Imagine you learn what is Arabica coffee by your tongue than through reading its description on a label. The former represents direct perceptual knowledge, the latter is inferential. Note the direct perceptual knowledge can be comprehended without applying concepts and most of the time cannot be described fully by mere concepts.By certain authority. This is common in religion that usually accepts certain important knowledge they believe as ultimate truth is delivered to them through revelation or a prophet or own meditation.",

            "answer_text": "Sounds like you might be having difficulty in understanding the information as it is being presented now where you didn't before.  This might be because the old way appealed to your particular style/approach to learning and the new one doesn't. The book information might also be more complex now with gaps or leaps in logic that will be filled in later. The teachers might be expecting you to figure out more on your own rather than teach everything. The learning methods you used might not be working as well for this new information. Or you may be studying new subjects that you do not connect with right away. Whatever it is, it is causing you stress, which in turn is making it even more difficult to learn... which is causing you even more stress. You need to get out of this vicious circle. Mentally step back and get some space. Go talk to your teachers or an academic counsellor. Explain the type of difficulties you are having, ask for support and work with them to figure out some ideas/methods for you to get back on track.  If you can't approach your teachers and there is no academic counsellor available, approach an adult in your life (parent, older sibling, relative, close friend) whom you trust to get in your corner and work with you and encourage you as you both figure out your next steps. Don't go to someone who will dole out the tough love and tell you to \"suck it up\"; that is of zero help and will simply add to your stress. If there are stress management or relaxation courses near you, sign up for one. Or take up a sport and go regularly. Good luck! ",

Some prefer to read things to memorize, others like to hear it spoken to them, and there are those who learn best through hands on experience. There are also a few neat tricks you can do. I have heard that by chewing gum while studying, it will become easier to remember if chewing the same gum during a test. Also, if you read, write, and say information to yourself all at once, your brain is much more likely to pick things up while studying. On a separate note, one of the tools I use to help myself study is Quizlet, or specifically the learn feature on Quizlet. My memory skills have improved significantly from using that feature. ",

Great for being a conversational expert on a random topic that can come up. As a Physics student I can tell you that knowledge is not only gained from learning but by doing. Though this crosses more into the realm of discipline and applied knowledge, reading all the books into how to make a car [or warp drive.. insert your own example here] won't make you an expert, but building one will.

The problem with Quora is that although it as been created implicitly as a LO, it does not function as a LO. This reply is one very long paragraph, perhaps the longest now on Quora, but it is indeed in a(n) holistic sense. So someone {a reader} should ask What is a learning organization?

This machine now knows only to \u2018react\u2019, not to \u2018act\u2019. We take words for the things. We get satisfaction in hearing nice words and get offended with words of abuse. We cannot takes things as they are. We can only understand things in the context of our own conditioning (of the mind). With a conditioned mind, we are always missing the larger picture, the things that we must notice but can\u2019t. It is the conditioning (Our experiences, our beliefs, our memories and the expectation from the society we live in) that makes our mind dull. This conditioning does not let the mind perceive anything in its totality. We always perceive things partially, as they suit us or as they appear to us due to our limitations of the mind. The answer to unlimited capacity of knowledge is to \u2018let go\u2019. To let go the mind of its conditioning, its tendencies, its habits; Everything.

A very popular quote in Sanskrit :  So the meaning of this quote is knowledge gives humbleness, humbleness gives elligibity/worthiness, elligibity gives wealth, wealth gives ability to do good deeds, and good deeds lead to happiness. So the question arises how do we get knowledge ? Gain of knowledge depends on several factors : Passion : Just gain some eagerness related to the particular subject.Observation : Try to observe things closely and hence try to understand the technicality behind the given thing.Reading : Read as much as you can about the given thing through trusted textbooks.Practical : Someone said \u201c If you only read about how to ride the bicycle then you would never ever able to ride that bicycle untill you give it a try\u201d. So practical is as much important as the theory part of the subject.Practice : Famous quotation \u201c Practice makes man perfect.\u201d So never ever try to get-rid-of practicing because just some practice would definitely going to work for math like subjects.Hope this would be informative for you.

If you are not curious about different subjects and you are not willing to try new things, you can never broaden your knowledge level.BooksMy favorite resource for knowledge are books.

Read some more books and dare to buy new ones or if you like reading an e-book more, try to find some PDF\u2019s.

I always read with a notebook nearby for two reasons - (1) when I come across something pertinent I write it down, which helps the brain remember it later, and (b) so that when the author draws from another piece of work and that work sounds interesting, I\u2019ll write that down and look that up next. So I started with psychology. Which lead me to the psychology of why people became Nazis and assisted in the mass killing of millions of people. Which lead me to a general fascination with people who live under totalitarian regimes. Which lead me to a fascination with Communist Russia, Pol Pot, China and North Korea. And these have lead me to a desire to look into Cuba and Che Guevara more. I also had a fascination with animal rights. Which lead me to human rights. Which narrowed down to feminism. I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert on any of the subjects. It takes approx 10,000 hours to become an expert on any one particular thing, and I just don\u2019t have that kind of time. But I do know a fair bit on each of these subjects, which was and remains my goal. After all, once you stop learning, you start dying. ",

Read quality books, blogs, journals, articles, research papers, periodicals, magazines - basically anything you can get your hands on. Reading books, both fiction and non fiction, not only helps you gain immense knowledge, but also has several other benefits. It makes you more empathetic, receptive to new ideas, and improves brain functioning. Quora is also helpful at times to learn about new things and expand knowledge. True, there are answers that contain only memes and pictures, bringing down the quality and making it like any other social media site. However, there are still people who write excellent answers and add to the knowledge base. Personally, I feel I learn at least 4\u20135 new facts daily by reading quality answers on Quora. There are other good blogs, websites too where you can read about different things. Try to follow some good blogs. If possible, subscribe to quality magazines and periodicals. Reading newspaper daily is also an excellent way. Read the editorial section thoroughly. Keep yourself acquainted with current happenings. Read it online if availability to physical newspaper is an issue. The crux of the matter is - Read. There is nothing else that'll help gain knowledge than reading. Hope this helps! :) ",

Then think how you can assimilate enough money using your expertise so that you can retire young. After that you have plenty of time on hand. So using your wok experience start a side business. Develop it and let it become a source of constant income. Once you become your own employer then flexibility is at your hand. Then it depends why you want to know more things. After getting financially secure people usually go void and some in order to fill that void become philanthropic, philosophers, etc. If you really want to gain knowledge in order to help humanity, then think what is the best way by identifying problems that are currently facing human societies all across the world. Stick with your decision. All the best. I find the following images very helpful related to this topic:     ",

The desire to learn is there, you just need to have a specific target for it. There are a lot of fields of knowledge to choose from, and most of them are interconnected (like electronics and programming). In this age of information and technology, gaining knowledge has never been easier. Tutorial videos are all over the internet; watch them starting from basics to advanced levels. Free e-books, learning wizards, and learning applications are just a few clicks away. Keep reading and keep practicing whatever you watch and read. Practice makes perfect. Make sure to conduct experiments and be curious. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what you want to improve your knowledge about. First ask yourself this question, would you much rather have in depth knowledgable about one particular topic or be sparsely knowledgable about about a wide range of topics. If it's the first, then YouTube is great resource. For me personally watching videos about a topic is much more useful than reading a random article about it online. Watch as many videos as you can about that topic and then once you think you have a decent amount of knowledge about it, come here on quora and try to answer as many questions as you can about it. It's scientifically proven that if you cannot explain your topic well enough, well then you have not understood it well. Don't do it for the upvotes, do it as a way of testing your knowledge. If it's the second then try to stay aware about the things happenening around you. Download the BBC app and read articles daily on it. Go to Reddit and browse the subreddits worldnews, science, technology and the front page of course. Read as many articles as you can. You might find them boring but just go through with it and soon enough you'll be knowledgeable about a wide range of topics. Finally try to talk to other people about the things you read, otherwise it's just a waste. Cheers! ",

After the discussion, use google to search for the doubts you had or to verify the points put by people. 2. Newspaper reading can enhance the general knowledge immensely. Develop habit of reading newspaper regularly and use internet to clarify the doubts or to read further on any point you want to. 3. Follow some good websites which updates on current affairs along with explanations. For eg.: gktoday 4. Share your knowledge with others. The new things which you learn will less likely be forgotton if you share it with others. You can present the information in an interesting manner so that people like to listen to them. 5. Quora is a very good media to enhance your general knowledge. Follow some useful topics and read the answers (good answers usually receive high upvotes) written by people. ",

When you feel that you need to get more knowledge, your journey to get more knowledge has started.  The way you have studied till the 12th is not your fault. May be that's what the education system has expected out of you. What is knowledge? It's processed information assimilated that is available for use.  So how do we get knowledge? It is developing a proper understanding on any topic. It involves starting from the fundamental concepts, getting proper understanding of various facets of the topic. Today it is much easier to do this. Almost any topic / subject can be understood and knowledge obtained with the help of internet. There are excellent quality contents available in public domain.  YouTube is a great source. Excellent quality books are available too.  There are many online libraries available that offer free access. I'm very sure that you will have some great teachers around you to guide you. Please go to them and seek their guidance. Now the most important thing : once you have decided to get knowledge, you will certainly find ways to get it. I'm sure you won't let anything stop you. You shouldn't. The world is fast becoming knowledge driven and you are doing the smartest thing - equipping yourself with knowledge! Wishing you a happy journey in your quest for knowledge Anu! ",

If we do not know about a subject thoroughly, we may only be making a fool out of ourselves. Knowledge is something that cannot be measured. You never know what kind of experience and knowledge the other person may possess. This way( by only pretending) a person may only be mocked at. If we do not want to make a mockery out of ourselves, then its better to gain knowledge rather than only pretending. Go out, get curious and start gaining knowledge. We are in a world where our phones work as mini computers. So everything is only a click away and right in your pocket. No offences. ",

            "answer_text": "Read Read Read. There is always something to learn. The question is what do you want to become knowledgeable in? In a world where information is easily accessible there is no excuse to not become knowledgable and intelligent. So pick a topic. What you are most curious about? Find out what important information is there to know about it? Ask questions! And spend time learning everything about it. The more serious you are about it the more time you will spend on it. Important tip: If you don't use it you lose it! Reading once and keeping it forever is for the gifted few. We have to practice what we learn for hours! Until it turns into muscle memory. Don't be distracted. In order to focus you need to be focused! Good Luck! ",

Start replacing your monotonous activities with anything from the list below : Hobby classes, where you're properly guided on something you can also enjoyReading books, news, blogs, articles etc on a variety of topics. Don't just pick something in your area of interest, try becoming more versatile.Trying something out of your comfort zone such as cooking, baking, painting, learning to drive etc. Make a list for yourself and try something new every few days!Meet new people outside your group of friends. You can meet such people through signing up for clubs, such as a Book Club, for example.Watch TED talks, documentaries, informative videos etc.Attend conferences, workshops, meetups, events and programs.Go to museums.The list is exhaustive, but hopefully you'll get the idea!

Be in good company of Smart people: This is what i have been following for a couple of years. if i want to know about any subject, i generally talk to the person, who has effective knowledge of it. Discuss it with him/her. They will not only provide you knowledge but also answer your questions and doubts, and help you make your own opinion, instead of becoming a blind follower. ",

Knowledge is gathered from learning and education, while most say that wisdom is gathered from day-to-day experiences and is a state of being wise. Knowledge is merely having clarity of facts and truths, while wisdom is the practical ability to make consistently good decisions in life. The application of knowledge is often a matter of finding or knowing the right facts, meaning that there is a distinct difference between the \"right\" and \"wrong\" facts. In contrast, wisdom often requires much more than facts to perceive and choose the \"right\" action or to avoid the \"wrong\" action. The factors involved may include speculation, feelings, and moral or ethical values. In this general sense, applying knowledge tends to be a much simpler process. ",

You do not feel the importance or the necessity to improve your knowledge in that arena. On the other hand, you will go out of your way to identify your interests and pursue them.

One will say keep an eye on different kinds of book everytime, but I should mention that GK is not a small thing that can be aquired by just going through books, newspapers, current affairs, etc. One must accept all the things coming to him/her as fun and accept if whatever it be. For example, housing chores is gk, the cost of a broom or a milk packet is gk. All I want to recommend is: I am saying it all in my way, but you have to find it in your way; hidden deep inside yourselves and explore the unexplored world. Just keep going through everything that comes to you and accept everything politely. Remember, always keep patience. ",

Likewise, we see a piece of paper on the floor, or outside on the ground, and walk right past it, thinking the whole time, \"someone should pick that up!\" Learning is like that. Every time I say \"I wonder,\" I try to stop and learn.  I often deliberately choose questions to answer on Quora about things that I don't know, so that I can take the time to learn.  But overcoming the necessary energy to bend over and pick up the paper, to click on \"Dictionary.com - The world's favorite online English dictionary!\" to learn what \"edification\" really means, and how it's different from \"education\" (edification is a moral or spritual learning, not just spelling or arithmetic), requires overcming inertia.   Like exercise of any sort, it's difficult or unpleasant at first, and eventually becomes so automatic a habit that you can't imagine not doing it. Now if only I felt that way about my coffee cup...

( hole means doubt here or attachment to results ) 2. Respect what you know already, apply it in life with full confidence. 3. Be rock firm in your faith. whether it is in God, yourself or Karma. Be it in any of the three but it should be rock firm.

So imagine the thing that you are reading,create a mental picture related to it,because when u see it you remember it and understand it well,which is important to store things in our brain and increase our knowledge. Then the content that you need for doing it is available all around you,newspaper,internet,mobile all capable of providing you with amazing things to learn and understand,youtube videos and sites like Quora itself.

Respect the opinions of experts in their field and put their solid arguments against whatever cancer-curing karma-boosting hyper-organic-kale post you saw on Twitter. Take courses on Coursera and EdX. Go out and talk to people. Have a pint in a pub with someone you don\u2019t know. Say hi to that beggar instead of just throwing pocket change at him.

It is best to read from objective, well researched sources. When reading, it is important to find out if what you are reading is credible or not. Another way of amassing knowledge is through our experiences. We can be leectured, and we might not understand. We can be taught and may not comprehend it. But when we experience things for ourselves, we will remember them forever (well, at least until our memories begin to fail us, which we hope never happens anyway).. We also gain knowledge from our failures. So, in short, life is a learning experience; people often call life a university. The learning never stops, until we decide to stop learning (which would be very, very unfortunate). When we see life as an everyday learning experience, it gets easier to gain vast amounts of knowledge. ",

They may be right , they may be wrong , they may seem foolish at times . But atleast you would get to learn something or the other by speaking less and listening more in the conversation . I would give you an example . There was a friend of mine . Let's call him 'X' . He was really poor at studies and he had an attitude problem . But he was way too good at Computers . And whenever we used to meet , he always used to tell us about things he learnt , about the tricks he got to know , and much more . I always paid attention to whatever he told me . And therefore I was also able to gain knowledge about Computers . This is just one example. People are different , their interests are different . IF YOU BECOME A GOOD LISTENER AND LISTEN TO WHATEVER THEY SAY , I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING OR THE OTHER . FOR ME , THAT'S THE BEST WAY ONE CAN GAIN KNOWLEDGE :) ",

Incase of arnab, i might not agree with all he says but his debates are surely interesting.There are multiple websites on internet which provide current affairs news daily. That is better than downloading copious pdf\u2019s to memorize all events till date.Sometimes encyclopaedias have a gk facts section. You could check that out.Prep books for job entrance exams provide a lot of information in this regard. My favourite is Mcgraw hill series where entire section on gk is there with multiple fact lists.Lastly gk is such a topic which you either grasp or don't. Interested or not it is important. So you have to be focused enough to go through facts everyday which otherwise might appear useless. ",

There can never be a step by step guide to acquiring knowledge (facts, information and skills). However, always starting from the basics and slowly progressing your way up could be helpful. Learning from authentic sources as well as from your own experiences is crucial. During the course of your learning, make sure to maintain an interest in the subject which in turn helps to maintain the curiosity which is very essential in order to acquire knowledge. I personally believe that a person only learns what he/she is curious about. That's why we have different interests and different choices. Having a curiosity pushes you to get deeper into the topic and drag more and more out of it. ",

This is due to the fact that we are born ignorant, and must look outside of us for information. Even when no one is available to inform us, we must at least have Faith in our own senses, because nothing enters the mind except thru our senses. Since our senses are not infallible, and sometimes can deceive us, we must trust our senses, but must not forget that sometimes they lie to us. As to the acquisition of \u201ctrue\u201d knowledge, since the only source of truth must be an omniscient and inerrant being, truth can be known only if God is known. Thus Faith in God is the only possible source of True knowledge. ",

So read about it, listen to experts, observe masters and do other relevant things to get to doing it as early as possible. Once you have done it yourself, go seek feedback about it.

In other words, thinking about what is best for yourself and others, or learning a technical skill. Intuitive knowledge can be had by trusting the insights that have worked in the past, that still relate with the new. Absolute knowledge depends on the sort of universal one is looking for. In my own philosophy, I have proposed categorical deductions and paroxysms as solutions to the problem of coherent knowledge and solving paradoxes. More about that here: Philosopher Nathan Coppedge . Absolutely relativistic knowledge, on the other hand, is not objective, and therefore contains no definite ground for truth. It is therefore a contradiction in terms! That's why we need objective knowledge, so that we can be sure that truth is not relative! ",
