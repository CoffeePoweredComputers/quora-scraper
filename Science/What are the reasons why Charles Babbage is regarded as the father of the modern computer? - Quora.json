            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see how he could be regarded as the father of the modern computer. He designed computing machines on paper. He made an attempt to build his first design in the 1830s, but failed. He got a \u201cfragment\u201d of it built, which he then used for demos to high society. He also came to a couple valid conclusions about computing, using this \u201cfragment,\u201d which would be borne out by computer scientists who would come to the same conclusions independently about a century later. To clarify the other information I see on here, it\u2019s true to say that Babbage designed a stored program computer that he attempted to build, but the programming was only in the domain of what could be computed with the mathematical method of differences. It did not involve writing an algorithm (the algorithm was hard-coded into the machine). It was not a general-purpose programmable computer. Babbage designed a general-purpose programmable computer, called the Analytical Engine (this was his second design), but he never attempted to build it. Babbage theorized about the algorithms it would be able to carry out. The reason for this was that the British government was so disappointed with his first effort that it refused to fund anything else he designed. ",

            "answer_text": "Babbage designed the first stored-program computer, and attempted to build it, on a defense contract for the British Royal Navy. The Royal Navy needed a mechanical device to compute trig tables used in celestial navigation. Certain errors in the hand-calculated tables in use at the time had been associated to clusters of wrecks, so it was worth money to the Royal Navy. The manufacturing technology of the mid 19th century was not up to the challenge of building Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine. Excessive frictional forces within the mill prevented its proper operation, so Babbage never got as far as actually running any computations on it. Ada Lovelace, frustrated female mathematician in a world that disliked smart women, wrote the first program for the Analytical Engine, which contains the first bug. All of this sounds so modern that it\u2019s hard to imagine it happening in an era of floor-length skirts and horse-drawn carriages. ",
