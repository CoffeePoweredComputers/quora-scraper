            "answer_text": "Sinkholes are a karst terrain feature.  They are not caused by erosion, but by  the rock dissolving.  They form by the dissolution of limestone by water.  Ground water can be high in carbonic acid making the water a mild acid, so the limestone dissolves in it.  Anywhere you have limestone near the surface and below the saturated zone in the soil,  the limestone will begin to dissolve.  The water will run along natural cracks in the rock widening them.  These cracks widen into underground streams which form caverns.  Eventually the overlying rock, the ceilings of the caverns collapse forming the sinkhole.  Some of the collapses are fairly spectacular, others just start with a small hole.  These small holes are how a lot of caverns are discovered.  If you live in an area prone to sinkholes, its a good idea to get a seismic survey done.  It can tell you where the voids are and where not to build your house. Whether or not it becomes a problem depends on how close to the surface the limestone rock bed is.  If it is deep it never really becomes a surface issue.  But if it is shallow it can cause surface sinkholes. No, there is no easy way to remedy it.  Imagine the tons of concrete it would take to fill in a huge hole?  Better off just letting it form a pond.  Be thankful you don't have one this size under your house.  See the person standing on the tip of the stalagmite in the center for scale  ",

            "answer_text": "Sinkholes happen when rock beneath the surface is worn away, usually by the the movement of water, such that the surface layer can no longer be supported. Gravity takes over and the surface falls into the void below. Sinkholes can only happen in certain geologic regions. There needs to be water-soluble rock -- usually carbonate rock -- beneath the surface as well as a source of water that can erode the rock. That can be rain dripping through rock over thousands of years, or it can be underground reservoir or channels of water. Sometimes, even a ruptured or leaking water pipe will suffice. There are a few other geologic structures than can collapse into sinkholes, including underground deposits of volcanic ash. If you're living on bedrock, you don't need to worry about sinkholes. If you're living over limestone, in a wet environment, you might worry. ",
