            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s immensely simplify things here. We all have light switches in our house right? Usually we have more than one switch and more than one light. Flick a switch and a light turns on (I know, one switch can turn on more than one light and multiple switches can work the same light, but let\u2019s keep it simple). How does the electricity know where to go? why does it always go to the same lightbulb and not some other light? Well, because that switch is connected to that light, not to any of the other lights. There\u2019s no other place that it could have gone but there.  When it comes to more complex behavior, likt you describe, we\u2019re talking about attention and selection biasing motor commands. This happens all the time, although not that explicit. You need to disinhibit for a motor command to be executed. This is a bit more complex and not completely clear, but the same concepts are valid. IF the luminance outside goes below X THEN turn on the light.  IF I see \u201ccat\u201d THEN execute the motor program to press the button. Signals aren\u2019t free floating in the brain, it\u2019s no highway with multiple exits and ramps. It\u2019s a one-way street with a beginning and an end. In your example there\u2019s a one way street to execute the motor command \u201cPRESS THE BUTTON!!!\u201d. It\u2019s not a straight road and it has multiple stops along the way (even a few roads connecting to other roads), but a one-way street nonetheless. That signal is ready to go, but the street is closed off, so no button pressing. Then you see that word \u201ccat\u201d which acts as a selection criteria. The inhibition of the command stops, the road is no longer closed off, and you press that button. There\u2019s no decision going on at that level, neurons and action potentials don\u2019t make decision. Think less \u201clittle cars driving around\u201d and more \u201cdominoes falling down\u201d. The brain as a collection of neurons does make decisions (in a way, though that\u2019s up for debate) but that\u2019s a whole different question. The signal doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d where to go, it just goes when it can. \u201cyou\u201d as a complex organism do \u201cknow\u201d when the signal should go. How you know and make that signal go is still being figured out. We\u2019re not sure how motivation and attention work on the selection of signals, just that they do. It\u2019s probably some immensely complicated system that\u2019ll be a beautiful example of nature finding a way. ",

            "answer_text": "The brain functions and processes information via neuron-to-neuron signaling, but signals mostly just propagate; they don\u2019t navigate. To make an analogy to computing, this is like asking how does the signal travel from the mouse button to the website when you click on a link? The signal traveling is something of an illusion whereas in reality there is a lot of complex processing happening. That said, in the case of hand-eye coordination, for example, the brain is able to establish signaling feedback loops between the visual and motor areas. The mechanisms have not been worked out, but there are theories floating around regarding signal routing, attentional biasing, surround suppression, inter-area neuronal oscillation synchronization, and other possible mechanisms. A key theme of signal routing in the brain, is that the routing happens not by navigation, which would involve the source identifying the destination, but by selection, in which the destination selects the source. In other words, it is the responsibility of a receiving brain area to decide what sources to listen to rather than the responsibility of the sending area to decide where the signal should go. This selection happens via mechanisms still being understood which include selecting for information gain, amplifying coincidence, suppressing predictability, and selection mechanisms trained from past outcomes via reinforcement learning.
