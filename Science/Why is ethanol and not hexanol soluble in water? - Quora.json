            "answer_text": "Ethanol and hexanol have the -OH group in common. This is a highly polar group, which increases the solubility in water. The remainder of the molecules, CH3-CH2- and CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- resp. are non polar: they will resist solubility in water (Like dissolves like!). The non polar \u201ctail\u201d in hexanol is much longer than in ethanol, and this makes hexanol insoluble in water. Solubilities of alcohols in water (in g/100 mL)methanol miscibleethanol miscible1-propanol miscible1-butanol 7,91-pentanol 2,31-hexanol 0,6 You see that the solubility decreases as the non-polar chain becomes longer.

            "answer_text": "Ethanol is soluble in water because it has a hydroxyl group (containing an O-H bond) which allows it to form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. Hexanol also has a hydroxyl group but as it is a long molecule, hexanol molecules have high dispersion forces (London dispersion force - Wikipedia) between them, making it harder to separate them. This is why hexanol is not soluble in water. Hope that helps! ",
