            "answer_text": "History shows that it is always a key individual who provides the necessary inspiration for a scientific discovery. Profound scientific invention and discoveries of the past are all nearly attributable to certain key individuals. Examples include Copernicus, Newton, Edison, Kepler, Darwin, Fleming, Columbus, and Einstein. For example, in challenging the notion that the Earth was in a fixed position at the center of the universe, Copernicus paved the way for the corroborating observations of Galileo a century later, and ultimately for Newton's principles of gravity upon which all modern science is based. The staggering cumulative impact of Copernicus' rejection of what he had been taught is proof enough of the value of skepticism. The staggering cumulative impact of Copernicus' rejection of what he had been told was true provides strong support for the speaker's advice when it comes to scientific facts. For example, up until Bacon's time the Earth was \"observed\" to lie at the center of the Universe, in accordance with the prevailing religious notion that man (humankind) was the center of God's creation. Applying Bacon's scientific method Galileo exposed the biased nature of this claim. As for the physical sciences, innovation and progress can only result from challenging conventional theories--that is, the status quo. Newton and Einstein, for example, both refused to blindly accept what were perceived at their time as certain rules of physics. As a result, both men redefined those rules. By theorizing before collecting data the theorist also runs that risk of interpreting that data in a manner which makes it appear to lend more credence to the theory than it actually does. Consider the theory that the Earth is flat. Any person with a clear view of the horizon must agree in all honesty that the evidence does not support the theory. Yet prior to Newtonian physics the notion of a spherical Earth was so unsettling to people that they interpreted the arc-shaped horizon as evidence of a convex, yet nevertheless \"flattish,\" Earth. When we think of the process of inventing something great we naturally conjure up a vision of the lone inventor hidden away in a laboratory for months on end, in dogged pursuit of a breakthrough. And this image is not entirely without empirical support. For example, Thomas Edison's early innovations--including the light bulb, the television, and the phonograph--came about in relative isolation, and solely through his individual persistence and commitment. But for the most part, scientific breakthroughs today typically occur only after years of trial-and-error by large research teams. Even Thomas Edison relied more and more on a team of researchers to develop new innovation as his career progressed. Thus the statement flies in the face of how most modern scientific innovations actually come about today. Perhaps the paradigmatic modern example of a great achiever's discontent was Einstein, whose theoretical breakthroughs in physics only raised new theoretical conundrums which Einstein himself recognized and spent the last twenty years of his life struggling unsuccessfully to solve. A third example was Einstein, who while committed to the mathematical soundness of his theories about relativity could not reconcile them with the equally compelling quantum theory which emerged later in Einstein's life. In fact, Einstein spent the last twenty years of his life criticizing his own theories and struggling to determine how to reconcile them with newer theories. Similarly, before Einstein time and space were assumed to be linear, in accordance with our \"observation.\" Einstein's mathematical formulas suggested otherwise, and his theories have been proven empirically to be true. Thus it was our subjective interpretation of time and space that led to our misguided notions about them. Einstein, like history's other most influential scientists, simply refused to accept conventional interpretations of what we all observe. A more recent example involves Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein theorized, and scientists have since proven empirically, that the pace of time, and possibly the direction of time as well, is relative to the observer's motion through space. This truth ran so contrary to our subjective, linear experience, and to previous notions about time and space, that I think Einstein's theory can properly be characterized as truly original. On the other hand are two compelling arguments against placing a duty on humans to protect endangered species. The first is essentially the Darwinian argument that extinction results from the inexorable process of so-called \u201cnatural selection\u201d in which stronger species survive while weaker ones do not. Moreover, we humans are not exempt from the process. Accordingly, if we see fit to eradicate other species in order to facilitate our survival, then so be it. We are only behaving as animal must, Darwin would no doubt assert. At a point when it becomes critical for our own survival as a species to save certain others, then we humans will do so if we are fit \u2013 in accordance with Darwin\u2019s observed process of natural selection. Turning first to discoveries, I agree that discovery often occurs when we unexpectedly happen upon something in our quest for something else--such as an answer to unrelated question or a solution to an unrelated problem. A variety of geographical, scientific, and anthropological discoveries aptly illustrate this point. In search of a trade route to the West Indies Columbus discovered instead an inhabited continent unknown to Europeans; and during the course of an unrelated experiment Fleming accidentally discovered penicillin. In search of answers to questions about marine organisms, oceanographers often happen upon previously undiscovered, and important, archeological artifacts and geological phenomena; conversely, in their quest to understand the Earth's structure and history geologists often stumble upon important human artifacts. In light of the foregoing examples, \"intentional discovery\" might seem an oxymoron; yet in fact it is not. Many important discoveries are anticipated and sought out purposefully. ",

            "answer_text": "The good ol' discovery of Penicillin, in which changed medical practise forever.   Penicillin: Monumental discovery that saved Millions; because of a left out petri dish and a vacation. Immortalized in scientific legend, the discovery of penicillin, an antibiotic group used to fight an array of bacterial infections is a serendipity from dirty dishes. Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming took  a vacation in August 1928  from his day-to-day work in the lab investigating staphylococci, known commonly as staph.    Forgot to clean up his Lab.. Upon his return on September, the perceptive scientist found a strange fungus on a culture he  had left in his lab, a fungus that had killed off all surrounding  bacteria in the culture. Since then, Modern medicine had never been the same.     then... Serendipity! Penicillin became a life saver from infections like Gangrene, that became a vital aid during the Second World War for soldiers wounded by firearms and grenades to stop the spread of infection.       Penicillin mould presented by Fleming to Douglas Macleod in 1935 ",
