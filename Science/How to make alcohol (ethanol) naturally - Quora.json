            "answer_text": "The simplest way to do this is using some plain white sugar, water. and a wine yeast or even better, a champagne yeast. These are both all natural. There are many different types of yeast in the world\u2026some are harmful, some are helpful. Wine yeasts are bred to give you the best quality alcohol with a minimum of byproducts. Now, how you proceed depends on what you want to make or how you want to use your alcohol. If you add fruit to your sugar, water and yeast, you\u2019ll get wine. If you just want ethanol, then just use the sugar, water and yeast. It would be best to use a yeast nutrient along with the yeast, just to feed it and get the maximum amount of alcohol from your sugar. The wine store will have this too. Now, I suggested a champagne yeast because it will ferment more sugar and create more alcohol for you\u2026about 18 percent alcohol. A regular wine yeast will give you 10 to 16 percent. Beer yeasts, even less. There are also yeasts called turbo yeasts that can get up to about 22 percent. So, assuming you use a regular wine yeast which says it will give you about 15 % alcohol, the formula would be 1 kilogram white sugar and 4 liters of luke-warm water. Mix it well and add yeast (temperature must be below 90 degrees F). Cover with a cloth and in a week or two, you\u2019ll have alcohol. Wait for the yeast to die and settle to the bottom and carefully pour off the clear liquid. This will be 15% alcohol \u2018water\u2019. To know what to do with it, I suggest you pick up a copy of \u2018How to Master Moonshine\u2019 by RW Marshall. I got a copy several months ago from Amazon, and have been using it ever since to make my own alcohol. It has detailed step by step instructions and lots and lots of recipes. I think it\u2019s a great resource, and wasn\u2019t that expensive either. Good luck\u2026it\u2019s really pretty easy to do! ",

            "answer_text": "Making ethanol is painfully simple, people in prison pull it off with materials they have access to. Fill a bottle with sugar water, dump in a package of yeast. Then you have to let the gasses out without letting air in. The traditional way to do that is to attach a tube to the top of the bottle and run the other end into a container of water. A simpler way is to stretch a balloon and poke a couple of pinholes in it, then put that balloon on the mouth of the bottle. Over time, you\u2019ll see the balloon expand, and the holes will stretch enough to let the gas out. Depending on conditions, you\u2019ll need to let it ferment for a couple of weeks, until the tube stops bubbling, or the balloon deflates. If you\u2019re using ordinary baker\u2019s yeast, it will get you to around 12% ethanol. You can buy special strains of yeast that will get you to 15%, but not much higher. If you want pure ethanol, you need to distill it ",

            "answer_text": "Begin with a sweet fruit juice (grapes are the most common) and add yeast. The yeast will turn the sugar onto alcohol and carbon dioxide. In fact, with most grapes you don\u2019t have to add the yeast, it will come in attached to the skins of the grapes. This technique has been used for thousands of years to make wine. Of course this will only get you alcohol in the range of 10 to 20% depending on factors like how much sugar you started with and how \u201caggressive\u201d the yeast is. It is legal in the USA to make limited quantities of wine in your home without a commercial license. If you want to concentrate the alcohol in that wine, the process is called distilling and you can make brandy with a much higher alcohol content. However, this is NOT legal to do in your home in the USA without a license. ",

What you get is kilju (pronounced \u201ckill-you\u201d), which is basically sugar wine. It contains ethanol of some 8% to 12% ABV. It is very much suitable for binge drinking. The stuff can then be distilled. Unless you know what you are doing, you are likely to end up with really foul-tasting 20% to 35% ABV water-ethanol-contaminant solution called pontikka, or in English language, moonshine.By catalytic addition of water into ethylene (natural gas). This requires sophisticated equipment and catalysts. Do not try that at home.",
