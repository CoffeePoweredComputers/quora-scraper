            "answer_text": "It will be impossible with the way things are in real life, with a rigid wall and solid body. But there is mostly emptiness inside all our atoms making up hundreds of trillions of molecules that make us, and similarly for the rigid wall. So why doesn\u2019t the \u2018mostly empty space of a body\u2019 mingle with the \u2018mostly empty space of the wall\u2019 and allow passage through it ?? Both the wall and the body are rigid structures with the wall being much more rigid, and the individual molecules can not separate to allow external molecules to pass through undisturbed and reform back after the passage. The other more fundamental reason is because of the matter that is locked inside the atomic space which is in certain position needs to remain mostly undisturbed to maintain integrity of atoms and molecules both with respect to their nuclei, the interatomic and intermolecular forces, the electron clouds, and the overall topographic distribution of all the above components. These arrangements will be disrupted in that type of encounter, even if it were to be facilitated by more advanced technology, short of complete dissociation, passage through the harder medium, and then complete association( \u201c beam me up Scotty !\u201d) without the cessation of life functions of course post-dissociation\u2026 Such a technology is thousands of years away, not hundreds\u2026 So quantum tunneling is an attractive concept but practically impossible until extremely advanced biophysical technology is born, which is thousands of years away in all probability\u2026 Assuming that there are many other intelligent life forms(high probability that there are) out there in this enormous universe of ours, that type of technology may already exist among others\u2026 Kaiser T, MD.

            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics is the physics of things that cannot be observed, where \u201cobserved\u201d is a fairly fuzzy concept but definitely does not have anything to do with conscious observers. It has to do with interacting strongly enough with the environment that interference phenomena are no longer significant. There is an important distinction to be made between \u201cnot being observed\u201d and \u201cnot able to be observed\u201d. It is supposed to be logically impossible to know what something is doing when no one is looking at it, but that supposition depends on philosopher\u2019s inability to understand relatively: although no one happens to be looking at that rubber tree in the quad today, the light reflected off it will remain observable far into the future at greater and greater distances from Earth. The same is true of the gamma rays passing through it, and so on. So the notion of \u201cwhat is a thing doing at some point in time when no one is observing it\u201d is incoherent in Einstein\u2019s universe. When a thing is \u201cnot able to be observed\u201d, in contrast, we aren\u2019t dealing with mere logic, but with physics, which is considerably more powerful. When at thing is \u201cnot able to be observed\u201d it is hidden behind the limits that the fact of quantization put on knowability. Immanuel Kant pointed out that the traditional metaphysical limits on existence were in fact limits on our perception of existence: Aristotle\u2019s law of non-contradiction was a product of our nature, not the nature of the universe. We could not perceive anything that was both A and not-A at the same time and in the same respect. The universe might very well be full of such things and quite remarkably, it is. Even more strangely, and contrary to what Kant believed, we can know this, even though we can\u2019t be directly aware of such things. Quantum tunneling is one such thing: the wavefunction of a particle that runs into a potential barrier (a wall) does not drop to zero at the barrier, but instead extends some way under it even when the particle has negative energy under the barrier. The important thing is that in this state the particle cannot be observed, because negative energy is impossible in classical mechanics. So the answer to \u201chow can particles pass through walls\u201d is \u201cthey do so unobservably, and we only infer they have been under the barrier by the fact they escape out the other side.\u201d ",
