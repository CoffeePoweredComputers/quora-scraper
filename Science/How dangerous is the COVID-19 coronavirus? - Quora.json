            "answer_text": "I am not a doctor, but I did work as an EMT for over 15 years, a cop for over 24 years and have served 8 years in the Army. I am over 68 years old, and still have a vivid memory of my father telling me about the Spanish Influenza pandemic that took place when he was 8 and 9 years old. He told me of playing king of the mountain atop stacked coffins filled with the victims of the deadly disease. That too began slowly then accelerated rapidly into a nightmare that most chose to forget because the memories were just to terrible to cope with. I am afraid we are on the brink of another such outbreak, and if so, I pray it ends within a year. While I don\u2019t see civilization breaking down over this, I can see it is, to some extent, uniting the political parties to work toward the continuation of our nation post infection. I am hoping to survive the major impact, living in a very rural area does, perhaps give me a bit of an advantage, however we also suffer from a lack of supplies when the pipeline drys up as it is already showing signs of impacting us. As was advised by the mayors of the east coast when talking to the mayors of the major west coast cities: Set your seamstresses to sewing shrouds, set your carpenters to building coffins, and set your construction workers to digging graves. This may well be as good advice in 2020 as it was in 1919 about 101 years ago. At first I thought that folks were going overboard, I still feel this may be the case, however when the Supreme Court canceled their hearings in the next session, I became very concerned, I have only read of this happening once in recent memory, that being the Spanish Influenza of 1918. Now all around everything is canceled. I can\u2019t even get in the local nursing home to visit my mom, who calls me a couple times a day wondering why I have abandoned her after promising her I would see her regularly. Being her last surviving child, it is hard on both of us, my two sisters who died last year would have celebrated birthdays this month. It\u2019s tough on everyone but the old folks suffer the greatest, as is always the case. I am just recovering from a bout with seasonal flu that morphed into pneumonia, I was happy that I was in good enough health to recover at home with a couple doses of antibiotics from my good doctor. That said, it was a bit of a hint at what may follow. Our Sate announced they have cancelled all school classes from Kindergarten to graduate school for perhaps the rest of the school year. Indeed, I am worried, and I am staying home. Our daughter who lives with us works full time at a motel as a manager, and part time as a volunteer Ambulance Squad member, she has been an EMT for over 25 years now, we are proud but she does have an increased risk as she must respond to those ill with this damn virus, and may well bring it home. Guess that\u2019s what I get for bringing up a wonderful daughter who cares for not only her crippled up old folks but the people of our town as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How dangerous is the coronavirus (COVID-19)? A: Very. [ This answer was originally posted Jan 30, 2020 ] [18 Mar update: With their own outbreak appearing to be under control, the Chinese government is engaging in a massive disinformation campaign, to deflect attention from the fact that THEIR negligence lead to the virus, via poor food hygiene standards, and then made it MUCH worse by hiding it for 2 months (Nov 2109 thru early Jan 2019). This article outlines some of those issues, and has links to a variety of documenting sources. China is not at blame for the US\u2019s incompetent response: the US CDC has primary responsibility for that. But China is to blame for the existence of the virus \u2014 through negligence \u2014 and for it\u2019s spread \u2014 through corrupt attempts at concealment and cover-up. ] [10 Mar update: The quarantine in China seems to be working. It appears that S Korea may be getting things under control. Unfortunately, the \u2018day-late/dollar-short\u2019 quarantines in the West are not working well: see this site, to track the numbers: Coronavirus Update (Live) ] [28 Feb update: As of today, WHO raises coronavirus threat assessment to its highest level'. This is official permission to, well, not panic, but to be deeply concerned!] [ 25 Feb update: Just today, the US CDC gave everybody permission to \u2018panic\u2019: US health officials say coronavirus will likely cause a global pandemic ] An important distinction: \u201cCoronaviruses\u201d are a class, and not an individual thing. The coronavirus that\u2019s in the news had the extremely awkward name of \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d but is now \u201cCOVID-19\u2032 and there are other names being used, including just \u201ccoronavirus\u201d. However, other coronaviruses cause: SARS => Severe acute respiratory syndrome - WikipediaMERS => Middle East respiratory syndrome - Wikipediaabout 20% of colds: Coronavirus Infections\u2014More Than Just the Common Cold (JAMA)And then, of course, the awkwardly named 2019-nCoV from Wuhan, China: Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - Wikipedia causes the COVID-19 infection. Though the reported mortality rate of 2% is much lower than previous Chinese-sourced coronavirus infections, such as SARS, COVID-19 appears to be much, much more infectious than previous coronavirus infections. As a result, current projections indicate that 2019-nCoV will kill many more people in total than SARS or MERS have done. [16 Feb 2020 update: COVID-19 has now killed 1775+, and is still going strong. That is more deaths than SARS & MERS combined. ] Current reports suggest that infected people may be symptom-free for TWO WEEKS AFTER they beginning shedding the virus. If this proves to be correct ,2019-nCoV is likely to be impossible to control. Even worse? The US CDC now confirms that COVID-19 can be transmitted by infected individuals who show NO symptoms: Coronavirus can be spread by people who don\u2019t show symptoms, CDC warns And 2% mortality, with a 90% infection rate, means many, many more deaths than people seem to realize. Even with an 80% infection rate, a 2% mortality means that  30 Jan 2020: WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency31 Jan 2020: U.S. declares public health emergency over coronavirus7 Feb 2020: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports (from the UN\u2019s WHO)12 Feb 2020: China reports gush of retrospective COVID-19 cases13 Feb 2020: Cruise ship from hell gets worse: Cases Of COVID-19 Soar On Quarantined Coronavirus Cruise Ship25 Feb 2020: Today, the US CDC officially gave everyone in the US permission to \u2018panic\u2019: US health officials say coronavirus will likely cause a global pandemicGiven how carefully the UN\u2019s WHO, the US CDC, and similar agencies avoid drama, there statements are pretty alarming. Also, this answer: Mitchell Tsai's answer to How serious is the 2019\u201320 Coronavirus? is much more complete \u2014 but also much, much more technical \u2014 than mine.  COVID-19 coronavirus facts: Few of the \u2018facts\u2019 are known for certain, and may change over the next month. It is clear that China has been \u2018managing\u2019 the news about 2019-nCoV, and both the US CDC and the UN\u2019s WHO consider \u2018news management\u2019 to be part of their mandate, as well. So . . . you should know that the situation is at least as a bad as they say, but may be worse, and may be much worse than China reports..Mortality is reported to be ~2%, so if you get it, you have a 98% chance of surviving. Reportedly, the mortality is lower among children & adolescents, but higher in older adults. .BUT . . . even survivors can take THREE WEEKS or longer to recover. Being stuck in bed for 3 weeks is no joke. For example, students may have to repeat the year..But, it is apparently extremely infectious, and nobody is resistant, much less immune. SARS \u2014 also courtesy of China \u2014 was much, much less infectious. Current figures suggest that up to 90% of people exposed to COVID-19 even slightly, will be infected..Reported mechanisms for transmitting the coronavirus infection are VERY hard to completely eliminate, and includeperson-to-person saliva, directly or via dropletperson-to-person nasal & respiratory secretions (snot) , directly or via airborne dropletsperson-to-surface-to-person, presumably from either saliva or snot on those surfaces.China is now (15 Feb 2020) disinfecting bank notes, which is very concerning: China Quarantines Cash to Sanitize Old Bank Notes From Virus.It is unknown how effective efforts to contain 2019-nCoV/ COVID-19. The range of possibilities goes from very effective to very ineffective..Regardless of containment efforts, the apparent infectivity of 2019-nCoV virtually guarantees that everyone will be exposed eventually, UNLESS a vaccine is created first. So is it dangerous? If containment efforts cannot slow expansion enough to allow most people to receive a vaccination, death rates may be close to those with the 1918 influenza epidemic.For example, if 75% of the worlds population is exposed within 18 months (not long enough for a vaccine!), then 63 million deaths can be expected. This assumes a world population of 7 billion, at 75% exposure rate over 18 months, an 80% infection rate, and 1.5% mortality rate. Most people would consider 63,000,000 additional deaths within 18 months dangerous..Regardless, the economic impact will be huge, with most US and European airlines and airports eliminating or greatly restricting flights to China. Control efforts will require closing malls, schools, theaters, churches and so on. This has been done in the US before, with the poliovirus. But the US was far more rural, with far fewer points of contact than is the case today.Just imagine the effects of closing the subways in New York and London!.Bottom line? Facts are emerging and may be revised. But based on current information COVID-19 is very dangerous indeed..What can you do?First, prepare for perhaps a month at home, with no travel. You\u2019ll need food, entertainment. and some water. Worst case, utilities are likely to keep working, so you don\u2019t need to go all \u2018prepper\u2019..Ask that your politicians pressure China, and other nations, to outlaw the human consumption of \u201cbushmeat\u201d and the like. The new coronavirus apparently came from eating a bat!These national food habits have led to many serious infections, including SARS, Ebola, and now WuFlu. Also, kissing camels (really!) needs to be sanctioned, since it is a significant contributor to the spread of MERS.
