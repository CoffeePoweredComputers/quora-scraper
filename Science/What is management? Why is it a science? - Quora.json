            "answer_text": "Management is often classified as a science due to actively identifying causes and effects of varied approaches. However, in practice, management is more of an art due to the varied personalities and traits of those being managed. Managers uphold standard operating procedures and regulations and so are characterized as those who \u201cdo what is right\u201d without taxing the mind with critical thinking. Leaders, in contrast, have more of a lasting or changing effect on people as they are more characterized as those who \u201cdo the right thing\u201d after assessment of a given situation striving for a goal of what a longer lasting positive outcome would be for all involved.
