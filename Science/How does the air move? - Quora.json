            "answer_text": "That is either a very simple question or a very complex one,depending on what you have in mind.What is air? It is a mixture of gases. What is a gas?It is a mass of particles called molecules bouncing around so hard that they cannot settle down, but bounce off each other and off any solids or liquids that they bump into. Like a lot of bouncing balls, they do not settle down unless they keep bumping into things that do not bounce them back again hard enough to keep them moving. The energy of their bouncing is what we feel as heat. The faster the molecules are moving, the hotter the gas, and the further apart the molecules will be on average.A liquid is similar, except that its molecules are not bouncing hard enough to fly off in every direction, but keep slipping over each other. A solid is one in which the bouncing is not strong enough to move the molecules past each other, so they stay in place.So, one way a gas can move is for its molecules simply to shoot off into the sky. That is what the air is made of, what we call the atmosphere.Another way is when masses of gas, such as the air, either have heavier molecules than the rest (being a different type of gas), or their molecules are closer together than elsewhere (meaning that their molecules are moving more slowly, and also meaning that the gas is colder). That means that such masses of air are DENSER  than others. If you put a dense object on water, it will sink. (try it with a solid stone, or pouring strongly salty water onto fresh water, or water onto oil).  In the same way, if you put a mass of cold gas into a mass of warm gas, it will sink, flowing down a mountain slope into a valley, just as the salt water would flow down a slope under fresh water.Similarly, if you heat part of a mass of cold air, it floats upwards, as oil under water will float upwards. if the gas that floated upwards cools down, it sinks again and if the same spot keeps getting heated (like if there is a candle in one spot) then the hot gas keeps rising and the cold gas keeps flowing down. We call that CONVECTION, which is one of the most important ways in which air moves. It is what causes winds, for example. Is that what you wanted to know? ",

            "answer_text": "Essentially, air moves in 2 ways (in a very basic explanation): Up and down, as air is heated and rises, or cooled and falls.Across, as air moves from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area.Non-natural movement can be done using fans, and there are other more complicated factors that impact air movement, but if you understand that wind (and basically all weather) is created by the uneven heating of the earth\u2019s surface by the sun), you will have nailed it.
