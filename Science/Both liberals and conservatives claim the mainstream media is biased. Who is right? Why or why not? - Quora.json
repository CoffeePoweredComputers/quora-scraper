            "answer_text": "Both liberals and conservatives claim the mainstream media is biased. Who is right? Depends on the media service being talked about. If you watch, browse or listen to Fox News, your bias is definitely conservative. They claim to be fair and unbiased, but if you look closely at any of their stories, there is always a bent to make liberals and their policies look completely idiotic. If you watch, browse or listen to MSNBC, your bias is without question liberal. Conservatives and their policies are destructive and ready to bring the world to war. Even Morning Joe has moved to the left over the years. However, there are unbiased sources that tend to get hate from both sides, such as PBS. I\u2019ve noticed they walk a very fine line, but if there is any criticism one way or the other, they immediately get bashed for being biased. In truth, they\u2019re probably the least so. PBS is a good example of personal bias regarding the mainstream media. There is a tendency in some people to only prefer news outlets that confirm their own personal bias. If they see Donald Trump as the savior of the U.S., then no amount of truthful reporting is going to change their mind. PBS does a piece discussing Trump\u2019s promises, does based on reliable sources, history, science and realities, and concludes that such and such promises are unrealistic and undoable. Rabid conservatives who make a living trashing anything having to do with liberals, immediately proclaim PBS biased, and call for defunding. Anyone living in the conservative echo chamber agree, and begin a protest. PBS does an evenhanded but critical piece on Hillary Clinton, using reliable sources, history, science and realities, and concludes many of her promises are unattainable. Rabid liberals proclaim PBS a conservative shill. The extreme left demands it gets defunded. I\u2019m a liberal, but not so extreme that I don\u2019t value the different sides. This is not true of many. I\u2019ll wager, though, that most of those rabidly biased tend to sit to the right of center to varying degrees. I can go into the psychology of political leanings to support my claim, but it would make this answer a lot longer. Personal bias tends to color our perception of how biased a news source is. If a person is conservative, and the source agrees with that persons beliefs, that person tends to think the source is being fair. Otherwise, countering a belief makes the source biased, regardless of the truth. Same goes for liberals. No media outlet is 100 percent unbiased, and the degree and type of bias can vary from program to program. But, there are some outlets the try to be more fair than others. If you are only getting your news and information from a few sources, and you feel they mostly agree with how you think, then those outlets are demonstrably very much biased. It means you\u2019re not getting the whole story. This is the case for too many these days, and one of the reasons we\u2019ve become so divided. We all think we\u2019re completely right, and our media choices confirm that. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea that MSM (Mainstream Media) is Liberal is utterly fallacious but almost all are biased. The media is a tool of the Establishment and owned and controlled by multi-billion dollar corporations that have a clear agenda as well as an almost unconscious culture that permeates almost everyone involved. The agenda of these corporate forces is established at the top executive level and disseminated throughout the organization. Most outlets have essentially the same agenda almost without exception. They want to maximize profits \u2014 remember these corporations represent far more than just the news, they represent many business interests profit and power. To that end they attempt to entertain and inform to the extent it furthers their organizational objectives and cater to those who constitute the majority of their audience \u2014 they are the establishment. We must understand first that there is a large difference in what are Social and Fiscal positions that range from Left to Right. It is quite common for a news outlet to be socially on the Left while being Center Right or Right in all other areas and this applies to most MSM. Examples of political social issues include abortion, civil rights, such as minority rights, women\u2019s rights, gay rights, transgender rights and a host of issues that apply to acceptance of social diversity. On the other hand fiscal policy applies to policy that impacts corporate regulation, wage inequality, taxes, war and in general the ability of the rich and powerful to continue to enrich themselves and control government. It should be understood that it is in the best interests of big business to be, in general socially on the Left, while remaining fiscally on the Right, and best suits the needs of the establishment when they are socially on the Left, appear fiscally in the Center. This enables the establishment to appear to be on the Left and embrace diversity, meaning all consumer groups, while also maintaining power and control fiscally. Control is best accomplished when messaging is mixed and falls within what is considered societal norms. Trump would be far more to the liking of all MSM if he kept his radical Right wing fiscal policy without sounding like a crazed Right Wing dictator who is unstable.. Note how large tax breaks for corporations that cost billions of dollars are rarely questioned but paying for healthcare is always questioned.. This is almost ubiquitous and is where you see almost all MSM outlets following the same pattern. Fox News is the exception here in many respects and they land to the Right on social positions and fiscal positions, however there are even outliers within Fox who report the news in a fairly balanced manner like Shepard Smith. Fox disseminates and is responsible for more false information than any other MSM outlet while Fox viewers are the least educated and are the most uninformed among all MSM outlets. CNN is closer to the Left on social concerns but are closer to Center Right on all other issues. Recently CNN hired Sarah Isgur Flores, a Trump Republican spokeswoman to help with the network\u2019s political coverage and in 2016 hired Corey Lewandowski who worked on the Trump campaign. Neither are Journalists. These kinds of hires show the true nature of these kinds of outlets who enjoy the appearance of being \u201cLiberal\u201d according to many but are far from it. MSNBC is the closest to the Left among the big three MSM outlets but even MSNBC has clear Center Right bias and follows the same patterns as most of the rest of MSM. Exceptions like Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes and some others give the network the appearance of being genuinely Left but even these Lefties, for example, never mentioned the West Virginia Teachers Strike, a rather glaring omission. MSNBC like the others love Center-Right candidates that offer a return to the 80s and 90s while they minimize true Progressive candidates. To see the true nature of the messaging that is pumped out we need only look at how Progressive policy positions are minimized by all three of these MSM outlets. Even as I write this MSNBC who is supposedly Liberal is minimizing Bernie Sanders and suggesting that his ideas are old, dated and useless against Trump. This claim is supremely false and easily debunked. All the new faces in Congress making news did so with nearly the very same policies and ideas. If that isn\u2019t enough one need only see how much money Sanders is raising from small donors while leading the polls among other Dem candidates. Yet somehow to so many MSNBC commentators this is old, ineffectual and will fail against Trump. According to their thinking Hillary was the perfect weapon against Trump, yet clearly this was not the case. By comparison the largest online Progressive media outlet \u201cThe Young Turks\u201d does a great job of covering politics without a Center Right bias and tries to cover things truthfully. Regardless of your affiliation take a listen to them for a comparison and read on what is missing from so called Left MSM outlets. MSM questions like \u201cHow are you going to pay for that?\u201d are almost always applied to social programs, but not applied to welfare for the rich. We don\u2019t hear these questions applied to war or big breaks for Corporations. We do hear this asked constantly about programs like Medicare for All, a single payer healthcare options that reflects existing programs on almost all other developed nations.. We don\u2019t hear how families go bankrupt trying to pay for medical costs, we don\u2019t question bailouts for banks, we don\u2019t question spending more on war than the next ten biggest nations. MSM also conveniently avoids reporting how huge Corporations like Amazon take advantage of their employees or fail to pay a single cent in Federal taxes in 2018. Or hear about how they tell employees having a tough time making ends meet to go get food stamps, etc. And this is not uncommon\u2026 Go take a look at how much in taxes many of the largest companies paid last year, or pick a big corporate name or bank at random and go look up their Corporate Rap Sheet online and see how long a list they have.. You won\u2019t hear this kind of reporting in your \u201cLiberal Media\u201d so just how \u201cLiberal\u201d are they really? This is the true bias in the MSM, the bias for big business and big money. Yes most of the media embraces things like gay rights and civil rights because if they didn\u2019t it would cost them. Back in the 1980s several members from the Soviet Information Ministry, came to visit the United States and met with those who worked for similar agencies here in the US, like CIA and others.. They reportedly stated their amazement at the immense effectiveness of the \u201cmessaging\u201d used in the United States, they said, \u201cIt\u2019s simply amazing what you have accomplished here.\u201d The representatives from the US asked what they meant\u2026 They said, \u201cEveryone here thinks exactly the same way, it\u2019s an amazing accomplishment.\u201d They went on to say, \u201cIn the Soviet Union the people know that all our messaging is propaganda \u2014 but here in the US the people don\u2019t even think propaganda exists..\u201d So there you have it\u2026 If you want to believe that a politician or a reporter is Left or Liberal because they\u2019re a registered Democrat fine. But try listening carefully to what they say or don\u2019t say. Look where the money is coming from, be they a politician with big corporate donors or a MSM figure with a big corporation. The culture in media in the US is nowhere near the Left. Reality check: The United States is an outlier among First World nations \u2014 the US favors big money and big business above all. Allowing and enforcing ideas that the MSM are Liberal or unbiased is all part of the image they want Americans to buy into because it enforces message control. This is how big money and power protects itself, in the past and today in 2019. ",

            "answer_text": "My view is that the non-partisan media bends over backwards to avoid being accused of being liberal. Look at some of the things the \u201cLiberal\u201d media did over the past 20 years: All Monica all the time: 18 months the media talked about Clinton and Monica Lewinski. And the only reason that was a thing is because Republicans were hell bent on having a scandal in the Clinton Whit House. I'm not excusing what he did, but in the grand scheme of things it wasn't that important (I'll concede that it opened him to blackmail\u2026) Do you really think the \u201cLiberal\u201d media helped Clinton with this? Al Gore invented the Internet: He never claimed it. He (correctly) said he supported funding the military program tha led to creation of the internet. Did the \u201cLiberal\u201d media Gore with this? War in Iraq: The \u201cLiberal\u201d media went along with Bush almost unquestionably. But her e-mails! & Benghazi!: Poor judgement, sure, but nothing criminal. To avoid appearing biased the \u201cLiberal\u201d media responded to every horrid thing Trump did by talking about an issue with Hillary. It's called false equivalency. You think they helped her there? The other day I wrote an answer about the fundamental dishines of the political right in America. This is aided and abetted by the conservative media which is just as dishonest (it's a symbiotic relationship). Anyone that doesn't repeat the lies is called \u201cLiberal\u201d whether it's accurate or not. The main media is driven by advertising, the more viewers the more advertising dollars. Sensation gets viewers. If you want to see real Liberal media watch Democracy Now! or listen to the Podcasts by Crooked Media. You'll quickly see that CNN, NBC, etc ain\u2019t it\u2026 Also-as others have noted most reporters identify as liberal. However most editors identify as conservative and they decide what goes on the air or in print, not the reporters\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s get the conservatives out of the way first: They are wrong, because the campaign to accuse the media of having a \u201cliberal\u201d bias is based on two things that are just as wrong: Conservatives are too often defending the status quo, which means they are defending injustice, racism, misogyny, homophobia, unfair or unsafe business practices, climate theory deniers and many other positions that cannot be defended by facts (climate change denial) or are supported much more poorly than they wish (trickle down economics). As a result, when the mainstream media simply covers these subjects, they tend to produce content that supports progressive ideas. That is not a bias.The conservative \u201cliberal bias\u201d campaign itself is indeed just that: a deliberate campaign to undermine the credibility of the mainstream media so as to keep conservatives and conservative-leaners in a controlled stream of conservative-friendly spin (Fox News) or outright misinformation (Breitbart).\u201c\u2026two events in the early 1960s convinced the right that creating conservative media wasn\u2019t enough to achieve balance. Conservatives would also have to discredit existing media.\u201d \u201cThe Conservative War on Liberal Media Has a Long History\u201d Liberals do not claim that the mainstream media is \u201cbiased\u201d in the same way that conservatives do, although there is always legitimate criticism about the potential suppressing of stories that cause problems for advertisers or other well-connected entities. However, the primary criticism from liberals in the present day is that the mainstream media, now owned by a handful of giant corporations, has become so obsessed with maintaining ratings that they are biased towards false equivalency: allowing two viewpoints of wildly mismatched credibility exist as if they \u201cbalance\u201d each other. Fox News is, of course, the worst offender in that they have to entertain InfoWars-level absurdities as \u201cnews\u201d in order to \u201cbalance\u201d stories where the facts might prove liberals are right. However, the major networks also give equal time to credible and not-so-credible spokespersons (and rarely challenge either) in order to avoid controversy and lose ratings\u2014except when a sensational, ratings-goosing story overrides their caution. This explains how Donald Trump got millions of dollars in free coverage and coverage of complex, real issues suffered as a result.

            "answer_text": "The conservatives are correct \u2026 unless you are referring to talk radio. But in all other media, it is not even close, and there exists overwhelming evidence that the media is biased in favor of the liberal point of view. If you cannot find loads of evidence within two minutes of searching, tell me, and I\u2019ll provide the evidence. But all you really have to do is listen to or read what members of the media say about themselves. In my opinion, an overwhelming majority of people in the media will admit that the media is filled mostly with people whose political views are liberal. But they won't call it a bias. They will refer to these liberal views as the natural byproduct of working in an industry where most people are moderately well educated and passionate about politics. And they will never acknowledge that their liberal views would jeopardize the manner in which they report the news or cause them in any way to lose their objectivity. People in the media are correct when they admit that members of the media are overwhelmingly liberal, but they are usually wrong about everything else. And the reason that Fox News was so popular with conservatives is because Fox was one of the very few places on the small screen where conservatives could go for news which was mostly slanted in favor of the conservative point of view unlike the liberal bias which is favored almost everywhere else.

            "answer_text": "I only moved to the US a few years ago. When I compare the mainstream media here with those in Europe, there are massive differences. Main difference is that in the US, news are \u201cstories\u201d amd news coverage is so commercialized that it is betraying its core function of providing objective reliable sources of information. It is a good practice that w.g. in Germany, news channels, even private ones, do not interrupt their program with commercials. Herw, in the US, they take a commercial break every few minutes. News are being dramatized into stories to be entertaining. Certain issues are being talked to death by various talking heads looking at it from every possbile angle with little news value added in the process. The sources that I resort to because they come close to what I am used to from Europe are PBS, NPR, Frontline, VICE and BBC, and, while it was still up, Al-Jazeera. Everything else is ever so US-centered: they waste hours talking and regurgitating the same few headlines of the day while sucking every drop of sensation out of them. I think most US mainstream media are biased towards the Democratic view of the world. But not because the DEMs have a stronghold on them but rather because the DEM view of the world is closer to the \u2018 accepted view of the world\u2019 as you would also find outside of the US. The REP have separated themselves quite a bit from (the only one true) reality whilst the DEM are still closer to it. The DEM\u2019s way often is to operate behind the curtains with a certain tendency towards corrupt behaviors while the REP try to manipulate the masses by spinning communication. Climate change is a case in point. The US is the only country (!!!) in the entire world where it has worked to manipulate millions into believing that climate change is not a man-made challenge or not even a challenge at all. Shows such as The O\u2019'Reilly Factor are a case in point. They would simply not fly in Europe - at least not until now - because they are so obviously partisan and truth-spinning that the vast majority of people wouldn't enjoy watching them. Breitband.com is trying to make inroads into Europe and meeting a lot of resistance - fortunately! The \u201cperceived\u201d biases in the mainstream media are, in my view, a massive problem and threat to democracy. Only an impartially informed and educated populace is able to make educated decisions in their own best interest. I see this condition massively under threat in the US, as the recent elections have clearly shown. ",

            "answer_text": "Bias is a complicated term. It is one which most people fundamentally misunderstand or abuse. First: every source has bias. This bias may be meaningless, but everything has bias. Second: there are multiple kinds of biases. \u201cConservatives\u201d seem to claim disagreements with their arguments as being \u201cfake news.\u201d Most of the time this doesnt hold up, and when a story is inaccurate or incorrect, it is usually retracted post-haste by reputable news agencies. [Looking at you fox news for not doing this] A story being incorrect or inaccurate doesnt intrinsically mean a network is biased. It is something that simply happens. Humans screw things up. Screwing things up intentionally and repeatedly however is an issue. This can be due to political leanings, or merely sensationalism. These are two very different biases. And they at times may overlap. News agencies typically have a range of topics they are more focused on or dedicated to. This is a form of bias. It does not alone discredit the news agency to have a specialty area. So long as it is accurate and intellectually honest in presentation. [You can use accurate information in dishonest ways.] Some agencies are blatantly slanted and biased in their writing. They will use loaded language, rhetorical tricks and other dishonest methods to get you on board. Most of what conservatives consider \u201cleft wing media\u201d does not fall into this category. But of course the media a large place. [Also, most of what conservatives consider to be left is actually centre.] Opinion pieces are also typically strongly biased. Most moderates/liberals would considerthe NYT a noteworthy source. However, the opinion sections are absolute junk 99.59% of the time. And they function on a similar level to fox news, which failed qualifications of being a news agency in certain countries outside the states - where it is instead only able to be listed as entertainment. In personal experience, reading through numerous publications, I have found problematically biased publications on the left and the right. I have found that the right considers the centre and the left both as \u201cliberal\u201d in recent times at least. Many of the publications with the most overt and pushy biases however seem to lean rightwing, with a handful of exceptions. I believe this has to do with the education factor. Increased education increases the odds you are \u201cliberal.\u201d less education is generally more heavily correlated with being conservative. This also has to do with exposure to the world. And there are anomolies, certain fields may lean one way or another. Critical thinking and the ability to accurately assess information independantly is thus important. This is what they seek to teach in schools because it means you are less susceptible to being misled. I follow some right-leaning and left-leaning publications. I do so based on their veracity and ability to deliver content honestly. I follow multiple organisations because it is difficult for one organisation to cover every variety of topic and I wish to push out that form of selection bias. I could give you a non-comprehnsive list of respectable sources. And sure you could probably cherry pick examples regardless of the source. Instead however, i think its best to invest yourself into advancing critical thinking and analyses of such texts. I will say its important to consider who is telling the story and why, what is their background? What are they saying and what are they leaving out? How accurate is their information? Do I have the skills to adequately assess this situation, or oughtnt i postpone judgement until a later date. List of cognitive biases - Wikipedia Bias (statistics) - Wikipedia List of fallacies - Wikipedia RationalWiki is another great source to look into topics. It covers extensively bias and common argument/debate maltactics. Factcheckers are also your friend. Fact checkers purpose is to find the original claim and source to try the veracity of a claim. There should be a link included to the primary source. The primary source is what you need in concluding veracity. Of course, learning about your own biases and weaknesses is an involved process and could take time. It will make you a stronger more accurate person, and like most things worth doing it will take some effort and isnt an overnight ordeal. But slow and steady wins the race! ",

            "answer_text": "The conservatives have it more correct. Some of the explanation is intuitive. Journalists don\u2019t check their bias in at the keyboard no matter how even handed they intend to be. Every survey over the past decades indicate that many more journalists are Democrats and donate to Democrats than those who are Republicans. That\u2019s not surprising because the large majority of journalism professors are liberal and not conservative. What would be surprising if bias didn\u2019t somehow bleed through.  Survey: 7 percent of reporters identify as Republican Within the White House press pool for Obama, not a single journalist was a registered Republican. But intuition aside, objective studies also show that there is liberal bias in mainstream news media. \"A media person would have never done this study,\" said Groseclose, a UCLA political science professor, whose research and teaching focuses on the U.S. Congress. \"It takes a Congress scholar even to think of using ADA scores as a measure. And I don't think many media scholars would have considered comparing news stories to congressional speeches.\" Of the 20 major media outlets studied, 18 scored left of center, with CBS' \"Evening News,\" The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second, third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal. Only Fox News' \"Special Report With Brit Hume\" and The Washington Times scored right of the average U.S. voter. The most centrist outlet proved to be the \"NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.\" CNN's \"News Night With Aaron Brown\" and ABC's \"Good Morning America\" were a close second and third. Media bias is real, finds UCLA political scientist http://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2016-10-18/hillary-clinton-gets-more-donations-from-the-media-than-donald-trump-study-says: 96% of press donations went to Hillary.

That is not necessarily evil or somehow disqualifying from reporting on events. The media bias is for click-bait, for attention, for ratings. \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads\u201d so the \u201cmedia\u201d wants blood blood more blood, whether real or political. That leads to pathetically bad \u201creporting\u201d but a bias not for left or right, just for ratings. Most media today is corporate owned and most of those corporations are owned by conservatives (or Republicans), conservative billionaires in fact. Like Robt Murdoch or Phillip Anscutz (of Gorsuch infamy) or Comcast\u2019s owners. So media ownership is certainly right-wing biased. Indeed there is now unfortunately a fairly big Alt-Right Wing media wing, not just biased but dishonest and hypocritical. On the other hand, the reporters themselves are probably spread across the spectrum, like the rest of us; while the pundits/talking heads will slew a right or left wing slant given the show and possibly the network. Fox is always slanted right (and into blatant lies which they went to court to preserve). MSNBC used to be slanted slightly to moderately left but not since Comcast bought them. Now they are center right. CNN is just crazy; though it has the most balanced show, in Fareed Zakaria. John Dickerson on CBS still works hard at presenting both sides of issues. Meet the Press no longer bothers much. There is basically NO left-wing mainstream media. Air America tried. (Newspapers also have a bias. WaPo is deemed leftish while WSJ is deemed rightish. It\u2019s the editorials and opinion pieces that are most slanted either direction. ) So there is no simple one-size-fits-all answer. You\u2019ll need to think for yourself when choosing who to listen to and whether to believe them. ",

            "answer_text": "Both. And neither. The media isn't biased. Individuals within the media are biased. News reporters may or may not be biased, but the best ones are fact based and either explicitly state their biases (allowing the viewer/reader evaluate those biases) or bury them entirely and not allow them to impact the story. Same goes for writers, actors, executives, etc. They likely have individual biases, but there's not a coordinated effort aside from peer pressure in whatever your particular social circle may be. The biggest bias in the media is the bias towards making money. At the end of the day, media organizations are businesses. They exist to turn a profit. So decisions are made based on what will increase viewership and raise revenue (whether that be ad sales or ticket sales). So the news focuses on style and scandal rather than substance. Movies focus on either broadening appeal or catering to core demographics. And the people who dislike those decisions, whether they are in news, radio, music, television, or cinema, tout it as evidence of some sort of bias that excludes them rather than acknowledging that it was a simple business decision intended to make money from someone else. I don't particularly enjoy a lot of the shows my kid watches, but that's not because PBS has an anti-adult bias in the morning. We accept that is simply a demographic decision. But when it comes to things like politics, gender/race representation, or any number of other things, we blame bias. Because acknowledging that it's a business decision means also acknowledging that there's enough people that disagree with us that those people are worth catering to. And that's scary for people who dislike when people think differently. ",

They\u2019re both right, but there\u2019s a silliness to this whole debate. People seem to believe that there\u2019s a gold standard for the non-biased media and there are just some bad journalists that deviate from it. But when people are involved there will be bias. If the bias doesn\u2019t exist in the stories themselves, it exists in the editorial decisions about what\u2019s worth reporting on. The reality is that most news organizations exhibit some bias. [1]  These rankings from Allsides are the product of an ongoing research project to measure bias in media. They do this through a factor of voting participation accumulated from both stories as well as general impressions of news organizations. This screenshot of a snippet of M and N should reveal some common news outlets and what I would hope are expected bias leanings. To suppose that the media is heavily liberal or heavily conservative is counterproductive as there is a spectrum of bias across the mainstream media. AllSides has even shown that there is varying amounts of bias within the same organizations:  Fox\u2019s editorial content is considered more right leaning than its general news desk. CNN, as well, fits a similar pattern. Different editors, different selections of what to share, different bias ratings.  They\u2019re both right, but they\u2019re also both wrong in how much it matters. As consumers of media, its on us to be aware of bias in reporting and to make choices about what we consume so we don\u2019t find ourselves isolated in an echo chamber making wild rationalizations about how the \u201cothers\u201d are somehow uniquely amoral or corrupt.

Both of them taught about bias and about how all human communications contain bias. One of them felt it was his personal mission to ensure that everyone who passed his class could identify bias. On a typical news article, you will find about three or four sentences of fact along with several paragraphs of fluff, extrapolations, and reactions. As free human beings, it is our duty to be able to differentiate all of the above. It is our own responsibilities to ensure that we are separating the facts from the opinions before we make our own objective opinions. Bias has the opposite effect on me than it has on most people. When I see bias, it turns me off to the claim that is being made. I'm kind of a contrarian by nature, so any time I see something that is too good to be true, I spend time researching it to find out if it is true. The fact is, if you are getting your news from social media, most of it is incorrect. If you are getting your news from traditional media sources, slightly less of it is incorrect. The only reliable way to get news is to work for it, and the internet has made that extremely easy for us to do. Unfortunately, the internet has also made it extremely easy for us to get lazy as well. The masses simply accept regurgitated, spoon-fed snippets without any regard for whether they are true or not. As a result, we have elected the kind of president we deserve. ",

If \u201cthey\u201d are liberal, and you are liberal, then you might think that they are not biased. Same thing with conservative. And that\u2019s simply because both the media outlet and the consumer roll the same way. It\u2019s like two trains moving at the same speed; look out the window of either one, and the other appears to be standing still. But the politics is not where the real bias problem comes in. The real problem is that many of the talking heads really have no clue what they are talking about, or otherwise \u201cdumb down\u201d the vocabulary so as to be accessible to the elementary school mind. Bottom line: too much media can make you stooooopid. Me? I keep Fox News on all day long. Has nothing to do with the obvious political bias. Has more to do with entertainment. This is like driving in the wee hours of the morning and listening to Art Bell or some wacky preacher on the radio, just to stay awake. When I want the \u201creal deal,\u201d I go hunting for it, and consult numerous sources, few of which I trust very much. The usual suspects: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Washington Post, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, etc. On the net, CBSN. About the only \u201cnews show\u201d I trusted was the Diane Rehm Show on NPR. I didn\u2019t really expect the truth, but I did expect, and did receive (most of the time) a representative sample of all the half-truths. And most guests on the show were reasonably well spoken. And now, she\u2019s retired. And Walter Cronkite is dead. And HIS greatest work? Maybe this:  My 2 cents. ",

This chart kinda shows that,  Editors, by the very nature of their work, are relatively well educated, and therefore tend to be more liberal than the population as a whole. I know they try diligently to always be unbiased in what they report, but I think most media are slightly left biased. But, then there\u2019s this other group of media like Howard Stern, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, etc. who are extremely and blatantly right biased. Maybe they\u2019re trying to make up for the \u201cliberal mainstream media\u201d by being completely 1-sided in their reporting. If you want the most unbiased media you can get, watch CNN. It\u2019s not perfect I know, but their bias is very subtle. Many of the anchors on Fox News, on the contrary, were even defending Trump after his \u201cgrab them by the p***y\u201d remark, which any sane person knows is indefensible, especially for a presidential candidate. From what I\u2019ve seen, any reporter accusing the mainstream media of being too liberal is himself an extreme conservative. It\u2019s much worse than the pot calling the kettle black. ",

Short Answer: Both are correct Longer Answer: Bias is part of the human condition. We can no more shed our bias than we can our feelings. The burn is, that its entirely possible, that the media does not see its bias, for what it is. Some people are going to feel very strongly, that President Trump, is the worst president in history and others are going to feel that the opposite, is closer to the truth. Why you may believe one or the other is true, its not facts that are moving you to that conclusion, its uncontrollable bias. Media sources have an additional reason to be biased and that is to support their companies revenues. Amazingly the majority of MSNBC\u2019s readers, viewers, and otherwise paying customers are Democrats and inversely the same is true of Fox News. Would Fox News or MSNBC slant stories with opinions, that their readers will respond to favorably, we are talking about billions of dollars here, so what do you think? ",

            "answer_text": "They are both right. There are very, very few truly independent media sources. Why? Because there is no money in it. With ever-increasing political polarization, people almost exclusively read what they agree with \u2014 their fragile egos are too wrapped up in how right they are that they need to feel validated by their choice of news source. It\u2019s human nature to want to be proved right. And, as profits are determined by repeat viewership, media companies will appeal to a certain chosen niche. Is it perfect? No. Is it better than the alternative of state-run media? Hell yes. At least now we have thousands of vying media companies, making it possible to spot and discern biases. In the case of state-run media, you are left with only a few very biased sources controlled by the currently ruling party. Here is a litmus test for a publication\u2019s inherent political leaning: Find articles marked \u201copinion\u201d.Determine which way these articles lean.The true bent of the media source is the opposite party.Media companies attempt to claim independence through offering both viewpoints. As such, they will maintain a slight (or large) bent on their regular, self-proclaimed unbiased pieces, and offer up opinion pieces from the other side. The difference is, they don\u2019t denote the inherent opinion in articles matching their viewers\u2019 leanings. This way, they can both make more money AND point to these opinion pieces and say, \u201cSee! We\u2019re not biased\u201d. Quite shrewd. Now, all that being said, the modern internet-based media landscape is largely dominated by the progressive ideology, because they are usually more connected in the online blogosphere. This is also why pollsters on left-leaning news sites were nearly universally taken off-guard with Trump won the presidency. All of their subscribers, in their man-made echo chambers, supported Hillary naturally, so it would be simple to overlook the fact than many people didn\u2019t like her. Now, a good amount of money has been made appealing to the previously nearly unacknowledged conservative minority in the younger generations. Also note that articles have become a commodity. Often, whoever breaks a story first makes nearly all of the cash flow (and with the internet, it can come down to seconds). As such, fact-checking has taken a backseat to clicks and speed. ",

            "answer_text": "They are both right but are completely wrong on to whom it is biased in favour and why. The media is biased in favour of those who own and fund it. Wealthy men have every interest in not allowing certain stories to be published. The media, in the US, is relatively liberal by its own standards. However, it is corporatist economically and supports anything that will create a profit for advertisers who in turn will fund the media. The media doesn\u2019t have anything much to lose by supporting things like gay marriage or abortion rights but it has a lot to gain by supporting things like the Iraq War. I would highly recommend that anyone interested in the media read Herman and Chomsky\u2019s \u2018Manufacturing Consent\u2019.In \u2018freer\u2019 countries like the USA, the government is much more limited in what it can do, with regards to violence, towards its own citizens. Thus, the media operates on a propagandistic model which filters information to coerce its\u2019 own citizens into supporting certain policies. 1) Ownership The mainstream media is largely owned by a handful of giant conglomerates and corporations. This largely limits the types of stories that get published. In my own country, Ireland, the media that reaches each household on a daily basis is almost entirely owned by the State and corrupt billionaire Denis O\u2019Brien. There are of course the usual Murdoch rags too. Pretty much none of O\u2019Briens\u2019 papers every criticise him and when they do it is usually mild or calls those he bribe corrupt and ignores his corruption. This is equally true for the US media whose mainstream papers and news channels are equally centralised 2) Advertising Advertisers fund the media and without its funding the media company collapses. There are countless examples one can find via a quick google search where advertisers threaten to pull funding over certain stories. 3) SourcesWhere does most of the sources of information come from? Offices around Washington and \u2018insiders\u2019 who feed the media whatever rubbish the want. Without sources the media has nothing so it toes the line to keep access with the Washington insiders. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs when you have to rely on hacks and whistleblowers to get the truth about what your government is actually doing and how far from the truth their stories are. Same for the media which puts out these stories based purely on what the government said happened. 4) FlakAnything from bills in congress, letter campaigns, lobbyists and lawsuits make up flak. Smaller media companies who step out of line regularly get sued and bombarded with flak from a corporation who was criticised by a story published by the media company. Large MNC\u2019s come together and lobby lawmakers to pass favourable laws. The entire purpose of flak is to discredit people and organisations who can\u2019t keep their mouth shut. This largely run by the modern propaganda agencies. Public relations. 5) Fear There is always an enemy in the US media to stir up the war drums or to curb civil liberties. From anti-communism to the illegal invasion of Iraq to the PATRIOT ACT and the war on terror. Anything that can make a profit or discredit those who expose government and corporate lies will be used to its full extent. ",

Think of left to right as a scale of 1 to 100 ( clearly this is not how it is in real life) The Liberal is a 10 the Conservative is a 90.The Media is a perfect 50. The only way to be perfectly unbiased is for the media to be a 90 on way or the other, but then its only not bias to that one person. a perfect 50 is 40 points to the left or right of each person, making the media seen as bias. Its hard for the person on the fast side of one or the other to see something reported in the middle as not bias. Now where the real bias is comes down to is ratings and Profit. Even if your the most high minded of journalist who wants to do the best job possible...you work for a business who has shareholders and profit expectations. If you don't you at least need readers and ad money to not go under. You have 2 stories, one is about how a contract to build new roads using a new surface material could save millions but may not be as good for the environment. The other store is The Person running for office just called the other guys wife ugly. Now I said nothing about what party or anything about that, no political bias...but you know what story is going to run ( unless maybe your watching CPAN of NPR) How much did fox news spend in the last year talking about issues...or CNN...or MSNBC...Not much but tones on who will win the election. The Race gets viewers and ad money, stories about if the interest rate is to high or to low get the channel changed. There is one other Bias that has hurt the media that often effect the view of bias. If you think Global warming is not real you may think the media is bias because it keeps reporting that it is real. But the fact is that is the consensus of Scientist in that field, and to pretend that its a open to debate 50/50 issue is itself a bias. There is not always a 2 sides that need equal time. When someone says ISIS is a horrible group, we don't say and now here for ISIS is...Things like Birthers, people who believed in FEMA Camps, and other crazy conspiracies, should not get equal time. Its because sometimes the facts as bias to one side or the other. ",

            "answer_text": "Both of them. Noam Chomsky did an excellent analysis of right wing media bias in \u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d, in which he identified the economic and political factors behind right wing media bias, namely, that the product being sold is our eyeballs, and the actual consumer is big business. As such, media is unlikely to run stories critical of their advertisers, biasing them right. They are unlikely to run stories that alienate their government sources, again biasing them right. Large capital barriers to entry in the news business has essentially led to the consolidation of media corporations as big business; management is a close shop, with CEOs often coming from finance and mining sectors, again biasing the media right; media management has an incentive to maintain the status quo. At the same time, a left wing bias does exist. Anyone who has ever worked for a company knows that the interests of the boss doesnt necessarily dovetail with ones own. Journalists tend to be to the left of the mainstream, and they tend to be to the left of their boss, and the stories they write will tend to reflect that. It is for this reason that many on the right have noticed a left wing bias. This is brought home in my own country, where the government owned television station, free from the need to advertise and free from the need to keep the government sources happy is significantly to the left of the mainstream. N.b- Dr Chomsky is a very busy man, but it might be advisable to seek his opinion on this. One doesnt have to agree with everything he says, but rest assured he has a vast amount of research an interest in this topic. ",

A tech industry source, a farm industry source, an auto industry source, a liberal source, a conservative source, a centrist source, a university source and a rural town paper source. They\u2019re all going to say, \u201cThis is how this judge might affect the things you, our audience, care about.\u201d That\u2019s bias, and it\u2019s neccesary. The important thing is to know what the biases of a source ARE. And whether the biases of the source are strong enough to distort facts and to give inaccurate predictions about the future based on those facts. Ranking the media from liberal to conservative, based on their audiences As you get further from the center, you get an increased chance that the source will distort the facts and circumstances around the topic to score points with their audience. Liberals lean more towards adjusting their views around what the world IS, conservatives more towards what the world SHOULD BE. As you get further from center, Liberal reporting is generally less inaccurate and overtly slanted than conservative. So yes, the mainstream media is biased. But it\u2019s far LESS biased than media that isn\u2019t mainstream. Yes Liberal and Conservative sources are biased, but for some reason there are many more conservative sources that move beyond mere bias into outright propaganda. (Distorting their reporting to influence their audience towards goals. Rather than just reporting from a particular perspective.) Not all \u201cbias\u201d is equal. In fact that\u2019s probably one of the most destructive biases out there, the belief that \u201cboth sides have a point\u201d or \u201cboth sides are the same\u201d or \u201cboth sides have equally valid but contradictory facts\u201d. Sometimes no, the other side is just incorrect. Facts aren\u2019t opinions, and reality doesn\u2019t care what you wish it was, it just is. And that\u2019s my personal bias. I\u2019m a \u201ctechnocrat\u201d, someone that wants to see the data, along with methods of interpreting the data to most accurately predict the what I\u2019ll see around the next corner or in the next week. What WORKS, with not much concern about what \u201cSHOULD work\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "This question gets at a phenomenon known as the hostile media effect. In the 1980s, social psychologist Robert Vallone attempted to study perceptions of media bias. He and his team recruited people with pro-Arab views and pro-Israel views to participate in a study that had them view media reports of the bombing of a US Marines barracks in Lebanon. After viewing the coverage, those with a pro-Arab stance viewed the news coverage as ani-Arab. Those with pro-Israel sentiments viewed the coverage as pro-Arab. So what was that all about? Human beings have a pronounced tendency to prefer information and evidence that\u2019s favorable to our pre-existing point of view, while rejecting evidence that is unfavorable to our pre-existing views. This bias is known as \u2018confirmation bias,\u2019 and it means that we, as media consumers, are predisposed to react negatively to any information that undermines our pre-existing opinons or ideologies. So we may label those who present contrary information as biased, but when we see bias in others, it may actually be the case that our own bias leads us to to label others as biased. This isn\u2019t to say that there are no biases in the media reporting. Any time we apply a narrative to data points (something reporters do all the time), we choose the data points to include in our story and we choose explanations that link those data points. This process is subject to our pre-existing beliefs and understandings of how the world works. We decide which facts matter and we decide how the facts are linked into an overarching story. We can try very hard not to be biased, question ourselves, really challenge our own assumptions, but it\u2019s exceedingly difficult to fully succeed. Some in the media strike me as pretty good at this self-challenging, and some clearly make no attempt to question their data and narrative asssumptions. Perhaps the latter occurs more often when a media outlet draws ratings and clicks by creating heat more than light. It may be a good way to make money with news, but it\u2019s more prone to bias. On the audience side, most people don\u2019t really challenge themselves enough to identify biases. We want be right because we want to comprehend the world, and we want good guys and bad guys defined. Being right can also be a matter of pride. But in the end, all that can get in the way of self-correction. Our own biases cloud our judgment of what we\u2019re presented by others, whether in the media or in everyday life. So the question of who is right and who is wrong about media biase, liberals or conservatives, is too broad to reflect the reality of how biases operate. Bias is very much a case by case phenomenon that can occur on both the media side and the audience side, and it is not confined to one side of the ideological spectrum or the other. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are right! All media is biased. Media is made by people and all people over the age of a few weeks are biased. Bias can\u2019t be avoided. It is an inescapable consequence of experience and learning. Fears, loves, prejudices and preferences can\u2019t be erased from our brains, they can only be neutralized with other experiences or balanced out by different learning. Responsible journalists know their biases even better than their life partners. They work very hard to keep them from shading the facts of a story. Mostly they succeed, but perfection is impossible. Some measurable bias always creeps in. Let\u2019s try to choose the least biased word from: Harvey walked/strode/strutted/shuffled/sauntered/stomped/strolled/paraded into the courtroom. Most would answer walked. No bias there right? But if in fact Harvey either shuffled or strutted, the use of \u201cwalked\u201d demonstrates bias. Now measure each spoken word like this with a tight deadline and you will understand why bias can never be completely scrubbed from a story. But maybe bias has gotten stronger\u2026 Only forty years ago, news came mostly from a few respected places, usually a national TV network or a local newspaper. Competing for audience size, these media outlets depended on viewers for advertising revenue. Clear bias was bad for profits. In the eighties, the media landscape widened with cable television and talk radio. Audiences loved this. They were suddenly free to choose news like a child chooses to eat an apple or a candy bar. People loved the sugar content in \u201cnews\u201d that confirms and strengthens their world view. Candy bars are easier to sell than apples. Along came the Internet with its ability to profile and target audiences. Almost overnight, segmentation of audiences became a competitive advantage instead of a cost of doing business. Media outlets and businesses learned that they earn more from a consumer when they know their orientation (political and otherwise). Now in 2019, there are more flavors of news than ice cream. Bias is a product feature of human audiences sold by media companies to advertisers. A few cynical (notice my bias in this word?) media innovators gained market share by camouflaging opinion as news and manipulating the watcher\u2019s emotions to get them addicted to the natural adrenaline and endorphin highs associated with outrage. It has gone a bit far in my opinion, but that is always a danger when profit-driven enterprises deliver public services in a loosely-regulated market (and yes \u2013 I believe the news is a public service). But don\u2019t despair, there are still plenty of news sources that stick to facts and try to be unbiased. The chart below might help you find something worthwhile.  Thanks for the A2A. ",

Editorial - essentially opinion pieces. It seems that a lot of people are unable to distinguish between the two. When a Fox News or MSNBC personality gives their opinion on a piece of government policy, that\u2019s exactly what is it: an opinion. It is not a fact. It is completely fine for people to have and express opinions without it affecting their ability to also present actual, fact-based news. It is only when facts are manipulated or lies are told dressed as fact that we have a problem. Recently, the New York Times published an editorial (say it with me now: opinion piece) that was criticising President Trump. Trump, in his usual, monosyllabic way, blasted the piece on Twitter along the lines of, \u201cNew York Times. So bad. Fake news\u201d. It is not \u201cfake news\u201d. It is an opinion. It\u2019s not even claiming to be news at that point. If you disagree with a person\u2019s opinion, it does not mean that they cannot do their job and the fact that people seem to think that is insulting to journalists everywhere.

Largely due to the Fairness Doctrine, opinion has long been reported as fact, total nonsense given equal weight to established truth. More recently, the need to be first has eliminated basic fact checking. As a direct result, vast swathes of the general public are just horrifically misinformed, if not deliberately mislead. The media are only now figuring out how disastrous and damaging this truly is, having been blamed for recent political upheaval. Trump, for all his flaws (let's not go there), is absolutely correct in stating the media is the enemy of the people. They have failed. Completely. We are now living in the results of that failure.

On the night of our last US election I flipped through all the big news channels. The Fox News hosts were almost giddy with excitement. ABC, NBC, ad CNN hosts were all dejected and defeated looking. Yes, they are all slanted, though when it comes to TV news, one team greatly outnumbers the other in terms of total number of outlets. This is nothing new. It has literally been the case since at least the day Ben Franklin set up his first printing press. He absolutely slanted his news and selected his anonymous letters to the editor to further his preferred political agenda, and that\u2019s been the role of news media ever since. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't matter really, what's important is being able to spot bias and fact check. Whoever the journalists are will have their own bias, even if they try very hard to be neutral. Do they show both sides of an argument? Do they allow both sides to express their point of view? Do they press both sides to defend their point of view? Do they show obvious bias towards one side? If you can spot bias while also realizing your own bias then you can pick out the facts! Any doubts, fact check and see what other sources come up. For example, Anderson Cooper on CNN. He has speakers from both sides of the aisle. Usually he maintains a neutral facade: he will ask questions and let both sides give their views and then move on. On two occasions he has let that facade slip. Once with an eye roll at Kellyanne Conway and once with a comment to Jeffery Lord about defending Trump if he took a dump on his desk! Shows he\u2019s human and he still let them speak. Sean Hannity just cuts people off, so he doesn't let them speak. Not neutral, not even trying to be. A lot depends on who the journalists are aiming for! If you are preaching to the converted who are not interested in a balanced approach, you don't have to be neutral, because they are only interested in opinions that back up their own not in facts. Sad but true. And to be fair, it is hard, picking out fact from bullshit with the amount on information available online, but you have to find trusted sources. This is why Trump\u2019s attack on the free press is worrying. We need the press, with all their faults, to ask the questions that politicians don't want asked, because they act as a check on what politicians get away with. ",

Fox is a less like this, but they do mostly cover things that concern urban and educated people; they generally (like everyone else) don\u2019t cover the decline of the working class, rural America, de-unionization or education in the inner city (except for feel-good shit occasionally) very often. They are all biased in the direction of corporatism, because the news stations are literally owned by private firms. Because most people are not urban, educated, wealthy or pro-status quo, nobody is happy with the media right now. ",
