            "answer_text": "There are several brands of metal detectors that are excellent for pulling out gold nuggets of all shapes and sizes. I can comment only on the brands I know do the job. Minelab seem to have it sewn up when it comes to gold detecting, others will no doubt disagree but the proof is on utube for several Minelab metal detectors. Some of the detectors available are mind boggingly expensive, AU$11,000:00 for one detector with a standard coil, should you wish to purchase others coils to enhance your chances of finding the yellow stuff then you could easily spend the same amount for coils. Minelab in their wisdom realised that this detector was out of reach to people in some countries, so they got their thinking caps on and came up with a detector called the \"Gold Monster\" now this beast will set you back AU$1000:00 complete with a huge coil that goes deep. There are no frills or bells and whistles on this particular detector but it does the job very nicely. There are of course other detectors made by the same company for gold prospecting, it's an individual choice that one makes after seeing the results for themselves. The GPX 5000 is a legend at finding gold nuggets and it is around half the price of the GPZ 7000 detector at AU$5000:00. Hope this helps. Cheers, Chris. ",

            "answer_text": "Minelab, chose which ever model is best for you. I still use the 4500, the 5000 I found less than any other machine. The 7000 is very very good, but so is the price tag at just over $10,000.00, the Gold Monster at $1000.00 I found to be near useless and my mate used it and found a small lump the same day. Garret and Whites have their place but nowhere near as good as they claim in my experience. ",
