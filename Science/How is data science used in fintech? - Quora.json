            "answer_text": "Data science is at the core of the current transformation of the financial sector. Here is how it is used in fintech- 1. Payment and Transactions-Analysis and prediction of transaction volumes is key to enhance product value for customers. Data science enables better classification of payment records and thus allows banks to tailor additional services to their client\u2019s needs. This may vary from simple analytical features (How much did you spend on groceries last month?) to more advanced features such as the integration of payment records and personal data to allow for recommendation, loyalty rewards and other forms of proactive engagement. Generally, data science facilitates the holistic analysis of customer behaviour across all channels of engagement. 2. Credit Risk Evaluation-With the vision to make \u201ccredit accessible for more people\u201d, various FinTech startups are on the rush for clients and VC money. Their value proposition boils down to a \u201cfaster and more accurate credit risk evaluation\u201d process than at traditional banks, which enables them to reach a broader client base and minimize credit default rates. Reliably assessing the creditworthiness of an individual not only requires the consideration of various data sources (some start-ups claim to include more than 15.000 data points, as obscure as \u201chow fast does one type when filling out the credit application online\u201d) in a robust model, but also the calibration against training data (historical credit data etc.). The more predictive power one can accumulate, the better the business case. 3. Revenue and Debt Collection-Data science enables the utilization of powerful predictive models in order to optimize revenue and debt collection. Already at the moment of purchase it is possible to predict a probability of timely payment, thus making revenue collection more transparent. At the same time, insights of behavioral economics and predictive modeling can be applied to allow for a more successful debt collection, once due dates have been surpassed. Determining the optimal strategy to approach debtors is a delicate undertaking, which should not be left to random guessing. Recently launched start-ups such as Pair and Collect.ai underline the potential in this field. 4. Customer Journey Attribution-Customer Acquisition Costs and Customer Lifetime-Value are \u2013 as in most business models \u2013 key metrics for banks and financial service providers. Thus, minimizing churn rates and optimizing conversion rates are crucial activities within most financial organizations. Data science enables the structured understanding of all kinds of interaction data \u2013 from unstructured text, social network activity to direct feedback rankings \u2013 throughout the entire customer journey. Thus, enabling the efficient spotting of customers, which are likely to quit the service or identify those, which could be targeted for upselling activities. 5. Fraud Detection and Prevention-While they have been on the agenda even before data science became a recognized term, fraud detection and prevention are still among the top priorities of FinTech executives. Especially with the rise of e-commerce, fraud detection and early warning systems have evolved rapidly, all powered by data science, which allows for the real-time assessment of fraudulent motives on any given payment ",

            "answer_text": "Data Science becomes a trend for different fintechs because it can help them solve various business problems in a fast way. Here are the most frequent use cases in the fintech industry: Fraud detection is the most crucial problem for any financial institution, so they\u2019re constantly looking for anti-fraud tools and different ways of automation in risk management. Different types of frauds try to impersonate, steal, or perform money laundering schemas. Efficient anti-fraud tools must have prevention, protection, and notification systems. The data warehouse receives data on the fly from payment processing systems, passes it through the models, and generates real-time results. Also, Data Science can help to define patterns of the fraud collaboration, build schemas and interaction diagrams.Deep learning of the customer\u2019s performance allows conducting user segmentation, customer behavior modeling, as well as real-time and predictive analytics. BI tools allow visualizing the financial activity of the user in the digital bank ecosystem. The user\u2019s financial behavior insights assist with building product strategy for fintech organizations. An additional parameter that can be provided to fintechs from Data Scientists is a customer lifetime value (CLV), which is a prediction of all the benefits that a business can get from the relationship with a customer.The risk modeling system helps to define if the user is reliable and can be granted access to additional services, higher money credits, and lower rates. Data Scientists can build models based on product usage and open-source information from different sources.Product improvement strategy can be based on product usage analysis and market information. Data Scientists can build models and predictions of the feature changes in customer behavior and possible reaction to the fintech product changes.Process improvement can be based on the usage of the Digital twins\u2019 approach, which is a trend of product development for the last few years. The financial organization or digital bank can track offline operation and customer support processes metrics, analyze them and simulate the changes to evaluate future effects.Personalized marketing is one of the most powerful tools for the fintech products promotion. Data Science gives a possibility to analyze the behavioral patterns of the user and suggests the relevant financial products and services.",
