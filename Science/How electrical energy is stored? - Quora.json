            "answer_text": "The fact about electrical energy is that it is very easy to create it but very hard to store it efficiently. The simplest way to store electrical energy would be by using the capacitors. Be it simple capacitor or super capacitor. Capacitor is a basic electrical device consisting of two electrodes and a dielectric medium between them. Once the the capacitor is connected to an active circuit with a battery, one electrode is charge positive and and the other electrode is charged negative. Now, even after removing the battery, the electrodes of the capacitor would hold the sufficient charge (depending on type of capacitor and dielectric medium). So, it can act as a battery (a voltage source) when connected to a load.Electrical energy can also be stored with the help of superconductors. Superconductors exhibits a property to have very negligible resistance even compared to metals. So, if a current is passed through a superconductor loop, the current will theoretically be passed forever in the loop. Thus, electrical energy is said to be stored.In above two ways of storing electrical energy, the electrical energy is stored in its original form.However, we can simply convert electrical energy into other form of energy and store (be it not efficient.). Some of the basic examples are:Running an electrical motor attached to a flywheel. Use of electrical generator to convert back.Charging of an electrical battery thus converting inyo chemical energy and again using the battery to power the load.Heating a coolant using a heater and utilizing its heat energy to convert back to electrical energy by various means.Thanks.

            "answer_text": "Hi Mulla, . . . The only way to store electricity is in Capacitors and Inductors. Inductors are not a very good electricity storage and will give up their energy quickly. . . Even Capacitors, although some can hold the storage for some time, that is still usually only measured in seconds. Batteries actually, do not store Electricity, they are a Chemical energy storage device. . Just very convenient that they convert electricity to chemistry by them selves and return the energy as electricity. . . Most other Energy Storage devices need other means to put the energy into them for storage and again some device to recover the stored energy. ",

            "answer_text": "There are various ways to store the energy. Capacitors, Batteries are the most widely used devices to store the energy.  Energy stored in capacitor is given by:  E = (C*V^2)/2  Here E is energy in Joules, C is capacitance in Farads, and V is the voltage to which the capacitor is charged. A 10000 micro-Farad capacitor charged to 24 Volts can store 2.88 Joules of energy. This energy will keep a 20 Watt bulb on for 0.144 seconds on.  Energy stored in a batter is:  E (in jouls) = Battery voltages * Current * time (seconds)  = Battery voltage * Current * time in hours * 60 *60    = Battery voltage * Ah rating of the battery * 3600.  In terms of Watt hours, it is  E (Watt hours) = Battery voltage * Ah rating of the battery. If you take a battery of 12 Volts and 150 Ah rating, energy is 1800 Watt hours. It is enough for operating two 40 watt bulbs and one fan (power requirement is approximately 60 watts) continuously for approximately 12 hours and 51 minutes (assuming ideal battery and 100% efficient inverter). If the battery is used for running a motor of 1HP (= 746 Watt), it will last for 2 hours and 25 minutes. There are other ways of storing electrical energy. Refer this link for details:Grid energy storage  Thank you  Vishwanath for A2A. If you have any doubt or question, please comment.     ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it can. We use lead-acid and other forms of batteries in many applications such as autos, backup systems, flashlights, toys and other uses. But if the question is one of how do we generate power when it is abundant and release it when it is scarce then the question is one of economics. How much will you pay for storage of one kilo-Watt of power that normally costs about $0.12 to buy? There is still no good cheap solution to that. Paying $500-$1,000 for batteries and an inverter (I figure a 500W inverter plus 4x 100Ah batteries) to keep your essential home power needs active means you may well be willing to pay a high price for an unpredictable short duration storage need. But paying a high price for storage of normal energy requirements would make electrical bills soar. ",
