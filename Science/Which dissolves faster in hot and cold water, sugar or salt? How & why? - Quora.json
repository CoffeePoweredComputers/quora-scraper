I,ll assume you mean \u201ctable\u201d types which is \u201cSucrose\u201d and\u201csodium chloride\u201d. Between these two, sucrose wins having 1g dissolving in 0.5ml of room temperature water (or in 0.2ml of boiling water). 1.0g of NaCl dissolves in 2.8ml of room temperature (25\u00b0C) water and about 2.6ml of boiling water.
