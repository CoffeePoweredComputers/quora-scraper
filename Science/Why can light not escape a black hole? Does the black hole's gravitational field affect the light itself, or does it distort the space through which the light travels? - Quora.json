            "answer_text": "JW\u2019s Q: \u201cIs it that light can't escape from a black hole because of gravity causing a bend in space or because time stops within the event horizon?\u201d Stop & Bend: Gravity neither bends space nor does gravity stop time. Both space and time are unaffected by gravity relatively. Gravity affects baryonic matter and the electromagnetic energy (spectrum) ergo light etc. Light can not escape a black hole, simply, because the gravity of the singularity within the black hole is of such strength that light can not escape. Light is curved back to the singularity. mass/energy, black holes  Time: \u201c time is the numerical order of universal change\u201d, a measurement http://www.gsjournal.net/old/sorli/sorli17.pdf Time rarely stops in any instance, time never stops naturally. Take a picture and time stops for that picture\u2019s references point in time, but time continues to pass. And, time passes if here or at the event horizon or on the singularity. Time is simply a numerical order. Spacetime: The issue is confused by combining space and time, then measure via light. When we do that and light gets affected by gravity, we conceive time and space are affected by gravity. When that happens, because gravity affects light, the conception that time stops or space bends is imagined. But that \u2018imagined\u2019 \u2018concept\u2019 is amiss. Gravity affects light- Gravity bends light\u2019s path, physically, and that is called curvature. Einstein wrote a paper to explain it, you can find it in his Special Relativity paper, section 10 towards the end, it is the R=curvature equation. On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies Schwarzschild furthered Einstein\u2019s curvature of light via gravity explanations to offer his Schwarzschild Radius equation:  We also account for gravity curving light and call it gravitational lensing:  The understanding that light is curved by gravity, and that space and time are essentially not affected by gravity is essential to understanding the advance dawning the astro-cosmos sciences: the Universe is contracting not expanding. Via curvature of light cosmological redshift is produced. Miss Perceiven: If you miss-perceive space and time are affected by gravity instead of light curved/affected, you will miss why cosmological redshift exists as it clearly does exist and is observed empirically. When space is curved instead of light baring its burden of gravity\u2019s effects, false conclusions are inevitable from such: the universe is expanding at an increasing rate\u2026. the misperception by Miss P. When in reality, in the Universe: time does not stop, space does not bend, and the universe is not expanding at an increasing rate in defiance of gravity requiring dark energy\u2026. Why? Gravity, baryonic matter, physics, logic, empirical data. The Universe is contracting at an increasing rate via gravity, space is simply 3 dimensional, and time is a numerical order of change. Light can not escape from a black hole simply because of gravity\u2019s affects on light. Cosmology  douG Ref: ToETheory ",

            "answer_text": "A simpler way to state (and understand) this would be to use two analogies. For the first analogy we need to start by envisaging gravity not as a force that pulls things toward each other, but rather as the effect of placing a bowling ball on a very soft bed. The mass of the ball causes it to distort the once flat surface of the bed, and now other objects will, if placed within the distorted area, be drawn toward the ball. In this analogy the bowling ball represents anything with mass, e.g. you, me, a planet. The surface of the bed represents the fabric of spacetime. When there is no mass around, we say that spacetime is relatively flat. But when there is a mass placed on the bed, we say spacetime is distorted, or compressed. The visible effect of this distortion is what we call gravity. Black holes are where the entire analogy breaks down, and for a very simple reason that in a way makes the analogy still hold up in this one respect. The analogy breaks down because in reality the physics and the math which describe how spacetime work break down when one gets too near a black hole. So by breaking down when we introduce black holes to the situation, the bed analogy is still doing exactly what the laws of physics do in that same situation: ceasing to function normally. Here is how it goes. Spacetime, i.e. the surface of the bed from our analogy. It gets distorted near anything with mass. The more mass, the greater the distortion, just as with the bed. But remember that spacetime is space and time together. This is why time seems to slow down for things as they get near a black hole when looked at from a safe distance. If I stand way off and watch as a shiny rock drifts inward toward the event horizon of a black hole, I will never see it pass through. What I will see instead is the rock appearing to slow down more and more to the point that the light shining off it starts redshifting, until eventually it just fades from view entirely. That is because it isn\u2019t just space that is distorted; it\u2019s space and time together that are distorted. This was at the core of the genius that was the Theory of General Relativity, the recognition and inclusion of time as a variable into the math. Now to our second analogy: think of traveling through spacetime as being in a car that has only forward gears. The car can go any direction in space that you want by means of the steering wheel, but it can only move in time in one direction: forward. That is a universal law that we get from General Relativity: nothing can move backward in time. Ever. Not you, not me, not light, nothing. Ever. Now here at last is where we reach the answer to the question of why nothing, not even light can escape from inside the event horizon of a black hole. It is because that event horizon marks the point beyond which proximity to the extreme mass of the black hole has made spacetime so tightly compressed that the only directions one can travel in space that will also allow one to travel forward in time all point inward toward the center of the black hole. To go outward toward escape would require going backward in time, which is impossible. Hence nothing escapes. Incidentally, that is also where the term \u201cevent horizon\u201d comes from. It is the point beyond which no event inside the horizon can have any effect on anything that is outside the horizon. And the reason is because nothing inside, even the light from an explosion, can ever escape back outward to affect anything on the outside. ",
