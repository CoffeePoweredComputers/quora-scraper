            "answer_text": "\u201cA hydrogen bond is the attractive force between the hydrogen attached to an electronegative atom of one molecule and an electronegative atom of a different molecule. Usually the electronegative atom is oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine, which has a partial negative charge.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen Bonding is a dipole-dipole interaction between partially positively charged Hydrogen and a partially negatively charged atom like flourine,oxygen or nitrogen. However, the condition due to which H-bonding is so strong is the presence of highly electronegative elements covalently connected to hydrogen. Eg :- water(H2O), HF, ammonia(NH3)\u2026 ",
