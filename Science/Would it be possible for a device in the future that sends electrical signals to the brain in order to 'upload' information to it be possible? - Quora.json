            "answer_text": "I think it that exact thing would be very difficult. The problem is that long term \u201cknowledge\u201d is encapsulated in the wiring of the brain. It\u2019s not \u201csoftware\u201d it\u2019s \u201cwiring\u201d. The only \u201csoftware\u201d memory we have is short-term. It self erases after maybe 10 to 20 minutes\u2026just enough time for the long term storage system to rewire some neurons. So anything we wanted to insert into the brain permanently would have to be inserted at the same glacial speeds we can go at when we read something in a book or whatever. SO WHAT IS (POTENTIALLY) POSSIBLE? What I think is more plausible is attaching some piece of electronic circuitry (containing \u201cinformation\u201d) to the brain and teaching the brain to use it. It\u2019s hard to imagine what that might be like you. WHAT I\u2019M NOT THINKING OF: What I\u2019m not really thinking of is something like you sub-vocalizing the words \u201cHey Google: What is the albedo of the moon?\u201d \u2026and then hearing (but not through your ears) - \u201cAbout zero point one two\u201d. That would just be fractionally faster than just saying it into your phone\u2026not really much of an advance at all. WHAT I AM THINKING OF: I\u2019m thinking more of a kind of thing where you\u2019re trying to think of the albedo of the moon\u2026and you don\u2019t quite have it - it\u2019s on the tip of your tongue\u2026and then you remember it. It pops into your head, just like any other memory. So rather than the kind of \u201cinstant learning\u201d thing you saw in The Matrix when Trinity needs to know how to fly a helicopter - and it\u2019s pushed into her brain cells\u2026but also not like using Siri or Alexa. The memories lie outside your brain - but the access method makes it seem like you already knew it. BESIDES - JUST INSERTING MEMORIES ISN\u2019T ENOUGH: I\u2019d really like a calculator in my head\u2026so just like I can think \u201cthree times five\u201d and \u201cfifteen\u201d pops into my head - I could think \u201ctwelve point six five divided by nine point two\u201d and the answer to that pops into my head. It would be nice to have a spell-checker that watches what I\u2019m about to type and just corrects it on the way to my fingers. For a large class of things - just think about doing something without needing to actually do it\u2026imagine I could reach out a long, stretchy arm to turn on a light switch 10 feet away - and have the computer turn on the light for me.
