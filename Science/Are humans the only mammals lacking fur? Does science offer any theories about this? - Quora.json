            "answer_text": "We have hairy, which is basically the same thing, Other species of mammal vary in the amount, texture, thickness of hair and there are mammals less hairy than us, for example the naked mole rat.  Other examples include whales and Dolphins, seals, sealions, I\u2019m sure there are many others. So we are certainly not alone as less hairy mammals. It should not be a shock that if hair can be evolved it can be unevolved and also that evolution can impact it\u2019s texture, density and distribution. Whiskers are basically modified hair. As to what selection pressures specifically drove us to be less hairy there are various hypothesis some linked to sexual selection in an ape that walked upright. None of them has clearly won out as proving which selection pressure caused something can be tricky and in the real would it can be and often is the result of multiple different selection pressures.

We have clothes, warm houses, and natural selection didn\u2019t kill off the humans with less hair. And after a few thousand years, we became the spineless eggheads we are now. ",
