            "answer_text": "An economy in which no inflation (and no deflation either, if I understand correctly the question) would be brittle and litigious. Forgive me for saying that economies are like bicycles: their speed depends on how much you push on the pedals, whether you are cycling up- or downhill, and they expose you and your bottom to the misfortune of experiencing a pothole or a bump every once in a while. Add to such picture your cycling around wearing Guantanamo goggles, so that you cannot properly anticipate the road ahead, and we will have acceptably described how economies behave. Their core element is guess: it may be educated or plain silly, but at bottom still a guess it is. Let us just take two examples: labour and debt. You are an entrepreneur and employ some staff, whatever your business may be. You have agreed with them a salary, based on the assumptions made in your business plan. You sell a product or service at this or that price, in a determined quantity, earning a certain profit based on a number of factors such as input costs and volume. Suddenly, one of the components of your price (and profit, upon which you get your bread and butter) strays from the ideal path: the price of a commodity increases, your landlord is capricious and raises the ground rent, energy in the form of oil imported from an exotic country gets costlier. Or your employees claim for a pay hike because they feel they deserve (or need) it. Or, simply, your customers scale down their purchases obliging you to reformulate your margin. In a zero-inflation situation, you would be compelled to refactor all items every time a change as above described occurs. A typical case would be having to adjust real salaries to a changed environment: you would have to go to your employees and explain that they have to take a pay cut of x%. The same would apply to any other input change affecting your plan. You would face resistance, and possibly strikes or disruptions of whatever sort. In such a world everything would make its impact felt at once. Now, think of a world of mild and predictable inflation. In such a world, a gentle headwind eroding purchasing power would assert itself and separate two classes of people: those paying salaries from those earning them, and debtors from creditors. Chances are that if you pay a salary you have had access to capital and employed it in assets that generate income; such assets would tend to generate real income, i.e. something that changes in price over time, adjusting to the conditions of each specific cycle. Although it is clear that salaries are also moving along with changes in prices (please notice that changes in prices of goods and services do not translate automatically into inflation , since the textbook definition of inflation is a generalised, sustained and noticeable increase in prices), they have less power to command immediate adjustments. Therefore, in some occasions, the mere act of delaying a pay hike rather than operating a pay cut would do the trick whilst keeping people acceptably quiet if mumbling. At the end of that period their real purchasing power will be lower than at the start, whilst the entrepreneur would have adjusted its prices well in advance to stay in tune with the cycle. The foregoing works in credit as well: pecuniary obligations are normally fixed at nominal value (plus interest if applicable) rather than at replacement value; hence, any repayment at a later date would be worth less in purchasing power than the amount originally borrowed. The interest rate, that should compensate such loss and remunerate the risk of non repayment, happens to be denominated in the same infinitesimally depreciating currency (this is why economists bother to work with deflators in order to make what happens in an economy in year x comparable to what happens in year z), . In times of inflation, the borrowers experience some marginal relief on their debt due to this mechanism. If the borrower has acquired a tangible (and durable) asset with the proceeds of the loan he has taken, good chances are that on balance at the end of the period he will be richer in real terms than at the start: the asset\u2019s price would have buoyed along with the general loss of purchasing power, but he will have paid for it with a fixed amount of partly depreciated money. We can say then that inflation, if low and controlled acts like grease on a bicycle chain and as a shock absorber when a pothole or bump makes itself felt. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many factors affecting an economy that no blanket statement could ever possibly cover every contingency. In the US in the 19th century, inflation over the entire century was less than 2%. Not 2% per year, 2% for the entire century. The gold standard had a lot to do with that, but so too did the fact that the economy of the US during that period was largely agrarian. Wages never went up unless the worker obtained more education or developed new, needed skills. Most labor was manual labor. Nobody expected wages to rise; life was just what it was. The gold standard limited growth the amount of gold the country/government could accumulate, and so economic growth was severely limited, and slow. Gold was hoarded and due to the lack of specie and currency, states, cities and even some local communities took to printing their own \u201cbank notes,\u201d and issuing script or chits for change, exchangeable for goods within the local community, and even the lowly \u201cwooden nickel\u201d was considered legal tender. Those bank notes were worth less the further you got from the issuing community. Was all of this a consequence of, or the cause of the low-inflationary economy? Tough to say. In theory, a lack of inflation would prevent either prices or wages from rising except in those cases where a worker obtained an education and/or developed skills in demand where supply was low. The concept of \u201cI deserve a wage increase because I\u2019ve been on the job for years\u201d would be facile bordering on ridiculous. I\u2019ll also add that the common definition of inflation as \u201ctoo much money chasing too few goods\u201d is becoming a bit threadbare. In these days, ramping up production to meet demand for finished goods takes almost no time at all, so what you\u2019re left with as a cause of inflation is \u201cwages rising out of proportion to organic demand for workers.\u201d This was the case in the 50s when over 30% of the workforce was in a union; today, with less than 5% union-represented, strikes are almost unheard of and wages are almost inflation-free.

            "answer_text": "Deflation. Deflation occurs in a recession. Deflation is a sign that things are things are going bad, prices go down so companies margins are squeezed. There is pressure to reduce pay of workers and cut expenses along with deferral of spending because prices are dropping, and people just don\u2019t have the money to spend. If prices are going down then the value of assets like homes is also going down. As assets like homes are often used as security for loans banks will end up with less security - thus they can lend less money on that asset. This also means that banks will ask current lenders to pay back some debt, or offer more security. This can make the recession worse. In the Irish recession the banks lent heavily on property. As asset values decreased it was found that a lot of this stuff was not worth as much as was thought (unprofitable new hotels were often being kept open because closure would require repayment of tax breaks for their construction). As property values decreased banks had less security - which meant they required more capitol. And this had to come from the state. Unlike Iceland, Ireland could not burn the bond holders, or devalue the Euro. A small bit of inflation is good because it gets people spending. This means suppliers earn more money, spend it and invest it thus helping the economy growing. Of course too much inflation is bad too because it begins to destroy value. To fight deflation a country will drop interest rates to stimulate borrowing, and increase government spending. The objective is to get more money into an economy - preferably with spending (A tax cut might be saved for example). A country with deflation will most likely have the IMF paying an unhealthy interest in them. In the case of Ireland the IMF did bail them out with harsh austerity (party because they could not burn bondholders and devalue the Euro). Interestingly the economy had strong exports during this time. There is a whole article on this subject with historical examples on Wikipedia. Deflation - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The question isn't hypothetical. There have been, in the last 100 years, several instances of Western economies spending time in deflation.  Japan in the 1990sUSA from 1930-1933UK in 1920, 1921 and 1930s What happened was that people started hoarding cash. After all, why buy 'some thing' today, when you'll be able to buy the same thing tomorrow for less. As a result of that, companies tend to sell less, so invest less. The 'ratchet effect' tends to mean that employees won't accept pay cuts, even if the cost of living is going down, so the solution tends to be that companies will layoff, say, 5% of their staff, rather than giving everyone a pay cut of 5%. You, therefore, get rising unemployment, and either reduced growth or economic shrinkage overall. Governments like inflation for the simple reason that it makes it easier to repay debts... and governments are (pretty much without exception) debtors. So, economic policy tends to dislike deflation for that reason :-) ",

In the Roman Republic/Empire prices for goods didn't change for decades. Bad economic times weren't caused by inflation/deflation, they were caused by a shrinking national treasury. And pretty much all this did was raise unemployment, yet prices continued to stay the same. Since the Roman government made absolutely no interaction in the economy, besides minting, the commodities weren't inflated or deflated, they stayed the same. But in a world like today where fiat dominates the Western world, inflation is necessary to keep a balance on the economy. ",

What if you fix all the prices without increasing the output or without lowering the demand? Then how will you prioritize all the customers demanding goods & services with their \u201cmoney\u201d that can perfectly buy those goods & services at that price (because remember you couldn't increase your supply).  In that case, the distribution may be arbitrary but if we go by simple average, then everybody will just get fewer of the goods & services (because you gotta provide them to your customers). What is this now? Their \u201cmoney\u201d could only buy so much at the same price per unit. This simply means that money lost its purchasing power right. This is just inflation. So its unavoidable. Any imbalance between demand and supply can result in inflation/deflation. ",
