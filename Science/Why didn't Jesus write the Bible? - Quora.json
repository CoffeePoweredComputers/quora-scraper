            "answer_text": "I cannot comprehend how you came to the point of having to ask this question. Do you even know what the Bible is? There are several things wrong with your question that tell me you don't. Let's go through some of the bad assumptions your question makes: First, you assume the Bible is a novel or a single piece of work. That is wrong, Bible, taken from Latin, literally means library. The Bible is not one book, but several compiled books. As thus, it was never expected to be treated as one single work that could be written by one person. Two, you assumed one person wrote the Bible. The books of the Bible are written from multiple perspectives; it simply doesn't make sense if Christ himself was the author. Take the book of Judges for instance. This covers a period of centuries of the nation of Israel\u2019s history. Did you really think that this book of the Bible all was written by the same person? Each book are testimonies of its writers, each one a different witness of different events and not all the work of one person. Or how do you explain the existence of the writings of Jeremiah and Isaiah if they were not the ones to write them? How about the testimony of Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John? You contradict their testimony if you say that Christ wrote the whole Bible. Three, you assume that Jesus Christ was going to write the Bible, but didn't. Christ, or Jehovah, never promised a record of His own making to distribute to His disciples, making the question of why He didn't absurd. There is only one whole book that is totally given by God, and that is Leviticus. The Law of the Levites was given in its entirety by God while He came down in a pillar of fire to consecrate the Ark of the Covenant. Elsewhere, only where it specifies that God is speaking does it indicate that God is giving out this passage of scripture. The words of the prophets, when prefaced with \u201cThus sayeth the Lord,\u201d also indicate that the Lord is speaking, but through another\u2019s mouth. I don't know anything about you or who you claim to be or believe. If you are a Christian believer, you are showing a startlingly strong show of ignorance about your own religion. If you are not a Christian believer, well it is no wonder about that because you clearly have little understanding of Christianity anyhow. If you want someone like me to take you more seriously, you had better ask far more informed questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Why didn\u2019t Jesus write down the words of the Bible Himself? There are several good answers here by other Quorans, but also consider that the testimony of third parties often serve as more compelling evidence than a person\u2019s own claims, particularly when they are eye witness accounts. Think about this example. If I claim to be good at singing no one should believe me necessarily. Who knows if my claim is really true or exaggerated? But if 3 or 5 or 8 people hear me and write about my singing in the newspaper, suddenly I have a reputation that is more reliably true than my own say-so. And more people find out about it. Jesus had the testimony of two or three witnesses (actually more) plus at least one competent historian (Luke), whose writings would stand as compelling evidence in a court of law that Jesus actually said and did what He said and did. Witness accounts were a reliable test of evidence back in the day, and it remains so even today. What stronger evidence could we conceive of that reaches across time and space than the written testimonies of contemporaries? Add to this the fact that the Gospel and Epistle writers were sometimes living under imprisonment or other hardships when they wrote. This demonstrates the urgency with which these writers told their stories, another indication of their value and veracity. Few people would use up their most valuable time, anticipating death, for lies. But Jesus was worth using one\u2019s dying breath to tell others about Him, and that's exactly what the writers of scripture did. ",
