            "answer_text": "Pre-meds are not a mystery. They are totally see-through. What is the most prestigious job you can think of that helps people? (Help as much as possible\u2014you can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to help everyone\u2014which is often). The unemployment rate of licensed physicians and surgeons is near zero and you can practice anywhere in the world. No one cares where you are unless it\u2019s a city or rural. It\u2019s the closest thing to nobility in America. (zero unemployment rate=permanent income). I\u2019d rather be a knight (that comes with way more awesome things) than an MD and Ph.D. ever got me but that\u2019s unconstitutional. So, if that\u2019s their dream\u2026their greatest attainable goal while at college\u2026it should be left as an option at all times\u2026.. \u2026it would be stupid to rule that possibility out (unless you hate the idea, to begin with) and until 1) your grades reach a level that makes it impossible to meet the requirements for entry or 2) you decide after you saw what the day-to-day was actually like (not your fantasies, not the feelings you\u2019re imagining, all tied to images of unrealistic TV drama as your only real experience). If you a patient, you saw the other side. I did before I began to consider it. You know that millions in debt is what MD stands for. You don\u2019t care, that\u2019s a detail. In other words, there is nothing more important in your life and you will die inside and lose your persona and will to act. Sound dramatic? That\u2019s why pre-med is often a very derogatory term when faculty discuss students whose poor performance ends up costing them office time\u2014not because of intellectual curiosity\u2026because they are pre-meds. Understand: everyone in college starts pre-med unless they are fully decided (max income). The choice narrow from there. If you don\u2019t think so, why are you paying tuition? So when\u2026people aren\u2019t sure about the major they doing better at the time\u2026s than the default fall-back of med-school (it\u2019s always on the top of best options\u2026) Notice that if your fall-back is med-school\u2026you already can\u2019t get in. Your grades in all other subjects can\u2019t beat your science scores. What does an undecided science major say when asked 90% of the time? Pre-med. What do math-challenged people say 90% of the time? Pre-Law or Business. If they say engineer, you know they\u2019re serious. If they pre-med, they mean they want the highest ROI for their tuition but have no idea what they want to do really (internally) vs the image they hold made by society. So\u2026They say they're pre-med. 1) It ends the conversation (unless you are one too\u20141) you have some things to discuss but\u2026 2) You\u2019ll just start making comparisons and judgments to each other (comparison is the death of happiness, friendship, peace) \u2014competitiveness is the manifestation of the desire to be a doctor, not good grades. 3) you\u2019re talking shop now and not about something you accomplished in real life, but talking about something that is only a distant hope unless you bust your ass and invest everything you have into it. Well, organic is the majority of that, so they hate it. They say it\u2019s all memorization. They say it\u2019s all useless. From good to bad, what they say of the subject is inextricable from the grade they received. Not all Professors are equal. A PhD is not a teaching credential. It just means you\u2019ve hit terminal knowledge in the subject. While your job is to disseminate new information about the subject\u2026that\u2019s to your peers, not your students. Some professors, who are rare, can do both effectively. But often that\u2019s not you have and if the teacher sucks at teaching you fail from not learning. The book doesn\u2019t help as much in this subject as in others. They will waste an hour of your office hour and your peer's time too, to claw, dig, beg for 1 or 2 points that literally cannot change anything except your opinion of them. \u2026.being pre-med means you have some kind of goal in higher education but it means you hope it\u2019s medicine (because the income) but you don\u2019t know if you can get in. To a pre-med, the mission in life is to be a doctor and everything in the way is an obstacle and beyond \u2014it is your most hated nemesis\u2014 because you\u2019ve made the value of your entire life rest on this vocation. So why do they hate it? It\u2019s the most difficult course you have to take. Not just to be a doctor but to be the highest-paid whatever\u2014chemist, engineer, astronaut, surgeon general. Why do they say it? It\u2019s a fact that can be proven by anyone. Pick up any textbook on the subject, any level, even a Cliff Notes guide of sorts) and give it the time it deserves. Odds are if you actually do that (300 hours of time minimum) and this is focused concentration or discussion, not reading with the TV in the background\u2026.I\u2019d guess based on national averages, you still only have a 50/50 chance of ever understanding it). You can be a straight-A student in everything else, but it may not make any difference at all in this class. You will see parts you recognize but never understand it all. So unless you read it all you still only have a chance (no guarantee of anything) at putting the info together. Everyone, myself included, teaching it says essentially the same things at the beginning: You\u2019re irresponsible if you don\u2019t. What You Are Told & What Reality Is Lie 1) it\u2019s not a difficult subject (100% lie.) Does a statement like that which comes from the person who knows it well enough you have you pay him to teach it to you is going to tell you it\u2019s hard? Never. The opinion of people about difficulty who already know it? It means nothing to you. What good is that opinion anyway? Truth: organic chemistry was a struggle for them and it\u2019s a struggle for everyone (ok it\u2019s not climbing Everest which only a few out of billions can do but it\u2019s still a fucking mountain). I hear all kinds of stories always with a lean toward improving the apparent intellect of the person opining\u2026you can\u2019t believe those either. Too many variables : some books are incoherent, some can be read without pain. Some professors literally do nothing. Not a thing but show up; some professors make time in their research agenda to spread their knowledge at the most important time, early. Some take it in the summer and that\u2019s fine, if they have support of some kind. It is made up of simple steps. That\u2019s all that can be said\u2026several simple steps at a time actually and if one is out of order, what\u2019s simple about more steps? A lot of simple steps\u2026wait, that\u2019s the definition of hard or complicated, isn\u2019t it? 2) it\u2019s much less a body of knowledge, rather than an ability, that you develop over time. Watch videos, lectures, read stuff \u201cfor dummies\u201d (there\u2019s no difference but the writing sty;e is colloquial instead of academic). Ingenious marketing\u2026. 3) find a tutor immediately A tutor who has at least a masters degree in organic chemistry, not regular or any other kind, can change your life. Anyone else will take your money and help you marginally if at all. There are ideas that are not terribly difficult to grasp. It\u2019s knowing what to do next that is the problem. Anyone who says it\u2019s not hard is a liar. The steps are elementary the process takes frequent repetition. But they're presented all at once. The student is never told which matters more, which ones less. No one will tell you. Everything is relative but people don\u2019t tell you where the significant boundaries are. It grows in uncertainty if you are new. If the reward and the effort were equal people would do it. If the reward were something, any progress, they do it. When it\u2019s incomprehensible and they can\u2019t verbalize a question because they can\u2019t formulate it logically in their brain, don\u2019t say it\u2019s simple. Even with the best organic chemists teaching the courses, people (half of all of them in college across this continent have an average of 30\u201360%). Your doctor failed it. Only the curve saved him. Why do they think it\u2019s hard? It\u2019s the first taste of self-understanding. I never studied in high school or college, I just went. That\u2019s nothing to be proud of. This was work and not just crunching numbers. For the first time, highly intelligent people are totally lost. However, everything who takes this subject has the same experience (pre-med or not, it makes zero difference. (Premeds are no smarter, better inclined to be a good doctor or anything else that suits them better than any other student on campus). They can\u2019t be\u2014why go to college at all if you know everything you want to learn? In this subject, if you don\u2019t know one thing, you may spend 8 hours studying and accomplish nothing. Most pre-meds study all the time. Imagine doing what you do and you can\u2019t answer the first question on the first page, a day later, you are where you were a week ago. It is based on terms you\u2019ve heard of like the first chapter (acidity). If I asked you a question about acidity in general chemistry you\u2019d calculate something and be done. In organic chemistry, a question about acids will have you calculate nothing, You have nothing but your thoughts (about 5 different considerations to juggle at once). If I ask which is stronger, nothing you\u2019ve learned to this point will allow you to do it by yourself. But then, you can\u2019t move forward\u2026and the rate of the concepts is increasing as the applications explode in number. Why do premeds think organic chemistry is the hardest class? Everyone thinks its the hardest subject in college, even chemists. Some think they just need to get past it. If you don\u2019t understand organic chemistry, you will suffer needlessly and fatally in biochemistry. You can take biochemistry without taking organic chemistry. Many do! They got past the prerequisite but retained zero. All of biochemistry builds on all of organic chemistry. You can\u2019t really understand the former if you think the latter is a formality to get you in. That is not the intellectual focus of successful people. It\u2019s growth and improvement. Grades are just a barometer. The easier your organic course, the harder your medical education will be (mainly biochemistry\u2014everything else is memorized\u2014pathology is aberrent biochemistry..). You get the picture.. Take the class for fun (no one ever takes it as an elective nobody would\u2026it\u2019s not). If you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re made of to reach answers that help people, I would hardly call you scientifically inclined and certainly no scientist. It will be the hardest thing you will ever do in your life intellectually up to now, afterward, should you attain a passing grade, and how to associate abstract things together to solve problems (it doesn\u2019t matter if were talking bubble gum or biochemicals) you can think like a doctor. If you can\u2019t you should\u2019nt be one. This subject tests that. Nothing else can\u2026not even GPA (because grade inflation..) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if all pre meds think Orgo is the hardest, but there are good reasons to think it will be hard. My Orgo textbook was 1200 pages long. For the 2nd semester final exam, one student asked on the last day of class what would be covered on the exam which was scheduled for three days hence. The professor simply held up the book and said \u201cthis.\u201d He then added some advice. He told us that there was nothing we could do in three days that would help very much. We had had about 100 hours of lecture, 40 labs and lab reports, seven intermediate exams and 10 quizzes. We students had put in about 500+/- hours of study, a few had logged over 700 hours. Orgo for pre meds is frequently graded on a curve (more on this below!). 20\u201330% of the class, in spite of significant effort, will get a grade below B. For pre meds, a single grade below B puts their chances in jeopardy. Rigorous pre med programs often will not allow a student who is performing below some standard to continue as pre med. The curve is demanding but not arbitrary or malicious. Some students simply struggle with the concepts. Others lack the academic discipline to put in enough time to master the subject. Rigorous programs want those who complete the curriculum to succeed. Less rigorous programs allow marginal or even delusional students to continue. ~ 100,000 pre meds take the MCAT every year (~80,000 first-timers, ~20,000 re-takers). At rigorous programs, those who\u2019ve survived the curve (Orgo, plus all the other required courses), are successful 90+% of the time. Many other programs let students fend for themselves. Barely half of the MCAT-takers even apply to Med school. Only ~21,000 of the MCAT-takers will gain admission (44% of applicants in a recent year). Do the math. At the most rigorous programs, 90+% of MCAT-takers go to med school (MD, DMD, DVet, DPodiatry, DO). Overall, only 21% are as fortunate. Berkeley\u2019s applicants (a sub set of Berkeley\u2019s Senior pre meds) are successful only 55% of the time. Even at Stanford, only 70\u201375% are successful. The top ~100 or so pre Med programs send a very disproportionate number of graduates to med school. The Ivy League alone fills about 1700\u20131800 of the ~21,000 openings. It should be clear that the success rate (that is, among those who actually take the MCAT) for less rigorous programs is much less than 21%. An \u201ceasy\u201d Orgo course is a waste of time. It allows students destined for failure to endure an extremely demanding curriculum for little benefit. ",
