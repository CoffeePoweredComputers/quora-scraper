            "answer_text": "Invisible cars. Mercedes-Benz ran a program demonstrating a new camera-in-projector technology, which I happened to see through Yahoo News:  There\u2019s the acoustic levitation (levitation-using-sound-waves) project (below). Researchers use sound waves to make lightweight objects levitate.  Successful simple over-unity (below). The effect is of a Siimple Magnetic Over-Unity Toy (SMOT) but without magnets (pretty ingenious). If the marble can activate the next lever this would constitute free, repeatable motion, since no additional altitude change is necessary. I believe this is POSSIBLE, because the marble can have a midpoint that is taller than the start altitude of the lever, and the device has been proven to have momentum in the video below. See also the version with a tall marble that would be necessary for perpetual motion: File:1st Fully Proven Perpetual Motion Machine.jpg  And still other devices might exist, for example, the Over-Unity Lever 2 (below). A lever can lift its own fulcrum at minimal expense in certain very precise configurations. I found this experiment very exciting, but it has NOT been publicly recognized:  I can\u2019t think of anything else right now since most of my other experiments are not so noteworthy, but these inventions surely ARE significant! (the first two inventions are not mine). ",
