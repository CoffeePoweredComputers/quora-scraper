            "answer_text": "Some animals have many different common names, even in the same language. Famously, in American English, the cougar, mountain lion, and puma are all the same animal, and sometimes so is the panther \u2014 although a quite different felid is also known as the panther (and also as the leopard). And of course different languages very often have different common names for the same animal. But some animals do not have a common name. There are over a million species on this planet with scientific descriptions and names; most of them unknown to the vast majority of people; who would have a name for yet another species of tree-dwelling beetle in some remote corner of the Amazon? And of course there are many extinct species which have never been given a common name (indeed, it\u2019s rare for an extinct species to have one). To get around the first problem \u2014 the confusing array of synonyms and shared names \u2014 scientific names (officially, they\u2019re supposed to be treated as Latin words) are used. The cougar/puma may have half a dozen names just in American English, never mind other languages, but in scientific literature it \u2014 and nothing else \u2014 is always and only Puma concolor. Every species has, for scientific purposes, a unique name shared with no other species; it identifies exactly which species one is talking about and pigeonholes it in the nested hierarchy of life: domain: Eukarya, kingdom: Animalia, phylum, Chordata, class: Mammalia, order: Carnivora, family: Felidae, genus: Puma, species P. concolor.

It allows for the accurate pinpointing of each species. The common names are for the rest of us who simply prefer to call a dog a dog - the word for which varies in just about every language. ",
