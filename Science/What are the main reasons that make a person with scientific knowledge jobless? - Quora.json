            "answer_text": "Q: What are the main reasons that make a person with scientific knowledge jobless? 1) Ego. A refusal to work at jobs that bore them, or are below them. An insistence that any job they take gives them a chance to use their scientific knowledge. I have Master\u2019s degrees in both Mathematics and Computer Science, the second is redundant because I also have a PhD in computer science. However, when I failed in one business after a year without income, and because of promises I made to my wife, I looked for a job and took the first contract gig with decent pay. Did it require any math? Nothing beyond high school. Did it require a PhD in CS? Hell no. Was it interesting work? Alas, not so much. It was just basic OS level coding for a somewhat complex device used by military intelligence. So I did that for a year, made 4 times what I would have made in a salaried job, and restored our finances. 2) Useless knowledge. Some fields are hot, some are not. Sometimes nobody is willing to pay for what you know about how the Sun works or fishery depletion off the East Coast or the kinds of diseases prevalent in regional Chinese wildlife. 3) Lack of Credentials. You may know a lot about quantum physics, you may be able to do the math. If you don\u2019t have degrees and/or peer-reviewed published papers, nobody is going to give you a job because you know quantum physics. Claiming you know something won\u2019t help, people lie on their resumes all the time. Employers want proof, and the approved shortcut to proof is a verifiable degree from an accredited university, and/or verifiable published papers in your name in academic journals with good reputations for thorough peer review. 4) Lack of Skill. Nobody hires us for what we know; they hire us for what we can do, what kind of value we can add. Even a college professor (I\u2019ve been one) is expected to be able to teach something to kids, understand what is keeping them from learning. It is not a job about knowing, but communicating in a way that duplicates some part of your knowledge in somebody else. There are no jobs like Alexis, where people just ask you to recite facts. Google eliminated all those jobs. You need to be able to DO something with your knowledge. Synthesize a molecule, diagnose a disease, fix software, design a machine. Use your knowledge to add value to something else. That is the nature of work, people pay us $X because they believe that what we can do for $X is worth much more to them than $X. That is going to take a convincing story that you can use your scientific knowledge to accomplish something, besides answering questions people could ask on Google. ",
