            "answer_text": "This is a very difficult question. Short answer: It depends. First you should note that, most importantly, \u201cquantum mechanics\u201d is not simply a clear theory on which there is wide consensus. Although the mathematics and the predictions for lab experiments are clear and agreed upon by all physicists, the meaning of quantum mechanics is heavily debated. There are a large number of \u201cinterpretations\u201d, or better to say formulations of quantum mechanics, which would answer your question differently. I would say that even two proponents of the same interpretation might disagree, because not all formulations are very clear. You will find, for example, that the writings of Bohr are more or less obscure. He was the father of the so-called \u201cCopenhagen interpretation\u201d in which the microsopic world is not assigned the status of being \u201creal\u201d. Only the results of measurements and things in our macroscopic, \u201cclassical\u201d, world, can be described unambiguously, according to Bohr. The formulation of quantum mechanics which is the most clear in this respect is Bohmian mechanics, because there, physical reality consists of moving particles. This is then just like in classical physics, only the movement of the particles is quite different. ",

            "answer_text": "Dark matter fills 'empty' space, strongly interacts with matter and is displaced by the particles of matter which exist in it and move through it. Wave-particle duality is a moving particle and it's associated wave in the strongly interacting dark matter which fills 'empty' space. In a double slit experiment the particle always travels through a single slit. It is the associated wave in the dark matter which passes through both. ",
