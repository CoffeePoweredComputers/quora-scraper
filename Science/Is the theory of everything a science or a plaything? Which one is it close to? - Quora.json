            "answer_text": "The term Theory of Everything has a specific technical meaning in physics. In its original, specific, and technical sense within the discipline of physics, it is entirely scientific. But it\u2019s a catchy term, and nobody gets to own catchy terms. So it\u2019s been picked up and widely used. In this more general usage, the term really has no meaning at all. Edit: for a more detailed answer to a similar question, see Jeff Berkowitz's answer to How would the theory of everything differ from typical theories? Could it be used in place of any theory? Or is it more of a pursuit than a definite finite goal? ",

We have a wish list of what it should do (specifically, join up quantum mechanics and general relativity so that they play nice together), but we don\u2019t have the theory itself. Yet. ",
