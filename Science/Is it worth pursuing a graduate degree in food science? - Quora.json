            "answer_text": "Yes overall. -If you do not have experience and you\u2019re entering the field \u201cfresh\u201d, it will get you into a better role more expeditiously. As well as possibly getting a better salary. -If you\u2019ve got many years of experience in the field already, its not crucial, but its always a help. It would help to negotiate for a bump in salary or role. Really, it comes down to Food Science being a science field and the more degrees and certifications, the better..particularly on paper, you\u2019re going to be noticed more by recruiters and people will think you are more qualified. Although, I have worked with people who only have bachelors who are much more qualified and experienced in the industry than some who have Masters and lack real world experience. ",
