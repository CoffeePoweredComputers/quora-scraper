OK, it based on a reformulation of Gravity which may be contentious, and beyond that it really just conjecture, but it appears to be logically consistent conjecture that attempts to address a wide range of observed facts, which is in my opinion a lot better than of the logically inconsistent conjecture that we appear to have right now.Completing the Write Up is going to take another couple of months I guess. I believe that everything can essentially be explained in terms of single field function, and whilst I am not an expert on fields, I do have a model that fits ",
