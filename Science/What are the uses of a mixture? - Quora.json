            "answer_text": "Mixtures\u2026especially solutions\u2026are hugely important for chemistry and biochemistry. A mixture allows multiple pure substances to be combined and retain their chemical properties while increasing availability to chemical and biological processes. A simple example is milk. Milk is a mixture of fats, sugars, water, proteins, vitamins and minerals. These substances do not react with one another but are carried in the mixture into the stomach where they can be effectively used (separated and digested) by the body for nutrition and energy. Mixtures can also be used to separate things. As a simple example, if you had a bucket of sand and salt and were told to separate out the salt and leave the sand, the best way would be to add water and create a solution (mixture) of salt and water. The sand (insoluble in water) would sink to the bottom of the container. Remove the solution of salt and water and evaporate the water to get the salt alone. Mixtures are also used to increase chemical reactivity, transport substances, dilute high concentrations of potentially poisonous substances, etc. So you see\u2026mixtures have many uses. ",
