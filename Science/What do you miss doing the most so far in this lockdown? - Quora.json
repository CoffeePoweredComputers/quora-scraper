            "answer_text": "There are many things I miss during this lockdown, but one of the activities I miss the most during this time is social dancing. Before the lockdown, I used to visit at least one pub every week to dance Salsa or Bachata during the social nights. Dancing used to be my key to happiness. It used to provide me with respite from the world. I used to spend my entire week looking forward to the weekend, when I could finally dance. Now, I spend my free time watching Salsa or Bachata videos on Youtube, or going through my old dance pictures, remembering all those good times. Thinking back, there are so many moments I can recall when I could have danced more, but I spent my time working instead. There are so many social dancing nights that I missed because I was busy in office. And now, when I cannot dance even when I want to, I regret all those decisions. I regret that I took social dancing for granted. I regret missing all those dance nights because of so many reasons, mostly related to work, which now seem completely irrelevant. After all, isn\u2019t life finally about spending time doing things you love? Everything else gets forgotten with time. But the moments you spend dancing or doing any activity you love are the moments you will remember forever in your life. I look forward to the days when life will become normal again, and social dancing will make a comeback. And believe me, when it does, I am not going to repeat my mistake. I am not going to take social dancing for granted anymore.  ",

            "answer_text": " I've never imagined a life like this quarantine, no not even in my dreams too. During this quarantine I understood why dogs really get excited to go for a walk. *facepalm*.  I live in an apartment in Chennai. I don't need an alarm to wake up everyday. Wait, don't think that I'm a morning riser before reading the full story. Two kids live with their parents the next door. Remember the Landlady from the kung-fu hustle? So these kids will scream like that landlady exactly at 7am. Yes that's when they take shower and probably the only thing they hate under the sky. This is my alarm clock. Since it's a national lockdown the schools are also shut and these kids wake up late. And no more cries next door. Imagine the good days you go out for a lunch and dinner to your fav restaurants? Now I understand that I've taken many gifted days for granted. I really miss the sea breeze and the refreshment that it gives me, watching the waves come fold and go back. I miss seeing best friends hugging and shaking hands with each other. I miss seeing retired people going for morning and evening brisk walks. I miss watching kids getting ready and go to school with glory. I miss the busy roads, where I'll be sitting in my car complaining about getting late to reach my destination. I miss witnessing guys playing cricket in my community with so much of charm. I miss saying \u201cI'm busy and I\u2019ll call you later\u201d. I miss socializing and meeting my mates. I miss telling my mom how my day was since I left home. To be more precise I miss the actual life which many had taken for granted and wasted complaining. Just can't wait to be back. Like two sides of the coin, I could see some beautiful things admist the lockdown too. Some becoming a cook, some spending time writing, brown girls oiling their hair (kidding), some moms out there making their daughters perfect wife material, guys learning household works etc. etc. But this too shall pass and we all will overcoming this together with strong grit and will power. We are going to kiss, hug and shake hands embracing each other gracefully. That's going to be a beautiful day! After all this is a one time opportunity to stay at home, lying under the fan and Ac Infront of TV to save the world. Don't screw this people. Stay home stay safe. Lots of love and prayers! Moral : Never take anything for granted in life. Life can go 100 to 0 really quick. Always be grateful for anything you have/possess in life be it small or big. Instead of complaining been locked down at home, you can be grateful for having the privilege to be at home where you have access to Internet, food, books and what not. Use this time for recreating yourself. If you come out of the lockdown without learning anything, I say you lack discipline in life and not time.
