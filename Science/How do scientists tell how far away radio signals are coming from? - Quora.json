            "answer_text": "There are a number of methods for determining stellar distances, but this answer will address measuring the most distant objects. The point to keep in mind is that both radio waves and light waves are simply different segments or \"bands\" of the electromagnetic spectrum. The most common frequencies that radio telescopes are operated at are in the microwave region (1GHz to 100GHz, practically speaking, but defined up to 300GHz), although they can often be \"tuned in\" to a band on a wider segment. Oscillation frequencies higher than microwave move into the infra-red band and at even higher frequencies, the sources of these oscillations will begin to emit visible light, starting with red (450THz) and moving up to violet. Above this (750THz), the frequency is no longer visible to human eyes (crossing into ultra-violet) and detection relies on photographic plates and spectrometers (photometers) for X-rays (30PHz) and Gamma rays (exceeding 10 EHz (10 exp 19, or a wavelength only 30x the diameter of a hydrogen atom)). Astronomical distances to the most distant visible objects are estimated by their red-shift (their very high-speed movement away from us causes their light to appear to be a lower frequency). This effect is called the Doppler shift and is readily demonstrated by the change in sound of an emergency vehicle's siren as it passes us and travels away from us, the pitch of the siren lowering slightly. We also note that apparent frequency increases if the emitter is approaching us (blue shift in stars, rising pitch in a siren). Since the Doppler effect is a natural result of adding or subtracting emitter velocity to its frequency, it can be used for analysis of radio waves, not just light waves and sound waves. There are more accurate methods to use when measuring astronomical distances that are not as vast as billions of light-years - and a simplified explanation of these methods can be read at Methods of Measuring Stellar Distances.

            "answer_text": "Estimating the distance depends on the type of radio signal. For the recent Fast Radio Burst\u2019s they use the Dispersion Measure (the time delay for different frequencies) to estimate the distance outside our galaxy. Pulsars : The Dispersion Measure can also be used to estimate the distance of pulsars within our galaxy. Often an optical object (with an already estimated distance) in that part of the sky (which with long baseline interferometry can be very narrow) is assumed to be the source of the radio emissions. For extra-galactic sources the red shift of specific radio emissions (spectral lines) might be used to estimate the distance eg of quasars (radio galaxies). Any annual parallax (direction changes over 6 months) can confirm a source is relatively near within our galaxy. For brief signals (eg. the Wow! signal, and the early non-repeating FRBs) it can be hard to even say if the source is outside our solar system. ",

            "answer_text": "You are right - I don't know also how to date radio signals, even more strange ones!Scientists can date electromagnetic waves, mostly in the visible spectrum, by comparing the emission or absorption bands of known elements with ones found in stars' or galaxies' spectrum.Elements absorb or emit light mostly in the visible spectrum - this is why our eyes are adapted to this spectrum - to see! Each element has its own signature depending on the configuration of its electron cloud around its nuclei.The electron cloud is small! Elements do not emit radio signals - we assume here that 'radio signals' from an article 'somewhere online' are not light or micro-wave, else would have had stated that way!Yet, there are some clues that a nexialist in spare time may try to connect:9 billion years is pretty fare away, the universe itself is 13.7 billion years old. So most of the visible/known stars/galaxies/(other galactic objects) would be closer. I would also speculate (in lack of other data) that the source of these radio signals won't be punctual. Eventually, some of these objects would be in front of the zone emitting signals and would eclipse those signals.Knowing the distance to those objects (stars/galaxies...) scientist may speculate about the distance/age of those radio-signals!
