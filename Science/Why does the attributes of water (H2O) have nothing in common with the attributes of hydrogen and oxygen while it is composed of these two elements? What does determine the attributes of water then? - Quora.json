            "answer_text": "Why does the attributes of water (H2O) have nothing in common with the attributes of hydrogen and oxygen while it is composed of these two elements? What does determine the attributes of water then? The first thing we were taught in chemistry is the difference between mixtures and compounds. Mixtures may very well have a mixture of the characteristics of the components. Compounds have completely new characteristics all of their own. Air is a mixture containing (among other things) hydrogen and oxygen. Water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen. It is completely wrong to expect water to have any of the characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen. What does form the characteristics of water is the size, shape, and atomic chacteristics of the water molecule. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, water, dihydrogen, and dioxygen, are ALL molecular species\u2026 of course water is a little more involatile than the elemental gases\u2026 In water, oxygen, an electronegative element, is bound to 2 hydrogen atoms of LESS electronegativity , and thus the hydroxyl bond is POLARIZED to give\u2026 [math]^{+\\delta}H-\\stackrel{\\delta-}O-H^{+\\delta}[/math] \u2026and in aqueous solution these dipoles act intermolecularly, and thus gives rise to a potent intermolecular attraction, i.e. intermolecular hydrogen-bonding\u2026 [math]^{+\\delta}H-\\stackrel{\\delta-}O-H^{\\delta+} \\cdots \\stackrel{\\delta-}OH_{2}^{\\delta+} \\cdots ^{-\\delta}O\\stackrel{\\delta+}H_{2}[/math] And thus water, a molecule of TRIFLING molecular mass, has quite an elevated normal boiling point\u2026 ",
