            "answer_text": "The concept of aging that most people in our society have is a highly unnatural one. We expect to lose more and more functioning as we get into middle and old age, develop diseases, and die a shell of what we were in our youth. The fact that this actually happens to so many of us is not a function of a natural process of aging but of living one\u2019s entire life in a highly unnatural way. It doesn\u2019t have to happen. This sort of aging is indeed a disease that can be cured, or better yet, prevented, through one\u2019s lifestyle choices. ",

If we are aware that our bodies including those internal organs - we can see that these are made to last for say a 100 years - this when we follow laws of the nature. Ok when we tend to indulge in excess - the food, drinks etc the mind and body would not be able to cope with these excesses. Hence we become sick. Thanks to the modern medicine. If one has the means, the life can be prolonged - but I feel that it is a sort of prolongation of the pain - but in the ultimate analysis - that one has to go. ",
