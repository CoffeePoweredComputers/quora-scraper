            "answer_text": "From the first law of thermodynamics (for a closed system), we know that dU = dW + dQ For a reversible process, dW = -PdV For a constant volume process dV = 0 and hence, dW=0 (no work is done by the system or on the system) In that case, we define Cv (heat capacity at constant volume) = dQ/dT (at constant volume) Q = U => Cv = dU/dT (at constant volume) This gives dU = CvdT (for a constant volume process) So in general this relation is valid for constant volume process only. But for an ideal gas system, this relation is valid for all process which I am going to explain below, why? From phase rule (F = C - P + 2) for a system of one phase and one component, we get F = 2 This implies that for the state of the system to be fixed we need to specify 2 intensive variables and then all other variables are automatically fixed. Hence, we can fix Cv for a given state by defining two intensive variables. Let those variables be T and P. So, we can write Cv = Cv{T,P} (Cv as a function of T and P) For an ideal gas, there is no interaction between molecules (attraction or repulsion). Internal energy is composed of Kinetic Energy (rotation, translational and vibrational) of molecules which is an affected by the temperature of the system and potential energy (intermolecular forces) which is affected due to the pressure of the system. Since there is no intermolecular interaction between molecules in an ideal gas, internal energy becomes independent of pressure and is dependent on temperature only. Similarly, Cv is a function of T only and not dependent on P for an ideal gas. [ Cv = Cv{T} ] This is why dU = Cv dT is valid for all process for an ideal gas. U is a state function and is dependent on initial and final condition. So, if we know the initial and final temperature of process and Cv as a function of temperature (although for large no of cases it is taken constant) we can get change in internal energy irrespective of path/process taken to reach the final state.

            "answer_text": "Dear first you have to understand the very basic of calculation of internal energy change. There are infinite number of specific heat capacity depending on various process and different change in internal energy for corresponding process hence for real gases you have to use particular sp. Heat capacity accordingly. As isochoric process is very well known process and sp. Heat capacity is defined as Cv. So for real as well ideal gas you can use du=cvdt only for isochoric process. And if your gas is ideal then you can use du=cvdt for any themodynamic process. I hope you understand and answer will help you. ",
