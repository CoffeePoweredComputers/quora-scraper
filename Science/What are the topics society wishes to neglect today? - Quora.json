            "answer_text": "1 -A DECLINE IN COMMUNITY A weaken sense of community and neighbourliness is seen as the first social evil. People feel that neighbours no longer looked out for each other or even know each other. This leaves people feeling isolated, lonely and fearful - particularly the elderly or those on their own. 2 -INDIVIDUALISM AND SELFISHNESS People believe that the decline in our sense of community has gone hand-in-hand with the rise of individualism. Many of the thousands said that people increasingly look after their own interests without considering the needs of society. 3- CONSUMERISM AND GREED \"Everything seems to be based around money and owning things. The more you have, the more successful you are. There's nothing wrong with having enough, but there's pressure on people to go for more and more.\" Greed and society valuing things in terms of money were two of the biggest concerns in the entire study. 4- A DECLINE IN VALUES People lacked a shared set of values which help guide behaviour. This failing was linked to growing individualism, selfishness and consumerism. People were described as \"pursuing their own desires regardless of the potential harm to others\". The decline of old-fashioned' values such as honesty, tolerance, empathy, compassion, respect and reciprocity was identified as having damaging consequences for society. It was felt that the decline in these old-fashioned' values wasn't just at the individual level. The media, business and the government were all criticised for being dishonest and self-serving. 5 -THE DECLINE OF THE FAMILY Family breakdown and bad parenting were said to underlie many other social problems, leaving young people without guidance and support. While poor parenting did come in for criticism, others argued that mothers and fathers were \"doing their best in difficult circumstances\". Young parents should be given help acquiring the skills needed to raise children. A strong, stable family is important for children, but there is a lot of disagreement about the importance of the traditional family structure. 6-THE YOUNG There was disagreement about whether young people were victims or villains. Some blame the young for anti-social behaviour, binge-drinking, violence and gun and knife crime. \"Young people have no manners, no self-control and no respect for anything.\" Others feel that the young are failed by their families and the school system, as well as being misrepresented. \"There is a wealth of potential in young people,\" another participant said, \"they tend to be stigmatised rather than encouraged.\" There is a concern about the perceived \"gulf between the old and the young\", and the negative attitudes this encourages between the generations. Young people themselves said they lacked role models and faced limited opportunities. 7-MISUSE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL The misuse of drugs and alcohol were seen as very damaging to society, chiefly because of the links to violent crime and anti-social behaviour. Substance abuse was defined as a cause of ill-health, poverty and family breakdown. However, drug and alcohol abuse were also seen as stemming from family breakdown, weak communities, child abuse, domestic violence, poverty, stress, unemployment and lack of opportunity. 8-POVERTY AND INEQUALITY People from disadvantaged backgrounds describe poverty as a trap' - constraining people's lives and limiting their aspirations. Poverty was also seen as the \"keystone to other social problems\". One example given was how, in a deprived community, making money from drug dealing can seem an appealing option for young people. It was felt that growing inequality in the UK was socially divisive and morally wrong. 9-IMMIGRATION AND RESPONSES TO IMMIGRATION Some people see immigration itself as a social evil. In their view, immigration lead to more competition for limited resources such as housing and jobs, and Britons lost out. Others highlighted the economic and social advantage that immigration brought to Britain and were critical of intolerant and negative attitudes towards immigrants and others seen as outsiders'. 10- CRIME AND VIOLENCE It was generally felt that Britain is a more dangerous and violent place that it used to be. People expressed anxiety about the perceived prevalence of violence, aggression and crime. Connections were made between drug use, gang culture and crime, with drug use also being seen as connected to prostitution and the sexual exploitation of young girls. Child abuse, and violence towards women were cited as specific crimes seen as absolute wrongs'. ",
