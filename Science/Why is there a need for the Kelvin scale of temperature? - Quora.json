            "answer_text": "If you see all the units of temperature , they are depend on properties of specific fluid. For example, water freezes at 0\u00b0C and boils at 100\u00b0C at atmospheric pressure. So making this point as reference we calculate the temperature of any substance. So in need of unit which does not depend on any properties Lord Kelvin introduced unit Kelvin. These is unit of temperature which can never be negative. But starts from 0 Kelvin (-273\u00b0C) to any. Infact we have to use Kelvin unit while using ideal gas equation. This is because of following reason\u2026 PV=mRT V=mRT/P If the temperature is taken Celsius and if condition exist in which temperature is below 0\u00b0C i.e negative temperature then while finding volume for given parameteres, it will be negative value. But we know that volume can never be negative. Hence we use Kelvin to avoid this, as Kelvin can never be negative value. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no need except for the fact that it is miles better than other units of temerature in terms of ease of calculation. So many derived units have direct relation with tempetature in kelvin like pressure, cell potential, free energy, etc. Another significance of kelvin scale is that it becomes easier to define absolute zero temperature. But it's just an internationally accepted standard unit and is just a convention. You could be asking why is there a need for newton for measuring force, inches or feet for length, joule or calorie for energy and my answer would be same. It provides a way to make our calculations less tedious. ",
