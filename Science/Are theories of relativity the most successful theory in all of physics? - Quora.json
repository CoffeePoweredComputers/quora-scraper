            "answer_text": "The texts below suggest that, if the speed of light is variable (it is!), fundamental physics, entirely predicated on Einstein's constant-speed-of-light falsehood, is long dead (exists as a farce/ideology). The only relevant task in this field of science is RESURRECTION. \"If there's one thing every schoolboy knows about Einstein and his theory of relativity, it is that the speed of light in vacuum is constant. No matter what the circumstances, light in vacuum travels at the same speed... The speed of light is the very keystone of physics, the seemingly sure foundation upon which every modern cosmological theory is built, the yardstick by which everything in the universe is measured. [...] The only aspect of the universe that didn't change was the speed of light. And ever since, the constancy of the speed of light has been woven into the very fabric of physics, into the way physics equations are written, even into the notation used. Nowadays, to \"vary\" the speed of light is not even a swear word: It is simply not present in the vocabulary of physics.\" https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Than-Speed-Light-Speculation/dp/0738205257 \"He opened by explaining how Einstein's theory of relativity is the foundation of every other theory in modern physics and that the assumption that the speed of light is constant is the foundation of that theory. Thus a constant speed of light is embedded in all of modern physics and to propose a varying speed of light (VSL) is worse than swearing! It is like proposing a language without vowels.\" http://www.thegreatdebate.org.uk/VSLRevPrnt.html \"The whole of physics is predicated on the constancy of the speed of light,\" Joao Magueijo, a cosmologist at Imperial College London and pioneer of the theory of variable light speed, told Motherboard. \"So we had to find ways to change the speed of light without wrecking the whole thing too much.\" https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8q87gk/light-speed-slowed See more here: https://twitter.com/pentcho_valev ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, indeed! The special theory of relativity (STR) is the very framework of the most successful quantum field theory (QFT in the form of the \u2018Standard Model\u2019) that can account for virtually all the basic fields and their quanta, except, the gravitation. And, the general theory of relativity (GTR) is the best theory of classical gravitation available. It is good to recall that despite their unmatched success, till today, physicists are aware of their limitations, as already hinted above. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess it should be a toss-up between relativity (both general and special) and quantum mechanics. Between the two, there are only quite few experimental facts that are not satisfactorily explained. We have mainly problems in explaining why galaxies rotate so fast that, if there were no additional matter, they should have flown apart (dark matter) and why the Universe expands as fast as it does (dark energy). But in any case, there is no experimental evidence that contradicts either of the two, so all must be viewed as extraordinary achievements. Finally, it is often said that the two have not been unified. That is only true for general relativity and quantum mechanics, and again, no experimental facts are available for which a unified theory of gravity and quantum mechanics would be required. ",
