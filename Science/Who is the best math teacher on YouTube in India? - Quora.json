            "answer_text": "There are many Indian maths teacher you can find on Youtube, especially of Vedantu and Unacademy also if you are preparing for some competitive exams like JEE, NEET, etc. And others to be listed are many for such exams oriented teaching. But if I talk in a higher perspective and non-exam oriented teaching yet very useful and informative with easy understanding, there is a channel named \u201cDear Sir\u201d. His teaching is fabulous and I like whatever the topic may be. Some of his videos are really worth watching. In some videos he has told about facts that many few of us had been told by others. He does not teach according to the syllabus of any class but he tries to teach students in a more general way so that they may develop some useful concepts which can help them throughout their life in every aspect. He has a large subscriber base of around 5.35 million at the time when I am writing this. I felt that he is worth mentioning to everyone and that\u2019s why I mentioned his name here. Please visit his channel once and if you ever visit , don\u2019t forget to read what he have written in the \u2018About\u2019 section of his channel. You will find a poem worth reading. Link to his channel: Dear Sir ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my recommendation of three math teachers who are best at their own level.. For JEE: Mohit Tyagi sirMathonGo (Anup Sir)For Board level exams: CBSE class videos.These teachers are unique in their own ways. I recently studied from CBSE class videos for board examination and the teacher is really very amazing and his way of explanation is very simplistic. So if you want to learn then you can try these YouTube channels. Also if you are interested then you can try watching YouTube videos of Vedantu and Unacademy. ..DHB.. ",
