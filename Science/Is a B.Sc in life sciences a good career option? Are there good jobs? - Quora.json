            "answer_text": "As a program it is very good. You get to learn a lot of things and a lot of subjects. It covers every area of biological sciences and this broadens your scope in career. But when coming to jobs it doesn't have much to offer. Companies rarely take bsc life sciences students . Although there were few of my seniors that were placed but those placements where from IT Firms and the position was of managerial. It has nothing to do with life sciences. But if you wish to do msc or get into research or teaching profession it is the best. You get to choose the subject of your choice in biological area and that is good. For 3 years you can learn about all of the subject and then choose your own area of specialization. Also if you want to change your stream you can easily do so. You can get into law, do a mba, upsc,ssc, banking anything you want to.. But if you want to get a good job right after your graduation then that's very difficult if you are from life sciences. So decide accordingly. All the best ",

Even PhD student arr getting 36K so I would suggest study lifescience only if you have passion for it. Other wise dont do it. ",
