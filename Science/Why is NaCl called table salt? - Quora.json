            "answer_text": "It has to be called something. Someone MANY years ago decided that the white(ISH) solid, that tasted good, that many animals craved, that evaporated from the sea would be called 'salt\u2019. That is the English interpretation of the sounds used, probably pre writing,(certainly preRoman). Other cultures use different sounds,( but many have a common root), so that 'salt\u2019 has become the default sound for what we now know as NaCl. English is so much a universal language that many English words are accepted as the easiest to use. There is no real answer for why a particular set of sounds represent any particular concept. Sometimes there IS a relationship between the sounds used as a name for something and the thing represented. These are onomatapea, but this is in the ear of the 'beholder\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "According to my opinion, compound which is obtained from an acid-base reaction is know as salt. Since NaCl can be obtained by chemical reaction NaOH+ HCl \u2192 NaCl + H2O , where NaOH is a base & HCl is an acid. NaCl has deep roots in human history. It was, & is, the most commonly used salt. In hotels, each table contains bottle of salt. That's why it might be known as table salt. In reaction NH3 + H2SO4 \u2192 (NH4)2SO4 , NH3 is a Lewis base (electron pair doner) & HCl is an acid & the corresponding compound formed is salt (Ammonium Chloride) ",
