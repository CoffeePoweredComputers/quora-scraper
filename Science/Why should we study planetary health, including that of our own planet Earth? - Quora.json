            "answer_text": "If by planetary health you are referring to the biosphere and the planetary systems which support it, then the reason is that life is interconnected, interdependent and highly dependent upon natural resources for it\u2019s maintenance and survival. Life is tuned to and in equilibrium with current planetary conditions. Any shift away from current conditions will necessarily force an adaptation to some degree on the living biosphere. Rapid change is dangerous to human society as well as to the ecosystems which are impacted. Relative stability is important. We humans have the ability to alter natural processes on a planetary scale. We have thus entered a new geological time period called the anthropocene. We had better choose our course wisely\u2026 We are currently doing a very poor job at that! ",
