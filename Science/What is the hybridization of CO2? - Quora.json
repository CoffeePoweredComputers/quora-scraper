            "answer_text": "[math]CO_2[/math] is a lineal molecule. This is because the carbon has only 4 electrons in its outer level, and this can be seen in its electronic configuration: [math]1s^2 2s^2 2p^2[/math]. Because there\u2019s no lone electron pair in the molecule, the better way to accomodate three things in space is in a line. If you recall, sigma bonds in a [math]sp^3[/math] hybridization form angles of 109\u00ba (more o less), in [math]sp^2[/math] the angle is 120\u00ba and in [math]sp[/math] it is 180\u00ba. With all this said, you can say that [math]CO_2[/math] is a lineal molecule with a [math]sp[/math] hybridization! The rules for what I talked before are known as VSEPR theory (VSEPR theory - Wikipedia). One more thing: Hybridization comes like a patch for the Valence bond theory that explains how bonds are established. The truth, like when you get to know the quantum chemistry that underlines this subject, is that hybrid bonds don\u2019t exist! It\u2019s just like an easy way to understand chemistry, and it really gets to the point in understanding bond formation. If you want to know more, just yell! ",
