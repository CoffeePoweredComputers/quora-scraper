            "answer_text": "There many facts they don't teach you at school, but I'm here to tell you; mostly about American history. So, some of them are weird and some funny. George Washington during dinner time would take some sticks and hit them on the table and play tunes pretending they were drumsticks; That would make Thomas Jefferson really uncomfortable. Another fact, is that during war, before a government was formed, future treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton had to swim his way to America. His family in-law (George Washington etc) thought he drowned so they prepared dinner. There were many tears, but many giggles as well when Hamilton showed up at the door dripping wet. Angelica Schuyler, Philip Schuyler's daughter, once slapped Thomas Jefferson so hard that he avoided her in every event. George Washington didn't actually chop a cherry tree; that was a story to show the people he will be honest so he gets more votes for president. Maria Antoinette once invited Gilbert De Motieur Marquis De Lafayette on a dance in France, because she knew he couldn't dance at all. While they were dancing he accidentally fell, and the Queen laughed at him. James Madison, for some reason made both political parties; Democratic Republican party and Federalist party. Also, one day, Thomas Jefferson, broke his wrist trying to impress a girl. Here's a funny one; Did you know Thomas Jefferson invented mc n\u2019 cheese? Well he did, and he would always bring that as a snack to debates. Everyone thought it was gross, so George Washington forbid snacks. Martha Washington once said that she had two worst days of her life; the day George Washington died, and the day Thomas Jefferson visited her. Thomas Jefferson made ice-cream popular in the U.S.A. George Washington's last words were \u201cTis well.\u201d He died because one days he was wet, and didn't want to make his visitors wait, so he didn't change. Two years after that he died because of pneumonia. Aaron Burr, was the only Founding Father that wasn't sexist. Aaron Burr once tried to light a candle by shooting it with a gun, but the house caught on fire. Furthermore, he did that again and his house caught fire again! Last but not least, George Washington was REALLY hot-tempered, he just tried to improve himself, and kinda managed it! There are many facts the don't teach us at school, and that's not all! Also, I don't go to American school, so I'm not exactly sure if they don't teach this there, but I don't really think they do; if they do, please forgive me. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, what\u2019s not taught is anything contrary to the current \u2018accepted wisdom\u2019. When I was a boy, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, RE Lee (my great-great-great uncle), and Abraham Lincoln were portrayed as highly moral, nearly divine men, and we definitely got the impression that Columbus was looking for America when he found it. We never heard of the panoply of black and/or female heros now elevated to elementary school hagiography. Which of these representations of \u2018America\u2019 is more correct? The OLD version (from my childhood) or the NEW version from my early adulthood or the NEWEST version in schools today? Unfortunately, unless you are a professional historian, carefully examining original sources documents for American history . . . there\u2019s no way to know. But it is scary \u2014 at least to me \u2014 that the reasons for the change in what was portrayed seem to have much more to do with politics and culture, than with an evidence based reassessment of history. I\u2019m pretty skeptical about the politicized reporting of \u2018history\u2019, whether from my childhood or now, so I\u2019ll refer to events, mostly local, about which I have personal knowledge. As a child, my county of residence was run by a commissioner who was in the process of becoming wealthy on a rather modest official salary. To the best of my knowledge, this has never been reported though it was widely known.When I was a boy, it was well known that my hometown (1,500 people, 1 stoplight) police force routinely purchased new tires for the two police cars at one service station, and then \u2018replaced\u2019 them a few weeks later at a station owned by someone connected to the mayor.When my father was a boy, in that same town in the 1930\u2019s, there was a lynching of a black man. I don\u2019t know any other details, but as far as I know, this was never reported.In the area near Chattanooga where we now live, in the 1960\u2019s there was a young and attractive French teacher who, year after year, had a couple of male French students who mowed her grass, washed her windows, and received \u2018special tutoring\u2019. This went on for over a decade, with much gossip, but no reporting. I know this, because as an adult I became friends with several of her former \u2018students\u2019.During the same period and at the same school, there was a band teacher who the more savvy boys knew to avoid. When he grabbed one young teen\u2019s crotch during an educational film, the guy \u2014 who I also know \u2014 locked out his elbow and then broke it. The boy was threatened with expulsion, until his father hired an attorney and threatened the school with a noisy lawsuit for tolerating immoral behavior. The band teacher remained for another year or so, before moving on.In the 1940\u2019s just after WWII, GIs returning to Athens, TN decided that, having participated in the defeat of Hitler, they were not going to put up with the corrupt local sheriff and other local politicians continuing to steal elections. I\u2019d heard about it from relatives who\u2019d served with some of those GIs, but it was apparently suppressed information since none of my peers seemed to have heard of it. Fortunately, you can now read about it in great detail on Wikipedia -Battle of Athens (1946) .During WWII, my father\u2019s regiment was within a day or two of entering Berlin. But due to Roosevelt\u2019s desire to accommodate Stalin, they were withdrawn back across the Elbe River, to allow the Russians to take Berlin several weeks later. During the ride back, German women offered their own teen daughters to men under my father\u2019s command, to use as they wished, if only they would take them away from the Russians. Recently published accounts verify that virtually all women, literally from 8 to 80, who were alive and in the area Russia seized, were violently raped, often multiple times by multiple men.And two more episodes, not part of my own experience. Growing up in the South, as a descendant of slave owners (on my mother\u2019s side; my father\u2019s people were \u2018upwardly mobile\u2019 non-slave-owning red-necks!), I\u2019d often noticed and wondered about obvious omissions in the accounts I was told of the slave-holding years. For example, I knew blacks in Africa weren\u2019t light skinned, but many of the blacks I knew were. Of course, I know why, now, but it was never explained, then.One of the other things I wondered about was, what did the slaves DO, once they were set free? My own family history was replete with stories of post-war privation suffered by formerly prosperous, or even wealthy, ancestors. Obviously, the freed slaves didn\u2019t have lands or money when they were freed, and most didn\u2019t have the generalist skills needed to be share-croppers, or the specialist skills needed to be paid tradesmen. I tried, several times, to find out what happened. But only in the past decade has the answer been revealed: How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black AmericansYet, this is still not publicized, presumably because it is contrary to the preferred narrative of the Civil War as the great liberation of enslaved blacks.Like most Westerners, I grew up thinking of the Crusades as an invasion of the Muslim world. Yet it turns out this has ALWAYS been known to be false by all historians examining the actual history and actual documents, whether \u2018Christian\u2019 or \u2018Muslim\u2019.The fact is, the Crusades were ALWAYS known to be defensive wars and were NEVER profitable for Western rulers. Here\u2019s the Wiki: Crusades - Wikipedia. The article nicely reflects both that the facts unambiguously support the conclusion that the Crusades were a RESPONSE to Muslim invasions, and that \u2014 in spite of the facts \u2014- ideological motivated historians are reluctant to give up their preferred view of the \u2018Christian wars of aggression\u2019.Apparently, the concept of the Crusades as Christian invasion is one of the most successful ideologically motivated educational hoaxes ever perpetrated! What I\u2019ve learned from these things, and more, is to view ALL \u2018historical\u2019 summaries and interpretations with great skepticism, regardless of whose views it supports. There is no group or viewpoint free of the tendency to ignore the facts they dislike, and retell history the way THEY prefer! It makes me very skeptical about ALL claims that people make claiming to know what people intended, or even how they acted, at some time past. I\u2019m sure that there is, somewhere, a lawyer who doesn\u2019t lie or twist the truth. Similarly, I assume that some popular historians don\u2019t distort their accounts to fit currently popular historical theories . . . but I now suspect that such historians are almost as rare as honest lawyers!
