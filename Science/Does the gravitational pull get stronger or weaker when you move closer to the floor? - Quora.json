            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question, really a special case of How does the force of gravity vary with the distance to the center of the Earth? and Since the force of gravity decreases with distance, is the Earth's gravity stronger on the surface? and most especially Tal Reichert's answer to How deep into the Earth does the acceleration due to gravity reach a max? There are two competing effects: as you go a depth [math]d[/math] into the earth (so your radius is [math]r = R-d)[/math], each shell or layer higher than you cancels its contribution to your gravitational acceleration so only the planetary mass below you [math]M(r)[/math] contributes to your acceleration [math]g(r):[/math] [math]g(r) = GM(r)/r^2 .\\tag*{}[/math] On the one hand, [math]M(r)[/math] decreases when [math]r[/math] decreases; on the other hand, the [math]1/r^2[/math] factor goes the other way! If the earth were a constant density object, the decrease in [math]M(r)[/math] going like the volume [math]\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3[/math] would win, and we would have [math]g(r) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi G \\rho \\cdot r \\tag*{}[/math] that is the gravitational acceleration would decrease linearly from 9.8 m/s[math]^2[/math] at the surface [math](r = R)[/math] to zero at [math](r = 0)[/math]. However the earth is differentiated, with a dense nickel-iron core and a lighter rocky mantle and lighter yet crust. The average density [math]\\rho_\\text{av}[/math] is larger than the surface density [math]\\rho_\\text{s}[/math]. It\u2019s actually quite lumpy and complicated because the surface is part continental crust, part denser oceanic crust, with a few km of even less dense water over that, and earth\u2019s surface or sea level is an equipotential which is not the same as an equi-accelerational surface, and there is a centrifugal piece proportional to [math]r[/math] and cosine of latitude, etc. etc. More detail is available at Structure of the Earth - Wikipedia and Gravity of Earth - Wikipedia, note especially the gravitational acceleration graph:  The region we are concerned with here is just below the surface, [math]r = R-d[/math] with [math]d<<R[/math]; notice that [math]g(r)[/math] of course increases from outside the planet to the surface, and then continues increasing for a while with depth below the surface. What is going on is that [math]M(r) \\approx M(R) - 4\\pi r^2 \\rho_\\text{s} d = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 \\rho_\\text{av} - 4\\pi r^2 \\rho_\\text{s} d[/math], so with a little Taylor expansion [math]g(r=R-d)\\ \\approx \\ g(R)\\bigl[1 + (d/R)\\cdot (2 - 3\\rho_\\text{s}/\\rho_\\text{av})\\bigr] .\\tag*{}[/math] It turns out that earth is differentiated enough that [math]\\rho_\\text{s} \\approx 3 \\text{ g/cm}^3 [/math]is less than 2/3 of [math]\\rho_\\text{av} = 5.5 \\text{ g/cm}^3[/math], so the coefficient is positive and [math]g[/math] increases with depth until about [math]d =[/math] 400 km when the local density rises above 3.7 g/cm[math]^3[/math] (that is 2/3 of the average density).  This works out to [math]g(r)[/math] increasing about 57 parts per billion per meter of [math]d[/math] below the ground floor. For depths less than a few km, other effects we\u2019ve neglected are larger, including whether you\u2019re on a ship or on land, what your latitude is, whether there are any large mountains or ice caps in the vicinity, even if there are iron ore deposits close by!

            "answer_text": "Above ground gravity pull becomes stronger, the nearer you are. When you talk of earth we have good models and according to PREM the graviational pull becomes higher even going below ground, it begins sinking only at the border between outer core and lower mantle of the Earth, see Gravity of Earth - Wikipedia That means moving up from a basement - which from that side is moving closer to the floor level - the pull becomes weaker. In that case you move off of the more dense inner core that has a higher influence then the outer earth mantle above you. So it depends from which side you move closer to the floor. If you think of a free fall down a hole in earth indeeed the acceleration will rise up to the outer core and only that deep will become weaker until it becomes zero, if you could reach the gravitational center where mass will pull equally from all directions, summing up to zero gravity.

            "answer_text": "Gravitational force increases as you get closer to the floor. From a different perspective, if you were in a rocket, as you move further away from Earth the gravitational attraction drops off. The precise value is given by the Newtonian formaula F = ((G)Mm)) / r*2 In the above equation G is a constant M is the larger mass such as Earth mass m is the smaller mass such as yourself r*2 is the square of the distance between the centers of the two masses. So F, the gravitational force, drops off as the distance between the two objects represented by M and m increases. ",
