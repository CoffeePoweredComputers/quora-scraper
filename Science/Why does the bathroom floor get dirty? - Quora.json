            "answer_text": "The same reason why leaves will always fall from trees and rain will always fall down: entropy. Without going too much into the physics of it, entropy is a measure of disorder.  Low entropy is low disorder with greater energy available and high entropy is high disorder with lower amounts of energy.  Nature has a tendency to go from high energy to lower energy, due to the conservation of energy.  The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system not in thermal equilibrium tends to increase.  This may be counter-intuitive to what you already know because for us cleaning up decreases the disorder in our lives and puts us in a state of equilibrium.  Entropy works oppositely.   Applying this to your bathroom floor (or any other floor you have to \"clean up\":  when you clean up your bathroom floor, you are taking matter at a more stable, lower energy state and applying your standards of cleanliness to it.  Entropy doesn't care about this at all and, coupled with gravity, will ensure that whatever particles float in the air will eventually settle on the ground for you to clean up again because that is a lower energy and therefore more stable state.  You may have cleaned up the remnants of matter as it progressed to a state of higher entropy, but your system is not isolated.  Dirt, dust, skin cells, and whatever you just swept up returns matter and some measure of energy to the air.  As time goes by these particles will go from a state of low entropy to high entropy once again, because that's nature's tendency to conserve energy and find a state of stability. ",
