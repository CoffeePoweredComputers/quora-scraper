            "answer_text": "I think that there is. Let\u2019s begin with some definition of the term.  Crucial is first determining what and where to observe. This will reflect investors, industry people and a curious public. A topic for investigation could be where do things begin and end.   \u201cWhy\u201d is motive and intention, because the human race is generally not static motion of societies and tangibles will \u201cchange direction\u201d. From walking to horsepower to self driving vehicles may be an example of this change. This action is directed by the intangibles of speech and conversation bringing agreement to an action. Intention affects a vast array of outcomes, short term and long term. The concern may often be less of what the end result is and more of how we achieve that result. There are witnesses to the human body when convenience is the dominant factor. A pandemic may be an example of that. In a person\u2019s life all systems experience failure at one time or another and the human interface going beyond programming is the safety factor in logical study of understanding the earth and its capabilities. Concentricity is a geo-mathematical reality in strata of technology, eccentricity is the reason for that. Many have said history repeats itself; a focus sets an individual as a cog while a multi faceted observation of experience sets an individual as a wheel. The concern seems to be potential energy in a regular tightening for pressure on a main spring. One elegant example of critique deserves another equally in \u201creciprocal\u201d. It is not good that science and technology stop progress, it is more logical that in following a clock face S and T will follow the curve and make a right turn. An example of this is electric vehicles. Eccentricity is found in the daredevils of society, they exist in all fields. When budgets are limited the public seems to be the laboratory for thought experiments. ",
