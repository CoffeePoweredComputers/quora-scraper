            "answer_text": "No, Kelvin is not a ratio scale. 0 degrees Kelvin is -273.16 degrees centigrade. 0 K = -273.16 C. Zero degrees Kelvin is also called absolute zero as all internal kinetic energy in any material is zero at that temperature. Note that the ideal gas equation of state can be written as: P1*V1/T1 = P2*V2/T2 where: P1 - Pressure exerted on the gas at point 1 V1 - Volume of the gas at point 1 T1 - Temperature of the gas ( in Kelvin) at point 1 P2 - Pressure of gas at point 2 T2 - Temperature of gas ( again in Kelvin) at point 2 V2 - Volume of gas at point 2. This is perhaps the reason why you thought that Kelvin is a ratio scale. ",

            "answer_text": "Temperatures in Kelvin are often used in ratios such as: P2 = ( P1 ) ( V1 / V2 ) ( T2 /T1 ) This above equation requires use of absolute temperature ( temperatures in K ). Use of temperatures in Celsius ( C ) is not permitted here. ",
