            "answer_text": "Density is weight for a given size. Okay children, gather around. Lets hear some tales. I want you to meet my two friends. Mr.Cotton and Mr. Iron. They are childhood buddies. And you know what? They were born on the same day. So, basically they have the same size. Which means, They look somewhat similar. But if you'll weigh them, you will see that mr.cotton is very light and iron is very heavy.  Did i tell you how they look like? They both are cubey. Which means both of them look like a small cube. They have a side of 1cm. But that's not how mathematicians say how big they are. One way to say how big they are or what their size is, by saying what volume they occupy. So, as both of them are cubey of side 1cm. Their volume is 1cm x 1cm x 1cm. So, the total volume they occupy is 1cm[math]^3[/math] I'll refer to 1cubic cm as cc. So, both of them are 1cc big. One day, both of them had the same doubt as that of you.  So,they went to a physicist and asked him to find out their density. Wise physicist said - Your density is nothing but how heavy you are for a your size. Say an object has a weight of 3g for a size of 2cc. Then, by definition, it's density is is 3g for 2 cc or 3g/2cc or 1.5g/cc. But I'm cruel to students so i like to put this sentence in the most despicable way possible which goes like. Density is the ratio of the mass of the object to the volume they occupy. Cotton and Iron laughed and were relieved at the same time that this evil physicist was not their teacher. So, they quickly found out their respective weights.  Cotton - 1.55gms Iron - 7.84 gms And divided those weights with their sizes. So, density came out to be 1.55gm/1 cc and 7.84gm/1 cc for cotton and iron respectively. They got their answers and they happily lived ever after. . . . . . Wait!! Its not over yet. There are no happily ever after in life. Conclusions time - Density tells me how heavy is something, no matter what their size is. Just by looking at the numbers you can get a better picture of \u201cwho's heavy\u201d and by how much?Q - Now tell me who's heavier out of cotton and iron? Hint- Just have a look at their densities. A- Iron is heavier. Or i should say iron is 5 times heavier than cotton. Now, coming back to the story. Years, passed by. Mr. Iron had a very good diet. So he became very heavy with time. And his size increased too. But Mr. Cotton remained same.  2. Density tells me weight for 1unit volume (here - 1cc). What if something is bigger than 1 unit, say 2 units. Then what? I ask you, if 1 unit of something weighs 10kg. How much 2 units of same thing will weigh? Come on, pick up pen and paper. Write it down. It'll be 20 kgs right? So, density can tell me what will be the size of object if it's current weight is given. Or vice versa. Q- Mr.iron is now 5cc big. Thanks to mumma iron's tasty dishes. Can you tell me how heavy is he now? (assuming his weight didn't increase only his size increased) A- Okay, I remember. 1cm3 of iron weighed 7.84gms. So, 5cc of iron would weigh 7.84*5=39.2gm Yayy!! You've done It. Now you know density.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are many appropriate and lucid answers to this question. I will answer this with graphic images. So, which will float here? wooden box or pin  Obviously, by intuition, you will tell the answer as a wooden box. It is we studied in elementary physics. It\u2019s correct. Because of density pin will not float. Do not confuse?. Not needed too because you are not a physicist. All our physics laws are orderly stated with many observations. So we have to believe what they say. They formed this density concept with the formula that Density = Mass/ volume This means, it merely describes the compactness. You can easily understand this with your eyesight too with your little bit intuition. Trust me, it is very easy. Just answer a few questions. which part has more density?  Right part, Agreed? In these trees  Left part, no? I hope you understood this. So, density is nothing but co-related to denser. If more particles are there in lesser space(or volume in physics terms), it means it has a higher density. In the first floating example, the pin has more density than water. And obviously you know that the box is less dense than water which makes the box float. Now, answer this question \u2014 Which has more density, Iron or cotton?. You are correct. And, which has more density, Sun or Earth? Again confused ah?. So there are many objects to which we can not tell density-level(high or low) with our expectations. That is why many experts calculate density of objects or earth/sun. ",
