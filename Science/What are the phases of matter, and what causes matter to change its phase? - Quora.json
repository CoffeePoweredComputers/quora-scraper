            "answer_text": "Depending of the average temperature around a group of molecules, these molecules will suffer all kinds of movements, like vibrations, rotations, translations. At low temperatures, molecules do not move a lot, so, they are attracted to each other by certain kinds of forces, so, they stick together. Molecules stick together in such a way that they organize themselves in very specific patterns, so, these bodies have their own shape. This is the phase of matter that we call \u201csolid\u201d. With higher temperatures, molecules start to vibrate, rotate and translate, so they separate from each other, up to a point where these bodies loose their characteristic shape, even though they still preserve they volume for a given temperature. This is the phase of matter that we call \u201cliquid\u201d. For a certain kind of molecule, for a given pressure, the temperature at which they become loose and turn from solid into liquid is a constant and characteristic: this special temperature is called \u201cmelting point\u201d. If we keep on increasing the temperature, molecules keep on moving faster and faster, away from each other, up to a point where they can\u2019t even maintain the volume for a given pressure. This is the phase of matter that we call \u201cgas\u201d: this special temperature at which molecules turn from liquid to gas is a constant and characteristic of the given type of molecule, and it is called \u201cboiling point\u201d. If we keep on increasing the temperature, electrons will keep on jumping to higher energy levels, and at a certain temperature for a given type of molecule, electrons become free from the attraction of the nucleus, so, atoms ionize: atoms get rid of electrons from the outer layer and atoms become positively charged. This is the phase of matter that we call \u201cplasma\u201d. So, now you know how this goes. Kind regards, GEN ",
