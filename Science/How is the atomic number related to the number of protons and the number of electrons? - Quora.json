            "answer_text": "Atomic number is always equal to number of protons in an atom in its stable state and also equal to number of electrons. For stable atom :- No of protons=No of electrons=Atomic No. But for ions or charged atoms the atomic number is equal to number of protons but not equal to number of electrons. Number of protons minus the charge is equal to number of electrons. For ions : No of protons =Atomic No. No of electrons=No of protons -charge . ",
