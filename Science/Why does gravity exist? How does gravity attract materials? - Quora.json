            "answer_text": "\u201cIt doesn't\u201d is the simple answer to both. But because Gravity has become the \u201cJesus\u201d of Scientism it is now practically impossible to have an educated, emotion free discussion about its existence and its nature. The reason for this can be seen in the fact that the inventors of the concept of gravity - Copernicus and Newton - understood it as being a divine principle, not a physical one. Copernicus saw it as divine aspect of the body itself: \u201cFor my part I believe that gravity is nothing but a certain natural desire, which the divine providence of the Creator of all things has implanted in parts\u2026..\u201d Newton saw it as \u201cdivine immensity\u201d, acting between bodies as the omnipresent agency of the Creator in space, causing them to move in a way that makes them appear to attract each other: \"Gravity must be caused by an agent ..\u2026\u201d In both cases, gravity is associated with distinct, solid bodies. Newton's mathematical treatment in particular needs a minimum of two bodies with a defined geometry in order to derive the mathematical artifact called \u201ccenter\u201d, without which there can be no measurable distance and therefore no force: F\u221dm1m2/r^2 What is never mentioned today though is, that Newton found it utterly absurd to think that the force of gravity is innate, inherent, and essential to matter: \u201cby their vis insita I mean nothing but their inertia.\" which means that the only intrinsic property of mass is its resistance to being set in motion, NOT to attract. According to Newton, that is done by an agent independent of, but acting on masses. The often heard mantra \u201cwhere there is mass there is gravity\u201d is therefore absurd in a Newtonian context, especially when we consider that the same people who constantly recite it, will tell you without hesitation the exact contrary : that the most powerful gravity is where there is no mass at all (black hole)\u2026. the concept of something being massive without containing matter is grotesque in any context. But once you get detached from reality to such a degree, there is nothing holding you back and you are free to fantasize whatever you need, anything but admitting you got it wrong in the first place. Such is the case with dark matter, a notion so devoid of sense and logic that it can only be called faith. It would mean that - together with the equally absurd notion of dark energy - 96% of the universe does not answer to what we call laws of physics, which is equal to saying we don't have physics at all, we don't have physicists with even a shred of a clue: per their own definition! Another widespread misconception is that we can measure gravity, whence the certainty that it exists. But the matter of fact is, nobody has ever measured gravity as such, it is only speculatively inferred from measurements of other quantities. When a body falls, we can measure a rate of displacement of space, or when at rest we can measure a quantity called mass. We can never measure both at the same time, wich we would need to in order to convincingly talk about a gravitational force. When a body falls, there is no measurable mass, and when at rest on the ground then we cannot detect acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change of displacement of space. Standing on your bathroom scale is NOT \u201cdisplacement of space in time\u201d. The contortions made by physicists - notably Einstein - in order to make you believe you are accelerating while reading out your weight, are something to behold - especially in light of the fact that what you are reading out is your mass, not your weight. On top of that, if bodies would be falling due to gravity, they would not accelerate, they would surge: acceleration due to gravity has a certain value only for one specific distance to the center [9.896m/s^2 for exactly and only a radius of 6,378,137m], in the next instance [r] would have a lower value and therefore [g] an exponentially higher one and so on\u2026.. acceleration would exponentially accelerate\u2026\u2026 but that is not what we measure. Then, at the geometrical border - the surface - of the \u201cattracting\u201d mass, the acceleration would change from increasing exponentially [g=GM/r^2] to decreasing linearly [g=(4/3)G\u03c1\u03c0r] until it is zero at the center. Therefore, talking about mass and gravity without referring to a surface is as meaningless as talking about water without referring to its container. This is even more true for gases which do not form surfaces, and thus cannot have a mathematically defined center. Without a mathematically defined center they cannot attract anything, least of all themselves. A gaseous sun is therefore not even mathematically possible, let alone physical reality. Same goes for the so called \u201cgas planets\u201d. What about Cavendish? didn\u2019t he measure gravity? no, of course not: if a 348 pound lead ball would be able to gravitationally affect a mass of 1.6 pound, can you imagine what would happen to a pendulum clock in the mountains, where a couple trillion pounds would stand by to grab that bob? (350 trillion pounds estimated for Mount Everest). Apart from that, according to the \u201cuniversal law of gravity\u201d the moving moon would have had 100 fold influence on the test ball over the experiment, an influence from which there is no shielding - yet Cavendish is always depicted standing behind a wall in order to shield the experiment from his own mass? Typical PR practice: emphasize weak points to make them seem being strong points. Gravity has never been measured or observed, and has - as a concept - never been necessary to create the most massive constructions ever erected (thousands of years ago), and never been necessary to make the most precise predictions of the movements in the skies (also for thousands of years). On the contrary, the moment you apply the concept of gravity to celestial mechanics, things start getting horribly wrong: a stable multi-body gravitational system is an acknowledged impossibility, but so is (unacknowledged) a single elliptical orbit: gravity acts radially to a mass center, centrifugal acceleration radially from the \u201cinstant point of rotation\u201d. These two points never coincide, the instant point of rotation is never the focus of an ellipse, as it would have to be in order to produce a stable orbit. The same principle applies to a rotating earth, where gravitation would act towards the center, but centrifugal acceleration would act outward from the axis or rotation. Therefore these two would not - as is claimed - just simply subtract, they would leave a resultant pointing towards the equator. For a pendulum clock to work properly it would have to be oriented east west everywhere except the pole and the equator, otherwise this resultant would make the swing asymmetrical. This is not the case, pendulum clocks work properly in all orientations, and therefore both gravity and rotation are fiction. But how would gravity actually attract materials according to the proposed models? Newton had no idea and declared not being interested in finding out HOW gravity works - the same way theologians are not interested to find out about God, other than describing his workings. \u201c\u2026..for the cause of gravity is what I do not pretend to know.\u201d and \u201c\u2026..but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.\u201d So, Newton leaves us to our own devices, other than admonishing us not to fall into the error of attributing gravity to matter itself: \u201c\u2026.pray, do not ascribe that notion to me \u2026.. by their vis insita I mean nothing but their inertia.\"Despite Newton\u2019s warning, people insist on using his equation F\u221dm1m2/r^2 together with the notion that gravity emanates form a single body, travels across space, latches on unto another body, thereby transmitting a sense of attraction. This is below kindergarden level of reasoning, it certainly is not physics: in physical terms that would be called a negative momentum: something comes your way, hits you and instead of pushing you away it makes you accelerate against the direction of the hit\u2026\u2026huh? If you decide to go with Newton, you have to go all the way and purge yourself of the notion of a single body \u201chaving\u201d gravity.That was actually what Einstein seemed to be trying to re-establish: that gravity is something \u201coutside\u201d bodies, happening in the space between them. Unfortunately Einstein was no physicist and no experimentalist - which is to say, no scientist - but a philosopher with a dangerous measure of mathematical half-skills and, more consequentially, a half-knowledge of electro-magnetism. The result is a system based on a mechanistic interpretation of light, which contradicts all evidence and all experimental results. The rate of propagation of waves is generally a function of the medium and never a function of emitter or receiver. Singleing out light as something special in that regard is not justified. The same goes for the claim of invariance: no finite value can remain unchanged after addition and subtraction, only infinity does: [c+v=c-v] only holds for [c=\u221e]. Therefore Einstein had to tuck in the following statement somewhere, which of course is never found worth mentioning: \u201cIn our Theory \u2026 the velocity of light plays physically the role of an infinite velocity.\u201d As is the case with everything Einstein, evidence and experiments testify to the contrary: here, Doppler red and blueshift show that relative velocity in fact does matter, and light cannot be treated as invariant.Splicing space and time together only works if you define the propagation of light as a displacement of space in time. Here is where Einstein misses reality by 100%. EM induction is a process in time NOT a projection through space. The concept of spacetime therefor is pure fiction based on an incorrect understanding of reality. And in the end we have come full circle with again claiming that one single mass sitting alone in space acts on its environment\u2026. in this case \u201cbending\u201d fictitious space time. History books in the not all too distant future will have a field day with us simpletons actually believing Einstein\u2019s nonsensical ramblings. In such a history book, Tesla, Heaviside and Steinmetz will instead occupy the places of honor and gravity will be left over material, good for jokes only.PS.: in the \u201cscience\u201d of propaganda, it is well established that strong aspects of a product sell themselves, what you have to spend money on is the weak points: it is no coincidence that Einstein\u2019s theory is associated with \u201cproving\u201d Mercury, and interestingly only Mercury, the weakest spot in the solar system model. In fact, Mercury\u2019s orbit, or rather its visibility is a complete impossibility, which is made go away with a classic PR stint. Such a stint was also employed to boost Einstein\u2019s theory to begin with: Eddington\u2019s phony expedition of 1919, driven by purely personal and political motivations, with zero scientific value. There is not room here to discuss the alternative, but let it be said that the concepts of space and counter space as employed in the physics of electricity hold the key to understanding what seems to us as being physical attraction. Billiard ball physics a la Newton and Einstein will never be able to read the small print of nature. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity. The average person probably doesn\u2019t think about it on a daily basis, but yet gravity affects our every move. Because of gravity, we fall down (not up), objects crash to the floor, and we don\u2019t go flying off into space when we jump in the air. The old adage, \u201ceverything that goes up must come down\u201d makes perfect sense to everyone because from the day we are born, we are seemingly bound to Earth\u2019s surface due to this all-pervasive invisible force. But physicists think about gravity all the time. To them, gravity is one of the mysteries to be solved in order to get a complete understanding of how the Universe works. So, what is gravity and where does it come from? With his theory of relativity, Albert Einstein explained how gravity is more than just a force: it is a curvature in the space-time continuum. That sounds like something straight out of science fiction, but simply put, the mass of an object causes the space around it to essentially bend and curve. This is often portrayed as a heavy ball sitting on a rubber sheet, and other smaller balls fall in towards the heavier object because the rubber sheet is warped from the heavy ball\u2019s weight.  In reality, we can\u2019t see curvature of space directly, but we can detect it in the motions of objects. Any object \u2018caught\u2019 in another celestial body\u2019s gravity is affected because the space it is moving through is curved toward that object. It is similar to the way a coin would spiral down one of those penny slot cyclone machines you see at tourist shops, or the way bicycles spiral around a velodrome.  A 2-dimensional animation of how gravity works. Via NASA\u2019s Space Place.. We can also see the effects of gravity on light in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. If an object in space is massive enough \u2013 such as a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies \u2014 it can cause an otherwise straight beam of light to curve around it, creating a lensing effect.  Images from the Hubble Space Telescope showing a gravitational lensing effect. Credit: NASA/ESA. Our understanding of gravity breaks down at both the very small and the very big: at the level of atoms and molecules, gravity just stops working. And we can\u2019t describe the insides of black holes and the moment of the Big Bang without the math completely falling apart. The problem is that our understanding of both particle physics and the geometry of gravity is incomplete. \u201cHaving gone from basically philosophical understandings of why things fall to mathematical descriptions of how things accelerate down inclines from Galileo, to Kepler\u2019s equations describing planetary motion to Newton\u2019s formulation of the Laws of Physics, to Einstein\u2019s formulations of relativity, we\u2019ve been building and building a more comprehensive view of gravity. But we\u2019re still not complete,\u201d said Dr. Pamela Gay. \u201cWe know that there still needs to be some way to unite quantum mechanics and gravity and actually be able to write down equations that describe the centers of black holes and the earliest moments of the Universe. But we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d And so, the mystery remains \u2026 for now. Hope this helps. Source-: Where Does Gravity Come From? - Universe Today ",
