For instance, the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized astronomy and cosmology research.GeoPositionalSatellites permit us to survey the world on both land and sea and help us identify where we are, where we are going, and how to get there.",

            "answer_text": "Often abbreviated as comsat, a communications satellite is a satellite that has been stationed in space for the purpose of providing telecommunications. Communications satellites are commonly used for mobile phone signals, weather tracking, or broadcasting television programs. Communications satellites are artificial satellites that relay receive signals from an earth station and then retransmits the signal to other earth stations. They commonly move in a geostationary orbit. Satellite communications technology is often used during natural disasters and emergencies when land-based communication services are down. Mobile satellite equipment can be deployed to disaster areas to provide emergency communication services. ",

            "answer_text": "Radio communication is line of sight. The height of your antenna determines how much area it can see. Now a radio tower picks up your local signal and sends it to the satellite. Satellites can then transmit it to another tower anywhere on that side of the earth. Geosynchronous orbit is about 40,000 km and gives you the tallest stationary antenna possible. ",

Communication Satellites use\u2019s wide range of radio and microwave frequencies which reduce the single breakage and make the communication more efficient. Almost all countries have their own Communication Satellites. In counties like Oman, Satellites Communication plays a very import role. ",

            "answer_text": "Many island nations (like Indonesia and many South Pacific nations) use satellite for national communications. Their population is distributed in many small groups separated by large distances (as well as some concentrated centres) making cable technology too expensive. India also uses satellites, as do countries like Australia, Canada, China, with large areas and sparse populations. Of course they are important in international communications. Geostationary satellites are not ideal for telephony because of the latency. Special protocols make them pretty useful for data communications in the Internet. ",
