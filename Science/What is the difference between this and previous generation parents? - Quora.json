            "answer_text": "Parenting today is more difficult than in the past. Or is it? What has changed?  Transient Relationships - divorce is easier today.  Single parent families are more common. That places more of a burden on the remaining head of the house. And stress with no one to share it with! Less Money - for more work! Parents have to hold down several jobs just to make ends meet. That means less family time and more stress. More Expenses - real income continues to decline while expenses climb. College tuition is no longer affordable by many families. And more wonder if a college degree makes sense!  Expectations - for a better future are lower. Especially when new parents realize it will be very difficult to provide the same opportunities their parents were able to give them! Less Reliable Income - downsizing and outsourcing continue to erode long term employment. Income security is only a dream for some but a nightmare for many.  Addiction - opioid abuse and marijuana use attracts a lot of media attention but alcohol continues to be a major problem. Substance abuse is far greater today than even 10 years ago.  Social Media - while providing opportunity to connect, it also has amplified cyberbullying of both children and parents.  Failure to Launch - children are staying at home longer. They have more difficulty finding work and have no place to go other than the nest they came from! And parents find the kids need to stay home even when the children marry and start raising families of their own! Connectivity - is easier with cell phones but we have grown farther apart. Cell phones intrude into the most personal moments.  There is more texting and sexting but less physical contact. This creates more emotional issues for both parents and children. Stress - is higher in modern families for all the reasons stated above. Everyone needs to be conscious of its impact on personal relationships.  Adults arguing or bickering in front of children takes a toll on the tikes as well! Mental Health - is eroded by the additional stress. Parents need to seek counselling if symptoms occur in their chiidren or themselves!  Is it worthwhile to become a parent these days?  It takes only one smile from your baby to say: YES! Parenting is worthwhile! Sure, it is tougher to be a parent now than in the past. It is a challenge that has been with us for thousands of years:  Families will continue far into the future!  ",
