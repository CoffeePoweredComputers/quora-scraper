            "answer_text": "If you're interested in biology, I say major in biology.  However, I found that most of the forensic science degrees that are out there are general degrees. Take a look into the field. I'm assuming if you like biology that you're interested in investigation, serology, or DNA.  If that's the case, my suggestion is to double in a criminal justice and biology (I'll admit I did this, so I'm prejudiced), or major as an undergrad in biology, and if you're still interested in forensic science do a masters.

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you want to pursue a career in forensics? If so, what specialty? Crime scene investigation? Death Investigations? Serology? Toxicology? Forensic Accounting? Forensic Nursing? In addition, you need to keep an eye out for hands-on training! I  have many students who have earned a formal degree (AA, BS) and yet still find it challenging to apply for a position (only because they lack the qualifications to apply) and/or haven't been called for an interview because of the lack of experience. My suggestion is to become laser focused about what specialty you wish to set as a career goal, find/develop your professional network, and get trained. Once you become laser focused, you will able to better decide what focus you wish to obtain--biology or forensic science. ",
