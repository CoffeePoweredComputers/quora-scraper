            "answer_text": "Do you mean reducing the rate at which climate is changing or reducing the extent of the change or what? It is unclear what you are asking. But our climate has been in a constant state of change for billions of years. It changes slowly (compared to our life spans). Climate is a highly non linear chaotic system, meaning that it has many many complex and inter related variables. It cannot be predicted or modeled the way we model well behaved systems. It would be like trying to predict the shape of a cloud in the future. We know it will change shape between now and then. We know that wind currents will be the driving force, and we might even be able to estimate that the wind will probably be mostly from the north. But we have no way of knowing how the shape of the cloud will change. Climate is way more complex than that. Every living thing on Earth contributes to changes in the environment. Some more than others. Every force, such as wind, rain, volcanic activity, plate tectonics, solar activity, radiation from deep space etc. contributes to the change in our environment. Climate is like that, only much slower. We can study the climates of our past to some extent. We can sometimes get a glimpse of why the climate changes, but we can never fully understand the reasons for the change. Trying to predict the future of climate is not possible. We can look for trends, like atmospheric constituents vs. temperature, but we cannot draw conclusions about whether they are directly or indirectly linked or what other things are involved. Climate is way to complex for that. As for the hypothesis that man\u2019s industrial activities are primarily and overwhelmingly responsible for current climate change, I think it is way too arrogant to make such a claim. We have no direct evidence that our activities have had even a measurable impact on climate. There are too many variables involved. It\u2019s like that saying that when a butterfly flaps its wings in China, it rains in New York. The smallest changes now can have significant leverage in how things play out in the future. But there is no way of knowing beforehand, what changes will have a great affect and in what way. Global Climate Change, as we know it now, is a politically driven scare tactic to force certain political changes in our world. The data has been tampered with such that it better shows how man is affecting temperature. The UN and others have openly stated how they have created this issue and how they are banking on the mass ignorance of science to rally a large number of supporters to push for action. This in turn will work to impose the desired political changes. It\u2019s a mess. Man has no direct influence on climate. Man has no way to control climate. Man lacks the knowledge and wisdom to interfere in a positive way even if we could alter climate. Man should stay out of the way. Interference will only lead to problems. But this does not mean that we don\u2019t need to be aware of how we affect environment. We should always be looking for way to reduce our impact on Earth. I say reduce and not eliminate because there is nothing we can do about the impact that man has on the environment as our mass marches through time. But there are things we can do to slow down that impact. I am way more concerned about environment than climate. We know for a fact, and we can measure, how much we affect environment. Butclimate is our of our hands. ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly\u2026 The problem is that because climate change has been spoken about continuously for decades which has created fatigue on the subject\u2026 in addition to both sides having been caught out either exaggerating or lying about certain \u201cfacts\u201d. This extended process has solidified people on either one side or the other\u2026 and they will no longer budge regardless of the \u201cevidence\u201d that presents itself. And to do what needs to be done\u2026 the percentage of the world population who supports taking action to mitigate climate change (because lets face it, the chances of \u201cpreventing it\u201d has long since passed) is simply not enough. In short, there are not enough people \u201conboard\u201d to make the change necessary without a percentage of the others joining\u2026 which they wont do. In this way\u2026 \u201cyes\u201d. The Climate Change movement has failed. However, I have been saying for years that we simply need to change tactics to make what needs to be done as an inevitable side-effect. And this is by stopping talking about \u201cclimate change\u201d at all and focusing on promoting new up-to-date technologies while ridiculing the ridiculous persistence of using primitive technologies far beneath our current civilisations potential (and the new fuel generation and energy storage systems that go hand in hand with them). By increasing the numbers who support the transition out of the \u201ctechnological dark ages\u201d and into the future\u2026 there will be other inevitable benefits. Primarily the massive reduction of individual CO2 production, environmental pollution reduction and resource wastage\u2026 and as a consequence the extinction of industries that can\u2019t adapt their products to meet the new population demands who currently are one of the greatest threats to planets systems. Result? Climate change mitigation without the need to \u201cconvert\u201d non climate change believers who will not be swayed and are sick of people endless talking about it. Problem solved. Of course\u2026 more responsible breeding practises would help as well. ",
