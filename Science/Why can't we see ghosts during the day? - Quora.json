            "answer_text": "I saw my Dad\u2019s ghost during the day in my garage. I never believed in ghosts until the supernatural came knocking on my door one summer morning . The following is an excerpt from my book, \u201cMy Journey Down the Reincarnation Highway\u201d that describes my father\u2019s ghost coming to visit me in my garage four months after his death: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 But then a very strange event happened about three months after Dad\u2019s death. I was carrying my four year old son Brian to the van to take him to day care. I sat him down in his car seat and started to buckle him up. I just happened to be looking at his face as I was adjusting his straps. Just then, my dad\u2019s face appeared, transposed over Brian\u2019s face! The image of my dad\u2019s face was silver in color and had a blank look. It appeared for just half a second, but it was there, and then it just disappeared. I startled when I saw that vision and lurched backward. What the hell was that? I thought. Was that real, or am I imagining things? I went back inside and told Karol what I had seen. \u201cWow, that\u2019s weird,\u201d she said. This incident would lodge in her memory because she was able to recall it later. As time went on after this incident, I developed psychic abilities through mediation and received training from my psychic trainer Brenda Posani. It was during a reading with Brenda that my Dad came through and confirmed his visit, here\u2019s the excerpt that describes my exchange with his Spirit: I wanted to clear up a mystery that happened after Dad died. \u201cHey, Dad,\u201d I said, \u201cwas that you in the van when I saw your face on Brian?\u201d \u201cYes, that was me. I wanted you to know that I was around.\u201d Oh, my God, I thought. I wasn\u2019t imagining things. That incident was real. \u201cGod, you scared the crap out of me!\u201d I said. It appeared that the scene was \u201cplayed\u201d to Brenda psychically, and she chimed in with, \u201cThat incident happened in your garage, right?\u201d I said yes. In a later reading years later when I was going through a hard time during my divorce, my Dad offered to reappear to me again to give me support. \u201cNo thanks\u201d, I said, \u201c I know you are with me, but your physical visitations are just too unsettling! Just a note, my dad\u2019s face kind of looked like this photo, but what I saw was much more defined. Ironically the below photo is a close up of a ghost image that appeared over the left shoulder of my friend Judy when she went ghost hunting in a graveyard. She did not notice the face image until she examined the photo later.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ghosts are 24 hour creatures. There is no seeing ghosts specifically at night thats just a villagers tale. In the same way that Hollywood gives the Bible bolts of lightning and Cecile B Demille, our current day perceptions of what ghosts are and when they are about are totally fallacious and modern craftings of old villagers tales. Most ghosts really have either no time or place for dealing with people. They tend to see them as inferior and with good reason .. as a ghost has an enhanced perception of how the world works and operates. Your reason you most likely wont see ghosts during the day is the same reason you are more likely to see them at night. Your eyes spend most of their time during the day providing an extensive visual filtration of light and movement based activities. Under reduced light conditions such as at night or darkened corridors or tunnels, the eyes have to respond better and make creative allowances for what they will filter, because they have to. ",
