            "answer_text": "Time Dilation comes from the Theories of Relativity. The keyword here is \u201crelativity\u201d. To calculate time dilation, we need two points of reference. An isolated frame of reference will always experience time as one minute by one minute. Earth alone - or anything alone - has no time dilation. It is a meaningless concept, if not paired with something else. Or rather; it is always relative to something else - hence \u201cTheories of Relativity.\u201d So it may be Earth vs. Satellites. It may be Earth vs. The Moon. It may be Earth vs a Black Hole. Or whatever, but you need two points of reference to calculate what you seek:  \u0394t' = The change in time in the influenced reference frame\u0394t = The change in time in a reference frame c = The speed of lightG = The gravitational constantM = The mass of the object r = The distance from the object being approached   Of course, you may be thinking in more pertinent terms, a bit like we have the Greenwich Mean Time Zone here on Earth as a reference for all other times. However, the universe does not have a universal reference like that, and so there is no higher point of reference to benchmark Earth (or anything) against. And it is important for our theories that there isn't. Everything is relative in our universe; so one cannot presume a reference when you ask about Earth, the Sun, or even the Milkyway. Perhaps more poetically we can say that we are all the universal reference, and so none of us are. Do I make myself clear? ",

            "answer_text": "Several points here. Time itself is not affected by gravityTime keeping devices however are affected by gravity and will slow down in heavier gravity. Or speed up in lower gravityTheory of General Relativity uses formula as follows.  Now the interesting thing with these formulas is that they use light speed as a core component. If we step back for a second we know that Gravity in space works well under the Inverse-Square Law. Lets look at Newtons Law   So the further you go away from the earth the lower the gravity effect will be. Justification[edit] The inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or other conserved quantity is evenly radiated outward from a point source in three-dimensional space. Since the surface area of a sphere (which is 4\u03c0r^2) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the emitted radiation gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. Gauss's law is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship. The gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them. Lets then look at the Relativity equation again. it has time over the Square root of 1- 2 x gravity x radius over speed of light squared. Now this is a version of the Lorentz formula that is used in electromagnetic transformation. In a way it is assuming that gravity and light travel at the same speed. if that was the case then anything moving at speed would not be affected by gravity. mmm food for thought. The distance from the earth core as the centre point for distance is used and the 1 minus gives the inverse part of the equation. so it does follow very similar to Newtons equation but then you throw the speed of light in. But it doe snot take into account the distance from earth the objects time is. Any how I am no mathematician so their must be reasons. But no evidence of the distance squared is in the formulae i have read. New point Quantum mechanics show that vibrations inside an atom are effected by both temperature and gravity. Thus an Atomic clock will be both effected by temperature and gravity. This point is proved by the fact that atomic clocks are cooled to near absolute Zero to increase their accuracy, and why an atomic clock would work quicker in space then on earth. So if this happens due to quantum influences gravity effects the clocks mechanisms and will slow a clock at higher gravity. So in space the clock will logically run quicker. This effect on the clock is real and must be taken into account, but the reasons behind why is where it goes wrong. Thus theory of gravity and time alteration is incorrect. Time is not effected at all, just the measuring device. ",
