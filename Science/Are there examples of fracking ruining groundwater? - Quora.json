            "answer_text": "Are there examples of fracking ruining groundwater? There is not a single proven case of the actual hydraulic operation having any effect whatsoever on groundwater. In every investigation to date another source for any contamination or pollutant in ground water has been found to be the culprit. There are cases where surface spills or runoff has caused some water contamination but these were not related to any fracturing operation. The controversial nature comes mostly because it\u2019s totally misunderstood or mischaracterized by political foes to the industry. The practice has been going on since the 1940\u2019s and, without it, gasoline would be triple or more in cost and natural gas upwards of 10\u201315 times as much as today. Yes, there are folks out there who try to cheap by and mess up but the occurrence is so rare as to be a major news story nationwide if and when it does happen. With the current knowledge, safety planning and government oversight, it\u2019s one of the safest practices in oil and gas production. Despite all the wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth, there is still no example of hydraulic fracturing leading to fresh/potable water contamination. Those kitchen faucets shooting flames were there years before any well was drilled anywhere in the neighborhood. The larger set of failures leading to problems come from cement or casing problems completely unrelated to frac\u2019ing. ",

I found a many examples of poorly designed and operated conventional wells - real cowboy stuff - that had been allowed to pollute the environment, but not a single example of fracking polluting groundwater. Not one. Not at all surprising, and if you bother to read a little about fracking, you will understand why. ",

Anytime you\u2019ve got an expensive, complex system, containing lots of energy, intended to make money, in the hands of an ordinary human, accidents will happen. But nobody\u2019s happy when accidents occur. Accidents are less likely when the systems are controlled by larger organizations with skin in the game, rather than by a sole-proprietor. If an induced fracture reaches the freshwater table, the well is likely to be a money loser because some or all of the hydrocarbons are not going into the wellbore. Note too, that my first paragraph is as true about transporting goods in 18-wheelers, and flying passengers in 737\u2019s. ",
