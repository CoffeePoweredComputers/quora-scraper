            "answer_text": "What CAN YOU DO with a degree in biology? It seems like most of these answers are pretty specific to \"what types of jobs\" you can get with a degree in biology. I'm not sure if that's what the question is actually asking, so I'll spin something different.  Biology is an incredibly broad topic. But, I'll keep it kinda simple and use the definition of biology as the study of living things. This is the possibly most fascinating, diverse and probably the most challenging fields of all of science. It's also possibly the single most important science for the current and future lives of all things on this (and eventually other) planets. In your degree you probably covered some portion of various topics, ranging from statistical analysis of ecosystems to X-ray diffraction patterns of biological molecules. Speaking more broadly you probably (or hopefully) picked up the following skills: You can find solutions to complex problemsYou can read research critically, learning from the described methods and drawing future questions from the conclusions.You can conduct research in safely, and properly use the scientific method. (something that even top level researchers struggle with, apparently)You can develop a hypothesis to test a certain trait, pattern, diagnosis, or idea.You can build methods that properly test a hypothesis.You can learn and already know of other skills or new technologies that will be useful in making your's (and other's) work easier, faster or better.You can work alone, in small teams or teams as large as multinational collaborations to achieve a goal.What you WILL DO with these skills is more up to you, and some of these answers are accurate in presenting some options. But, ultimately, there are an endless number of problems to be solved in biology, which include disease, starvation, climate change, pollution, food and drug safety, to name a few. Here are a few example questions: What happens when a new technology is introduced to the environment?  What are the impacts of forestry, fishing and agriculture practices on the environment as well as the people who consume their products? How can we change our lifestyle or technology to improve our health, reduce disease or improve control over our impact on the environment? How do we keep track of our surrounding ecosystems, and what can they tell us about the future of the environment? (ie: disease or pest outbreaks in human, plant, and animal populations; soil and air quality; the impact of changes in wild populations, etc.) How can we as humans survive in harsher conditions, whether it's a place that's too cold or too hot, the vacuum of space, or the surface of foreign planets? If you look historically and currently at how we've studied these kinds of questions, you'll find that we're pretty good at answering these in some cases but horrible in others. And, in some other cases, we can solve problems but the solutions can't be implemented or are disputed for cultural, fictional, emotional or religious reasons. If you need a few case examples, there's the neglected space of orphan diseases, the discovery of vaccination and the anti-vaccination movement, genetic engineering, cigarette smoking, use of CFCs, air pollution, the Theory of Evolution and others. If you are passionate about biology, then you are... ...indirectly or directly,... ...now or in the future,... ...in a big or in a small way,... ...responsible for these kinds of events, whether they're disasters or brilliant inventions. Back to what you can do... You can... communicate biology through journalism, bio-art, education, or other wayslearn to save lives, whether directly or indirectly of humans or other living thingsdiscover new things by yourself or in teams, at an institution, in a company, in a garage or in your backyard.invent new technologies which directly or indirectly impact the lives of manyhelp or support others doing anything in the list above.That should cover most of the jobs that other people are mentioning. My last point is about what you want to do and how you want to do it. My guess is that, in posting to Quora, you might not be entirely certain of that answer. Neither was I when I graduated, nor am I now. But, after enough time I'm getting a better idea of exactly how I like to work and what interests me most. This consists of many different things that might make up another series of blog posts sometime. But, here are a few things to keep in mind: Don't do things that you don't enjoy doing.If you're doing something that you don't enjoy, don't plan staying long or plan on changing it into something you do enjoy.Always learn, be critical and stay up to date. Biology is endless and often hard to predict.Maybe this wasn't the answer that you wanted, or expected, but I hope this helps you or others in one way or another. Good luck and have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "I had the same view when I started biology. My school had its own medical school, so it really tried to funnel its biologists toward medical sciences (heavy on the physiology, histology, etc.). I really wasn't interested in most of that (although I still had to take physiology, and I find the way the kidneys, lungs, and liver work chemically is facinating). There are tons of branches of biology, with specialties in each branch. Some fields that I worked in were ecology, microbiology, oncology (yes medical, but my job was to use the TIRF microscope), and genetics. You could spend your whole life in any one of these and more. However to answer your question about what to do with a biology degree, I personally couldn't find a job (I graduated with a Genetics and Subcellular focus in biology). Others in my class that also graduated with biology degrees either went on to get higher education in the same field (if they were lucky), or now have jobs that don't really have to do with the degree, only the bachelor's designation. What I ended up doing is going on to a program that allowed me to get my Master's of Environmental Engineering without needing a bachelor's of engineering first (oh man did I make up for all that math I missed out on..). I now have a background in stream restoration, low impact development strategies, watershed management, water quality systems... I realized that this is actually what I wanted all along: not just the research about biological concepts, but what are engineering techniques being employed today to actually help solve problems.  If you're just starting out in biology, your courses will automatically introduce you to various fields of biology (and chemistry, physics, etc.). I would keep a career path in mind for after college by looking at the job market in your region for biology degrees (unless you're willing to move). But, you shouldn't miss out on something you might love (I really liked genetics, but I probably wont ever use that again..), and many employers I've encountered do value the bachelor's degree even if they don't care that it's in biology.

            "answer_text": "You can teach or do research. There are a variety of teaching positions from elementary to the college-level. However, if you want to teach primary school, you probably would need to get a teaching certificate of some type (I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not interested in teaching below the college-level; you have access to Google, right?) . Research positions vary from university positions, government, pesticide and agricultural companies, etc. If you like mucking around in the field, Fish and Wildlife may be for you. If you like interacting with people and the public, apply for a zookeeping position. Graduate or professional school are also other options. These are particularly useful if you want to be a doctor, vet, or want to get on the road to a PhD for university-level teaching and research. There are a lot of things you can do with a Biology degree, but honestly, if you are not interested in the field, DO NOT FORCE YOURSELF TO GET THIS DEGREE. Get a degree in something you are interested in. Biology is not the highest paying field, so if you are motivated by money and not particularly interested in this field, you might want to consider majoring in something else. Even if you wanted to go to medical school, they don\u2019t even require pure Biology or Pre-med undergraduate coursework. ",

Aside from the people I know who actively work in research (both field and laboratory) or teaching (or the college professors who do both), there are still a lot of options out there. I personally work as a laboratory technician in a veterinary laboratory. We do a lot of the same things that are done in human labs, but our patients are cows, horses, dogs, cats, etc. instead of humans. One of my former coworkers had previously worked in a quality assurance/quality control lab in a factory that produced packaged lunch meats. Now, she works in water quality analysis for the local water company. Another coworker previously worked for a zoo. One of my former college classmates works for the national park system. Then there\u2019s the people who work for the USDA, and other governmental oversight organizations. This doesn\u2019t even get into jobs where the requirement is just that you have a college degree, with no field specified. Most biology jobs are willing to train you, because while you may have related experience, it\u2019s very uncommon that (at my job) we would get someone who had previously worked in a veterinary or human diagnostic lab.

Biology, microbiology, biochemistry, etc., degrees can take you many places with pharmaceutical and medical device corporations, both in Fortune 500 corporations and small startups. It\u2019s not simply a matter of coming in with a life sciences degree and working your entire career in a laboratory (if that\u2019s not what you want to do), there could be opportunities in sales, marketing, operations, quality, regulatory, and even in finance. Understanding the science behind the business is essential and recognized as such. I look at the most highly successful people in the corporations I\u2019ve worked for and those with biology degrees are right up there with engineering, finance, and other desired and door-opening majors - an example of a great foundation for progress in the industry could be a biology degree with an mba. The pharmaceutical industry is getting a lot of bad press due to a few of its leaders\u2019 horrid marketing and sales practices over the years, but the reality is there are hundreds of thousands of people in the industry whose goals and objectives are simply to produce and make available the highest quality drugs, hospital products, and medical devices for saving and sustaining lives and ensuring the highest quality / healthiest lives for people. Coming into the pharmaceutical industry was the best career move I could have made - and it was just happenstance (and some dumb luck) that got me into the business... I had worked my way through college in the aerospace industry and shortly after graduating we were facing a downturn in aerospace, so I took a chance with a pharmaceutical corporation that was building a new plant in the area - and never looked back.

            "answer_text": "I think a biology study during high school and college can lead into graduate school or any area of medicine or laboratory science. You usually apply the biology major to study medicine, study zoology, environmental science, food and drug products, or any examination of life. You may study in a laboratory doing research, examining bacteria or viruses through microscopes, or simply studying microorganisms. It is usually to achieve a balance between our living needs as people, what we do to other living organisms, and how to prevent terminal illnesses. The critical application to control disease outbreaks and illness among the population through spreading and contamination is a very obvious biology and health science interaction. And that is most likely the greatest need from government, aside from the more research driven or administrative driven places in laboratory science, medicine, and agricultural quality. ",

The most \"major related\" career will more than likely consist of temporary jobs as field assistants for graduate students and professors. This work usually dries up over the winter but you will always have a job for spring/summer. For full time work, I would strongly suggest getting a master's. This degree will prepare you to work as a biologist or technician for a state or federal agency or a private consulting firm. Honestly, your undergrad years are so crammed with liberal arts and required classes that you only get the barest of biology background. You really need at least a masters to be proficient. A bachelors in biology pretty much qualifies you to get a masters or do field work. ",

And at last if you want to go in teaching job do it with chemistry they are the most repect receiving professors. And also at coaching centers they are the only one to be paid with highest salary more then any other teacher. And many more options are also available But each option mentioned here seem best to me, and each of this also have lots of destinations. So do research, and decided with very cool mind and take a lot of time in thinking about this after all its about your life, and you have got only one. And their is no option for undo or restart.

Basically to be successful career wise (you can argue with what im about to say) its 40% degree,40% projects/skills, 20% work experience (but one can argue degree is 0%). Anyways, with a bachelor degree you can get a job in typical places like in medicine or in a lab or in education. However, no matter what in the end always make it useful for oneself. Learn to grow plants and fungi. Care for animals. Start a blog. The way you get a career in it is all up to you, it may require another job for funds first, but if you want to be successful in it truly, use all the knowledge for your own benefit and make something new. Do your own bio research and upload on youtube, make your own successes and achievements. If you need quick cash on the side that is easy while your job hunting I suggest working for door dash, uber eats, and postmates (schedules are flexible and pay is extremely good and you can study while working easily).

In most cases, these employers don\u2019t want masters or PhD level individuals to perform marketing or product management They want people who has a bit of knowledge and can be trained in other aspects of business. The generalist is supposed to take a \u201cglobal view\u2019 of problems and not get distracted by the science. So think about product marketing/management or pharmaceutical / medical device sales.

Even without a education minor, there are programs for lateral entry. When I spent weeks in the hospital, I met technicians who worked in the labs. With the pandemic, lab workers frequently appear on the news. Many biology majors go to graduate school because they would like to work in research. Good Luck! ",

What a bachelor\u2019s degree tells a prospective employer is that you are able to commit to a long term program, conform to a hierarchical system, capable of learning, capable of completing assignments, capable of getting work in on time and up to at least a minimum of quality. The employer may then offer you an entry level position where you prove your ability to learn the business and that you are a productive employee. ",
