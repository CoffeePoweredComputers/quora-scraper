            "answer_text": "The fact is research only measures, (to the degree some forms measure at all) confidence that an idea under consideration can be supported by the evidence available or that the idea can be dismissed as lacking supporting evidence. Thus the extent to which research actually measures what it was intended to measure is determined only by the quality of the research itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, is the physics of the experiment the same as the physics of the theory, or it is a simulation of the theory system?Secondly, does the experiment include all possible possible results, or at least the extreme results? Thirdly, are there factors that are not present in the experiment? For example, the inverse square law for the gravity as a funcrion of distance does not include the different energies of the systems that were compared. The energy of a body at a given distance, could have a range of values depending on its vertical velocity, that might affect its acceleration., ",
