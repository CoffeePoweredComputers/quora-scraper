            "answer_text": "Some people have so-called autoscopic doubles (cf. When You're Visited By A Copy Of Yourself, Stay Calm). Their phenomenal world-simulation contains more than one bodily self-image. Neuropsychologist Peter Brugger and his colleagues describe a man who experienced five such body-image doubles (\u201cpolyopic heautoscopy\u201d). By contrast, no one runs two or more simultaneous streams of logico-linguistic thought. How does the massively parallel human central nervous system generate this sophisticated virtual machine? No one knows. Either way, episodes of what is commonly called thinking are adaptive. Contrast how taking LSD at high doses disrupts the capacity for serial logico-linguistic thought (\u201cflooding\u201d). Such disruption can be incapacitating, especially for the drug na\u00efve. So can you entertain two distinct thought-episodes at once? Compare the duck-rabbit illusion. However hard you try, you can\u2019t simultaneously see a duck and a rabbit\u2026  That said, there is another sense in which massively parallel conscious thoughts define our waking lives. Over a third of the mind-brain is given over to visual processing. Somehow, this visual processing creates the huge macroscopic world-simulation your mind-brain is now running. Thus you can simultaneously generate, say, half a dozen football players running on the pitch or \u2013 in the ancestral environment \u2013 a pride of hungry lions. If you are awake rather than dreaming, such parallelism can be immensely fitness-enhancing. How does a pack of membrane-bound, classical (??) neurons carry it off? Again, no one knows. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, It can happen. The trouble here is that you see the phenomenon in the westerners\u2019 point of view. The brain, a human, the conscious.. have been known enough. If I ask you \u201cwhat is the consciousness? and the big difference between human\u2019consciousness and animals\u2019?\u201d I think you will answer with lots of difficult terms\u2026 that basically can\u2019t help with these questions like this. One of several practical methods I can show a little, but not for encouraging. It may be hard for me to describe in english language. Thus, let\u2019s try as following: One preparing good mood in a pleasant space, lying and relaxing at the most possible posture but he\u2019s hard to sleep any more.Firstly, one person tries to focus all his mind outside. That means the perceive happening, locating, \u201clistenning\u201d,\u2026 around like it\u2019s still natural but not be mixed by whatever thinking in brain. The existance\u2019s only him and the proccess above that should be call the radiated proccess. (\u201cone point\u201d sees and percepts all the world)Second, invert the process. That one tries to focus inside all about his mind world only. Eliminate the previous world outside, he\u2019s the god of this inside universe and sensating, looking at the whole of it. (\u201cgod\u201d sees and percepts all the world).So then, repeatedly continue these proccesses one after another (changing the positions) as long as possible until some special things might happen.Note: Don\u2019t explain the expecting results to the participants who need relaxing mind like playing a game is important also. You might set the participants do it until they fall asleep\u2026 because that\u2019s the best condition for a relaxing mind meaning really releasing all other thinkings behind. There\u2019s basis for that experiment. But the result should be which you want to happen. You could see and feel two worlds (inside and outside) and double bodies,\u2026 It\u2019d be useful if it\u2019s not described out. I read some other answers but the processing with streams of logico-linguistic thought and some simultaneous actions with parts of body\u2026 they\u2019re not the same as the situation above. They\u2019re actions belong to habits that\u2019re trained for quickly happening so the foci are super quick rotational. Finally, I think this process hardly help for fitness-enhancing in general. Because our mind would be strongest if it deals with only one problems at once. You can see that while we stand among beautiful nature, everything appears in our vision, in virtual brain. They\u2019re there for us to be able to perceive all at the same time but only allows us to activate our focus on one point every moment. ",

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong please: I think that people with ADHD are people who have extremely high consciousness, that their specialty level of humanity desires to do, think, please or anger, imagine..etc etc ..all at the same time, a sever case of ADHD is when the desire of doing all of this becomes too heavy to the brain. the mild to moderate cases makes the person a treasure t humanity if managed right and with sincerity, not to sell more medications, but to benefit from these people.
