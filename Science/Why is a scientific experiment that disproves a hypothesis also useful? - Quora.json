            "answer_text": "[Edited: to correct 5 am writing errors!]        Shawn and Ayse have offered good points.  Let me follow up on one these from your question, because it is quite important.           Consider a well-constructed and properly-implemented study that is unable to show any real benefit from a certain treatment or procedure, and for which the null hypothesis (which states \"no effect\") cannot be rejected.   The authors have the same responsibility to publish those results as they would if the effect was clearly very strong and beneficial.          The reason is that if these results were NOT made public, then we wouldn't be able to share these findings, and other investigators might repeatedly try the same study again, with the same result - arguably a waste of effort, time, and money, ALL of which could have been applied to solving other important issues.  In this sense, such waste can actually be argued as being \"unethical\".  In addition, of course is the importance of confirming that a treatment is not effective, so that patients can be considered for more effective treatments.         The question of whether to publish results with \"no effect\" also arises with some journal editors, who unfortunately may prefer to publish reports of studies with solid, positive, results, while allowing less publishing space for the less-spectacular papers.

            "answer_text": "Scientific hypothesis are never \"proved.\" They are either rejected, or fail to be rejected. So to answer your question, disproven hypotheses are useful because they allow to make a new hypothesis, which you might be able to find support for. Sometimes a rejected hypothesis is all you need.
