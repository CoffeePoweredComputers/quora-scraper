            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. Deuterium is absolutely NMR active: it splits carbon atoms to which it is attached, and hydrogen atoms to which it is adjacent. The classic example is found in carbon-13 NMR, where we see a triple peak at 77 ppm from the chloroform-d solvent. The carbon atom is split by magnetic interaction with its deuterium atom.  We don\u2019t usually look at deuterium signals in NMR, for two reasons: Deuterium is an insignificant fraction of natural hydrogen, far less in proportion than carbon-13 as a fraction of natural carbon.Deuterium is a spin=1 nucleus, and so gives rise to more complex splitting patterns than the spin=[math]\\frac{1}{2}[/math] nuclei we all know and love.Deuterium NMR - Wikipedia Clarification: Deuterium resonates at a different frequency than protium. That's why D substitution makes H-1 signals go away. ",
