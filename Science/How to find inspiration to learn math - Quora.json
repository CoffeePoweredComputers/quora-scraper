            "answer_text": "SO you loved math and now you don't as much.  A few questions: At what point did you stop loving math?  Was it in Algebra 1, geometry, Pre-calc, calculus, statistics?What are some things that you love/like/get joy out of (anything at all)?What resources do you use right now to understand math besides your teacher?  Websites, tutors, friends, parents, etc...What skills do you want to have when you are 25?  Don't focus on careers, just skills like playing the piano or being able to talk with people comfortably or being able to really read numbers well...Once you answer the questions, I can give you a better answer on what you can do to be inspired to learn more math.
