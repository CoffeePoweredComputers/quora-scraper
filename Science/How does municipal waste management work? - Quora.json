            "answer_text": "Basically, you have two principal functions: waste collection and waste storage or disposal. Collection can be door to door most typically, from standardized containers, or via bins in more centralized systems. Disposal can be either at a solid waste landfill, or incinerator. Principal costs in collection are labor and capital equipment. In disposal it is the construction of facility and maintenance of same. Either or both of these functions can be contracted out. This is fairly simple, assuming there is a fee collections system in place. Without some form of efficient fee collection system, the payment process can be a deterrent or additional cost to the system. This problem is not so prevalent in developed countries but presents a barrier in less developed countries. ",
