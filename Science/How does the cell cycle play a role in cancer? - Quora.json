            "answer_text": "Overview   The cell cycle is regulated by proteins that are outside the cell as well as inside. These proteins are either known as external regulators or internal regulators, based on their functions.  The internal regulators are proteins in the cytoplasm and tell the cell when to divide.  The external regulators are protein signals produced by the cell that induce other cells to start dividing. When cells sense that they do not need to divide anymore, they cease producing this growth factor and stop cell division. If mutations in the genes that provide these growth factors are found, they could possibly either make growth factors continuously again (cancer) or produce the wrong kind of growth factor (no growth) Tumor Suppressor Genes   Tumor Suppressor Genes are the \u201cbrakes\u201d of the cell cycle. The cell's DNA contains the information to produce the proteins that stop in order to check the condition of the cell at these \u201ccheckpoints\u201d of the cell cycle. Mutations in the DNA may cause these cells to lose their checkpoints. For example, some genes stop the cell from moving to the next checkpoint if damage to the DNA exists. When mutated, the cells will either lose their prescribed checkpoint or proceed through the cell cycle in an uncontrolled manner.  Proto-Oncogenes Proto-Oncogenes are the accelerator of the cell cycle. Unlike other genes in the DNA that encode proteins and promote cell division, however, proto-oncogenes help move the cell through the cycle. When mutated, the proteins require the cell to proceed through the cell cycle in an uncontrolled manner even if there is damage to the cell or its DNA.  Apoptosis    Apoptosis is essentially programmed cell death, or the common way that the body normally rids itself of cells that are not dividing properly. It is a normal feature of healthy organisms that is caused by a cell\u2019s production of self-destructive enzymes, and occurs in the development of infants. However, apoptosis is shut off  in cancerous cells \u2013 so damaged and/or mutated cells are not destroyed.  About Tumors \u2013 Why are they so bad? A common misconception about tumors is that all tumors are terrible and deadly. This conception could not be further from the truth \u2013 most tumors are benign \u2013 that is, they don't cause any harm to the body. However, after a while, any specific tumor may metastasize and spread, harming the function of other organelles and becoming more disastrous. Causes of Cancer   There are a multitude of causes of cancer, although there are four key causes that may lead to the terrible disease.  1. Radiation: most forms of radiation, including X-rays, sunlight, and nuclear radiation can cause cancer by causing mutations in DNA. If mutations occur in genes that control cell growth, the cell may be transformed into a cancerous cell. 2. Viral Cancers: Certain viruses cause cancer when the genes they inject into cells disrupt the normal processes of mitosis.  3. Chemicals: Chemical compounds called carcinogens can also trigger cancer causing mutations in the DNA. 4. Genetics: In some cases, an individual may inhibit the mutation in DNA passed on from their parents.  Fighting cancer As with most diseases, the best way to fight cancer is to prevent it. This includes avoiding cancer-causing agents, regular exercise and a balanced diet. However, once contracted, there are three treatments for cancer: 1. Surgery - localized cancerous tumors or those that do not spread quickly are often removed surgically. If this is done before the cancer has spread, the patient is often cured. 2. Radiation therapy - properly directed radiation destroys fast growing cancer cells most quickly than normal cells. 3. Chemotherapy - the use of a combination of chemicals to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy may also harm normal, healthy cells.  Hope this helps! Feel free to comment on this answer, A2A or PM me if there are any further questions, comments, or concerns. ",
