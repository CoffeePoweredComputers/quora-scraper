            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing, not all problems are scientific problems. Here are eight different models which we use: ExperienceLogic and reason (Evaluation, critical thinking, comparison, and contrast)Inference and intuitionIteration, feedback loop, and correctionEmotional intelligenceCreativity and design thinkingProblem solving (based on various methods)HistoryLets skip past to the substance of what you are suggesting: \u201cThe evidence is all on Christianity\u2019s side. Let\u2019s take a tally: twenty seven books of the New Testament, nineteen pagan writers, and three Jewish writers testify to Jesus Christ\u2019s historical reality. Christians, indeed, did not follow a cunningly devised fable, but a real person. There were, as the Bible proclaims, eyewitnesses to His majesty. That historical fact is at the very foundation of the faith we hold\u201d (p. 77) \u2013D. James Kennedy, doctorate in comparative religions from New York University, Skeptics Answered: Handling Tough Questions About the Christian Faith, 1997 And science concludes that religious practice is net better for individual and community along 18 or so different key areas: Why Religion Matters Even More: The Impact of Religious Practice on Social Stability Beyond that, I would remind you of this CS Lewis quote: \u201cTo be incommunicable by Scientific language is, so far as I can judge, the normal state of experience\u2026.The very essence of our life as conscious beings, all day and every day, consists of something which cannot be communicated except by hints, similes, metaphors, and the use of those emotions\u2026which are pointers to it.\u201d What Lewis is saying is that the methodologies, frameworks, and perspectives of science focus on the objective, repeatable, and the quantifiable. By definition this leaves out the subjective, identity, personality, consciousness, imagination, creativity, and ultimately you. Your only way to know is through YOU. Eliminating or denying YOU or self-knowledge and relational knowledge is to deny the essence or in the words of one of my Favorite movies, Walter Mitty, it denies the quinessence of Life. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah yet again, we encounter the supposed contradiction between the \u201cscientific method\u201d and other modes of rational inquiry. So I will take this opportunity to reiterate that other systems of rational thinking are equally valid as long as they remain grounded in Logic. To evaluate the validity of an argument, it would be sufficient to check if it violates any rules of reasoning . I can\u2019t stress enough the misleading character of these false dichotomies ( Science vs Metaphysics, Science vs Ethics, Science vs Everything Else !!. etc) Too often even scientists seem to forget the fact that like all other thought processes, the Scientific Method is also based on Logic and Rationality. It is Logic which can be said to be the modus operandi sine qua non of knowledge. Now for a definition of the Scientific Method The Scientific Method[1] is nothing but the use and refinement of inductive reasoning to build mathematical models of reality with a particular emphasis on repeating the process of observation to compensate for and nullify various errors. We can see that Science relies almost entirely on the type of reasoning known as Inductive Reasoning. Its operation is through continuous observation and evaluation of the results of individual experiments and trying to build coherent, mathematical models from these specific observations. Unlike mathematics which assumes the truth of certain general statements (axioms) and builds theorems upon these axioms, there are very few statements in the domain of Natural Science which can be taken to be true a priori. Scientific theorems are predicated on and built exclusively through the process of observation and inductive reasoning.  Inductive Reasoning is considered invalid in Maths! Therefore as ironic as it may sound, the Scientific Method is in fact considered to be inferior to reasoning by deduction. No one can prove that a scientific theory will not cease to hold true the next day or perhaps even the next minute. It's just an assumption made on the grounds of utility. Scientific theorems are always to be treated as open questions since they don\u2019t follow necessarily from the basic observations. Against common misconception, the way of thinking that characterizes the Scientific Method is actually nothing new. It has been been around pretty much since homo sapiens' front lobes grew to sufficient proportions. What was added in the 16th Century (the so called start of the Modern Age) was only an extra emphasis on experimental study and a more rigorous mathematical formulation. It must be clearly understood that the only reason the Scientific Method is believed, wrongly so, to be infallible by many amateurs is because it has been highly useful in the advancement of civilization. But that does not provide incontrovertible evidence for its infallibility. Also see Chetan's answer to What is the difference between science and philosophy?
