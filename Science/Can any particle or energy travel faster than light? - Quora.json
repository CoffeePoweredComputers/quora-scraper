            "answer_text": "I do not have enough formal education to answer that properly. From our current understanding of world it seems that light speed is kind of unbreakable barrier. So accelerating to faster then light is not possible. There are speculations that there is another branch of solutions that makes sense. Particles faster then light that could behave drastically differently. Such particles has still not been completely ruled out (as far as I know, I might be wrong) but things are strange with time so it is difficult to imagine. Those are pure speculations. You need to realize that in order to measure speed, you need to measure distance over time. For you distance and time seems two different things. Because, for some reason, we seem to move (at constant?) speed through time. The fact seems more and more to be that time is just another dimension. In relativity it is used so for long time. In all possible quantum equations time has very similar role to space. And in some recent experiments it is shown that it can exhibit properties we originally associated only with space dimensions. So time is different, yet the same. We only start to understand how to treat it, how to understand it. But that is the point. In order to speak about speed, you need time. But if time is not so much different from space, then we will need to even re-evaluate what we thing speed is. And once we re-evaluate we might see things that we overlook because of our interpretation of time. (As a lot of quantum or relativistic effects were overlooked before we understood what to see.) ",

            "answer_text": "no, because as physics and mathematical laws emphasis that if anything travel faster than light then it voilates physics and mathematics laws. It will break the space-time frame.And could be a time traveller. As we know that, as velocity increases a body\u2019s mass also increses.so, it can\u2019t be possible to travel faster that light. Also light is something having mass much smaller as can possible. ",
