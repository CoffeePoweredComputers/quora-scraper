            "answer_text": "The same way science does anything. You begin by formulating a hypothesis (in this case, that objects with mass attract each other), a good hypothesis is one which can make predictions about the outcome of a set of initial conditions. Next you propose a test of this hypothesis, a good test is one which has a reasonable chance of proving that the hypothesis is wrong. The results of this test will provide more information with which you can propose more tests. The more tests that the hypothesis survives the more likely it is to be true. If it doesn't survive you have to determine if a slight adjustment of the hypothesis will allow it to pass while still describing observed phenomena, if not throw out the whole hypothesis and start again. Continue testing an infinite number of times. If a hypothesis survives an infinite number of tests it will have been proven true. What's that you say? You can't run an infinite number of tests? Well, I guess science can't prove anything is true. This is where the idea of \"sigma\" comes into play. You may have heard that the LHC had a \"6 sigma\" result for the detection of the Higgs boson, this meant that they'd run enough tests that they were certain to a degree of 99.9999% (six nines) that their detection was actually the Higgs. I believe that four sigma (99.99%) is the point where other scientists are willing to agree that your findings have merit (scientists are very reticent to truly acknowledge another scientist\u2019s findings unless they absolutely have to, \u201cI suppose you might be getting close to being right\u201d is extremely high praise from a scientist), but for something as groundbreaking as the Higgs boson they wanted to be exceptionally sure before they made the announcement.

            "answer_text": "According to the scientific method, a theory is tested. This testing is performed with he intention of disproving the theory. If the theory is difficult to disprove, it becomes accepted. Acceptance is entirely different from Proven. No theory can ever be proven. There is just not enough time in the universe to ever do this. There will always be experiments that can be designed to attempt to disprove it. That\u2019s just the way science works, or was intended as. However, we now find much more effort devoted to \u201cproving\u201d theories. For example an experiment is set up to prove a mathematical concept (Higgs Boson, let\u2019s say). The experiments are therefore done with the INTENTION of getting a favorable result. These are not double-blind experiments. Since there is Intent, data are fit together according to the model. This could be considered as highly biased data manipulation. Remember, data is neutral, and a model brings it to life. With the Higgs Boson, a mathematical formula was tested using mathematical formulas (algorithms) that were designed to filter out the overwhelming noise (alternative interpretations). This is an example of guided discovery. As such it was not scientific. Efforts should be made to disprove this Boson. However the methods and data are not released to the public. My guess is that such methods and data could also disprove this Higgs Boson. The same kind of intentional data fitting can be found in the \u201ctheory\u201d of evolution. I am not against this theory, however, scientific attempts should be performed to disprove it in order for it to be an accepted theory. We can \u201cprove\u201d anything we want if we use intentional data fitting. Data can be interpreted in many many ways. I am an experimental scientist, and at least this is what I have found over the last 40 years. My opinion, of course. Cheers ",
