            "answer_text": "Does it? The heat capacity of salt is lower than that of water, so for a certain MASS of salt water, it will cool down quicker, because there\u2019s less water and more salt, so the total heat capacity is lower than for the same mass of pure water. But, for a certain VOLUME of salt water, it will cool down slower, because there\u2019s the same amount of water and some salt, which will hold more heat than the water alone, so the total heat capacity is more than for the same volume of pure water. (1 litre of salt water will have more mass than 1 litre of pure water) (The above is assuming the same conditions - container, ambient temperature, etc) ",
