            "answer_text": "Is the Coronavirus over exaggerated or under exaggerated? That depends on you. It's just an opinion so nobody is right or wrong. As far as I'm concerned, it's over exaggerated. COVID 19 is a new strain of flu, but a known strain of SARS. It pops up in the middle of the flu season and people are surprised there's an outbreak and deaths. So far only around 1,100 people have died from the virus and the world goes insane. Millions of people have doed from the flu and the media is silent. Apparently Number 10 doesn't mind deaths of its citizens, at least 20,000 of them: The UK's Chief Scientific Officer, according to the Telegraph says, \u201cKeeping the number of deaths from coronavirus to less than 20,000 would be a \u2018good outcome\u2019 of the Government strategy to battle the pandemic.\u201d It has the same effects as the flu. It's spread the same way but don't mention this or you will be banished from social media . . .including Quora. This is by definition over exaggerating but dont believe me, read for yourself. From the UKs Sun newspaper: DEADLY coronavirus could kill 45 million \u2013 and poses a bigger threat than terrorism, experts have warned. From the UKs Express: CORONAVIRUS disease (COVID-19) could huge a huge death toll if a chilling prophecy in the Bible's Book of Revelation is to be believed, Christian evangelists have claimed. From the New Scientist: If the spread of the new coronavirus isn\u2019t halted, it could infect 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population and kill 1 in 100 of those infected \u2013 around 50 million people.

            "answer_text": " In reality it depends on the nation in question at a given time, and the end result globally. For China, it is turning out that even if there was deliberate attempt to lessen the severity of the Virus in December 2019, this quickly changed to transparency, and massive action to contain the spread. Nations such as Singapore responded with thought out plans, and they also showed it was possible to contain the virus. South Korea would have quickly followed in this pattern, had some individuals not decided to violate quarantine regimes and attend religious gatherings for an obscure cult like society they were part of. South Korea has since than point through vigorous testing and focus largely contained the epidemic.  Returning Evacuee having Temperature taken, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, International Airport, Delhi, India. India would begin action 2 months ago, and though not having a first world health care system in every aspect, it leveraged it\u2019s resources strategically. India had transmission from travelers from abroad, and not from community transfer. These cases have so far been dealt with successfully. India has in fact performed successful airlift of more people than any other nation, and it has brought it\u2019s people back home, without endangering others. The effort put into these efforts is truly commendable. Hopefully, the pandemic remains in control.  Italy expands control mechanisms to a lock down. Europe and in particular Italy, had an initial policy which was not implemented properly.. By stopping flights from China and then not checking to see if passengers simply made the journey via other routes, was not a good follow through. When the first cases emerged, they went unnoticed and in fact it is surmised that the hospital staff carried the infection after this point and they were not tested either. It was only after the cluster became large, that it was realized that the disease had spread. Since then the situation worsened and finally a nation wide lock down has followed. In the U.S. a lot was stated by the Trump administration, and the U.S. was the first nation to stop flights from China. Yet, political aspect aside, not much was to prepare. Neither were any viral treatments prepared in case of an outbreak, nor were plans implemented at the possible sites of potential outbreaks. Instead, the alarm was only triggered after the COVID-19 had been spreading for weeks in Washington State. A Lawyer in New York who traveled to Iran, was allowed to pass through J.F.K. Airport, and this man created a cluster of illness which never was brought under control. The response was among slowest in the world. Though this is changing now.  The U.S. Stock market has in essence lost 30\u201340% of it\u2019s value and gone into a bear market, and the world has followed. Suddenly, China\u2019s statistics and conclusions are now accepted, whereas two months ago they were dismissed as manipulated. The world is now being told what China had stated in January, and this was that 80% of people have mild illness, and 20% of people have illness which may require hospitalization. Severe Illness befalls about 5% of the people and half of this group may require assistance in breathing. The outbreak could have been prevented, if the outbreak had been caught early, and stopped. The second chance was missed, when passengers were allowed to evade travel restrictions by taking connecting flights. Finally, too much faith was put into weak travel restrictions and their ability to stop a disease with low fatality rates. In the months and years ahead this pandemic will indeed be studied to prevent others. By no means is the pandemics severity exaggerated, it is just as bad as the ultimate statistics will show, even if this means in time that the mortality rate is lowered because of the cases not tracked. Any lives lost because of failure to contain a preventable illness are too many.
