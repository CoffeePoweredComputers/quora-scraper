Gaseous states of matter. Then revise those notes only . One advantage of using notes made by you is that it's takes short time to revise and recapitulate .so I will suggest u to make notes then do revision from those notes repeated number of times . Plss don't mind if there is any grammatical mistakes \ud83d\ude4f. ",
