            "answer_text": "The three examples cited by you have different material properties. The types of waves that can be propagated through them depend on the material properties. Ground or Earth is a solid. It can undergo both longitudinal and transverse wave motion ( i.e. the particles oscillate in the direction of the movement of the wave or in a direction perpendicular to it). Hence both types of waves can and have been observed to travel through the ground- whether caused by sounds or explosions ( as in seismic exploration) or by earthquakes. A sky wave (in distinction to the space wave cited by you) would be a wave through the atmosphere -since the sky is an illusion created by the scattering of sunlight by air molecules. Air is a mixture of gases and can only support longitudinal waves. Transverse shear is not possible in a gas. Hence sound waves are the typical waves passing through the sky. Space would then mean the region beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere - where the amount of matter is too low to permit energy transfer from one particle to the next one in a regular manner. Hence no wave requiring a medium ( sound/earthquake) can be transmitted through space. Electromagnetic waves on the other hand do not require the presence of any medium and hence radiation of various energies passes through space. Depending on the wavelength, most electromagnetic radiation passes through the atmosphere but only few long wavelength radio waves travel through the ground/ earth . Some examples of limited transmission are ground penetrating radar / unidirectional links with submarines. ",
