            "answer_text": "Remember, \u201cIQ\u201d is comparative number based on a mean. Someone with a really high IQ is smarter *relative* to the population they belong to. So your question is asking \u201cWho was the smartest person . . . of his or her time?\u201d Hey maybe Leonardo da Vinci, he was pretty sharp for his time period. Or it might be the person who invented the wheel. Did you know it took about 300 years for someone to figure out they could turn a wheel on its side, put a stick in the middle and *roll* that wheel? That\u2019s how dumb people were back in the day. They just used the wheel to spin and make pots. For centuries. Pythagorus? Who knows? We can\u2019t know because we don\u2019t know for sure how dumb every one else was at the time, relatively. So maybe you\u2019re asking, \u201cWho\u2019s the smartest person in history?\u201d We\u2019re getting smarter and smarter, with every generation. So someone out there among the 7 billion people who live today, probably a kid, is the smartest person in the history of humanity. Just because he\u2019s intelligent *and* he inhabits a smarter, more complex world. If we think in terms of augmented or collective intelligence, everyone who has open access to the internet is enormously \u201csmarter\u201d than how smart people were before. I was clueless about what that weird noise was coming out of my car. But I, plus a video on youtube, knew what it was and how to fix it. In fact, with my ability to use a search engine and a world of shared knowledge, I know so much stuff I could crush 15th-century Leonardo. Okay, maybe not with my sorry art skills. But you get what I\u2019m saying here? Leo no doubt would crush me and my google skills, if he lived today. But he doesn\u2019t. No matter how much brain power he had, he was limited to whatever books the Medicis bought, and the limited comprehension of the world during his time. ",

            "answer_text": "I am pleased to announce that I personally estimated my cat as having an IQ of 10,000 in human terms. She is so smart she won\u2019t deign to take a test. No test can measure her IQ. She has done better than that you see. She doesn\u2019t try to communicate with us humans other than in the most rudimentary ways on concrete matters (mostly about food) because we are so impossibly slow and boring she can\u2019t be arsed. On this and many similar questions the name William James Sidis often turns up with an estimated IQ of 250 to 300. Sidis doesn\u2019t have the highest recorded IQ of all time. He doesn\u2019t have a recorded IQ. He has an estimated IQ (estimated by whom?) and there is no test at all that can measure an IQ of 250 nor can there ever be. 250 is a meaningless number. Such numbers, 10,000 or 300 or 250 are IMHO meaningless made up numbers, with no accuracy, reliability, validity, or meaning. The WAIS I think has been renormed to extend to 220. I may have that wrong as to the specific test or number, it isn\u2019t really important. To speak of people with an IQ of 210 or 220 you are speaking of people who would place above all the humans who have existed in all time 50 times over. Probably more; much, much more. You cannot test enough people in three generations to get a population that definitely includes one single person who can be placed at that value. (Well of course you CAN theoretically find such a person as in one could in theory exist; but you have to have a bunch of people BELOW him and above the rest of us to prove that\u2019s where he or she belongs on the \u201cnormal curve\u201d.) The normal curve breaks down when you get this far from the Norm; and you cannot have a large enough population for it to mean anything. (Well maybe Hari Seldon - Wikipedia would disagree but he has a much larger population to work with.) You may find a person who is smarter than every person you ever tested (already pretty speculative since the only thing that tells you that is a test, whose answer key was developed by people much dumber than your subject). How can you say they are smarter than some person you haven\u2019t tested and never will test (because by a thousand times or a million times more than struck-by-lightning-odds they haven\u2019t been born)? I am a smart guy by all accounts and a good number of tests. I repeatedly score from 98th to 99.9th+ percentile. Note that goes from a ho hum 1 in 50 (Mensa) to above one in a thousand (Triple Nine). And it likely involves a few questions as little as one or two on a long test being answered differently that would make a difference in result. I\u2019m not impressed, I know for sure many people are much smarter than me who I can actually name because I talk to them almost every day. (\u2026 BTW I don\u2019t think Mensa smart is ho hum\u2026I don\u2019t even think average is ho hum\u2026). But I am not even remotely the smartest person in THIS population of Earth. There are likely 5 million or so people who are as smart or smarter\u2026 lots of room above me. Actual people, alive today. IQ Percentile and Rarity Chart This chart tops out at IQ 202 \u2014 1 in 190+ BILLION which is 27 times the population of Earth. If Sidis were here and IQ 300 he would never \u2014 literally in a THOUSAND years \u2014 have a single peer. How can you develop a test that will reliably, repeatedly, place a person a specific distance above all the people who have ever existed and currently exist? If you have such a person who is smarter than everyone who does or has existed how do you determine how MUCH smarter they are than all those people? It is chimera. Just to get a 202 you have to be smarter than ten times all the people who ever lived. Yet we have tales of a half dozen people who are that smart. It\u2019s not possible, if you find TWO such people it is a wildly improbable coincidence. Indeed if you find one person at IQ 202 it appears to be a wildly improbable event. An IQ of 250 is TEN standard deviations. I haven\u2019t found a chart or calculator that will tell me the rarity of ten standard deviations (obviously I\u2019m not smart enough to calculate it by myself) but if we had even one person who was there we couldn\u2019t actually measure it and we couldn\u2019t understand what it means and we couldn\u2019t actually recognize it. In reality IQ testing and the concept of IQ top out at about 160, and perhaps the concept can stretch to 180 or 200 but beyond that we are past meaningful discussion. And let me interject with \u201cwhat are we talking about anyway?\u201d OKAY back to basics. Intelligence is a broad word to describe a function of one organ, the human brain. It refers to the efficiency of its operation, it\u2019s ability, or the capacity it possesses in various ways. Some brains clearly work better than others. Some much better. In rare cases they work \u201coff the charts\u201d better. We don\u2019t know exactly why. But the reason the normal curve is applicable is because it generally has been shown to describe the results of many kinds of natural phenomena or functions. To extend the idea of the normal curve to TEN SD is to presume that it is possible for a human brain to operate at that level. I highly doubt that it can, even though we don\u2019t know all the things that go into superior working brains. Two, three, maybe as much as five SD sure, we\u2019ve actually measured most of that. Reliably. But whatever makes the brain work cannot be presumed to indefinitely improve if we just wait long enough or look at enough brains. Whales will not climb trees no matter how many we look at. I think the human brain no matter how good physically cannot operate at ten SD. My cat has the highest IQ recorded ever, at 10,000. Unfortunately she can\u2019t prove the point because she doesn\u2019t have a human brain and we\u2019re too feeble minded to understand her. ",
