            "answer_text": "There are different definitions of random, some of which are thought to apply to reality, others of which are convenient models known to be fiction. The original studies of randomness concerned games like dice and cards. These are devices manufactured by people for generating unpredictable results, but they are governed by the laws of physics and are no more random than the motions of the planets. Computer pseudo random generators are modern variants. In this case, randomness is a fiction convenient because calculations are usually too complex and too sensitive to initial conditions. It\u2019s also an artificial example, because it does not occur without human design. It is consistent with a deterministic universe. Randomness next arose in Darwin\u2019s theory, which is now usually described as random mutation plus natural selection. Natural selection was not controversial, and everyone knew that unnatural selection (a.k.a. breeding) worked. Darwin\u2019s controversial claim was that the raw material selection worked upon was not caused. Today we have some explanations for what causes mutations, but Darwin was still essentially correct in that the mutations are not caused by anything that relates to their fitness (actually, some elaborations of Darwinian evolution challenge this, but that\u2019s an empirical matter that doesn\u2019t affect the philosophic point). Thus evolutionary randomness is truly random in its biological context, even if ultimately mutations are determined by physical laws. Statistical thermodynamics was the next place randomness arose. It is controversial today whether the second law of thermodynamics is a true physical law, in which case entropy and therefore randomness is real, or just a convenient model for aggregating deterministic phenomena. Quantum physics inserted a new kind of randomness into the picture, and it also remains controversial whether it is true randomness or an illusion caused by our perceptions of reality. Bayesian theory was developed in the 1930s and posited subjective belief as the fundamental definition of randomness. Subjective beliefs are certainly real, but they don\u2019t seem to obey the mathematical rules of randomness. Nevertheless, Bayesian randomness is a real experience, even if it has deterministic underlying physical causes. Game theory required a new type of randomness. It is certainly real in the sense that it can be used to improve strategic decisions, but whether or not it is real randomness depends on your theory of consciousness and free will. ",

            "answer_text": "The term \u201crandom\u201d has lots of meanings. Some are useful. Often, random just means \u201cunknown\u201d or \u201cunpredictable.\u201d Not bad but not very precise. Some terms \u201cRandom Variable\u201d have nothing to do with randomness; it\u2019s a synonym for \u201cMeasurable Function.\u201d One can compute (some) things such as averages by measuring \u201cenough\u201d of an object. Fortunately there are theorems which lead to procedures for doing this effectively. I like to think of this as \u201crandomness by saturation\u201d; one knows enough to get answers. There is (in physics) another type of randomness that occurs simply because of the existence of atoms and molecules. Small particles of dust or pollen can be observed to jump around rather irregularly. A botanist (Robert Brown in 1827) observed this phenomenon. It was finally described by Albert Einstein in 1905. Mathematically, the particles do not have a velocity; they are bounced around by varying numbers of atoms and molecules in a manner that seem to fit what one means by \u201crandom.\u201d One interest point is that one cannot measure the location of the particles because a small probe would be subject to the same \u201crandom\u201d collisions with molecules. (This has nothing to do Heisenberg or anything quantum mechanical; it only has to do with the existence of tiny particles.) There is one type of \u201creal\u201d randomness that occurs. Quantum mechanics has some random choices. One can\u2019t really get around this feature such attempts either predict violations of well-established experiments or they are subject to their own random choices. Sometimes, \u201crandom\u201d is used to mean \u201cunpredictable\u201d but they are distinct. Unpredictable has the hidden question of ,\u201cBy whom?\u201d There are computations whose outcome is unpredictable if one doesn\u2019t have a powerful enough computer (really, if one doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay for the computation.) A combination lock that takes more than a couple of days to open may be considered random from the point of view one trying to break in. ",
