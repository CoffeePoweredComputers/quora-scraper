            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question. I will try to explain this in detail. I did my Ph.D. in the lab of Prof M. Van Beylen. He was a student of Michael Szwarc - the pioneer in Living Anionic Polymerization. When you study living anionic polymerization your solvents need to be super dry, consequently the group of Prof Van Beylen used a lot of sodium and potassium metals. Concomitantly with it, they also had lots of sodium and potassium waste. We collected this metal waste in 2.5 L glass bottles covered with paraffin oil. The traditional way to dispose the alkali metal waste on lab scale is to suspend it in n-hexane followed by dropwise addition of isopropanol. This works fine if you have a few grams of metal, but not if you more than 2 kg. (Unless you have a few days to spare.) So our - enjoyable, nevertheless slightly unsafe - way of sodium and potassium disposal was a bit different. We would glide our 2.5 L bottles in the small river nearby the lab. Due to the turbulence of the water, the bottle would eventually flip and fill up with water. This would potentially give an explosion or at least a nice fire in the middle of the river leaving only some alkaline residue. I have to admit that this would not be acceptable anymore, but in our slightly juvenile opinion it was the fastest way to dispose it in a reasonable safe way. Although they told me that on one occasion the bottle drifted nearby the river side and started a small fire in the bushes. Obviously this event caused some extra amusement. The fact that we sometimes disposed the waste after a lab party in the middle of the night adds to the equation of pure nostalgia. So far the introduction to the fact that alkali metals fires are fascinating and one of the reason of this post. Why do alkali metals explode in contact with water? This seems a simple question. I guess most chemists would just state: \u201cThat is obvious: the reaction of alkali metals with water is very exothermic and you generate hydrogen. Due to the heat the hydrogen is ignited, which causes the explosion.\u201d But if we look into detail it is not that straightforward. Let's check what happens if we would drop a pea-size piece of metal in water. Lithium just sizzles on top of the water (see Table 1 for densities). It does not explode.Sodium also floats on top of the water, it will ignite with a yellow orange flame most of the time however it does not explode.Potassium is not denser than water, it does react very violently and will ignite with a violet flame, it will often explode in contact with water.Rubidium sinks, reacts very violently and will explode.Caesium will explode on impact with the water.TABLE 1: Physical properties of the alkali metals + NaK alloy (data from Alkali metal - Wikipedia) [math]\\small{\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\hline M & \\text {Melting point/\u00b0C} & \\text {Boiling point/\u00b0C} & \\text {density/g mL}^{-1} \\\\\\hline Li & 180.5 & 1342 & 0.534 \\\\ Na & 97.7 & 883 & 0.968 \\\\ K & 63.4 & 759 & 0.856 \\\\ Rb & 39.3 & 688 & 1.532 \\\\ Cs & 28.4 & 671 & 1.873\\\\ NaK & -12.6 & 785 & 0.866 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}}[/math] Just to give you an idea of the complexity I will start with the reaction of the alkali metals with pure oxygen. Lithium gives Lithium oxide: [math]4Li(s) + O_2(g) \\to 2 Li_2O(s)\\tag{1}[/math] Sodium will be rather similar: [math]4Na(s) + O_2(g) \\to 2 Na_2O(s)\\tag{2}[/math]but it does react further to the peroxide [math]O_2^{2-}[/math]: [math]2Na_2O(s) + O_2(g) \\to 2Na_2O_2(s)\\tag{3}[/math]the peroxide will be the main product. Starting from potassium it will react in a 1:1 mole ratio to form superoxides: salts with the dioxide ion; [math]O_2^-[/math] (a charged ionic species with a single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of \u22121) [math]\\begin{align*}  K(s) + O_2(g) & \\to KO_2(s) \\\\   Rb(s) + O_2(g) & \\to RbO_2(s) \\\\ Cs(s) + O_2(g) & \\to CsO_2(s) \\end{align*}\\tag{4}[/math] Superoxides are rather exotic, but they do have applications in for instance O\u2082 generators. The large superoxide [math]O_2^-[/math] anion can only be stabilized by the bigger cations with smaller ion charge densities. The Lithium cation is just too small and has a too high charge density. Actually the reaction with oxygen is one of the reasons you should keep the metal stored in an inert solvent that doesn't dissolve oxygen. But we are drifting away from the question. We were interested in reaction with water: all alkali metals react the same. They form the metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas (and heat.) [math]2M(s) + 2 H_2O(aq) \\to 2 MOH(aq) + H_2(g)\\tag{5}[/math] The traditional assumption is that the heat will ignite the hydrogen gas causing the explosion or more correct an implosion (reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water) [math]\\begin{equation} O_2(g) + 2H_2(g) \\to 2H_2O \\tag{6} \\label{oxy}\\end{equation}[/math] But the heat generation is not a correct argument: if we look at the thermodynamics of the reaction (See Table 2) all alkali metals actually generate almost the same amount of heat per mole. If we would recalculate per gram we notice that Lithium generates much more heat per gram. Hence the argument that the generation of heat is responsible for the explosion can\u2019t be correct. TABLE 2 Heat Release Based on the Reaction (based on data from ref. 1)[math]\\textbf{(7)}\\quad\\ M(s) + H_2O(aq,\\infty ) \\to MOH(aq) + \\frac{1}{2} H2(g)[/math] [math]\\small{\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hline M & \\Delta H \\text{/kJ mol}^{-1} & \\Delta H \\text{/kJ g}^{-1} \\\\\\hline Li & -508.5 & -73.3 \\\\ Na & -470.1 & -20.4 \\\\ K & -482.4 & -12.3 \\\\ Rb & -481.2 & -5.6 \\\\ Cs & -488.3 & -3.7 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}}[/math] The reason why all alkali metals are so close to each other might need some extra explanation. In order to have some qualitative data we can look at the Hess cycle of the Cation formation. SCHEME 1: Hess Cycle of the Cation formation:  You can imagine 3 steps: The atomization energy is the energy required to vaporize gaseous atoms of the metal. As you can see from the table Li requires the most energy. The metallic bond in Li is the shortest (and strongest.)The first ionization energy is the energy required to form an ion. Since the valance electron is further from the nucleus in Cs, it will require less energy to get rid of it.The hydration enthalpy the energy that is formed to hydrate the ion. In the case of Cs the ions are larger in size there is less interaction with the lone pair of the water molecules.TABLE 3: Estimate of Enthalpy of formation of alkali metals with water. All data in kJ/mol. (data from ref [1] except hydration enthalpy from [2])[math]\\small{\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\hline M & \\text {Atomistion energy} & \\text {1st Ionisation Energy} & \\text {Hydration Enthalpy} & \\\\\\hline Li & 159.4 & 526.4 & -519 \\\\ Na & 107.4 & 502.0 & -409 \\\\ K & 89.2 & 425.0 & -322 \\\\ Rb & 80.9 & 409.2 & -293 & \\\\ Cs & 76.1 & 381.9 & -264 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}}[/math] In all 3 items there is clear trend from Li to Cs. The problem is that the change rate of the separate items is different, so - when combined - the trend is gone. For the smart people that do the actual math of the last table. It indeed does not correspond to the data of Table 2. But please keep in mind that the data was provided to give you an idea about the trends. (The enthalpy data of Table 2 was gathered from one source, if you would check others you might find other values.) I also left out the contribution of water (visualized by the infinity sign), and only included the enthalpy value of OH-formation. But - if you want - you can add it, which I did in table 4). You could also calculate [math]\\Delta G[/math] using standard electrode potential or [math]E^\u00b0[/math]: [math]\\small{\\begin{align*} 2M(s) & \\rightleftharpoons  2M(aq) + 2e^- \\quad & E_{M}^\u00b0 \\\\ H_2O(l) + 2 e^- & \\rightleftharpoons   2 OH^- (aq) + H_2(g) \\quad & E_{H_2O}^\u00b0 = 0.83\\\\ \\hline 2M(s) + 2H_2O(l) & \\rightleftharpoons   2M^+(aq) + 2 OH^- + H_2(g) &E_{cell}^\u00b0=E_H^\u00b0-E_M^\u00b0\\end{align*}}[/math] [math]\\Delta G_{cell}^\u00b0 = \u2212n \\,F \\, E_{cell}^\u00b0 [/math] TABLE 4: Estimate of Gibbs Free energy and Enthalpy of the reaction[math]M(s) + H_2O(aq) \\to MOH(aq) + \\frac{1}{2} H_2(g)\\tag{8}[/math] [math]\\small{\\begin{array}{cccc} \\hline M & E_M^\u00b0/V & \\Delta G \\text{/kJ mol}^{-1} & \\Delta H \\text{/kJ mol}^{-1} \\\\\\hline Li & -2.84 & -194 & -222.7 \\\\ Na & -2.71 & -181 & -184.3 \\\\ K & -2.931 & -203 & -196.5 \\\\ Rb & -2.98 & -207 & -195.3 \\\\ Cs & -3.026 & -212 & -202.4 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}}[/math] Thermodynamic data don\u2019t tell you much of the speed of the reaction. Referring to the data of Table 3 you can make a fair estimation of the activation energy of the reaction by making the sum of the first two items (until formation of the ionized cation, but before hydration) . It turns out that activation energy is much higher for Lithium. This is the reason why Lithium reacts slower in comparison with the other alkali metals. But it remains puzzling why it eventually does not explode. It might relate to the solubility of the resulting hydroxides; Lithium hydroxide is less soluble in comparison with the other metals. (About a factor 10, see Table 5) So the the LiOH might form a film on the metal surface, which could explain an inhibition or at least a slow down of the reaction. Another factor is that Lithium has a fairly high melting point (see Table 1) in fact higher than the boiling temperature of water. The other metals will melt during the course of the reaction. But Lithium remains solid: the surrounding water act as a buffer and takes up the heat in the form of steam. The other metals will melt and might give small droplets which does give a much higher contact surface. TABLE 5: Maximum solubility of Alkali hydroxides in g/L near room temperature (data from Wikipedia) [math]\\small{\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hline MOH & Solubility /g L^{-1} & temp /\u00b0C \\\\ \\hline LiOH & 128 & 20 \\\\ NaOH & 1110 & 20 \\\\ KOH & 1210 & 25 \\\\ RbOH & 1000 & 15 \\\\ CsOH & 3000 & 30 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}}[/math] But even considering all the above factors there are some other issues with the theory that hydrogen causes the explosion. If we would repeat our experiments again in an inert gas like argon it turns out that starting from Potassium it will explode sometimes. Without oxygen reaction [math]\\textbf{\\ref{oxy}}[/math] is not possible. One of the options would be a Steam explosion, but that seems highly unlikely. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the reaction the water and metal need to come into contact. You form hydrogen gas and heat at the surface of the metal, but once the reactions starts the hydrogen gas and generated steam should act as a barrier to prevent further reaction. (The Leidenfrost effect) In 2014 Mason and Colleagues [3] used a high-speed camera (~100 \u00b5s resolution) to film the explosion. They actually used Sodium-Potassium alloy, which is a liquid at room temperature (see Table 1) . The reason why they did this was two-fold: they could control the size of the droplet reproducibly by using a syringe, but the main reason was to have a clean metal surface. So free from oxides and other impurities. Using the high speed camera they could produce these wonderful pictures:  Figure 1 A NaK-drop hitting the surface of water from above and below (with water as comparison) from ref [3] As you can see from the picture the reaction is virtually instantaneous. At about 0.3 to 0.4 ms you see some spikes coming out from the metal. These spikes were crucial in order to understand the mechanism. The spikes are the reason why alkali metals explode in water: a closer look at the pictures revealed that they are dendritic. (smaller spikes appear as secondary spikes etc.) In a matter of a few ms this causes a very high surface area, which can react with the water molecules creating the enormous amount of heat and hydrogen i.e. an explosion. They did some extra experiments with molten Aluminium (which did not cause the spikes) and also dropped a NaK-drop into liquid Ammonia. (Figure 2)  Figure 2: A NaK-drop hitting the surface of liquid ammonia. From ref [3] So in liquid ammonia the spikes were clearly visible, but no subsequent explosion occurred. Ammonia is capable of solvating alkali metals (forming a blue solution), but the reaction to hydrogen is too slow. (Sodium in Ammonia is stable for days, although eventually it does form sodium amide) [math]M(s) + NH_3(l) \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\ H_2(g) + M^+ + NH_2^-\\tag{9}[/math] But obviously one question remains: what causes the spikes. The authors suggest that in contact with water the metal forms solvated cations(visible as the blue area in the above picture) almost instantaneous hence a fast formation of positive charges on the metal area. These identical charges repell each other due to electrostatic repulsion. This causes what is called a coulomb explosion. They did some ab initio calculation to proof their theory. In addition they could completely stop the explosion mechanism by adding small amounts of surface active species like hexanol into the water. In a follow up article ref [4] they published a very nice footage of this last experiment: link to movie (mp4) I urge you to watch it first before you read on. (It's 20 seconds long) The authors describe what is going on: After gently placing a drop of a sodium/potassium alloy on water under an inert atmosphere production of solvated electrons becomes so massive that their characteristic blue color can be observed with a naked eye. The exoergic reaction leading to formation of hydrogen and hydroxide eventually heats the alkali metal drop such that it becomes glowing red (at this stage to be around 600\u00b0C) and part of the metal evaporates. After the chemistry is essentially over. When the smoke clears, the drop cools and suddenly becomes completely transparent. It is consisting of molten hydroxide temporarily stabilizes on water via the Leidenfrost effect, bursting spectacularly after it cools sufficiently. Now, watch it again :-) This figure appeared on the cover of Angewande Chemie  FIGURE 3: A small water drop on an alkali metal drop. With the blue, electron-rich region and white hydroxide as the final product of the reaction from ref [5] So to conclude: the explosion of Alkali metals in water is far more complex as it seems. Edit: thanks to the comment of User-11782962439727910095 I realized that Mason is a YouTuber called Tunderf00t. So I had a look into some of his videos. He explains the journey in this rather long (30 min), but very interesting behind the scenes video: (He ends with a question that he explains in his follow up article as explained above.)

In their defense, it must be said that the explanation has been discovered only recently. My response is based on the fllowing paper:\"Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with \u200bwater\" Mason et al., Nature Chemistry 7, 250\u2013254 (2015) doi:10.1038/nchem.2161 The fact that a reaction generates a lot of heat is not enough to start an explosion: many metal oxidations are vigorously exothermic, yet they quickly stop due a formation of a \"passive\" layer of metal oxide that prevents further reaction. The key that leads to an explosion in the case of alkali metals is the coulomb explosion: as soon as the heat from the early reaction melts the metal, the charge inbalance at the metal/water interface drives the formation of microscopic metal spikes which enormously increase the surface available to the reaction.  Small traces of surface active impurities may reduce this process, which explains why sodium and potassium do not always explode, but heavier elements do! ",
