            "answer_text": "The most basic question is \u201cIs the religion necessary for a human being?\u201d You may be a Hindu,Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, or belong to a different religion, this question must have come into your mind at some point. Is the religion really necessary for us? Suppose there is no religion and no one follows any religion, what would happen? Would the world drown? Statistics: According to an estimate, about 2.3% of the world\u2019s population describes itself as an atheist, while a further 11.9% is described as nonreligious: United States (4%), Italy (7%), Spain (11%), Great Britain (17%), Germany (20%), and France(32%). If you observe, most of the nonbelievers are from western countries. If you see, western countries are very advanced and are the richest countries. If so many people can live without religion, then why can\u2019t all? Purpose of Religions: If I am not wrong, religions are created by men whom we call as prophets. The main purpose of the concept of the religion was to create a civilized society, as primitively people were following their basic instincts, which was not good for a civilized society. So, the main purpose of the religion was to tame the animal within us and to provide a spiritual platform on which we can spend our life happily. The paths may be different but the aim was the same i.e. the welfare of humanity Advantages of Belief in Religions: If someone says religions are not useful at all, then he should think again. If you see the civilized society around you, it is based on some values. Though the morality is on a decline around the world, still there are more good people than bad people and that is why this world is not as bad as it would have been with more bad people than the good ones. Religions teach us not to harm innocent people, animals, respect our elders, to have faith in God,to discern between good and evil, not to misappropriate, make donations, let live and let others live, etc. Lots of people follow this and this provides a good foundation for a civilized human society. Disadvantages of Belief in Religions: 1. Misinterpretation: As most of the scriptures are written a long ago, it is hard to know what the person exactly wanted to tell his fellow people. If he had made a rule, it could be possible he had something else in mind and today, we can misinterpret it and say that this thing about this religion is bad. 2. Time: Most of the rules are based on the situation a few hundreds or thousands of years ago.Socioeconomic conditions during the time between have changed tremendously, so some people find it very hard to cope with the old traditions and rules. 3. Provocation: Some shrewd people of society use the emotions of common people about their religion for the selfishness. This problem is most prominent nowadays. Religions have just become a toy in the hands of some politicians and religious leaders. They have divided the world into different religions. So, instead of bridging the gaps between the minds of people, religions are dividing them. 4. Competition: There is a race going on among st nearly all the religions of the word to acquire the No. 1 position. Therefore, they always compare their religion with the other religions and try to teach follows of other religion how they are better than theirs. To do this, sometimes they use every possible way which is not allowed in any religion. They forget the basic principles of humanity and join the blind race. 5. Money: Do you know that you can make millions easily if you enter the market of religion because it is very easy to fool the people. Nowadays, as money is God for everybody, some people are exploiting every possible way to do this. 6. Terrorism: Terrorists are claiming that they are killing people for Holy War. They do even blast themselves and kill innocent people for the sake of religion. Followers of all religions are using religion according to their convenience. In a situation, if they feel it is profitable for them to believe in religion, they do so and in other situations, they deliberately keep it aside. Therefore, the main purpose of religion is not getting fulfilled. Argument: Suppose there is a person A who is a believer but is not a good human being and there is a person B who is an atheist but he is a good human being, then who is better? I think A is better because he is following the religion of humanity. Instead of being a charlatan, it is better to be an atheist. On the other side, there are situations in which religion is helping common people to live a better civilized life. There are some people who are believers and are good human beings too. In fact,religion helps them to be a better human being. Conclusion: It is my opinion that religion is necessary in order to make our society more civilized. What I am right now, my religious teachings have contributed to it a lot. My religion has taught me to discern between good and bad. But if somebody does not want to believe in God or religion, he should not be forced to do so because the ultimate aim of the religion is to make our society more civilized. If we force others to believe in what we believe, then I think we are regressing. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.  Religion consists of: Ontology and Efficacy, a theory that explains why things that you experience happen the way that they do. (What is the purpose of existence?  What does it mean?  Why does anything happen?  What matters and why does it matter?)Mythology, a supporting narrative justifying the theory.Ritual or customary practices based on the theory. A system of Morality and/or Ethics based on the theory. Religion originates in the minds  of individuals where it performs  specific functions related to language and necessary for conscious thought.  But it also exists externally in the social world  where it performs social functions, and is subject to social forces. Religion isn't just the stories people tell (mythology) it is also the beliefs people hold.  Are  all beliefs religious?  I honestly can't think of a single belief that  can't be traced back to the ontological premises of the person who has  it. All beliefs go back to values (What the individual thinks is  valuable or important.) Is this the best ice cream flavor? Is this the  best route to the store?  Where should we have dinner?  In order to  answer these questions you need to know what exists, what doesn't exist,  what you value, and what you do not value. These are the questions that  are answered by traditional religion. Although clearly some beliefs are  more central to the ontological premiss than others.  People  don't believe things because of the stories, they tell stories to  explain what they believe.  That is why some people consider particular  stories to be compelling while other people are not moved by them at  all. Mythologies are stories that people use to explain their beliefs.   The stories don't need to be literally true to serve their function,  allegorical stories work best because metaphors are how the human mind  processes abstract thoughts. We manipulate abstract ideas through a  process of analogy with concrete experiences.  (See :Moral Politics by George Lakoff.) But  humans are also constantly updating their beliefs with new experiences.   A good story can change what people believe if it causes them to  reevaluate what is possible or what they value.  Which is why people are  most likely to change their beliefs when they are having an emotional  crisis. If, during a crisis, a persons' beliefs comfort them and help  them deal effectively with the experience, then the crisis will just  reinforce their faith in their beliefs.  If, however, they feel that  their beliefs have failed to help them deal with the experience they  will be open to finding alternative beliefs that might be more effective  to meet their needs.  The primary need religion fills for the  individual is the need to have some basis for making decisions about  what is important (valuable) and what is the most effective path to  acquiring those things of value.  Matthew 16:26 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?  Is a statement about values based on an ontological premiss. If you  don't accept the ontological premiss that the soul exists you will  obviously prefer to gain the world and lose something you don't believe  you even have.   That is why believing that the soul, or God, or  Atlantis don't exist is just as much a religious belief as believing  that they do exist. The thing believed in is not what makes a  belief religious.  It is the fact of having any belief at all that is  the substance of religion. ",
