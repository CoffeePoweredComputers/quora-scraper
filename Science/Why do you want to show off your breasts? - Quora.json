            "answer_text": "It makes me feel good. I am one of the majority of women who particularly want to. My husband likes me to show off and I like it that he likes it. The billion-dollar bra industry with its support, padded, push-up, see-thru lace bra varieties will affirm this feminine trend to show off. However, as long as I don't need the \u201csupport\u201d, I will, whenever the situation is appropriate go bra-less. Its more comfortable and makes me feel good\u2026 I am a bit of an exhibitionist\u2026 and I like the attention (as long at it is polite and not abusive) I feel if many men can without receiving much objection show off their topless bodies at every opportunity, then why not women? Many males never look for an excuse to take off their top and flaunt their pecks\u2026 am I right or am I right? Well so too with me\u2026 although I at least do it with a little more discretion in public when the situation requires\u2026 apart from specific public nude beaches and nude bathing areas\u2026 then my top will be surrendered as soon as my foot hits the beach sand and my breasts are free to public view. My wedding dress, to my husband\u2019s great delight, was controversial and showed ample cleavage\u2026 like this\u2026  ",
