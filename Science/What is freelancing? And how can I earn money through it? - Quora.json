            "answer_text": "First off, let's address what a Freelancer actually is. Freelancers usually earn money on a per-job basis, charging hourly or daily rates for their work. Freelance work is usually short-term. While a freelancer is not officially employed by another company, they can be subcontracted by other businesses. It\u2019s common for freelancers to work on several different jobs or projects at once, but some freelance contracts may restrict who else the freelancer can work for until they complete the project. Some of the most common freelance jobs are within creative industries such as graphic design, copywriting, website development, or photography; however, freelancers can work in almost any service-based industry, such as translation, consulting, or catering. Freelancing is an awesome way to make money online working from home. But sadly most freelancers fail from the get go. It's not that they are not talented it more their lack of understanding on how to actually get the work and have people find them online that want to buy their services. Lets talk about three reasons that freelancers fail that are based on my own personal experience of both succeeding and failing from time to time. I'm so confident in these reasons and why I think you'll find that if you are struggling you're doing at least one if not all three of these common mistakes. Freelancing at its core is quite a simple business, you have a service that delivers value to someone. You provide that service and then get paid. Avoid these top 3 mistakes and you will become a very successful freelancer: Not Creating Systems & Processes Systems and processes can sound pretty boring, but the truth is they can save you heaps of time and money in your business. Establishing processes for routine tasks means that you can spend less time on administrative work \u2013 like email and bookkeeping \u2013 and more time on building your business and earning money. Here are a few areas of your business that you can set up a time-saving process for: onboarding new clientssending invoicescollecting paymentsfollowing up with clientsscheduling meetingstracking income and expensesmarketing and social media activitiescollecting testimonialsTo start systematizing your business, track everything you do for 2-3 days. And I mean everything. Use a time tracking app like Toggl to record the amount of time you are spending on each activity and create a log. Take note of any tasks that are repetitive \u2013 these are the things you can systematize now. Start with the most time-consuming task and find a way to automate it. It\u2019s also a good idea to record the steps you take for any of these tasks so that down the road you can hire a virtual assistant to perform these tasks for you. If you create a process document now, onboarding people onto your team will be a breeze. AVOID UNDERVALUING OR OVERCHARGING YOUR WORK One of the biggest problems, when talking to new freelancers is that they severely undervalue their time and work. As newbie freelancers, we tend to sell ourselves as low as possible to get projects. Similar to what Rickshaw drivers do, but they have a code among themselves that there is a minimum value set below which no one would charge. On websites like Fiverr, people showcase their work for as low as $5! I mean seriously? But they slowly build their portfolio to make a pitch for bigger projects. That is one way to go. Another could be to prepare samples of your work and show them to clients while pitching and putting forward your quote. Avoid too much bargaining also by charging justly. The same way overcharging is bad for freelancers. Companies can afford to quote high for a project that you would take much less for because people trust companies and not individuals. People coming from known institutes tend to charge way more than what a normal university pass out would charge, well that is on account of their background. The amount you charge should cover your basic direct costs, travel time for meetings, eatables (if it not an online project) cost while in meeting plus set an hourly rate for yourself to make it easier to charge for your work. As you grow, you can charge what you want based on your portfolio. Don\u2019t start out charging high is what I\u2019m getting at. Here are a couple of resources to help you get an idea of what others are charging: The Freelancer Rates DatabaseCalculating a Freelance Rate by AIGALast but by no means least - Assuming the work will find you When your plate is full of the client work that actually pays the bills, it\u2019s far too easy to lose sight of those other necessary activities that don\u2019t necessarily equate to billable hours\u2014you know, things like marketing. While it\u2019s tempting to assume that work will find you after you\u2019ve established a reputation in the freelance world, that\u2019s not always the case. It\u2019s important that you make the time to actively market yourself and your business in order to secure new clients. Set aside a couple of hours each week that you can dedicate to marketing, relationship building, and business development. Even if you don\u2019t necessarily need new work now, investing that time will be a huge benefit if and when you do need to scrounge up some new gigs\u2014as you won\u2019t be starting from square one! Whether you\u2019re just getting started or have been freelancing for a while, there are plenty of mistakes you\u2019ll make. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I\u2019m guilty of several of the ones listed above. But, at the very least, you can learn from the freelancers who have come before you and avoid the common pitfalls most new freelancers make. Do that, and you\u2019ll be off to a better start than most. Just stay laser-focused and you will be well ahead of the pack. Conclusion Freelancing can be an extremely rewarding choice, especially if you end up with a better work-life balance than you had before. But it takes time for freelancing to become a primary source of income. It\u2019s also worth remembering that freelancing is only a choice. An employed position can be just as rewarding if you\u2019re working for and with the right people. If you\u2019ve made the switch to freelancing recently, or are considering it, get involved in some online freelance communities. Take a look at Independent Work, Freelance Heroes, Being Freelance and Doing It For The Kids (for freelancers with children).

            "answer_text": "Freelancing is merely performing a task typically remunerated by the professional world in any particular industry on a project-by-project basis instead of working under the banner of any particular organisation and being paid by them on a monthly/yearly basis.  Basically, it means: If you are a writer, instead of working on as a salaried employee and working by their norms, showing up to their offices, reporting to their superiors etc., you write for many different organisations on a project-by-project basis, choosing which projects you want to take up from the ones offered to you. In this manner of working, you do not need to focus excessively on what a particular organisation\u2019s guidelines or manner of working is. You can work independently, and of your own accord, from your own situation and choosing your own hours. You can also dictate your own pay, subject to negotiation. Freelancing is an excellent lifestyle for many people, as it avoids the monotonous nature of work you would receive when working for an organisation, and also allows you to dictate your own working terms. However, there are some careers it particularly takes well to, like digital marketing consultation, which is what I do! Digital marketing is a field that melds to perfectly with freelancing, I\u2019m so glad I picked both this field of career and method of working. ",
