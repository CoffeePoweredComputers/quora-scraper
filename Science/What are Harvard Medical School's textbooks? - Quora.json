            "answer_text": "This is actually a very difficult question to answer, as each course usually has as set of topic-specific textbooks that are recommended, but not required.  Generally, the teachers tell us the material we are supposed to learn and leave it up to us to figure out what resources (beyond lectures) we need to use to do so.  I'd say that most students that I talk to will use lecture slides/notes and the internet as a first line, and the turn to the primary medical literature and/or to some favorite textbooks as a supplement.  This is very class- and student-dependent, though. So, as much as I wish I could point you to a simple list, it would probably end up being a mix of three or four dozen different texts, a couple of which I read cover to cover, but the majority of which I just read a couple important pages from. Here are a handful of books that I have enjoyed, however, and will definitely keep around:- Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9e (Robbins Pathology): 9781455726134: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com (Classic reference) - Pathophysiology of Heart Disease: A Collaborative Project of Medical Students and Faculty (PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HEART DISEASE (LILLY)): Leonard S. Lilly MD: 9781605477237: Amazon.com: Books (I love this one) - Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 8e (Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Abbas): Abul K. Abbas MBBS, Andrew H. H. Lichtman MD PhD, Shiv Pillai MBBS PhD: 9780323222754: Amazon.com: Books (Pretty classic immunology text, along with Janeway.  I use this one because I love the figures and it was written by several of our faculty). - Pathophysiology of Blood Disorders (Lange Medical Books): 9780071713788: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com (Nice, concise treatment of hematology) - Atlas of Human Anatomy: Including Student Consult Interactive Ancillaries and Guides, 6e (Netter Basic Science): 9781455704187: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com (Wouldn't be med school without Netter's) For boards, many medical students across the country use First Aid and Pathoma, and the students of HMS are certainly no exception.  Online resources include PubMed, UpToDate, Wikipedia :) ",

            "answer_text": "Medical schools generally don't issue a list of required textbooks.  Even if they did, medical students would ignore the list and use whatever books they think are best.  Generally that means review books written in outline format like the Board Review Series, Pathoma, and the Rapid Review series.  Full-length textbooks are just too long to read when you consider how much information medical students have to learn in such a short time. If you want some textbooks that Harvard students who like using complete textbooks will use (I'm not from Harvard but medical education is the same throughout the U.S.), here's some for the first year of medical school: Clinically Oriented Anatomy -MooreAtlas of Human Anatomy - NetterPhysiology - CostanzoHistology: A Text and Atlas - Ross and PawlinaBiochemistry - Lippincott's reviewEssential Neuroscience - Siegel and SapruGenetics - Thompson (Only if you enjoy pain; there's probably a better book out there but I don't know it)The Developing Human - Moore Once you've read those few thousand pages, let me know and I'll give you a list for second year.  Be advised that you don't learn to be a doctor in the first two years of medical school; you learn to be a doctor during clinical rotations and especially during residency. ",
