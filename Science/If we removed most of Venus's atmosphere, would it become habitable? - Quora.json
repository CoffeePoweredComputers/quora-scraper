            "answer_text": "Well, its not that simple. Yes, Venus is referred to as Earth\u2019s \u201cSister Planet\u201d. In addition to being almost the same size, Venus and Earth are both terrestrial planets with similar in mass and have very similar compositions. As a neighboring planet to Earth, Venus also orbits the Sun within its habitable zone or the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d. And given its similarities to Earth, many scientists believe Venus would be a prime candidate for terraforming. But of course, there are many key difference between the planets that make Venus uninhabitable. The atmosphere of Venus is very dense. It is about 90 times more massive than Earth's atmosphere, containing about 96% of Carbon-di-oxide and 3% nitrogen and a very small amount of water vapour - like 0.003%. On top of this, Venus also has a thick layer of sulfuric acid clouds. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 93 bar - roughly the pressure found 900 meters under the sea here on Earth. (the pressure at Sea level on Earth is 1.01325 bar, translating to little over 1 kg per sq.cm.) The Environment of Venus Earth's axial tilt is 23.50\u00b0 but Venus has a very low axial tilt \u2013 just 2.64\u00b0 relative to the ecliptic. Combined with its slow rotational period and dense atmosphere, this results in the planet having no \"seasons\" and with virtually no variation in its surface temperature. The average temperature at the surface is a sizzling 467\u00b0C. hot enough to melt lead, zinc, tin etc. This may be due to Venus' very slow rotation. A \"day\" on Venus is 116.75 Earth days which is by far the slowest rotation period of any of the major planets**. Therefore the planet experiences extremely long days and nights, which could prove difficult for most known Earth species of plants and animals to adapt to. Furthermore, most of this heat cannot escape back into space because it is blocked by the very thick atmosphere of Venus. The heat becomes trapped and builds up to extremely high temperatures - what we know as the greenhouse effect. Therefore the nights on Venus are as warm as the days. The slow rotation also probably accounts for the lack of a significant magnetic field. ** Some say that a \"day\" on Venus is equal to 243 Earth days, which makes the \"day\" longer than it's \"year\" as it orbits the Sun once in 225 days. To understand this, we need to make a distinction between a \"solar day\" and a \"sidereal day\". A solar day is the time it takes for Venus to rotate about its axis so that the Sun appears in the same position in the sky - like sunrise to sunrise. The sidereal day is the time it takes for the planet to complete one rotation about its axis with respect to the more distant 'fixed' stars. On Earth, the sidereal day is about 4 minutes shorter than the solar day. Combined with its orbital period, the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same point in the sky over Venus - the solar day - works out to 116.75 Earth days, which is little more than a half a Venusian year. A sidereal day on Venus takes a whopping 243.025 days which is the longest rotational period of any planet in the Solar System. Its unlikely that Venus ever had oceans, but even if there were, since the planet has been so hot, all of the water in its atmosphere may have been broken up by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen lost into space. Incidentally, Venus has a retrograde rotation, which means that if you could view the planet from above its northern polar region, it would be seen to rotate in a clockwise direction on its axis - or in Earth terms, it rotates from East to West. On Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Its weird. Considering all this, you will agree, that just by removing most of the atmosphere, Venus does not become habitable. If humans want to live there, some serious ecological engineering \u2013 terraforming \u2013 is needed first. Several scientists have proposed plans to 'terraform' Venus - to reduce the atmosphere, slow down the rotation, and so on, but none have been considered acceptable so far for various technological reasons. (Incidentally, data pertaining to Venus is known as Cytherean - as in Cytherean day, Cytherean year and so on.) To me it appears as if it is a lot easier to terraform MARS. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes if we remove venus sulphurous atmosphere, we can live on it. But the catch is we have to live a few hundred metres above the surface since the surface is too hot and full of volcanic materials. If we are about a hundred metres about the surface all the toxic gas and greenhouse gas concentration will be less and the atmosphere will be manageable to tamper it to human requirements. ",
