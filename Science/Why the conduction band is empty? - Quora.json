            "answer_text": "The conduction band is not always empty. By definition, the valence band is the last band that is fully occupied. The conduction band is by definition the one directly above ( in energy) the valence band. In metals, the conduction band is partially occupied even at 0 kelvin. In semiconductors, the conduction band is empty at 0 kelvin, but can be occupied at higher temperature depending on the energy splitting between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band.

            "answer_text": "The conduction band (if there is one, not all solids have distinct conduction and valence bands.) is not empty at any temperature above absolute zero. However, the number of electrons might be so low that they could be considered non-existent. The number of electrons in the conduction band depends on the material and the temperature of that material. ",
