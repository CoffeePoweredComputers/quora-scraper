            "answer_text": "Thanks Manoj Singhania for A2A The major problem in converting 'Sea/Ocean water' into 'Potable Drinking water' is the economy.Exiting methods of Desalination: RO (Reverse osmosis) \u2014 Uses costly Membrane Technology;Distillation (Evaporation followed by condensation) \u2014 highly energy intensive.Most of large-scale desalination plants generally use RO technique. But, Distillation is widely used on ships for making potable water.  Reverse Osmosis is just a water filtration process which employs a semi-permeable membrane as filter. In this process, oceanic water is pressurized (Pressure > Osmotic Pressure) and is passed through the membrane. Water molecules pass the membrane, but salt and other dissolved solids doesn't. The major obstacles for using RO process are \u2014 Membrane inffluent (i.e, sea water) should have steady flow, Membranes are very costly (that is why RO process is not used on trading ships).  Distillation is evaporation of salty sea water and then condensing the vapor back to liquid state. Evaporation can be done in two ways: Evaporation by Boiling and Flash Evaporation. Now, The Boiling process is further divided, on the basis of condenser's structure \u2014 into two following types: (1) Tube type; (2) Plate type. \u2192 Further research on desalination can help economize the process Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Yes we can. The process is called desalination. Seawater is drawn from the ocean through intake pipes set out in the open ocean or below the seafloor. That water is filtered for bigger contaminants (and some essential tiny sea creatures) before it is sent through a reverse osmosis system that pressurizes the water through membranes, separating out the salt. Now it is perfect for drinking. However the resulting water lacks the essential minerals which are usually present in natural drinking water. So minerals are added to this to make it better. ",

A lot of the water you drink was once sea water, but evaporation (from the Sun shining on the sea) made it into clouds from which water rained down on the earth as \u201cclean\u201d water. In addition we are doing right near my house (well some miles away, but not that far) at the Carlsbad Desalination Plant - 50 Million gallons a day. Carlsbad Desal Plant <<= link to the plant for more information. Places all over the world do it. Atomic subs and aircraft carriers do it too. Some other ships also can make water by using the steam from the boilers or \u201cwaste\u201d heat from the heat exchangers to evaporate the salt water into \u201cfresh\u201d water. ",

You can do this yorself by freezing Salt water. Not in an ice cube tray but in a bowl where liquid water is left under the ice that is where the salt will end up. In ice cubes it will be concentrated in the center of the ice cube. 2 You can evaporate (boil) sea water collect the steam and condense it back into fresh water. 3 you can run the salt water through a reverse osmosis filtration system . the membrane filter is to fine for the salt molecule to pass through but the water molecule will pass through the membrane giving you fresh pure water.

This is due to the fact that there is too much salt dissolved in it. That much salt can be very dangerous for our body. Some countries have started to install large desalination plants near the oceans to purify the water. What desalination does is remove the excess of salt from the water. The issue is desalination is a very costly process and requires a lot of energy to desalinate 1 liter of water. So, although ocean water can be drinkable in present day situation it is very costly. In the future, we might be able to reduce the amount of energy required for desalination or come up with another method to purify ocean water. So, yes, ocean water can be drinkable.

Although the percentage of water on earth is more than the land, most of it is salty water and only a certain percentage consists of fresh, drinking water. But due to rising global warming, the seawater level is rising and it is getting mixed with freshwater causing its quantity to decrease.

Traditionally it has been quite energy intensive using thermal distillation but new more efficient processes such as reverse osmosis have been introduced in recent years. Manufacturers range from GE which makes complete skid mounted systems to many smaller firms. Like electriciy, conservation goes a long way. The correct economic analysis weighs the cost of desalination against the lowest value uses of water which could be addressed in a different way. This approach gives the opportunity cost of the low value uses. Saving 1000 gallons / month by using a sub-soil watering system on a new lawn installation trades against the alternative of a costly ($ and kilowatts) desalination system. If there is another way, desalination should be avoided. ",
