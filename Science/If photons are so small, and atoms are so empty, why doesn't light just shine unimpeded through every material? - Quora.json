            "answer_text": "Atoms are not mostly empty space. This is a misconception propagated by elementary education and is based on a model of the atom (the Rutherford model) that was shown 100 years ago to be false. Electrons in an atom are not solid little balls that orbit the nucleus like planets orbit the sun, with a vast chasm of empty space between the electron and the nucleus. Rather, electrons in an atom are smeared out into wavefunction clouds that fill the entire atom. These clouds (often called \"orbitals\") are not formed simply because a solid little electron is traveling too fast for us to pinpoint it, nor is it formed because we simply don't know where to look to find the solid little election. The cloud is the electron. Electrons are quantum particles, and as such, they are complex beasts that act somewhat like waves (clouds) and somewhat like particles. In a stable atom left to itself, the electrons act mostly like waves. Therefore, the electrons in an atom literally spread out in the wave state to fill the atom, and there is no empty space. But this concept has little to do with why we can see objects made out of atoms. Humans see objects by detecting the visible light that comes from the object. Visible light (red to violet) has a wavelength that is a thousand times larger than an atom. Therefore, when visible light hits an object made of many atoms (e.g. a metal spoon), it is not really interacting with one isolated atom at a time. Light is interacting with many atoms at once. Furthermore, when atoms bond into a solid structure, they don't act like independent atoms anymore. The atoms bond into an integrated structure, and the outer electrons smear out into waves that stretch over many atoms. So when you have sunlight reflect off of your metal spoon and into your eye, allowing you to see the spoon, there is not really a stream of photon particles, each individually interacting with different, separate atoms. Rather, you have photons spread out over the size of many atoms, interacting with electrons spread out over many atoms. You aren't really seeing atoms when you look at an object. You are looking at the bonding lattice of the atoms. That is why carbon can be black when arranged into a graphite lattice and clear when arranged in a diamond lattice. What is this interaction? It is the electromagnetic interaction. Light is a fluctuation in the electromagnetic field, and electrons carry electric charge. Because of their electric charge, electrons can destroy, create, and redirect photons. As far as visible light and everyday objects are concerned, its the outer electrons that are each spread out over many atoms that mostly allow us to see objects. credit: chrisbaird  ",

            "answer_text": "First, Who said that the photon is so small? The photon is a wave-packet of electromagnetic energy. Therefore, a wave packet is not necessarily very small. The experiment showed that a photon takes about 13 nanoseconds to pass through an atom.[1] Due to the speed of light, the length of the photon is about four meters. Secondary, we must change our understanding and imagination of the atom. \u201cThe quarks, leptons, and bosons of the Standard Model are point-like particles. Every other subatomic particle you've heard of is an extended particle. The most familiar are the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus of an atom\u201d. [2]  \"If you magnify an extended particle, it will look bigger. A point-like particle will not change in size, but the more closely you look at it, the stronger the field surrounding it becomes\". [2] \u201cNow extended particles don't have a well-defined surface like a marble does. They're a bit more like the Earth and its atmosphere. The atmosphere of the Earth is thickest near the surface of the Earth and it gets thinner with altitude. So the exact point at which you can say that you are no longer in the Earth's atmosphere is a bit fuzzy, but you can still safely say that the boundary between inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere is 10 or 20 miles straight up. Independent of the exact point at which you say something is inside or outside, extended particles have a size\u201d. [2] In the theory of CPH, all subatomic particles and even photons have a structure.
