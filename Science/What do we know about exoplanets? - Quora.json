            "answer_text": "A lot more than can fit in a Quora post.  Here's some of my favorite trends in the field and factoids.  According to my Exoplanet iPhone app, there are 948 confirmed extrasolar planets.  WAHOO!!! That is quite one large number, especially given the first, 51 Pegasi b, was discovered less then two decades ago. Many planetary systems look quite different than our own.  Our solar system is orderly, many others are quite erratic.  Some Jupiter-type gas giants live so close into their host sun that they are actually evaporating.  Some planets go around their host star in the opposite direction of the stars rotation.   \"Hot Jupiters\", large gas giants that live in close to their host, are often extremely hot and over inflated.  We have managed to gather a surprisingly large host of data about some of these stars.  HD209458b, the first transiting planet discovered, has spectroscopic measurements of oxygen, carbon, and alleged water vapor in its atmosphere.  HD189733b actually has a heat map of its surface!  It also has CO2 in the atmosphere.  More massive stars have a much higher chance of hosting a planet.  This makes sense, because there was more dust to form planets in the region where the star formed.  More metallic stars (which for astronomers means anything other than Hydrogen and Helium) also have a higher chance of hosting a planet.   This is just the start of a very exciting story. ",
