            "answer_text": "In my view \u2014 Social sciences have little to do with the Humanities. Biology is a Natural Science. Although humans are biological entities, that doesn\u2019t make biology a discipline of the Humanities. Biology remains a Natural Science. Humanities include cultural acquisitions, i.e. expressions of the human spirit: e.g. Aesthetics, Ethics, Economics, Commerce, Politics, Rhetoric, Fine Arts, Literature, Music, Drama, Art Criticism, History, etc. Social science, on the other hand, sees Humanity from the outside, as any other Natural science. Social statistics. Group analysis. Group statistics. Institution analysis (objectively). The queen of the Social Sciences is the National Census. Analysis of populations is plausible only on the basis of such social statistics. Yet these do not contribute to the Humanities. We can count how many people are involved in Pop Music, and where they live, and how much money they average, and so forth \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t add one single song to Pop Music \u2014 or even to the fan base. So I conclude: Social sciences belong to Natural Science \u2014 and have little to do with the Humanities. ",
