            "answer_text": "The energy contained in any amount of mass is given by Einstein\u2019s famous mass-energy equivalence equation: [math]E=mc^{2}[/math]. If that amount of mass were converted to energy, perhaps by colliding with a kilogram of antimatter, it would produce [math]E=(1 kg)(3\\cdot 10^{8} m/s)^{2}\\approx 8.99\\cdot 10^{16} [/math] joules. For comparison, the Sun produces approximately [math]10^{26}[/math] joules of energy every second. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why nuclear bombs are so powerful and why nuclear fusion is a potential wonder source of energy, there\u2019s your answer. Matter is incredibly energy-dense.  The Sun utilizes mass-energy equivalence all the time, as the products of its fusion reactions are slightly lighter than the sum of the masses of the reactants. That lost mass is released as energy.

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as complete annihilation. Nothing is created or destroyed but only changes form. (Universal law of conservation of matter/energy.) The *conversion* of one kilogram of hydrogen into energy in a hydrogen fusion bomb would yield an explosive blast equal to 20 megatons (20 million tons) of TNT. ",
