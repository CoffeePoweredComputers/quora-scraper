            "answer_text": "First, understand the meaning of the word \u201cRelativistic\u2019\u2019. A particle is said to be a relativistic particle if it moves with a speed comparable to the speed of light. So, the motion than describes such particles is called relativistic motion. Non-Relativistic motion therefore describes the motion of particles/objects that do not travel with a speed comparable to the speed of light. ",

Simply put, speed measured in thousands kilometres per second. Thus non-relativistic motion is motion with speeds of much lower magnitude, for example kilometres power hour. ",
