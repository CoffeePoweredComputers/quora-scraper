            "answer_text": "The examples? there are so many as to be uncountable so I cannot give you the examples but I can give you some examples. Water, Ammonia, hydrogen fluoride. come to mind as the simplest such molecules with lone pairs. The N in ammonia has 1 lone pair and three bonds (to H). The O in water has 2 lone pairs and two bonds (to H) the F in Hydrogen fluoride has 3 lone pairs and one bond. Notice how the numbers add up to 4 each time. N is tetrahedral, O is tetrahedral and F is tetrahedral in their electron geometry. But the molecule NH3 is trigonal pyrimadal because only three of the four electron pairs have a bond. Water H2O is bent because only two of the electron pairs are a bond and HF is linear. ",
