            "answer_text": "Physical tests Collect and cultivate bacterial and viral samples from your body, and compare to known strains. Assuming use of antibiotics continued, then it is likely you are carrying bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that presents an unreasonably high resistance to most known antibiotics. You should also be carrying several virus strains that show approximately expected numbers of mutations when compared to common modern strains. These are also the reasons you should be quarantined.Examine you for unknown, advanced medical tech, such as artificial organs, joint replacements, stents, and even drugs and antibiotics within your bloodstream, that would be indicative of receiving as-yet-unknown treatment.Take stool samples and samples of your stomach contents to judge what you've been eating. If it contains DNA that implies you've eaten genetically modified plants or animals not known to exist, then that would provide strong evidence for your claim.Examine your own DNA for signs of genetic modification. Examine your physical body for signs of being developed in an artificial womb.Examine any body modifications, such as tattoos, piercings, etc. for signs they were done in a particularly unconventional, or entirely advanced, manner or with such materials.Equally for any counter-evidence, such as vaccination scars for discontinued vaccines and evidence of their existence within your body, unmutated viruses, evidence of outdated surgical techniques, or anything else that is unlikely to occur on someone your age at any point in the future.Non-physical tests Obviously, attempt to establish a known identity. If your fingerprints or DNA are on file, online activity of someone who looks and sounds exactly like you exists, or a doctor immediately runs into the room to apologize about an escaped mental patient, then that's pretty damning evidence against your claim.Measure IQ. While not definitive, especially using a modern IQ test, it is likely you should score higher than the average modern person.Measure emotional response to images, audio, and videos likely to be more triggering to a modern person than someone from the future, such as WWI and WWII scenes, air raid and nuclear attack sirens, religious imagery and the desecration thereof, 9/11 and other recent attacks and disasters, displays of gay affection, etc.Quiz you on events that will likely become the case soon, that you would be expected to know at least most of. Who wins the next US election? In what year does Queen Elizabeth die? Who wins the 2022 World Cup? I would also ask you to describe, in as much detail as possible, any other unusual or niche occurrences you know about that will take place within the following months and years. Naturally this becomes a waiting game, but the more of your answers and predictions become true, especially if they were particularly hard to guess, the more evidence you are being honest emerges.Test technological knowledge in other fields. If I traveled back in time by 48 years, I might not be able to produce a modern computer, but I would be able to explain concepts like epigenetics in a coherent and likely testable manner. If you're capable of giving a similar explanation for a concept not yet explored, especially if it's possible to verify the explanation using modern technology, then that would be strong evidence.",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen this yet. But its obvious: Your clothing. If you are wearing clothes from the future we would expect to see; Better fabrics. Perhaps they will be more environmentally friendly, which will mean the materials within would be more or less the same we have today. However - if you are wearing synthetic materials, we can test those. If those synthetic materials are not existent and cannot be replicated by what we have, it is VERY strong indication you are from the future.Branding. If you had branded clothing, it should be obvious to see which company made your clothes. Company doesn\u2019t, and has never existed in 2020? Clothing is from the future. Note - if say your fabrics are environmentally friendly, this WILL be a tell-tale signal because as of today, major clothing producers are still not that environmentally friendly, which means that it is plausible an environmentally friendly t-shirt from the future will not be made by an \u2018old time\u2019 company.Extremely high quality. A piece of clothing from the future would have been made by better technology, and therefore should be superior to most, if not all, production processes we have.Opposite; Extremely damaged clothing. If you wanted to blend in 2020 society, the clothes that came from 2020 you would wear to do so would not be in good shape, and would likely have many repairs, broken patches etc. An extreme amount of repairs on clothing that otherwise shows normal use, or lack of use indicates it has been around for a long time. This is weaker than other evidence, but it can be used.Clothing styles which don\u2019t match 2020 styles. Future clothing styles will be different to our current ones. If your clothes from 2068 are as futuristic as they should be, then the clothing styles will be different i.e additions to clothing, reductions to some parts of clothing.If you miss all of them - average quality clothing from a company that exists in 2020 which is in average condition that matches current clothing styles, it would be strong evidence you are not from the future. Here\u2019s another one: Foods that you eat. Foods that come from the future will be unlike anything we have today. Signs of genetic modifications in the food you have that are currently non-existent are strong evidence you come from the future.On the other hand, synthetic foods (like chemically made food products i.e milk with large amounts of fortifier) is another sign you are from the future.Branding. If your food is in a container, and is in original packing, a currently non-existent company which made it, or a current company which has not made that product yet, will be strong evidence that it is from the future.If you carried any food with you, this will be a strong sign you are from the future or are from our time period. Finally - Political views on stuff you find important. With expert psychologists that can tell if you are lying through your body language, if you are from the future, we would expect these things: Very different \u2018hot-button\u2019 issues. Our current issues are gun rights, abortion, refugees, immigration, sexuality, climate change and religious freedom. A person from the future will have different views and will consider these unimportant (like how we think slavery is wrong and no one bothers about it), or at the least, will have a different view on them (i.e more drastic measures to fix climate change, or different refugee groups mentioned i.e Swedes) due to a different political climate and different problems. Political views you hold strongly to stuff we don\u2019t really care about would be a sign you come from a different political climate and therefore time period.Views that you consider normal may be extreme in our opinion. I.e state sanctions to those who violate climate agreements might be normal to a person in the future facing climate change but that is extreme in our opinion.Different \u2018hotspots\u2019. Right now, the middle east, specifically Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the South China sea along with the Kashmir region are hotspots where conflict can or is happening. In the future, it is unlikely that these places will still be the same, so instead of thinking that Iraq is a problem, you would instead think that U.S help to a Kurdish state is a problem. In short, problems that don\u2019t exist now are signs you are from the future.Different problematic groups. Groups you may have problems with are likely to be different, i.e you will have a problem with ISIS\u2019 successor Caliphate rather than ISIS itself, which will be a dead group to you. If the groups you mention are not existent, it again, provides evidence you are from the future.If you fail these, it would show that you are just from 2020 and making stuff up. On the other hand, if you meet all of them, you might not be from 2068, but you are from the future at least. ",
