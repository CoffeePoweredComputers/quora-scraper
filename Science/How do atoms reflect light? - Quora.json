            "answer_text": "Photons - Photons are elementary particles which is a pack of electromagnetic energy which emits radiation and is seen as light . Atoms - The atoms consist of protons,electrons& neutrons inside the nucleus , the atoms doesn't reflect light there's a small relation of atoms and photons How is photon formed ? Since the atoms has electrons and other charged particles are in a different orbits , when an atom is energized the electrons in the atom move to another orbit with higher energy level than the current orbit. Whenever the electrons in the higher orbital level falls back to the normal orbit (it's old orbit- from where it excited to another higher level orbit ) the electron emits a photon . \u201cThe electron moves to a higher orbital , when a photon impacts with an atom, i.e., the atom absorbs external energy.\u201d Atoms always emit / absorb they don\u2019t reflect ! Example - a mirror reflects light and it is coated with aluminum foil as the reflecting surface . Even though the aluminium is made of atoms they also absorb some light/photon particles and they emit some radiation (in form of heat ) and the reflecting surface just reflects the incident light ray . Reflectivity is often used to address shininess in physics !! ",

            "answer_text": "Which atoms? Which light? So it\u2019s important to know the relative sizes of light: photons as the light particle and the sizes of whole atoms and nuclei. You can look these up. The thing about the photon isn't the photon itself but what we call the wavelength (which sounds more like a wave than a particle (this is the linguistic problem os duality)). And the term used by physicists, who since Newton, study light (more) is called scattering. So yes, atoms scatter light, and by wavelength no less. Individual atoms are very difficult to photograph, technically, we say we image them. But in the bulk volume of many atoms, the easiest examples of how atoms scatter light are: why the sky is blue, why sunsets are red, why we can sense color (we have evolutionary physiological and psychological aspects of this). So the topics to research are Rayleigh Scattering and Mie Scattering. And they are the function of the size of the particle doing the scattering (not the photon wavelength in-bound). A long time ago, we had this as a test question (open book) but the answer to show was actually much simpler by putting the wavelengths of red and blue line into a function form (f()), and it turned out you could just see a factor of 16 on the amount of scattering (you merely took the factor (product) out and could see how that worked).
