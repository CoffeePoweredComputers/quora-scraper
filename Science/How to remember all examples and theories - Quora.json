            "answer_text": "I once thought Mathematics was One as a purview to the Universe, so there was a great disappointment when no to that and yes to connectivity. And I work on that but when it comes to \u201cexamples and theories\u201d I guess the prevailing wisdom is to remember equations, because you can\u2019t see all and everything at once.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t remember everything. Our long term memory contains those events that interest us in some way. If something grabs our attention, new connections are made between the associated neurons or existing connections are reinforced. When the information is replayed by the hippocampus for the neo-cortex to consider for storage. Weak connections between the associated neurons leads to tentative storage or to the neo-cortex ignoring them. ",
