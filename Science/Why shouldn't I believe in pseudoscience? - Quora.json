            "answer_text": "This is a difficult one, as we first have to establish what we can regard as science and what we must regard as pseudoscience, but there is a third factor, which I call \u201cquasi-science\u201d or something that appears to be a science, but is questionable if looked at rationally. There is also the science of medicine, which, I have discovered, has glaring holes in it. Is dietetics and its companion nutrition, a science? As far as I am concerned, only the practical sciences, that can be measured, weighed and gauged by instruments and be accurately tested in practice, are the real sciences. All the rest are quasi- and pseudo- sciences. The so-called \u201cscientific method\u201d is so flawed as to be laughable, yet certain \u201cscientists\u201d insist that it be employed to validate any claims one makes in their fields. The reason it is flawed is because of the convoluted path it has to take: first a supposition is established. \u201cIf I do this, this should happen.\u201d Now the experimenter is supposed to see if he/she is wrong. Human nature being what it is, the experimenter will do everything to ensure that he/she is right, even if it means cheating and fudging findings, as Ansel Keys did when he convinced everyone to accept the SAD diet as the healthiest diet around. Once the experimenter has made his/her conclusions, the work must be published and reviewed by his or her peers. All well and good, right? Well, in some so-called \u201csciences\u201d, this is exactly the wrong thing to do, because the reviews can only be made by followers of their particular fields and are not open to other disciplines to examine. Let\u2019s take the theory of evolution, paleoanthropology and archaeology as examples here. All are based on assumptions, not on anything that can actually be measured by yardsticks, scales, pressure gauges, wind tunnels, by getting your sister to climb on your back and jumping up and down on it to see if it can take the weight and stress, by setting fire to it, by soaking it in water or in any other practical ways. First off, the whole thing is based on the conjecture that Earth and the universe are of a certain age and that they began with the Big Bang. But, as \u201cscientists\u201d can never agree with another, we have detractors to this idea: Could the Big Bang Be Wrong? - Out There I\u2019ve done a hell of a lot of reading and all I ever see is that the universe is expanding and we know this because everything is moving away from us. This doesn\u2019t make sense, as there must be at least some stuff that is moving towards us from the origin of the \u201cbang\u201d. I don\u2019t accept that we are the very last piece of debris to have left the focus and that is why all is moving away from us. I\u2019m certain that someone will accuse me of being pedantic, but I have come to expect that when no rational answers are forthcoming. Let's leave that be and come down to Earth where nobody has a clue what caused it, but this condition we call \"life\" began. Nobody knows what the hell it actually is, where it originated or how it came about, but they sure as hell can tell you where and how it didn't! Let\u2019s ignore that and concentrate on mankind, shall we? Somewhere in the distant past some creature\u2019s left leg staggered off in one direction to become the primates and its right leg hopped away to become the proto-hominids. Why and how this split in our ancestry occurred can only be guessed, but as the whole bang-shoot is based on postulation, this is perfectly acceptable. Whatever. We are all descendants of some thing that lived a long, long time ago. We did not ascend from this primitive state: we descended from it, according to the \u201cscientific\u201d worthies. Now, every time an archaeologist comes across a tooth or skeleton that looks vaguely human, they brandish it about and yell: \u201cLook! It\u2019s my great-great granddaddy ^x!\u201d Nobody considers that Ug might have come across a cousin seventeen times removed, who was a primitive form of chimpanzee and that they, carried away by the joyous occasion, \u201creunited\u201d in more ways than one \u2026 well, you know how it goes \u2026 and that the skeleton is actually that of their daughter, Lucy. Nobody considers the idea that there was another of the primates that endeavoured to climb up the evolutionary tree, but the branch broke off and they plunged into oblivion. We have such concepts as \u201cinsular dwarfism\u201d that is supposed to explain why Homo Floresiensis and H.Luzonensis are so small, but - hang on a sec: if there was not enough food for their forebears to have survived within those limited confines, would they not have starved to death, leaving nothing behind? How does one apply this to the pygmies of the Congo, the Taron of Myanmar www.firstpost.com \u203a world, the Barrineans in Australia Mbabaram people - Wikipedia and other short races around the world? The whole concept looks very cock-eyed when one looks at this: 20 pygmy animal species from around the world If we look at the monolithic structures and ancient tunnel systems around the world, we discover very similar tool marks, suggesting that disparate peoples had matching equipment, yet they are not supposed to have had any way of communicating with one another. We see cities, tunnels and \u201cshrines\u201d carved out of solid rock, supposedly by primitive peoples using wholly unsuitable tools. The whole thing looks like a farce to me, so am I right to dismiss them and chuck them into the pseudoscience or quasi-science basket? It is only when we can agree upon the definitions of these words that we can decide what we should and what we should not accept as real science and leave the others to squabble among themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Why would you want to believe in pseudoscience? Because the true stuff is scary? If you actually know it to be pseudoscience, then your willingness to claim you believe it is dishonest. Not believing that climate change is occurring here and now or that measures must be taken to forestall the damage that will render the Earth far less habitable for humans as the ecology loses species integral to the food chain, means that future generations will be subject to greater pollution, stronger and more violent storms, less arable land and less potable water, starvation, and shorter lives. Acknowledging the fragility of our future and the future of animal and plant species gives us the impetus to do something about it now. Denial (or preferring to believe that \u201cGod will just take care of us\u201d or presenting a deaf ear to what climatologists are telling us) is jeopardizing our lives and those of our progeny. No, the earth itself will not be destroyed by climate change. But the earth can lose a species called homo sapiens and still carry on, whether we like it or not. Pseudoscience does not help someone who suffers black lung from a lifetime of working in a coal mine. Pseudoscience does not alleviate the suffering of an asthmatic child living near a coal-fired plant. Real science has produced medicines to help the black lung and and asthma sufferers. Imagine if real science were respected by all and used proactively\u2026 ",
