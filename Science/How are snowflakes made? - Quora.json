            "answer_text": " Introduction What a wonderful question to answer considering that the winter season is fast approaching in the Northern Hemisphere. The reason I especially wanted to answer is because I have stumbled upon a possibly overlooked, simple and reasonable new way that snowflakes may form. And I wish to state that this is only ONE possible unexplored mechanism, not the only one. As you can see, they come in many varieties, and my idea applies in one case, though similar processes may explain others.  Snowflakes begin by the crystallization of water seeded by a small particle. Without a particle to begin the process, a super cooled liquid will occur without any crystallization. The effect of a particle on a super cooled liquid is shown below. A piece of dust from the stick begins the crystallization.  This is how the freezing begins, but most are concerned with how the structure forms in the prototypical, ubiquitous hexagonal snow flake. Note how the water froze just as the snowflake forms: the freezing spreads out symmetrically.  A simple explanation is that water crystallizes with a hexagonal structure and that is expressed in the limbs of the snowflake. But this explanation may be too simple. The reason for the spacing and symmetry of these limbs is due to Newton\u2019s third law. For every push there is a push back, with the result of a standing wave, which retains the symmetry of the third law: push=push back. Instead of a further explanation, and to partially dismiss the idea of the crystal structure being the full reason for this shape, we need only look at other fractals.  Fractures and Fractals Both of these words come from the latin word fractura, which means \u201cto break\u201d, but we would hardly call a snowflake\u2019s growth a fracture. However, the pattern in which snowflakes grow is comparable to how ice and other materials crack.  Cracked ice, not quite a snowflake, but close.  Glass fracture  A bullet fracturing on impact.  Balloon breaking into tendrils or limbs. All of the gifs above show the fracturing into symmetical limbs. A force was applied and the symmetry of the forces resulted in a symmetrical fractures. This mirrors the fractal growth of the snowflake.  And now watch what can happen to water upon impact with sand:   Again, the fractures are spread out with even distributions. Though the type of material does play a role, since each material spreads into a different number of limbs, the common thread among them is the symmetry of the matter distibution. And as an important clue for later, the spreading out of matter has important consequences. A New Mechanism for Snow Flake Formation: Collision of Torroidal Vortexes A torroidal vortex is a vortex ring where the the matter spins around the edge not the center.  Well known examples of these are smoke rings:  The pictures to follow are not only beautiful, but they were also a lot of hard work, requiring four years of experimenting to get these shots. As you will probably say, well worth it.    Did you notice the SNOWFLAKE!!!!?????? Of course you did. But what does this have to do with my point, these are gases? The difference between the objects created above and our beloved snowflake is simply the state of matter - ice versus a gas. But when we consider thermodynamics, we know that a rapidly expanding gas cools as it expands (refrigeration) -:think of the ice that forms on a pressurized gas container, such as propane or spray paint. These colliding vortex rings cool after collision because of the expansion. Since water is already super cooled in the atmosphere in the absence of a seed particle, we have everything we need for rapid cooling and freezing post collision. Include a seed and voila a snow flake is born.   The blue and red vortex rings are made by the same machine, therefore the rings spin in the same direction. When pointed towards each other, they are rotating in opposite directions, so upon collision much of their rotation is cancelled. There are still some rotations that occur, as seen in the outer parts of the fractal:  Which seemed to contradict my idea, that is until i found this:  Fractals from rotations. But I think the best way to see this is that the collisions of these vortex rings create many snowflakes, not just one, in a way similar to this  For extremely large vortex rings that could form in a storm cloud, this would create countless snowflakes all at once. Conclusion This is just my opinion on a possible way that snowflakes could be made, but I have no proof other than what is presented. I hope you enjoyed it. Basically, I am open to discussion.

If you think this amount of dust in snow is trivial? Look at the top of a glacier with seasonal melt.
