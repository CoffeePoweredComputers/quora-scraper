            "answer_text": "It is not. Rock salt (from the ground) and sea salt have various other compounds in them. Table salt is not pure NaCl because it has an ant-caking agent in it. Sodium chloride NaCl is a pure substance by definition. Chemists and chemical engineers take salt in its natural form and put it through processes in order to remove unwanted components and get a (nearly) pure substance. This is generally \u201cas pure as necessary\u201d. It happens that salt and sugar (sucrose) are commonly available (by the tonne) at very high purities in the sense of being nearly all one substance, equivalent to high quality laboratory chemicals. Other substances may still be a mixture, but have had some material removed from them, and are said to have been purified, e.g. vodka. ",

            "answer_text": "The word salt is a general word for any ionic compound, specifically a compound formed by the reaction of an acid and a base. In chemistry, compounds are always considered pure substances. However, people colloquially use the word salt to mean table salt, which is a mixture made primarily of sodium chloride, but which contains numerous impurities. If you\u2019re talking about table salt, like the kind you can buy from the store, then that\u2019s a mixture. Let\u2019s recap: sodium chloride is a compound \u2014 specifically, a salt \u2014 and is therefore a pure substance. Table salt is a mixture that contains sodium chloride and various other compounds. ",
