            "answer_text": "The vibration of atomic particles, including electrons and nuclei, is a quantum phenomenon.  That is, there are discreet energy levels of vibration with no \"in between\".  So, an electron in the \"electron cloud\" around the nucleus of an atom, (typically an electron whose ground state is in the highest energy level of that cloud) will jump to a higher level of vibration (a higher energy level), when it receives energy from outside the atom (either from absorption of a photon or from receiving kinetic energy from another atom which enters then leaves that atoms electro-magnetic field).  The change in vibration level is like the change in pitch (i.e. vibration rate) of a guitar string when you change frets.  It is not like the change of pitch of a violin string when you slide your finger from one position to another. Recent research has also found that the atoms on the surface of a solid object vibrate at specific rates (frequencies), but not at rates in between.  Of course, the temperature of the object is a measure of the average vibration rate of the molecules which are in contact with the measuring device. ",

If you're interested in a visual representation of what an atom \"looks\" like and exactly what a vibration of an atom can appear like - try the Hydrogen Atom Applet and the Atomic Dipole Transitions applet on this website. It's a real gem if you want pictures to see how some basic quantum physics and wave mechanics works. Math, Physics, and Engineering Applets (Paul Falstad) ",
