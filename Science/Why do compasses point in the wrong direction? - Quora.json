            "answer_text": "If your compass points in exactly the wrong direction, someone has been playing with it using a magnet and managed to re-magnetize the needle the wrong way around. If it just points in a somewhat wrong direction, there may be a mass of ferrous metal close by, or you haven\u2019t accounted for the local magnetic declination. ",

In terms of where is the Geographical North Pole it is not pointing in the wrong direction. Like magnetic poles repel, unlike attract. ",
