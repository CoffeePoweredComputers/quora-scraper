            "answer_text": "By volume, exhaled CO2 is about 5%. If you combine that with the fact that the majority of exhaled breath is going to go out of the mask. Only a very small volume remains in it and when you breathe in, whatever CO2 is there gets diluted. Unless you are exhaling into, and rebreathing from, an air-tight bag, you will not significantly increase your inhaled CO2 from wearing a mask. Some masks include an exhalation valve to make it easier to exhale. The problem with these is that they may protect you from inhaling virus-laden droplets, but they will not protect others from your exhaled breath if you are infected. So you could infect others which defeats one goal of wearing a mask in the first place. Most healthcare facilities will not allow a mask with an exhalation valve to meet the requirement for wearing a mask - they will likely offer you a mask to replace it while you are in the facility and ask that you change to it.

            "answer_text": "The volume behind the mask is about as large as a shot glas, i.e. 20 ml. Relaxed breathing is about 500 ml, and, unless you keep air for a long time, you breathe our air with about 4% CO2. So even if we assume that there is no exchange of air, the mask reduces your O2 intake by 0.8%. Which is much less than usual vatiations in air pressure. So if you suffer from negative effects due to.a mask, you should rush to the hospital, because you couldn't survive the next low-pressure area. Also the body constantly monitors CO2-level. It is not lack of oxygen that makes us breath, but too much CO2. So unless your respiratory centre does not work, any change in CO2 is countered by increasing depth and frequency of breathing. You can perform 200W over a longer time, which means the respiratory centre can deal with triple the normal demand, not just a measly percent. ",
