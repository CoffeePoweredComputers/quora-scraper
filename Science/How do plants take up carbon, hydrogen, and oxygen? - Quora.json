            "answer_text": "Plants take up carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) from atmosphere in the presence of light at the time of photosynthesis. Plants take up hydrogen and oxygen from soil in the form of water. They also take up oxygen in the form of O2 from the environment in the absence of light at the time of respiration. ",
