            "answer_text": "The structure of N2H2 will be H-N=N-H with a lone pair of electrons on each N. About each N will be a total of 6 bonding electrons (2 sigma + 1 pi = 3 pairs of electrons) and 1 lone pair of electrons. However, if you are asking to determine the shape of the molecule, then the count is slightly different since multiple bonds are treated as single bonds. If it is for the purposes of determining the shape using VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion), then about each N will be 1 lone pair and 2 bond pairs, resulting in a \u201cbent\u201d shape about the N atom.
