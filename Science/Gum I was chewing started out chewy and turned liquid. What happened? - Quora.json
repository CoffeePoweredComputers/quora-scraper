            "answer_text": "The only time I recall that happening to me was when I would eat something with the gum. For example, peanuts together with the gum and the gum would become liquidy. It was an interesting sensation and I don't recall if I then spit out the whole mess or just swallowed it. I was young and foolish in those days so I probably swallowed it and I probably ate nuts to deliberately stimulate the gum to go into that fluid state! ",
