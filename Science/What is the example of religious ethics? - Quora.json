            "answer_text": "Higher religions have remained inseparably related to morality. For example : Judaism and Christianity have accepted the Ten Commandments and the last five are virtually the same as the Pancha mahratna of Jainism. Thus religion and morality are inseparable and interdependent. Interdependent means that religion helps morality and morality in turn keeps on refining religious demands. Example- Tribes in Garo Khasi hills gave up head hunting after their embracing Christianity. Now they respect their neighbours. Religious development has been greatly helped by the deepening of moral insight. Example : Growth of Judaism did not emphasize the cruel rite of animal-sacrifice. The lord was said to be better pleased with the practice of justice, mercy and with a contrite heart. Rigvedic Aryans were persuaded to give up animal sacrifices and accepted doctrine of brahman. Religion with its derivative of 'Religare' means to bind its adherence together and also to end of lower impulses within each man himself. Hence morality includes both external and interiorized rules of conduct. Both in Christianity and Hinduism the emphasize is laid on the interiorized of morality in the direction of self- conquest and the self-culture of soul. ",
