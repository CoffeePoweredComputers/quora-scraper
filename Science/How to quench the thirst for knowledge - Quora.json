            "answer_text": "I dont trust Wikipedia as they dont provide the full details of a persons life or the ideas he inputs . I read their autobiographies or interviews, sometimes if i can talk to them in certain situations i also try to do that . Autobiographies are the best way to have knowledge or just talking to a person and listening to what they have to say ! Guess what our parents were right all the answers are in books , the internet provides information in which a certain person can gain attention from like minded people , i want the full blown picture regardless of any association! After all the knowledge it is you who has to put it in perspective. All i m saying is you need to have enough understanding of how people do what they do , to understand how everything unfolds . But with all these you'll be able to satisfy you thirst but it still keeps wanting more . ",

            "answer_text": "For me the source is reading. I read a lot of non-fiction and I believe that books are filled with abundant knowledge and you can widen your knowledge base with their help. Even if I'm browsing internet, I look for e-books or websites where I can get to know about any knowledgeable stuff. Reading books helps me have thorough knowledge about any topic and at times it even aroused the curiosity to dig deeper and gather more information. ",
