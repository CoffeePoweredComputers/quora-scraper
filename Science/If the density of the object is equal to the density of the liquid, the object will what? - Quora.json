            "answer_text": "If the density of the object is equal to the density of the liquid, the object when placed in the liquid would have neutral buoyancy. The object when placed in the liquid would sink until it was submerged and then would only move up or down if acted on by forces other than buoyancy. If the object was irregular and trapped air bubbles and the bubbles were of lower density than the liquid, the bubbles would buoy the object up, but if the bubbles came off, the object would return to neutral buoyancy. If you pushed down on the object it would move downward until stopped by friction.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm, Good question. If an object is less dense than the fluid it is in, the object will float. The volume of fluid the object displaces is actually smaller than the volume of the object itself. Therefore, part of the object will rise above the surface of the fluid. Think about an ice cube placed in water. The ice cube floats, and part of it sticks up above the water. I have never ever come across what will happen, but I did see a video about what happens if the density of the object is equal to the density of the liquid, then it would float partially, with part of the object submerged. However such occurrences are very rare. ",
