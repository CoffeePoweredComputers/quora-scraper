            "answer_text": "I used to make good money in highschool. You can always recycle for a few extra bucks, your school should be a good start. I was also lucky enough to have parents that could afford to give me an allowance, but I did have a long regular lists of chores that if I didn't complete something, I didn't get paid. I don't just mean for that chore, i mean I didn't get any of my allowance until everything was done and done rite. But in highschool your expenses just keep piling in, so I had started my own simple handyman yard care business. It only took a few flyers in the rite locations, a couple neighbors I knew that could use the cheap labor and then I let my work do the rest. As soon as I had a couple houses a day(say 2 to 5hrs) for 5 to 6 days a week I took down the flyers and I was making a cool 100 to 200 a week cash in my pocket. I would take on jobs I knew I could handle, and only people that let me use there tools and lawn equipment. That way I didn't have to haul them or come outta pocket to replace any tools. Some of my loyal regulars were only an every other week job but it would be 6 to 8 hrs every other week, and I charged most people then $5 an hour. I believe minimum wage was 5.75, maybe 6.25 at the time so I was cheap but I worked hard, efficiently and nonstop. The people at the every other week job liked me so much that they gave me a raise to I think like $8 an hour so I was making like 50 to 120 a month just off them. Just remember that while having a job is great experience and shows maturity in you at such a young age, you need to never let work or making money get in the way of school, your education and earning your diploma is most important. Your only job as a kid is to really go to school and learn. Don't take that lightly because you will only go as far as what you know In this life. Yes I did graduate, from a decent highschool, with a graduating class of 5000 students, maintained a 3.31 GPA while lettering 4 years for the schools nationally recognized baseball program and held down the yard business for 2.5 years until I graduated and went to a local community college in the area. So just use your youth and imagination and you will find some decent ways to make some dollars. Work hard while you can and good luck to you! ",

            "answer_text": "I love it! It makes me feel so excited when someone is interested in making money so young. While others are thinking about getting wasted and get girls, there are some smart ones trying to be a few steps forwards. When I was in high school, I wasn\u2019t popular at all. I was considered good looking and in good shape but other friends had more luck with girls than me. It wasn\u2019t because I was not good with girls, it was because I wasn\u2019t that focused on that. Of course, I wanted to get laid but I also wanted to make a lot of money and make all the girls come to me and beg for my time. While others spent their free time in the common area socializing, I used to spend my free time at the computers figuring out ways to make money, create websites, learn, etc. Believe me! Just by the fact that you are making this question, you are already making a big difference and you have an advantage among other people on your age. What You Focus Expands! Remember that, because if you focus on creating a business and making money you will do it sooner or later. Now, before you jump directly on whatever anyone else here is recommending you to do. I will tell you something I wish someone would have told me when I was in high school: Create an audience. That\u2019s the first thing you have to do, build your audience because if you build an audience you can sell or create anything and you will already have someone to sell it to. Find something you are passionate about and create content about that topic: cars, gadgets, books, travel, makeup, clothes, food, whatever you want that you like and that you could talk about for hours. Create a Youtube channel, Instagram account, Twitter, Facebook page, Pinterest and post original content about the topic you like. I would suggest YOUTUBE because creating videos is original and provides value by the content you share, plus Youtube Partner Program will pay you for the views. Look at this kid: A 7-year-old boy is making $22 million a year on YouTube reviewing toys He makes $22 million talking about toys that he likes. Do you think you can do the same? If a 7-year-old kid can do it, I am sure you can do it. In fact, everyone can do it.  Then why not everyone is doing this? Why not everyone is making millions? Simple! Because people want everything fast, here, right now. They don\u2019t want to work making 100 videos earning $0 and waiting until they get some views. No, they want to make one video and suddenly become famous and millionaire. And that\u2019s not very likely. It can happen but usually, it doesn\u2019t. What you can always count on, it\u2019s that if you take action every day and you are patient you will get it. So, let\u2019s go back! BUILD an audience. Provide content and once you have the audience you will be able to sell them whatever you want related to your niche. When I started building my audience I thought \u201cI will make one hundred videos if I have at least 100 views per month in each one of them (which is very low), I will have 10,000 views\u201d. \u201cMmm, it\u2019s not enough. Then I will make 500 videos and expect 1000 views in each one of them. Then I will have 500,000 views! That\u2019s a bigger number, I can do something good with that.\u201d The truth is that I have videos with 5 million views and I only have 99,000 subscribers and barely 100 videos. But hey, now I have sponsors and Youtube pays me per views and I have an audience listening what I recommend or say to them. I can recommend a product and get commissions from every sale. So, my recommendation is to start a Youtube channel and an Instagram account. Use them to provide content and earn followers or subscribers. If you start now, and you upload content every week, you will start making money in less than a year because of the Youtube Partner Program. If you upload content more often you grow faster. The best part is that you don\u2019t need money or investment to start doing this. If you have a webcam or a smartphone you can use it to record videos. You don\u2019t know what kind of content? The kid was reviewing toys. You can review products you use or you like. SIMPLE! After you build your audience, a whole new world of possibilities to create income will open for you. Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Be the candy man. I was the candy man in high school. Made great money. $100 day almost. Carried around a duffle bag full of candy in one half and my books on the other. Go to Sams club and buy packs of popular candy such as skittles, m&m, extremes, honey buns, etc., they should be on average around $5 a box of 12. That\u2019s $7 profit if you sell everything for $1 which you should. Don\u2019t make it $1.35 because nobody in high school carries change. Everybody has a dollar or can get a dollar. NEVER give out any freebee\u2019s, IOU\u2019s, or \u201cI\u2019ll pay you later\u201d. Money upfront or no candy, plain and simple. Not even to your best friends. This is a business, be about your money. Discounts: It\u2019s up to you if you want to do a sale where you lower your prices. One reason you may want to is to get rid of old inventory. Maybe you\u2019ve had the last bit of candy you\u2019ve been trying to get rid of and nobody has bought in the last couple days. You could do a $.50 flash sale to get rid of your inventory so you can re-up your stock with new supply. (I rarely did this. I usually just stuck to my guns and kept everything at a dollar.) Once or twice I\u2019ve had smushed honey buns or big texas\u2019 that nobody really wanted that I would let go for .50/.75. Only carry what you need. If you carry EVERY piece of candy you have, and your not 100% on top of your stash at all times, you WILL get robbed. Keep the rest at home or, if you know you\u2019ll need more within the day, keep it in your locker. (Another note, Dont locker share! Don\u2019t give out your locker combo, EVER!) School Rules: For The life of me and my entrepreneur mindset, I to this day still don\u2019t know why the school system frowns upon entrepreneurship. In many schools it is against the \u201crules\u201d to sell candy to other students. Why you may ask? I have no clue. The school sells candy though. Idiots. I remember I was on my way to the cafeteria one day to get ready for a field trip. I stopped by my friends class (also my partner at the time) to give him some inventory to sell off. The security lady saw us and said stop right there. Give me the candy. Part of me wanted to run but I knew better lol. She said give it to me or we can go to the principles office. In hindsight, I should have gone to the principles office because I never saw that candy again. She claims she threw it away\u2026. Yeah right. The Lessoned learned was money can be losses but are you really gonna get in trouble for selling candy? And if you do, would your parents really be mad about that? If I could do it over again I would choose detention over giving up my stash every time. There\u2019s still other students you can sell candy to in detention and you get to get out of class haha! Accounting Books: Keep track of how much you spend on inventory and how much you get back. By the count of how many pieces of candy you have total, you should know exactly how much cash you should have. If you didn\u2019t do any sales and the numbers aren\u2019t adding up then where did that money go? Also don\u2019t keep all of the money you make in your pockets all day long. Professional pick picketers start off in high school lol. Put in your locker and never come to school with money. If someone ask for change tell them to come back after a class or two when youve made some sales. The money you get, make sure to keep it in a secure place, like a hidden pocket in your bag or a pocket on your clothes that zips up. People WILL try to rob you. Be smart! Biggest RULE!! DONT SPEND THE MONEY YOU MAKE!! If you go spending the money you made today to go buy some extra snacks at lunch, or go buy some cool toy that you won\u2019t use a year later, you\u2019re losing money you can use for better things. Would you want to see $100 or would you want to see $1,000? Would you want to hold $1,000 or would you want to hold $2,000? Learn from my mistake. I spent all that money, which I now realize was almost a full time income on stupid things that I now no longer use. They were fun but they didn\u2019t make me any money and I ended up being broke\u2026. Again. Goal: what\u2019s your goal? Are you just trying to make some extra money to have money to spend on stuff? Are you trying to raise money to buy or pay for something specific? Or are you trying to start a business which will keep making you good money? If you don\u2019t have something specific that you\u2019re raising money for, I recommend saving EVERY last dollar you make and invest ALL of it into something that\u2019s going to make you even more money than what selling candy makes you. Thats entirely another topic to get into for another time. It\u2019s much easier to start a business when you are still a dependent with no bills and your parents are taking care of you. (Besides credit, again, another topic) If starting your own business appeals to you, think about becoming an entrepreneur. You can still go to school, get a degree and start a career, and you can still start your own business and fire your boss and not ever use your degree again. Depends on what you want in life and how you want to live. If so, once you start making money and you have your first $1,000 saved, look into other ways to make money. Just a few examples a lot of young people can get into are: Shopify, Amazon, YouTube, clothing brands, etc. Find what appeals to you, what you think you could do on a regular basis and what you would need to start AND become successful. Always do research. Good luck. If you follow this guide I promise you can make $100 a day. ",

            "answer_text": "Trust me there is no easy way to money, If someone tells you a certain website pays you something like clicking ads or surveys or anything which can be done quickly and easily, take it straight away as a scam. However it\u2019s not completely impossible to earn money easily online or offline. Let me start by explaining what is money: In the ancient times when there was no money people used to trade something they had for a thing they wanted which somebody else had. for example- a fisherman would trade fishes he caught for the grain a farmer grew. As a person had limited time and energy as well as skill to do a certain work he/she would do excess of that work and barter the products to other people. moral: it is the time and energy people trade for the things they want. the Money or bucks which came later into existence as the civilizations grew and became a way to store the value of time and energy you spent to be used later, which made life easier. Now the fisherman mentioned above could sell his fishes for money to be used later to purchase something else to a trader who in turn will sell the fishes in a market for some extra profit. moral: the fish trader used money to work for him without having to catch fishes. Thus money made markets, and markets made life easier. You must be thinking.Stop your blabbering and tell me How do I earn money!! In fact i have answered your question. If you want to make money Think how can you make somebody\u2019s life easier with whatever skills or time you have to spend. the formula goes like this Time = money, and Skill* time = (the rarity of skill * money) This applies to the whole world, why does a CEO of Google earns millions working for the same no. of hours compared to an average guy at McDonald's. It is because the skill that these CEO\u2019s possess is very rare and has come to them with practice and patience. Let me simplify this, with the example of same fisherman, He has been working hard and catching fishes daily and selling them for money enough to buy him grains. this way he has to work everyday, one day he got sick and couldn\u2019t catch any fish. that day he had to go hungry. This taught him an important lesson that if he continues to catch the same no. of fishes and got sick for a week he would starve to death. so he used his mind for planning ahead, and didn\u2019t catch fish one day and went hungry, however with whatever energy he had left he made a net to catch more fishes the next day. Now he was able to catch more fishes and sold them for more profits, he saved this money and bought a canoe, now he could go deeper into the river and catch bigger fishes. He became a Millionaire later on. The Net in the story is not just a net its an asset. An asset is something which earns money for you. Let me tell you how you can build your own nets or assets, But a word of caution, Its a hard work to create an asset which could earn sufficient money for you. But YES IT CAN BE DONE. Some Assets you can create with very less or no investment except for Time and sweat. A blog : ever wondered how many times you have searched for something very obvious like \u201c How to make money\u201d on Google and came across a post telling you how to. Then you have already encountered a blog. and the moment you clicked on that blog post someone out there earned money. If you want to learn how to make a blog you can learn it from scratch at ShoutMeLoud - Shouters who inspire . Its not my blog or not that i am getting paid for writing this post, its just the best I found out there.An E-book: Have you ever written a short story for an assignment or project that was liked by your mates and teachers. Then you can easily write a short book. It could be fiction, fantasy or any genera, whatever you like. Now a days its not tough to publish and e-book as the websites like Draft2Digital | Welcome and Kindle E-reader \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Amazon Official Site do it for free for you. Obviously they take a small amount as commission after you make a sale but you still retain 60\u201370% of the earnings with you. You just have to focus on writing a good story that people may want to read.There are other options as well but pretty investment heavy. You can contact me anytime and i\u2019ll feel happy to help.

            "answer_text": "First of all, good on you for working on your financial situation at such a young age. Keep it up and it will get you quite far. Now let\u2019s answer your question. Since you\u2019re so young, I\u2019ll just assume that you are quite tech-savvy and familiar with social media and everything digital. That\u2019s one of the best tickets for your success. Digital Marketing Number One. Learn online marketing. Essentially it doesn\u2019t take too much time to learn how to market something really well. For example, you can learn social media management and try some collateral pages in order to make them go super popular. There are tons of educational material on the web, like on Udemy and Skillshare. The great thing about this is that you won\u2019t have to sit at an office all day and most of the employers look for young people in these positions, so you have a nice advantage there. Once you practice on your accounts save them for your portfolio and then start freelancing. Freelancing is as easy as it gets these days. You can just sign up on Fiverr or UpWork. But make sure to have a nice profile, with relevant information. Like your education, some certificates, the work you\u2019ve done and your skills. Some of these websites actually offer you test so that you can increase your credibility, take them. All in all, within a few months you\u2019ll have learned digital marketing established a nice profile and also a good portfolio for a beginner. Dog Walking This is a super easy field. It doesn\u2019t require any skills or experience. All you have to do is love dogs and be an outside person. There are numerous apps that make it possible to find potential clients in your area. Clients who don\u2019t have enough time to walk their dogs themselves, so you can offer your services after school. At first, the pay isn\u2019t going to be much, but the more dogs you walk in a day the more you\u2019ll make. I think it\u2019s easy to make like $20 an hour with this hustle. You can use apps like Wig! and Swifto, to find potential clients. however, this may prove unreachable as most of these apps are US exclusive. If you\u2019re outside of the US, use your marketing skills that I mentioned earlier and grab some clients yourself. It\u2019ll build up your portfolio even more. E-Commerce You can also make an online shop. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a website, you can just create it on multiple platforms, even on Facebook. Make sure to research what platforms are mostly visited in your country and try to establish it there. So how does E-Commerce work? it\u2019s pretty much like re-selling stuff you buy in a bunch from abroad. It could also be something that you\u2019ve made yourself, but it needs to be relevant. For example, you can just buy a bunch of similar items from Alibaba, have it shipped to your location and sell it for a profit. You\u2019ll also find the marketing skills handy that we\u2019ve already talked about. Writing If you know English very well, you can become a freelance writer. It doesn\u2019t require too much time to get into it. You just sit there, write some articles, then review them and catch some mistakes which you can improve immediately. Usually, people pay per article, which could be about 1,000 words. If the topic is new to you it would take you 2 hours maximum to do the research and write it. Usually, when writing freelance, it helps you get in touch with Keyword research. This is very important for your marketing skills down the line as good Keywords mean that Google is going to pay attention to you. If you get an order for an article that the client will use for their blog, make sure to implement some keywords. For example, the topic is about how chocolate is made. Some keywords would be: How is dark chocolate made? How is milk chocolate made? How chocolate is made step by step. These are connected to the same idea but are the words that someone may type in the Google search. Get good at writing and keyword research and you\u2019ll become one successful writer. Hope I was able to help you with some examples. Keep the attitude you have now and you\u2019ll definitely have some form of success. Stay awesome! ",

            "answer_text": "This probably isn\u2019t going to be the answer you want to hear but it is truthfully a very easy way to earns one money. Go out and get a job at your local grocery store. \u201cBut why a grocery store?\u201d you ask. And to that I tell you that grocery stores are great for a couple of reasons. The first more applies to the question and that is because tons of teenagers work at grocery stores, meaning that they have a lot of employees who have very specific times they can work. This works great for you because due to having so many employees, you can tell them when you want to and don\u2019t want to work and it will generally be okay. Another reason? It\u2019s VERY easy to get recognition for your hard work. In a group of teenage employees, you won\u2019t find much effort and excitement for work, so your hard work will stand out, get you noticed by management, and possibly even promoted. \u201cBut how do you know that these are possibilities?\u201d I know that both of those things are easily achievable because I have done them. When I first started working at a grocery store, I pushed carts in the dead of winter for six hours a night. Eventually my hard work outside was noticed and I was brought in to do some bagging and stocking inside, and eventually that got me to the point that I was offered a position in another department, one that is comprised of all full time adults, aside from me, a teenager who showed enough competence to work alongside adults and provide value. I\u2019ve been able to earn a lot of money, friends, and experience through this, and I strongly suggest you go about it this way as well until you can figure out what you want. Best of luck! ",

I had a friend who was so great at Computer Science, he was known in my entire school for that to an extent that even the teachers would ask him to tutor their child and he actually did that for $10/hour.Do people\u2019s homework. You can suggest doing your classmates\u2019 homework for them. But you gotta be careful to make sure it doesn\u2019t look like your own and that the person who\u2019s homework you\u2019re doing is a big mouth or else you\u2019ll get into trouble with the teachers and the deans.Sell snacks. I remember my friends would by a bunch of types of chips packs, keep them in their sports bags and then sell them for $1 each. Not bad considering a pack of 20 of those chips bags would cost around $10, so you\u2019d get your money back and make profit.Internships: Even while in high school you can definitely get an internship. Talk to a career counselor and see if your high school has such opportunities. If not in high school, they will likely know of some opportunities outside. Never hurts to ask, or simply google.Part time job: You can definitely find a part time work opportunity around your school area. At a grocery store or a food restaurant. Employers will be likely to accept youngsters like you with no experience or degree necessary.",

Tutoring: Most time in schools, students spend learning a different subject like maths, physics, chemistry and many more. So if you are good at any subject you can teach it to other students or your juniors. if you are good at any hobby or skills like musical instruments, painting, art &craft, Calligraphy then you teach it, to other people in your school or on the internet like on youtube, udemy, and on any tutoring sites.School Projects and Activities: In School, many projects and activities are given to students on vacation, holidays and during exams which they don\u2019t want to do and Even Small kids in school get difficult projects which they can\u2019t complete themselves so their parents had to work for them. So you can earn by completing their projects. and can make good money.Handmade Craft Selling: You can sell handmade art & craft, home decor item or any famous art piece of your locality on e-commerce sites. For Selling, you will need your parents to Support because in India to sell online GST number is required.Sell your Notes and Old books: Toppers Notes and old books are always in great demand in schools so if you are Topper of class then you can earn good money by selling your notes and old books to your juniors.

            "answer_text": "There are a few ways to do this. The easiest way is to find a job. Plan a budget, and put X amount to the side toward your car. When you have enough, take the money out (or use debit) and get your car.Start an Online Business. The fastest way is to combine options 1 and 2. Get a part time job, budget your paychecks. Put X amount towards an online business (make sure you will have time to concentrate on school, your job, and your business BEFORE doing this). This method will not only give you the money for your car quicker than options 1 and 2 alone, but you will also be building a residual income for yourself that you can use to help pay for college or do it full-time after high school as your career.When I was in school, I had a part-time job in a supermarket. But I didn't know there was such a thing as online businesses. The internet was still relatively new and I didn't use the computer much (the connection was\u2026dial-up). Otherwise I probably would have gone into online business earlier, but that's me. I tried a lot of different ventures, including a franchise and 2 MLM's. As I said above, if you're interested in online business, only choose option 3 if you can manage all the work hours between a part-time job and your business and still be able to concentrate on school. A cars a cool thing to have, and setting up residual income through your own business is exciting; but don't jeopordize your education for cool and exciting. You may not realize it today, but 10yrs from now you will see how important that education is. Trust me on this one. Thank you for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Selling coke.  Pictured above is the boat loads of sugar you\u2019ll find in a can of coke. When I was in high school, the only canned beverages the cafeteria sold were iced tea or juice (e.g., Brisk). Not only that, but the price was exorbitant! 2 dollars for one can\u2026 So I realized there was a lot of free market space for me to start a \u201cbusiness\u201d. I asked my parents to buy me a pack of 24 cans of coke, and started selling them at lunch for 1 dollar each. People were getting an incredibly good deal: a drink they like way more than the drinks at the cafeteria, for half the price. I didn\u2019t spread the word around too much, not only because I was kinda shy, but also because all \u201cfinancial activities\u201d were prohibited by the school\u2019s code of conduct. Still, even with that, I was making a nice profit at 60 cents per can sold, which was enough for me to drink a can of coke each day and still be making money. If I didn\u2019t fear the code of conduct so much, I could have rapidly up-scaled my coke empire and started making 50 to 100 dollars per week, if not more. After all, the demand for sugar is pretty damn high amongst high school students, seeing as they have so little self control. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many alternatives to make money on the internet. The question is how much money do you want to make online. The definition varies from one to another. Take Surveys OnlineYou can try to make money by taking survey online. However, it is not possible to make a living by filling up surveys and you will not be able to make a sustainable income. However, it is the simplest and the most straightforward way to make money online as it does not require any special skills and qualification. Below you can find a list of legitimate paid survey sites you can sign up. Pinecone ResearchPaidViewPointOpinion OutpostSwagbucksiPollVivaticGlobal Test MarketMySurveyiPanelIpsosHowever, there are pros and cons making money through paid survey sites. Pros:Easy and straightforwardYou do not need any special qualificationFree and you do not need to have special toolsYou can participate and take surveys anywhere you wantAll you need is a laptop/ smartphone and internet connectionCons:Small rewards from taking surveys. It is possible to make $5 per month if you work extremely hardEasily get screened out in the middle of the surveyLose all rewards after expiration durationIt does not allow you to make a sustainable income. You need to constantly participate in taking surveys every day.Affiliate MarketingAlternatively, you can become an affiliate marketer. I graduated as an engineer and after years of working 9-to-5, I got fed up with the routine work and decided to do something else that could earn me an opportunity to spend quality time with my family and make extra cash. I started as a blogger and expected to make some extra cash like anyone else. To my surprise, it turned out well where I made more money than what I could as an engineer. My preferred way is to become an affiliate marketer because it allows me to make a lucrative and sustainable income through blogging. You can easily make $300 - $500 per day by becoming an affiliate marketer. To make money from blogging (affiliate marketing), First, you need to find your niche. A niche means a target or a subject that you are going to write about. A niche can be your interest, a hobby or a skill. Any subject can be your niche, for example, people blog about collecting match boxes, bug photography, work-out program, or even daily political scandals and etc. Remember one thing is when you are finding your niche, avoid being too broad with your selection. For example, do not blog about Work Out Tips and Motorbike at the same time. Both of them fall on different categories and they just can't simply be put together. You could do a post about your niche (e.g. camera, guitar, trekking) and include affiliate links to any paid ones (e.g. Amazon or ShareASale). Create great content is not enough to make a lucrative income online today. You will have to make use of social media platform to promote your content and drive traffic to purchase items via your product reviews. My site earned my $7,000 within six months. Of course, I worked extremely hard at the beginning and success did not happen overnight. I spent almost 5 hours per day after work to make it worked. As my site matures, I spend 1 to 2 hours every day writing, optimizing my site, connect to social media and reply readers' emails. The best thing is the earning potential doesn't stop there and the revenue growth is still climbing up every single day (provided I publish articles regularly). At the time of writing, my site is making 5-figure revenue every month. Anyway, my answer is if you're passionate about a subject and you have decent writing skills, blogging definitely could be an alternative career path for you to make a living. All you need is to become an affiliate marketer. You will also find the pros and cons working as an affiliate marketer. Pros:The earning potential is enormous due to the exponential growth of the internet usersIt allows you to make sustainable income onlineIt allows you to quit your nine-to-five job and allow you to spend quality time with your familiesIt is a legitimate online businessThere are many affiliate programs on the internet you can participate (e.g. Amazon, ShareASale, Apple, FreeflyVR)Cons:It requires a lot of effort and timeYou need to blog from time to time (constantly publish content)You need to learn how to do affiliate marketingYou can\u2019t do it alone. It requires mentor-ship. You can do it alone with trial and error method but it takes a while to figure out the methodologyEasy to get scammed as a newbie as there are many so called internet Guru out there to steals your money and only deliver empty promises.I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. For example, everyone is talking about virtual reality now. If you are interested in VR and you blog about, I believe there will be a huge potential in making good money from it. Note: Freefly VR offers affiliate program to earn commission. So, my answer to your question - become a blogger/ affiliate marketer. Hope the answer helps. Regards Alex Founder of ManagingYourFinance.Com ",

Lots. Of. Jobs. But there is one job that is nearly always killin' it, giving me twice the amount of money of my best steady job - being a Santa Claus. You can do this only once a year, but if you are hired by companies and can visit around 12 families, boy does it pay out! Most often some sort of service is provided in your local area, or you can ask families by yourself and promote your service. Do not forget the Chrismas rules 1.) Santa never drinks, nor does he smoke or eat.2.) Keep a bell by your side as doorbells are for the mere civilians.3.) Keep chocolate in your bag because people want to make photos from you and demand presents.4.) Longboard>Bike, way quicker to go from a to b and you can put it easily into every staircase.5.) Golden book, black boots, white beard. There are no alternatives. Do it. I had the best Christmas last year by bringing joy to twelve families, doing around 40 pictures with strangers (Santa on a longboard <3) and made good money. HoHoHo! ",

I have listed some examples for each area. There are infinite ways you can make money, and people are thinking up new and creative ways everyday. You need to find something that works for your lifestyle, and allows you to keep enjoying your teen years.

            "answer_text": "The website that I use to bring in around 100$/week as a high school student is Earn.gg, which is a website with various features such as gambling, watching videos, and taking surveys for free. In the website, you can do a couple different things. The most profitable is just letting your computer idle videos. You can find the videos, after registering an account, here:  You get a small amount, but leaving it running overnight will do wonders to your onsite balance which can be withdrawn to bitcoin, paypal, or gift cards! The second best way to make money is through gambling. When you use my referral link, which is embedded into the link at the top, you get 1000 points to start gambling with. You can do two things: coinflip, and roll:  Roll, which is more easy since it is not player versus player style, automatically will roll a random number. If it\u2019s over 51, your money doubles (multiplier can change based off your liking.) Under 51, and you\u2019ll lose the money.  In the Coinflip option, you go up against another user in a coinflip and can either profit or lose. Usually, for me, it\u2019s a mix of the two. As long as you\u2019re smart and safe with gambling you will eventually profit. The third and final way is through surveys. I will only show a brief picture because many are fake or have viruses. Save your time and stick to the other things, and let me know if you need assistance with anything on the website!  ",

He probably made $100 a day doing that in between classes. You could also offer to do people's homework for money. Some kids want to go to a party and tell their parents that they are really visiting a friend somewhere, you could offer to pretend that you are that trusted parent of someone calls to check in. Then there are all of the legit businesses that anyone can start. Just don't get into drug dealing at school. All of the idiots trying to sell drugs at school make a couple dollars, then think that they are Pablo Escobar. My entrepreneurial high school friends that thought this was a good idea ended up getting hurt and/or in serious legal trouble. Run a legit operation, you can actually talk about it and be proud of your accomplishments, and so will the people close to you. It's better that way. ",

That meant no more caffeine unless you brought it from home. So, I took cans of mt dew to school and sold them for a dollar each. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but let me explain the operation. Walmart and other stores have 12 packs of Mountain Dew on sale, 3 cases for 12 dollars. I would sell all thirty six in a week or less when I started. That\u2019s 24 dollars profit. When I came close to running out I would stock up again, and sell them all quick. I made pretty good money for a 14 year old. Not as much as a actual job would pay but just some pocket money. You can also cut grass, shovel snow, rake leaves. One of my friends used to make over a hundred dollars a week just on grass. If you are old enough you can just get an actual job. Fast food is always hiring but there are sometimes better jobs. Dishwashing at nursing homes, Walmart pays well, so does target. ",

However there are some core answers that apply virtually apply to all 18 yr old high school students, all of which require finding work.  Now work doesn't necessarily mean a 9-5 or part time job, it can just be cutting your neighbors grass. Work is work. Now I would suggest being more self employed, as you gives you more character, plus it can bring in more cash faster. You can easily walk around door-to-door and ask if anyone has any job they need/want done, however are willing to pay you to do it. Even they are close enough, and look trustworthy enough, I would even recommend offering to do the job right then, without pay, and they pay you whenever they can. By offering a \"pay-me-later\" option you are opening a larger market to yourself as some people might not accept service from just because they don't got the money right then. Do you know how many times I had to turn down a good offer because I didn't have the money right then? Put yourself out there! Heck, if they don't got a job for you, give them your number or ask if they know anyone who might have a job for you. People really admire a hard working youngman believe it or not. (P.S. never turn down a job) However, if no one seems to have a job for you, perhaps make a similar approach to small family own business, it may still work as they might need some help. And if that fails,  there's obviously normal work. Either way, if you just stay true to your dedication, and just reflect how badly you want a car, you probably won't have to wait long to receive. Now sorry if I chopped up this answer, still celebrating new year's over here. Cheers! ",

When I was in high school fifty years ago I had lots of opportunities to make money \u2014 mowing lawns, selling sodas at the football game, working at the car wash, and hauling stuff in my pickup truck. One of my friends worked at the fast-food place. Selling dope was also very lucrative. Rumor had it that one of my acquaintances used hundred-dollar bills as bookmarks. Now all those job opportunities are taken over by undocumented immigrants so high school students are just out of luck. My best advice is that you wear a black turtleneck and start talking about disruptive economics and try to get the attention of venture capitalists. I had an idea last night I\u2019ll give you for free. We need to add value to the optometrist\u2019s office. Turn it into a \u201cVision Spa\u201d. There will be herbal eyewashes, and vision exercise groups, vision-enhancing luncheons and dinners and smoothies. Darkened rooms with soothing music for relaxing your sore eyes. It\u2019ll be huge!

I would look at local grocery stores or fast food like chipotle or McDonald\u2019s, it depends what you want to do because that\u2019s where you will be spending your evenings. I would also look at entertainment like a trampoline park or a movie theater, as a high school student the pay is usually $8.30 per hour in most jobs. What I have always done is make money during the school year (I made it by working at the school) and then take the summers off to enjoy yourself and your money you made, I made about $4000 a school year and you have the summers free to spend it. Or you can do the complete opposite and work in the summers doing landscaping or at a summer camp, and take the school years off, but I don\u2019t recommend that because I would rather have summers off.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m just going to be straight forward. Try to resell things on ebay. The best niche I\u2019ve found is with books. My library does book sales pretty often, try and find some. When you go there, just pick out any random book that\u2019s in good condition. Look up how much it costs on ebay and look to see how often people buy it. If you can make $5\u2013$10 off of that book you\u2019ll get like $3\u2013$6 profit after shipping and fees. Do that 10 times and you\u2019ve got $30\u2013$60 profit. Find somebody you trust and that\u2019ll trust you and transfer that money from paypal to their card and withdraw your money. If you\u2019re in high school you probably have cheap expenses. So if you can sell 20 books a month (less than 1 a day) you\u2019re looking at ~$100. Definetly room for more. People are always going to say \u201cTry and sell food at school\u201d. Seriously\u2026 how are you going to fit that in your backpack? They\u2019re being dumb. Other people are going to say \u201cjoin this website and you\u2019ll make thousands of dollars\u201d. It\u2019s really stupid. I sold books and that gave me enough money to do hobbies and hang out with friends. ",

If you enjoy sports;I recommend doing what I did and officiate youth games.I make $40 a game umpiring.I also know a girl who works at a dance studio,teaching little kids how to dance. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that if you look hard enough,you can find a job that you would enjoy doing. Or you could skip the job application process,and mow lawns or shovel snow. You have a lot of options for jobs out there if you want them. ",

I've worked as a dishwasher and bus boy for a local sushi joint, and I'm currently employed at Panera Bread. Starting wage is $8.50; after 6 months it's $9.00. Not bad if you ask me. Being a high-school student is actually an advantage in the eyes of some many. As long as you maintain a good work ethic and stay ambitious, it's likely you'll be favored over some older employees. Being in your managers' pockets is a great idea if you want to have flexible hours. It would be wise for you to set up checking and savings accounts. Having a certain amount taken out of your paycheck and into an untouchable savings account = more funds for college. Avoid credit cards at all costs. Best of luck to you! ",

But at my school, there are a handful of people who are always peddling their goods (Snickers, Arizona's, hot Cheetos, Sour Patches) and make a pretty penny. To make a profit, I suggest buying these things in bulk at places like Sam's Club or Costco. It will require a small investment, but after a few weeks, you can expect to have some money. Now, will this earn you something similar to a minimum wage after school job? More than often, no. But if you want some weekend cash or get some clothes, this is a pretty good way. Cheers.

The problem is not that you don\u2019t have the required skills or that you\u2019re not fit for the job, but it\u2019s just there are too many people just like you who are also trying to land that job you\u2019re trying hard to take. Given the competition, you can always find somewhere else to work. I mean you don\u2019t have to work on websites like Freelance or Upwork in order to make money. You can make money off doing all sorts of things, such as clicking ads, doing surveys, etc. These are nice jobs, but they are not going o pay you that much if you asked because it all depends on how much you really work. You can make from 20 bucks to like 600 bucks a month. You may start thinking about starting your own blog. Yeah, it\u2019s more likely to make tons of money off just blogging, depending on how much effort you put in either. So as a high school student with no much experience in any field and no degree, it requires hard work and dedication in order to land a job and it may not pay you as much as you expected. Still, it\u2019s not always about online jobs; you may start looking for any local jobs which don\u2019t require much experience or higher education, such as Uber or the like.

What pays the most right now I would say is probably programming- Java, Javascript, HTML, Ruby (These are all programming languages that can be learnt easily on sites such as Learn to code or Khan Academy) I highly advice you to take up those because even without doing work online, if you learn some programming languages, lots of startups would be willing to pay for someone with those types of skill sets. If programming is not for you, save up some of your pocket money and start investing in penny stocks. I can\u2019t tell you how many teenagers out there have made lots of money doing that (But they put in hard work trying to learn how to trade properly trying out different strategies- Look up Timothy Sykes) I would say, this method could take some time and some errors to learn properly but once it sticks, it sticks. Most online brokers require a parent signature and some paperwork to start the stock market account but once you start it up, you\u2019re on your own, unless your parents decide otherwise. Good Luck.

            "answer_text": "When I was a high school student, I used to teach kids and my juniors around my residential area every night. As a high school student, I improvised a lot by teaching others and gained precious experience as well as good amount of money without much effort as everything was still fresh in my mind. By doing this,you can gain some money and there won't be any struggles to study ,as you teach your junior you will automatically revise your previous chapters and will have deep understanding. The more you teach someone, the more smarter you will be.The most important thing is you must know on how to manage time wisely. 1)Get enough sleep after school 2)Eat properly because energy is vital in teaching 3)Don\u2019t charge tuition fee too much as you are only a high school student 4)Do this if you only interested and have patience to teach 5)prepare materials before teaching 6)Make sure finishing all your homeworks and extra exercises before your work. 7)Learn to control your mind and to make some sacrifices for success . #If you want to excel in studies and life.

People are more hesitant to hire males for babysitting, unfortunately, and that isn\u2019t likely to change due to us living in a world full of bad people. For boys: cutting grass, landscaping, weeding. A unique option would be to offer a service for walking dogs or petsitting, which would apply to both genders. Other options applying to both genders include tutoring a subject you are good at (math, English?), editing/reviewing homework and term papers (just don\u2019t help the student cheat by overediting or doing it for them), house cleaning, car detailing, or garage organization/cleaning. Of course, you could also just get a part time job anywhere (McDonalds, library, grocery store, etc), but the options I listed give you the opportunity to run your own little business, which is good for you: you\u2019ll learn advertising, customer service, hard work, pride in your work, and many other useful skills. So, my recommendation, in short, is to offer your services in an area at which you are at least somewhat skilled and that you enjoy doing. Advertise your services, sell yourself at an interview, do a FANTASTIC job for your customers, follow up on customer complaints, and earn repeat business. ",

            "answer_text": "Bare with me this whole answer. The best way to make money is to buy one of these:  A cheaper lawnmower $150  A cheaper edger $80  A cheaper trimmer $100 Right now that's a measly ~$330 which you can either gather yourself, or get your parents to help. Get a friends from school. Get a trailer if you don't have a truck. And start making flyers for your new lawn business. Drive around town and put them on the doors of people's houses that have really bad lawns. I'd recommend not giving a set price but a free estimate. I'd charge around $30 for a medium sized lawn. Ask your parents and friends if they need their lawns mowed. If you go to church ask the older people there. Once you have 7\u201320 lawns to move each week, you'll be making bank. If you mow 20 lawns for the \u2018average\u2019 price of $30 you'll get $600 bucks a week. It helped me get a lot of money omg high/middle schooler! ",

I\u2019ve gotten into this program called Ambassador Club ever since I was 19, in my third year of University. It helped me pay off my tuition and taught me things like email marketing and how to scale up your own business. You can see How I am Making $997 Commissions in 2018 in this article, it goes more in depth about Ambassador Club and its benefits. However, I\u2019ve got an article with a free ebook that you can see, it teaches the best way of making money right now in 2018. The Best Way to Make Money in 2018 Best thing about affiliate marketing and the Ambassador Club, it\u2019s that you really don\u2019t need a lot of starting capital to do this. Once you invest the time, which you currently are with school, then you\u2019re out to make a lot of money. Now I wouldn\u2019t say this is an easy way, because looking at it that way might bring super high expectations, so be realistic, although it\u2019s a program that has everything done for you, you still have to put in some work to get maximum results.

No matter what your skill set is, or how much time you have, you should be able to find something on this list that you can do this week to make some extra money.
