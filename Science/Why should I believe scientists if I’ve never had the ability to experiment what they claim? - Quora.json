            "answer_text": "Does your friend know what a superbug is? This is, in essence, evolution in the making and on a time scale we puny humans can see. What scientists do is come up with theories and then subject those theories to experiment. Experiment can be many things, but it needs to rigorous and it needs to be reproducable. The findings of these experiments are to support or disprove the theory. Notice I didn't say 'prove the theory' only support it. Unless the theory can actually be proved it can only support. So ,sorry, but in this you are wrong. There aren't proofs, just evidence (unless you count the superbug as a minor proof) This is called the Scientific Method for a reason. The results of these experiments and the conclusions that they draw are published in scientific journals where they are peer reviewed. This means that other scientists, who know the field, and have access to the resources can pick the experiment and conclusions appart. Its a brutal process, but one entirely geared to find the truth of what's going on. There are many defunct theories that are no longer believed (one in that list was from Einstein, and this list is not comprehensive at all). Now here's the fun part. Just because theories say it is so, does not mean it is so. It means that this is the best guess we have with the information at hand. For me I choose to believe that evolution is true, and in my opinion the method by which God created the animals and allows them to adapt. I believe God created Man separate despite there being some strange monkey cousins out there, and is one part of evolition i rejet, thought i have an interest in seeing how these monkey cousing fit into this awsom puzzle. Interestingly this allows me to reconcile my beliefs, with scientific knowledge. I belive God is the source of truth be that religious, scientific, financial, secular, historical whatever he knows the truth. The more truth we understand the closer we can come to knowing the source (to know God). The more we act like flippant children and say things like \"we'll did you see it yourself\"? (Ironically used by your friend about science just as Atheists are using it about God) the more we are denying the power of collective intelligence gathering. To sit there with your hands over your ears yelling 'LA LA LA' has not assisted either the Religious camp, nor thr secular one. I would recommend against this. ",

            "answer_text": "Because science operates in a transparent peer-reviewed system that you can observe. Look at the claims being made, the experiments done, the replication of these by others. The entire process is open to examination. The claim that \u201cyou should never believe what you never witnessed\u201d is interesting for someone to make regarding evolution since it is likely coming from someone who has a religious background. So, they already believe many claims that they never witnessed. Why do they believe those claims? Because someone else witnessed them? How do we know that? How do we trust those \u201cwitnesses?\u201d Science has much better processes of evaluating and testing claims than simply relying on eyewitnesses which are often notoriously inaccurate and biased. That is why experiments and research are conducted through a peer-review process. When it comes to evolution, the claim that it cannot be witnessed (presumably based on the notion that it only occurred in the past) is simply false. We can witness examples of evolution in action all around us. Look at the growing number of illnesses which are due to antibiotic resistant bacteria. That\u2019s evolution in action! There are a number of other examples happening now and in the recent past which have been and can be observed. All you need to do is be willing to observe. Here\u2019s a good summary that might be insightful from Kristan Lawson\u2019s Darwin and Evolution for Kids: 1. Any group or population of organisms contains variations; not all members of the group are identical. 2. Variations are passed along from parents to offspring through heredity. 3. The natural overabundance of offspring leads to a constant struggle for survival in any population. 4. Individual organisms with variations that help them survive and reproduce tend to live longer and have more offspring than organisms with less useful features. 5. The offspring of the survivors inherit their useful variations, and the same process happens with every new generation until the variations become common features. 6. As environments change, the organisms within the environments will adapt and change to the new living conditions. 7. Over long periods of time, each species of organism can accumulate so many changes that it becomes a new species, similar to but distinctly different from the original species. 8. All species on Earth have arisen this way and are thus all related. Does evolution really make animals change shape? Can I see it happen? That would be exciting, but unfortunately the answer is no. Evolution is not like a science-fiction film with special effects showing an alien creature growing a new head. Given enough time, evolution can make a species change shape but not an individual animal. Every plant, animal, and person remains the same throughout its whole life. Groupsevolve, not individuals. You'll never be able to see a fish grow legs and start to walk; evolution doesn't work that way. What evolution does is control what percentage of a group's individuals possess a certain trait or feature. Does evolution always happen to every species? Or do some animals never change? You might think from the description of evolution that natural selection is always working to bring about changes in species. But in reality most of the time natural selection prevents evolution from happening. Most of the variations and new features that might arise in organisms are not helpful at all, because evolution has already been going on for a very long time. Every species has already adapted to its environment as best as it can. Just about any change to a species would end up hurting it. Natural selection is continuously \"weeding out\" those variations that make an organism less adapted to its environment. Natural selection usually leads to evolutionary changes only if a species' environment and living conditions are shifting. In many cases, animals and plants that live in a stable environment hardly evolve at all. Horseshoe crabs are a famous example. They're fairly common on beaches around the world today. But archaeologists have found fossils of horseshoe crabs that look exactly like modern horseshoe crabs- except that the fossils are over 200 million years old. Horseshoe crabs have not evolved one bit in all that time because their environment-shorelines and beaches- hasn't changed much either. Is evolution the same thing as progress? Not necessarily. During the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era, people thought that history was always progressing forward, that life got better and more advanced every day. So they naturally assumed that evolution worked the same way. It seemed that life on Earth had started as a tiny organism and had progressed upward through evolutionary change to become the complex and superior creatures known as human beings. Yet Darwin showed that evolution does not always imply advancing toward more complicated or larger forms. Many animal species a hundred thousand years ago were larger than they are today; changes in climate made them evolve downward to become smaller. Other species, such as the peppered moth, evolve sideways (by changing color) but do not become any more or less advanced. Species merely adapt to their current environments. But that doesn't mean they're getting \"better.\" Are animals and plants really \"perfect\" in their design? William Paley's Divine Watchmaker argument relied on a basic assumption that all animals were \"perfect,\" intentionally designed like a watch to have all the right parts in all the right places. But Darwin and other natutralists discovered this was far from true. Animals often have weaknesses and deficiencies that could easily have been improved upon or eliminated if someone had designed them from scratch. Many animals have vestigial organs, body parts that don't work and for which the animal has no use. Various kinds of snakes, for example, have leg bones. Why would God give snakes leg bones if they have no legs? Evolutionists will tell you that snakes evolved from earlier reptiles that did have legs- legs that slowly disappeared as the species changed. The external legs disappeared, that is; the useless leg bones continued to exist inside the snakes' bodies. And if every species were \"perfect\" then why don't all animals have the best possible features; flawless vision and hearing, strong and fast legs, big brains, sharp teeth, and so on? Most don't because each species is just a hodge-podge of adaptations. Animals aren't \"designed\" to be any way at all; they're just an accumulation of evolutionary changes, some of which no longer serve any purpose. Where are the missing links? Missing links do exist. Difficult as it may be to visualize, all modern birds are the descendants of prehistoric dinosaurs. Scientists have uncovered several fossils of the missing link between dinosaurs and birds, a transitional form called Archaeopteryx that looked like a flying lizard with feathers. They've also found many bones and fossils of transitional forms between ancient primates and modern apes and humans, both of which are descended from the same ancestors. many other transitional forms in the evolution of horses and reptiles have also been found.
