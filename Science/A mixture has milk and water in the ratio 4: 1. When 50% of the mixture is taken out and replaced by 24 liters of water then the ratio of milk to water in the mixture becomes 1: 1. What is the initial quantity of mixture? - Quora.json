            "answer_text": "Let the initial mixture be 5x. It contain 4x quantity of milk and x quantity of water. When 50% of the mixture is taken out quantity is reduced by 5x/2 or 2.5x Amount of milk in the quantity removed = 2x Amount of water in the quantity removed = 2.5x\u00d71/5= 0.5x Balance quantity of milk in the mixture:2x and Balance quantity of water in the mixture 0.5x Amount of water added 24 litres. New quantity of water in the mixture 0.5x +24 Total quantity : Milk 2x : Water: 0.5x+24. We are infomed that this ratio is 1:1 Hence 2x = 0.5x+24 Hence 1.5x =24 and x= 16 Therefore initial quantity of the mixture of milk+ water which was 5x= 16\u00d75=80 litres. ",
