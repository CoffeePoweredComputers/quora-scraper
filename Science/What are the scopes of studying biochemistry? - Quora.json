            "answer_text": "We study biochemistry because it is the best way to understand how life works in a fundamental way. Physics and chemistry shape the way reactions and processes work in nature, biochemistry takes the knowledge from chemistry to study the fundamental processes that make up biology. Both biochemistry and molecular biology are extremely important fields when it comes to basic research (knowledge for the sake of knowledge) and applied research. The body of biochemical knowledge we\u2019ve gathered in the last fifty years has allowed a huge revolution in the medical, agroalimentary and even energy fields. Advances such as recombinant DNA technology, which allows for example the production of cheap insulin for people suffering from diabetes, are results of years of research in the biochemical basis of life, and this research has provided the means to alter living organisms to industrially create target molecules. Health sciences also get improved by knowledge in the field of biochemistry, cancer, HIV or other diseases will only be cured or treated once they are understood in a biochemical way. The last reason I would add, as a biochemistry student, is that we also study it because it is interesting to know how things work, and one of the most interesting things to research is how life works. This and also because it is so damn cool. ",

With all due respect ,\u2019 what is the scope\u2019 of something is a very very Indian question. I have traveled the world, currently working abroad and have never heard any student in US, Canada , Australia etc asking what is the scope of something that they want to pursue. It\u2019s absolutely fine to ask where do I look for jobs, who to connect who can advice on my career in biochemistry. Those are the right questions. What if o or some random person comes in a days no the scope is not good. Go and study Geology because he knows someone who is doing well in Geology. I have done the same mistakes and asked same scope questions when I was young. Got me nowhere. All these years working and life abroad has taught me why we have the worlds largest pool of engineers who are unemployable. Because everybody just stood and asked for scope and ended up doing some sort of engineering. it\u2019s a very Indian question which we all need to take it out of our system. Last week a student from a high school (around 13/14 years) in Wisconsin, USA asked a very straightforward crisp question to ceo of my company. I plan to become a designer of tools ( it\u2019s a manufacturing company) and is still charting out how to go about it. Does your company provide any internships or guidance on how to go about it. If this was a Indian student the question would have been what is the scope if I do this or which job has the most scope ( basically means earn money) so that irrespective of what he likes or wants will go and study whatever was suggested. I apologize for the long answer and I did not in anyway mean any disrespect. I just vented out what I feel how we Indians miss out on what they are good at and do stuff which is somebody else\u2019s scope. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: What are the scopes of biochemistry? This is going to be a fairly superficial answer. But here goes something: Biochemistry is the chemistry of living things. So understanding the chemical processes of life. That can encompass, or contribute to, a vast amount of different subjects, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to try to list all here. Generally, almost all of biology is biochemistry and biophysics, so physics and chemistry (which, when you break it down is also just very complex physics simplified) in living things. But much of it is so complex that we have subjects such as \u201cbiology\u201d or \u201cpsychology\u201d to tackle these, since they do not necessarily concern themselves with the chemical and physical details. So another way to say it, albeit not very detailed either: Biochemistry concerns itself with the parts of biology, that is not biophysics, and tries to understand the sub-microscopic details, not \u201cjust\u201d the macroscopic features (e.g. behavior). Though in real life (studies and research), the two are not necessarily that separate. Biochemists learn about biophysics as well. ",

One can do PG in biochemistry or DNB in biochemistry and then he/she will be able to become assistant professor of biochemistry in any college with fursther scope to become associate professor then additional professor and then professor. One can also do BSc. in biochemistry and further MSc. and PhD. Non medico people are also appointed as professor in medical colleges. Biochemistry is one of the most dynamic field of science because everyday new things are being added to this field. Researches are going on vastly in this field. One can do a lot of research work along with teaching. My biochemistry HOD has done more than 75 researches in this field. His name is Dr. Sanjay Yadav and you can find him on Google scholars. His major work is on RNAs. He has been to so many foreign countries for his collaboration. Currently he is in France for a month for his collaboration. He is a wonderful person to have a conversation with. His speech is always inspiring. Also our assistant professor in the department of biochemistry is a PhD in biochemistry with a three year postdoctoralship at National Institute of Health and National Institute of Allergy USA. On seeing the success of these people I can easily say that there is very much scope in this field. One shouldn't consider any field as big or small. Every field has it's own auspicious contribution to science. Thank you. ",

Whether it's how things (like me) fall down, not up, or how I now have a big greenish - yellow spot on my knee, inquiring minds want to know HOW. And, so far, the best way we have found that answers those questions consistently is science. In the case of my knee, how and why the color change occurred in just the way it did.In the science of biochemistry, we begin to see how the blood under the skin of my knee changes color (and now itches), rather than just sitting here and saying \"wow, that's ugly and now it itches, too.
