            "answer_text": "Originally answered: How to check whether a molecule has a vacant orbital? Any molecule will always have a vacant molecular orbital (MO). If not vacant then at least partially filled antibonding MO. And there will be many molecules with vacant antibonding MOs. If you want to know whether a molecule has a vacant bonding MO, electron counting and MO diagram would help. But in general molecules will have vacant ABMOs. Strictly, number of bonding molecular orbitals should equal number of antibonding molecular orbitals. If there is no unoccupied antibonding molecular orbital, i.e. all ABMOs are occupied, the molecule will not exist. ",
