            "answer_text": "Sure: electric charge (or as named in earlier centuries, \u201celectricity.\u201d) Charge is like matter: a conserved quantity, meaning it can\u2019t be changed (not created or destroyed.) Electric charge is quite \u2018thing-like,\u2019 almost like a liquid, where the Coulombs can behave very much like Kilograms, with an entire technology based on charge-flows and charge-pressure. Charge is closely entwined with electrical energy, but charge is not a form of energy. Also, charge may be the fundamental origin of matter (see Feynman\u2019s musings about the mass stored inside the close-in e-fields of charged particles.) Yet also charge is not mass. Besides kilograms and joules, coulombs are a third, separate stuff. Another one: INFORMATION. It\u2019s not energy, but can be part of modulated energy-flows, and it\u2019s not matter, but can be stored in matter-based media. And the exact same information can leap from matter to energy and back. It has it\u2019s own physics/mathematics: Information Theory. JC Maxwell\u2019s longstanding conundrum, the microscopic \u201cDaemon\u201d which could create heat out of nothing (by sorting random-moving particles,) turned out to be impossible, because \u2026to destroy information essentially requires energy, and the \u201cerasing\u201d process turns out to be a thing of enormous importance to physics! Heh, there\u2019s one more: if you have a big bucket full of Entropy, is your bucket full of energy? Matter? Void? Aether? Or maybe it\u2019s more like liquified television CRT-snow. Don\u2019t splash any of that stuff on you pants; it stains even worse than Gamow\u2019s primordial Ylem!  Speaking of which \u2026does the \u201cStuff\u201d you mentioned need to be real? If not, then what about Ectoplasm and Unobtainium and Vril? Or Diskworld\u2019s \u201cSlood?\u201d Most of these are listed on Category:Fictional materials - Wikipedia But even these aren\u2019t entirely unreal, since they exist as identical instances of information, spread across many minds. (And shows, and movies.) Infectious memes, neither matter nor energy. An agreed-upon societal construct can be more real than bullets. As a kid I invented one of these substances: \u201cSmeb,\u201d an imaginary and invisible material which, once you got any of it on you, you\u2019d never be able to wipe it off again. Same basic thing as \u201ccooties,\u201d but in liquid form. And it smelled horrible. ",

            "answer_text": "A.: Of course, yes: the question presumes a false dichotomy\u2020. Energy is a property, whereas matter is stuff. Stuff can have property: indeed all the various kinds of stuffs that exist have energy \u2014 and in fact can have various kinds of energy. Therefore, there exist oodles of other properties of stuff, which are not matter (since they are properties of stuff, rather than stuff itself) and are not energy (since they are properties other than energy): linear momentum, normal stress (= pressure if isotropic), shear stress, (see stress\u2013energy tensor), angular momentum, spin (intrinsic angular momentum), moment of inertia, electric charge, weak isospin, (chromodynamics) color charge\u2026 To be clear, \u201cmatter\u201d is everything that consists of the elementary stuff:  as well as the so far very vaguely identified dark matter and so-called dark energy\u2021. Notice that the orange tiles correspond to: gluon\u2192strong interaction, photon\u2192electromagnetic interaction, Z & W-bosons\u2192weak interactions, which are three of the four fundamental interactions, often visualized as force-fields; the yellow tile corresponds to the Higgs field. In turn, the three columns of tiles from the left (purple - quarks, and green - leptons) are most often visualized as particles. In fact, all of these are quantum fields, and the respective particles are their quanta = minimal-action changes in the respective fields. And that\u2019s limiting the answer to physic topics. (Outside of physics, there are myriads of \u201cthings\u201d that are neither matter nor energy, but that\u2019s a different story.)  \u2020 \u2026or uses the words \u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d not in the sense of the nine physics topics under which this is classified; I shan\u2019t opine on the \u201cPhilosophy of Everyday Life\u201d topic, as I am not a philosopher. \u2021 Yes, \u201cdark energy\u201d is a misnomer: it is any kind of stuff for which the pressure/energy density ratio is negative. Oh, well\u2026 ",
