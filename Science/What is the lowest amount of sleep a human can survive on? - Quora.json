            "answer_text": "Between 1% and maybe 3% of people in the world have what is called \u201cShort Sleep Syndrome\u201d - and seem to manage perfectly well on very small amounts of sleep - typically, less than three hours per night. Some of them sleep less than one hour per night - and a few as little as 15 minutes. And they don\u2019t seem to suffer any adverse consequences or even need to take a nap during the day. But those people have a specific gene abnormality. For the rest of us, we can get away with less than 7 hours per night for a while - but long-term, there are some serious medical consequences. People who sleep less than 5 hours on a routine basis are at high risk of death. In the short term - you can survive quite well with zero sleep for one or perhaps two or even three nights - but a time will come when it will simply be impossible to stay awake any longer. For most people, it\u2019s also possible to sleep fewer hours one night in exchange for sleeping longer on the next - as if you could borrow time from the sleep-bank and pay it back in the near future. Then there is another medical condition called \u201cFatal familial insomnia\u201d - where people with a particular genetic problem gradually become unable to sleep at all. Those people rapidly become confused, show signs of dementia and typically die within a matter of months. ",

            "answer_text": "There really is no right answer for this one. Eight hours of sleep is the optimal amount of sleep. The body needs to go through the whole sleep cycle to in order to perform at its best. The sleep cycle consists of about 5 stages, and each takes about 90 minutes, which adds up to about 7\u20139 hours. When you sleep, your body recovers and repairs. Your cells regenerate, your tissues grow, your muscles repair, and your brain processes information. If you do not give your body the chance to do this, the worse your body is going to perform. People who get 6 hours of sleep have been shown to be less alert than people who get eight hours, and they are not as healthy. It only goes down from there. You may think you are doing ok on 5 hours, but you are probably more likely to get into accidents. People who are deprived of sleep on a regular basis start to hallucinate and put themselves at risk for diabetes and heart disease. In short, the less you sleep, the more unhealthy you are. There are people who practice polyphasic sleep. This is a type of sleep in which you have one core sleep in the middle of the day lasting anywhere from 90 minutes to 6 hours and then supplement it with twenty minute naps throughout the day, but you have to retrain your body to be able to do it. However, some people say they can get by on as little as 3 hours of sleep this way, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Anyway, the closer you come to 7\u20139 hours the better. I am going to send you a link to some cool sleep products so you can get a better sleep, and I am also going to send you an article on polyphasic sleep in case you want to try it out for yourself.
