            "answer_text": "You heat it until it melts, and write down what temperature it melts at. :) More scientifically, heat it up until its heating curve reaches the transition phase between solid and liquid, and average the measured temperatures during that phase. (the picture below shows both transition phases)  This works because, at the transition phase, additional heat goes into breaking bonds between the material\u2019s constituent parts, not into raising temperature. What if you don\u2019t have the material? Then guess based on the bonds and structure. Bonds (and more specifically, intermolecular forces) are what hold solids together. They act differently from material to material; there are metallic bonds, polar bonds, Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, etc. You also must look at the ways these bonds are all arranged in the shape of the molecule. This becomes more complicated the more intricate the molecule. In general, metallic bonds are very strong, followed by strong polar bonds such as hydrogen bonds, then weaker Van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. PS: Some things don\u2019t have useful actual melting points; we have made up definitions for them. For example, the \u2018melting point\u2019 of a strand of DNA is the temperature at which half of the DNA strands have separated from its pair. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends in which state your compound is. If you have a solid, you heat the solid until a fluid starts to form. The temperature at which this state transfer is visibile is described as the melting temperature/melting point. In case you have a gas or a liquid, you have to cool your sample. When your sample starts to soldify, you found your melting point, ",
