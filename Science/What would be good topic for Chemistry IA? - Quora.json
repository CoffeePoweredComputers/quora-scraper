            "answer_text": "Any simple topic could be used for your Chemistry IA. As long as you twist it in a way, present it in a way to get the correct impression from your teacher and the examiners. In your Chemistry IA, being creative for your topic is not a very key criteria. It is mostly about how you treat your topic and how you present it. I personally got my idea by a few google searches like \u201cIdeas for IB chemistry IA\". And if you actually read the \u2018Nature of Science' and \u2018Skills and Applications' sections in your IB (Oxford) Chemistry textbook, then you can get numerous ideas from there too. Other books, also have a section or some whole chapter dedicated to IA ideas. But if I were you, I would not use them much since everyone else, not just in your class, but anyone who has read that book, which probably over thousands, will use one of those. Aim for originality if you really want a good topic. Since Science IAs (Biology, Chemistry, Physics\u2026) generally follow a similar format (Introduction, Background, Aim, Research Question\u2026). You just have to change the variables and use different references for your research. And definitely follow another famous research on the topic to learn more. But whatever method or aim you have in your research, try to reduce your amount of plagiarizing or unreferenced copying of other material to a zero since IB is really strict about those. Here are some topics to check out: Stoichiometric relationships Vitamin C content of \u2018superfoods\u2019 \u2013 Use redox titration to find out if superfoods like kale and broccoli contain more vitamin C than oranges and peppersThe calcium content of various substances \u2013 Use EDTA titration to determine the amount of calcium in substances including tap water, milk, eggshell and limestone.Finding the relative molecular mass of washing soda by titration \u2013 Use acid-base titration to find out how many waters of crystallisation there are in washing sodaInvestigating caffeine content \u2013 Using colorimetry to assess whether different teas (white, black and green) contain different amounts of caffeineCalculating absolute zero \u2013 Investigate whether the way the volume of a gas changes with changing temperature allows absolute zero to be calculated.EnergeticsFinding and comparing the enthalpy change of combustion of alcohols \u2013 Using calorimetry to check if alcohols with more carbons in them have a higher enthalpy of combustionDetermining enthalpy of neutralisation \u2013 Use calorimetry to see if the enthalpy of neutralisation for different acids and alkalis is always around -55 kJ mol-1Using Hess\u2019s Law \u2013 Measure the enthalpy changes for the dissolving an anhydrous and hydrated salt (such as copper sulfate or cobalt chloride) in order to work out the enthalpy for the hydration process.Using Hess law to calculate enthalpy change \u2013 Measure the enthalpy changes for the reaction of magnesium and magnesium oxide with hydrochloric acid, then use Hess\u2019s Law to work out the enthalpy of formationInvestigating cooling pack chemistry \u2013 Use calorimetry to determine which endothermic reactions would be suitable to produce cooling packs based on cost and safetyChemical kineticsGlow stick kinetics \u2013 Measure how the light output from a commercial light stick at room temperature varies with time in order to determine the activation energy from an Arrhenius plot.Which conditions denature lipases? \u2013 Investigate the effects of UV light, temperature and pH on the rate of fat digestion by lipase to see which factor has the greatest effect.Investigating the hydrolysis of aspirin \u2013 The effects of pH and temperature on the rate of aspirin hydrolysisDetermining activation energy \u2013 Measure the rate of a chemical reaction at different temperatures and use an Arrhenius plot to calculate its activation energyThe kinetics of dye bleaching \u2013 Use spectrometry / colorimetry to determine the rate law and rate constant for the reaction between some common dyes and household bleachIn the end, choosing the topic comes down to you. Don\u2019t expect an angel to drop from the sky, dressed in a teacher, and give you that topic. Bear this point in mind: Choosing your topic is only the first step in doing your Internal Assessment.

            "answer_text": "Back when I did it, my teacher said that the Chemistry IA definitely needs to involve two quantitative data points, as that allows for the best interpolation, extrapolation, and general analysis. Topics like pH, UV beads, and the like which only give qualitative data are not good for Chemistry IAs. Also, do not look at Science Buddies or other sites for young students as most of those projects involve chocolate or vinegar volcanoes. If you can Google the answer to your question, it\u2019s probably too straightforward. Other than that, here are some suggestions. I have no idea if these would go over well with the IB organization or not, since I don\u2019t work for them nor do I know how they feel about any of this, but here are some ideas for data points: -rate of dissolution -rate of reaction -solubility -electronegativity I\u2019m not sure if all of these are easily measurable, since I didn\u2019t spend a whole lot of time delving into topics besides my own, but hopefully they are a good place to start. I would definitely recommend talking to your teacher about what past students have done. ",
