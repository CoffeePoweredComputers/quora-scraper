            "answer_text": "There is crap metaphysics. There is terrible mathematics. There is pretty damn awful psychology. But that there is bad quality work in any field of study should not condemn the whole discipline. I learned this lesson the long winded way. Back in my youthful teens, I arrogantly proclaimed to all that would listen that psychology was a bunk science, filled with claptrap and obscure terms. Having read some Freud and a few other bits and bobs, I drew pretty much the same conclusions you drew. Claptrap, unfalsifiable nonsense, with little value, and, in fact, very possibly harmful. The whole discipline, when seen through the lens of popular authors, literature and the media, seemed to be riddled with vague unprovable generalisations and halfhearted \"laws\" which personal experience clearly showed to be false. But of course Freud is not psychology. Psychoanalysis is not psychology. The perception of the discipline through the media is not psychology. The problem was twofold. First, the jargon and terminology in psychology and the cognitive sciences was obscure and difficult for non experts. But the neuroscientist doesn't write for non-experts - that's not her job. Jargon is a useful shorthand. And at the time, I had little or no access to high quality jargon-busting texts that could have given me the gist of what was going on in psychology and the cognitive sciences generally at that time. As such, the quality studies I did have access too seemed opaque and difficult, filled with jargon and dull, irrelevant, unprovable conclusions. And the media's over-hyped stories were clearly nonsense and ridiculous. What else was I to think? Second, the questions asked in psychology, and the techniques used, are difficult to grasp and difficult to get your head around. Honestly, they have some of the hardest jobs around in terms of experimental design and inference. Comparatively, physics has it easy. Lots of mathematics, sure. But at least atoms don't mislead you if you word a question in a slightly funny manner. But looking at the discipline, when you cut away the nonsense, it's hard to see what real conclusions have been drawn. It all looks, from the outside, like a bunch of academics arguing in circles. But psychology is not nonsense. The study of psychology has had both direct and indirect benefits to the world at large. And progress is being made. So why am I talking about psychology when we should be talking metaphysics? Because I want to warn you to be careful not to dismiss a whole discipline on the basis of popular perceptions, low quality work within that discipline, or superficial characteristics such as the apparently inexplicable jargon used. Metaphysics is filled with jargon. Sure. No denying that. But so is every discipline - from literature to linguistics. And, in fact, you'll find that much of the jargon is the same in both metaphysics and other areas of study. These include the cognitive sciences (representation, mental state, qualia), linguistics (proposition, statement. sentence, subject, predicate, indexiality, lexicon, term), logic (inference, deduction, quantification, existential, possibilia, modality), mathematics (set, class, type) and so forth.  So not all the jargon is inexplicable unless you want to say that these disciplines are also filled with inexplicable jargon. Some of the jargon is borrowed from metaphysics and is thus shared, and some of the jargon is borrowed by metaphysics. There is some unique jargon to metaphysics, but given the centrality of the discipline, it's rapidly picked up and used elsewhere. Nevertheless, jargon does have an aura of opaqueness. There are two good reasons for this. First, people like the big questions. The media likes to know about whether men and women have different brains, it cares little about the receptive field integration and submodality convergence in the hand area of the post-central gyrus of the alert monkey. As such, the media will latch onto such topics and any papers addressing anything like it. Philosophy has an image problem. It has few popular advocates, and they only get tend to get success in \"hot\" topics, like the Philosophy of Physics or Mind (think Daniel Dennett). This makes the terminology all the more obscure, and makes it harder to clamp down on claptrap being spouted outside metaphysics. So don't think that because you hear \"philosophers conclude that reality is perception\" or \"philosophers endorse the many worlds hypothesis\" that it actually reflects the ongoing work in the discipline. There are plenty of hobbiest \"philosophers\" on the internet for example who enjoy thinking - and that's great. But there's plenty of hobbiest psychology too on the internet, and a significant proportion of it is bunk that no self-respecting psychologist would consider. So with that warning in hand, let's consider your two potential arguments. One is methodological, the other is practical. The first - is metaphysics methodologically unstable?  Your core issue is that it's unfalsifiable. There are three things to say to that: Falsifiability stemmed from Popper, a Philosopher of Science. And as many have pointed out, the only way to warrant that \"falsifiability\" is a criterion of a good research method non-scientific, unfalsifiable reasoning.It's not the only \"unfalsifiable\" method around. Other ways of getting to the truth are also valuable.Metaphysics is not always unfalsifiable or completely detached from scientific investigation.The first is a silly point, mostly rhetorical, but really emphasises the second. There's lots of things we want to know about but which aren't amenable to scientific investigation. Political values (freedom, liberty, justice, equality, rights), ethical principles (do no harm, help others, don't lie), mathematics, and the scientific method itself are all to a greater or lesser degree distinct from scientific investigation.  So be careful when throwing around concepts like \"falsification\" - you might just find that you've shot yourself in your foot, just as the logical positivists did! But none of this is to say that metaphysics is immune from scepticism. In fact, there has been a constant, regular healthy dose of scepticism concerning the methods used in metaphysics for quite some time. James Ladyman's book, \"Everything Must Go\" is a solid critique of many practises within metaphysics. But even he, ardently sceptical of many traditional methods in metaphysics, has a profound respect towards many more traditional metaphysicians, such as Fraser McBride. It's a respectful sceptism, and a position which I quite admire.  And the reason for this respect concerns your second point - that metaphysics has done little to help us in the long run. Of course, we could traipse through the distant past, identifying how metaphysicians of the past like Descartes and Leibniz had a profound impact on the world yadda yadda. But I imagine that you'd want more contemporary examples.  These are harder to give, but the reason should be unsurprising. The direct benefits of metaphysics are few and far between. Same goes for pure mathematics, if we're being honest. And computational neuroscience. In fact, any really abstract discipline rarely has a direct benefit to human kind. At least, not in a short span of time. But once properly interpreted or used, boy oh boy can they be seen to be pretty darn handy.  Same goes for metaphysics. The long term and indirect benefits are quite amazing. This is why it's always so tempting to go off on a tangent into the past. I'll do you a service and stick to the twentieth century. You like computers, right? Well, Logic is quite a good friend to Metaphysics. Gotlob Frege and Bertrand Russell were both metaphysicians. And both were inspired to resolve metaphysical problems, particularly in the realm of mathematics. Hilbert, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Brouwer, Weyl, and Heyting (three other great mathematicians) were all caught up with metaphysics too. Together they helped to develop some pretty amazing logical and mathematical tools, all with the motivation for resolving various paradoxes, logical problems, ontological issues and the like. The history of this is all rather fascinating. These all led to the formation of various logical systems and metalogical results which led to the formation of computer science. And still today you'll find close ties between metaphysics , logic, and computer science. Sure, you might rarely find the computer scientist and metaphysician in the same conference hall. But you will undoubtedly find logicians and metaphysicians, and logicians and compsci's publishing and working together. It's a trickling down of results that metaphysics finds its way into our every day lives. The benefits are hard to predict, but they are there if you look. I chose this example as it's close to my area of study (though I'm not really a metaphysician per se!).  Metaphysics is abstract, obscure and difficult. It has a massive image problem, and worse, does have some pretty terrible examples both outside and inside professional academia. But don't think that these examples are necessarily representative. And don't think that because it's opaque that it's nonsense - that's the same trap that many nutters fall into who believe that the earth is flat, or that climate change is bunk. \"The discipline is hard or obscure, so it must be wrong\" is not a good inference.  There are useful outputs, but these uses are not easily quantified or easily seen. But they are there. ",

            "answer_text": "Is metaphysics a nonsense study? Even though greater than 90 percent of metaphysical works are nonsense, metaphysics is most important. In spite of the fact modern metaphysics has gone to the dogs as most of the metaphysicians are idiots by the nonsense they write, there is an inside awareness of the [real] important stuff; there is a group in the know that communicate with one another. The problem is they can\u2019t produce the quality the human mind is fully capable of [simply] because of economic reasons. First, Hume is the critical basics. Second, Kant is [the] development of Hume but he is not a stickler for Hume\u2019s basics. Finally, Schopenhauer is the expert of Kant\u2019s development with a better awareness of Hume\u2019s basics but even he is not completely compatible with Hume\u2019s basics. A good section of Schopenhauer that exposes his differences with Hume\u2019s basics is \u201cIntellectual Character of Empirical Perception. THE UNDERSTANDING.\u201d of \u201cOn the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Here is a sample of Schopenhauer as he is at the business of a serious attempt to correct Hume and he is in direct line with Kant: \u201cIn the professorial philosophy of our philosophy-professors we are still taught to this day, that perception of the outer world is a thing of the senses, and then there follows a long dissertation upon each of the five senses: whereas no mention whatever is made of the intellectual character of perception: that is to say, of the fact, that it is mainly the work of the Understanding, which, by means of its own peculiar form of Causality, together with the forms of pure sensibility, Time and Space, which are postulated by Causality, primarily creates and produces the objective, outer world out of the raw material of a few sensations. \u201d Excerpt From: Arthur Schopenhauer. \u201cOn the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason and On the Will in Nature: Two Essays (revised edition).\u201d iBooks. If you read the whole section you get a very serious attack on Hume\u2019s take of the law of causality and he elaborates so clearly on Kant\u2019s idea \"Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind\u201d that any student of Kant that doesn\u2019t understand this after reading Schopenhauer\u2019s elaboration should give it up. Schopenhauer makes the abstruse so clear that his reader takes an important test in that if it is not understood after reading Schopenhauer then said mind simply can\u2019t understand it. Not saying to give it up but to keep at Schopenhauer and only Schopenhauer (or Kant himself). After a time and nothing is happening, that is, you can\u2019t explain to the idiots why they are an idiot or they obviously have no interest in interpreting what is there to be interpreted, then you should give it up. Do give yourself a chance \u2014 spend some time on Schopenhauer \u2014but if you just can\u2019t get it from him then you simply will not get it. If you waste time on the others rather than Kant or Schopenhauer as far as how did Kant or Schopenhauer correct Hume it will only make it worse. I am far from becoming proficient in the correction of Hume. I am in the process of getting it but I can\u2019t let go of Hume therefore I am going to continue with this, try to become an expert by studying Kant and Schopenhauer but mainly the latter, in order to play the skeptic. An academic of course or you will never catch me being absurd. It goes against my grain. The way I see it when minds try to explain the abstruse they approach it from a different angle [and] they attach slightly different meaning/ideas to terms [and] because the thing being explained is a very very many step process (not seen but mostly probably reasoned with a wee bit of a priori reason necessary to set the stage) they pick it up in different areas or they explain small parts rather than the whole. This last problem can be seen or understood by [noting] how useful the correct take is notwithstanding it has been corrected. The easy art of Adam Smith is the most impeccable system ever created by the human mind. If he could be used in his power to destroy the minds of all economists practicing their art today this seemingly outlandish statement wouldn\u2019t appear outlandish at all. The absurdness of economics has been a trend that has carried so long and the serious problems caused over the centuries explained away by complex nonsense (involving all of the social sciences) it has really taken its toll on MIND; social science is shot to hell \u2014 my theory of discombobulation; all social scientists are for all practical purposes senile right out of college. In her old age my grandmother forgot more about The Great Depression than Ben Benecke [ever] learned in college or throughout his whole career. David Hume\u2019s take on causality is absolutely in line with Smith\u2019s easy art that is impossible to un-understand. This is true notwithstanding all of the effort to make it un-understandable. If you will study the complex attack on Smith over the years with a notice of the piss poor defense by his supporters you will understand Smith\u2019s importance from a unique angle; no system can generate that much hatred or disgust from the negative aspect of the human mind but one that is true. It is true in three very important problems that is impossible for a liberal mind to misunderstand either the importance or the fact that the complex problem was solved: What is wealth How is wealth created How is wealth distributed How could Hume\u2019s law of causality be corrected whenever it was so important in the becoming of the most important system ever that is the easiest to understand ever; there is no system of thought as important as Smith\u2019s that is as easy to understand as Smith\u2019s. No one can not bring Smith\u2019s system to mind upon reading Hume on how metaphysics is to serve easy art. If they can\u2019t do this then they mark themselves as un-intellectual. If every intellectual does this or a majority then you have prime example of an intellectualism that is shot to hell or full of shit or some kind of mix. You can\u2019t have a country guided by such an ugly, useless, MIND. ",
