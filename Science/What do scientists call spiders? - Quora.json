            "answer_text": "I call them \u2026\u201dspiders\u201d or if I know the species or common name I will call them that, Spiders are members of Kingdom Animala, Phylum Arthodopa, Subphylum Chelicerata, Class Arachnida, and Order Araneae. In writing a scientific paper or response to Quora I might refer to them as \u201cArachnids\u201d - strictly speaking this is not accurate because the Arachnids include non spiders like ticks, mites, and scorpions. Araneaeds is more accurate but I have seldom heard it used. ",
