            "answer_text": "According to me there are two possibilities when a compass is placed on top of any of the poles:- 1.The pointer needle still pointing to the north direction the compass is in a magnetic field which is pointing towards the north(although it pointing towards where the compass is now) and earth\u2019s north pole is actually a magnetic south pole. So this is the case of earth:-  and when a compass is placed on top of any pole then it influence and pointing towards the north which is actually south according to humans.  2. The pointer needle rotating constantly As it can\u2019t detect where to point due to excessive magnetic field lines at the poles and high atmospheric pressure. Hope this will help you. These are just my opinions. ",

            "answer_text": "At the poles the magnetic field lines go into and out of the ground. The compass will want to point up or down. You wouldn't notice this, probably, unless you had a special compass that allowed that movement, since the needle is usually constrained to point horizontally, and usually depends on gravity to balance precisely (i.e. if you just tip the compass up, the needle won't be able to move freely). So, the horizontal direction it points will be somewhat unconstrained and unpredictable. ",
