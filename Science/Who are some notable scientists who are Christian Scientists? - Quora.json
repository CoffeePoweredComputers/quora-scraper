            "answer_text": "Many scientists you find famous are possibly Christian. One of my favourite examples are Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei.Both Newton and Galileo are Christian, and are brilliant scientists and philosophers of their time. But then, their religious side are usually wrongly interpreted. Religious people like to cite them both as support of religion spawning smart people, but that is a misconception because they both hail from a time where practically everyone are called Christians.  Both Newton and Galileo were brought up in Christian families, but their behaviour and philosophy contradicts that. The two scientists found many errors in Christian teachings, contradictory evidence against the \"facts\" taught in the Bible, which pushed them forward into doing experiments to finding what's actually true (eg. Newton's two body problem and Galileo's Sun-centred system.)  Their curiosity is what made them great scientists, the fact that they are able to question what is taught to them made them famous till today.Many other scientists rode on the same train where they experimented against their religious views, which is why Newton once claimed god has nothing to do with his work. In the end Newton and Galileo died a Christian, but I think that they are secular scientists remembered as Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "There are more than not.         Louis Pasteur once said little science will make you doubt God, going deeper into science will make you doubt your earlier beliefs. Many scientists over the centuries have come to believe in the existence of God even from their work. God bless you! ",
