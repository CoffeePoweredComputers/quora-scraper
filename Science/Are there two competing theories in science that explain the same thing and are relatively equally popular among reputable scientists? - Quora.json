One recent debate is on the black hole firewall paradox (see: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/science/space/a-black-hole-mystery-wrapped-in-a-firewall-paradox.html?_r=1). Well, recent is \"recent\" it is actually a new chapter in a long debate started with Stephen Hawking in the '70s on the properties of black holes. See here some popular science videos of some of the people involved:      ",

Loop quantum gravity is headed by Ashtekar, Smolin, Rovelli, Thiemann, Baez etc. All these are highly eminent physicists. String theory is headed by Witten, Gross, Maldacena, Vafa, Greene, Kaku, Sen, etc. Both these theories describe quantum gravity, though these are not complete theories as yet and have a plethora of conceptual and technical issues.
