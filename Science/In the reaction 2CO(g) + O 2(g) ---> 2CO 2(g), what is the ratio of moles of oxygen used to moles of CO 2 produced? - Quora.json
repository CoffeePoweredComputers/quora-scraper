            "answer_text": "Basing on the balanced chemical equation one mole of oxygen gas O2 produces 2 moles of carbon dioxide gas CO2. The mole ratio of the the oxygen gas to the carbon dioxide gas is 1:2. This is the beauty of a balanced chemical equation because the mole ratio of the reactants and the products are immediately seen. ",
