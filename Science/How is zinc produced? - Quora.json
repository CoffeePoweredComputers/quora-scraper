            "answer_text": "Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point. At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless specific measures are taken to prevent it. The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulphide which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method. Secondary (recycled) zinc material, such as zinc oxide, is also processed with the zinc sulfide Approximately 30% of all zinc produced is from recycled sources. There are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the electrolysis process. Both methods are still used. Both of these processes share the same first step: roasting.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is a metal lying in the middle of the reactivity series.First it's sulphide ore or carbonate ore, It's  roasted or calcinated, according to the type of ore and then the process is continued . After this process is complete. Carbon is added to the resulting oxide ore to get the zinc metal and this process is called smelting. ",
