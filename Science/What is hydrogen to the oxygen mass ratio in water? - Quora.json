Here molar mass of H = 1.00 O = 16.00 STEP 2 FIND MASS OF EACH ELEMENT IN THE COMPOUND Here H = 2(1.00) = 2.00 O = 1(16.00) = 16.00 STEP 3 FIND MOLAR MASS OF THE COMPOUND Here molar mass = 2.00+16.00 = 18.00 STEP 4 FIND RATIO TO THE MASS OF THE COMPOUND. Ratio of H = 2/18 Ratio of O = 16/18 Ratio of H:O::2:16 = 1:8 ",

In other words the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 2:1, the ratio of hydrogen to water is 1:1, and the ratio of oxygen to water is 1:2. ",
