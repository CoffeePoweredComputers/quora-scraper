            "answer_text": "Arguably, some of the same skills that will be obviously valuable in 2030 are also pretty valuable today. In other words, enhancing these skills will help you advance today as well as in 2030.  Will we have flying cars? Maybe. Driver-less cars? Probably. Driver-less flying cars? SalesYou are always selling something, how far you get in life (no matter the era) depends on cultivating this skill. You might be selling your self during an interview, selling your ideas in a meeting, or selling your integrity to your parents to convince them to borrow the car. Everything you want is gained through this skill.ProgrammingAs seen throughout history, people are always working to make life easier, we always want more and more leisure time. The hunter/gatherers eventually learned to farm which allow them to settle down which allowed overproduction of food which created an economy eventually leading to construction, industrialization, and machinery. Now we\u2019re at the point in which we don\u2019t even want to run the machinery, we want programs to run the machines to make our lives even easier. In order to have programs, you must have programmers. Even if you don\u2019t plan on becoming a programmer, most likely you will have to interact or work with one so it\u2019s good to know the basics. Programmers (are supposed to) make life easier and more automated which is the goal isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t we all want to lounge around while our robot minions clean the house, farm our food, and take care of us? (Think Wall-E)CommunicationI mean this in two ways, communicating within your language and communicating outside of it. You must be able to write or speak clearly in such a way that people understand what you mean. In a world that\u2019 becoming more unified, especially since the internet allows instant access to anyone and everyone, you need to have a voice. Not everyone needs to know you and you don\u2019t need to know everyone, but some people need to know you. Arguably by then, schooling might have undergone a \u201crevolution\u201d where most people are now taking online courses for lower cost and working in offices is replaced by working remote. In the case that you don\u2019t really see people anymore, you need a platform to create an identity and be known.Unless some perfect translation is able to be programmed, people will still likely have trouble communicating in languages not their own. I imagine English will be the most known language but you would do well to learn the languages of up and coming nations as well.AwarenessIn an online world, it\u2019s easy to live in an echo chamber. If you choose everything you interact with, you won\u2019t ever need to challenge your thoughts or beliefs. You need to be aware of the world around you, you need to know what\u2019s going on outside of your circle and you need to understand people. You also need to be aware of changing markets and dynamics between groups of people. Awareness allows you to better guess what will come in the future and therefore allows you to set in motion a better plan for today. Awareness is hard to develop, you might even think you\u2019re aware of everything when it\u2019s not even remotely true. It\u2019s more a philosophical mindset than a skill really.Entrepreneurship / Initiative ^ The rise of entrepreneurship has already begun There are a lot of problems in the world and with a lot more leisure time, a lot of people will solve a lot more problems if we start cultivating this skill now. In between world hunger and poverty are a million other problems and big companies aren\u2019t going to be concerned with them (not really). It\u2019s up to individuals, the new generations that still have their naivety and bleeding hearts to do something. By then, new generations will have more powerful tools and be exponentially more advanced than even we are today. Google was founded less than 20 years ago, who knows what could happen in a decade? When people solve problems, truly solve them, then the world becomes a better place to live and a wealthier place to live. Everyone\u2019s standard of living increases and as such, that individual(s) that solved the problem will undoubtably make a profit from helping people.Although with everyone\u2019s standard of living increased, a lot less people will die, which creates the problem of world wide overpopulation but that\u2019s another topic. But on the other hand, with more people than ever being alive and able to think, human advancement should sky rocket.The future will change so rapidly that it won\u2019t be reliable to depend on graduating college and finding a job like our parents before us. By the time someone enters a 4 year institution with the intent of a specific job, the job market at the end may be non existent, a lot can happen in 4 long years, especially with the creation of million of new businesses. The most valuable skill for the future is this initiative to not take the path most traveled nor the path less traveled by, make a new path. ^ Population is only increasing and at a more rapid rate than ever ",

            "answer_text": "ADAPTABILITY Not since the Industrial Revolution has the world gone through such revolutionary and rapid change. Cars will soon drive themselves, artificial intelligence will replace a large sector of the workforce, cash will soon be a thing of the past, online shopping is putting brick and mortar businesses like Sears into the ground and breakthroughs in health care mean people will be living longer than ever. The rules of the game have changed. If you're a millennial you've probably been taught by your baby boomer parents to go to school, get good grades, get a career and your life will be great. Thousands have followed this framework and found themselves back home in their parents basement after college with enough student debt to keep them company until they can start using their senior discounts at McDonald's. The truth is for many of us under 35, our parents were able to get by fairly well using the same advice they gave us. They could never have predicted how fast the world would change in their lifetimes. The internet has become the new playing field for wealth creation, advancement of knowledge and ideas as well as entertainment. It's share in these industries will only grow by leaps in bounds in the decades to come. For millenials and the generations following us, the greatest skill we can possess is the ability to change as fast as the world around us. The truth is, there are going to be millions of people left behind as societies continue to change at light-speed. The gap between the rich and the poor is increasing every year. If something is not working for you or not providing you with the life that you want, YOU MUST be able to adapt. Can't find a job in your degree? Provide yourself with new skills and look elsewhere. Can't get your business ideas to take off? Read books on the world's leading contemporary entrepreneurs and find a new strategy. My mom always told me: Time waits for no man. If you're falling behind, the world certainly won't wait for you. Adaptability will allow you to be flexible enough in a 21st century environment that will always keep you on your toes. ",
