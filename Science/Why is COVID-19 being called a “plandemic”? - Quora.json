This is to be expected, especially \u2014 when the person in the Oval Office is actually fueling many of them, and spreading them himself. There are dozens of such conspiracy theories that claim that Covid-19 was manufactured in a lab (we know for certain, scientifically, that is a lie), or that it was released as some deliberate act by some big pharma corporations, or by Bill Gates, or by George Soros, in order to profit Or, that it was deliberately unleashed upon the planet to sabotage the November election, and ruin it all for that meek, mild, innocent victim Donald Trump (this disease was spread, intentionally, of course, by \u201cthose sneaky, nefarious members of the Democratic Party!\u201d Because, \u201cthe only good democrat(ic) is a dead democrat(ic)!\u201d Those are all utter bullshit, of course. But, somebody sitting in the Oval Office is promoting them, on a daily basis\u2026 Covid -19 is not a \u201cplandemic.\u201d (That is a made-up word). It was not planned. By anyone. \u2014 However by definition, Covid-19 is a pandemic. It is called a pandemic by \u201csome people\u201d \u2014 because it actually is a pandemic. pandemic [noun]. an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of the population : \u201ca pandemic outbreak of a disease.\u201d [-Merriam-Webster.]  Covid-19 cases have been on found on every one of the seven continents on the planet earth \u2014 with the exception of the few hundreds of people who are stationed in Antarctica, or who actually \u201clive\u201d in Antarctica. Covid-19 deaths have occurred on every one of the seven continents on the planet earth \u2014 with the exception of the few hundreds of people who are stationed in Antarctica, or who actually \u201clive\u201d in Antarctica. Because, by definition, Covid-19 is a pandemic. I hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Well because Dr Fauci had a corona virus they where working on they where moving to start testing on animals. That project was banned in America so instead of stopping the project it was moved to China along with 3.7 million dollars of your money.   (This picture is showing that the president of Tanzania was leery of the test so he used his brain and had some other things tested , well what do you know they came up positive one was a fruit and the other a goat. This means some people have been getting a positive testing when who knows if they really had it )So Dr Fauci sent the virus over to China to make it a chimeric virus to see if they could make it transmit into humans. The corona viruses can\u2019t move directly to humans they needed some help to make them infect humans so that\u2019s what they where studying. It just so happens that the Chinese military also wanted a bio weapon , how convenient. All this ties into Bill Gates and a project he had a few months before we got the pandemic. So why would you need to do a study like that ? A study of what it would be like to have a pandemic and now he wants to give everyone a digital ID and a vaccine. The same man that wants to depopulate the world. This follows the plan book for the New World Order a real group of people that meet at Beildiburg every year . These people have been trying to startup this NWO for over 60 years . They must tear down society , governments and economies in order to start up a one world government a one world religion and a one world economy. The Pope has already trying to start the one world religion right now. President John F Kennedy talked about them in secret societies like Skull and Bones . President Bush sr talked about them too he was in Skull and Bones also. If you go look into it you\u2019ll find the information it\u2019s all out there. This whole thing has to do with them trying to recreate the world so they can inslave the working man more efficiently and use the world for a select few. ",
