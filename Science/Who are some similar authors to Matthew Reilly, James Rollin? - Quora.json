            "answer_text": "Noting from your description, I see that you're already familiar with Ludlum's work. Anyway, I'd suggest that you give these authors a try: Lee Child: Lee Child is perhaps best known as the creator of the character Jack Reacher and in case you are not familiar with his work, I'd suggest that you begin with his debut novel titled \u201cKilling Floor.\u201dJo Nesbo : Don't know much about him but I'd suggest you give him a try. You can start by reading his novel titled \u201cHeadhunter.\u201dTry Michael Crichton too, the creator of the hit novel Jurrasic Park which was developed into a Major Motion Picture.You can also give Robin Cook a try if you are into Medical Thrillers.I'd also recommend that you give the \u201cArtemis Fowl\u201d series a try. It's author is Eoin Colfer and the central character in this series is a young teenage boy who happens to be the smartest criminal on the planet. A must read if you were to ask me. That's all I can come up with for now. Thanks for the A2A btw. ",
