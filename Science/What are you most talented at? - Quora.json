            "answer_text": "1.I developed skills with women completely on accident and I know for a fact compared with a lot of people I\u2019m on the higher end with this skill and I know the in\u2019s and out\u2019s. I don\u2019t use this skill very much and I conceal it from the majority of women for set reasons. I know the mistakes, I know the miscommunication errors where women define things differently than men and men don\u2019t understand what exactly a woman Is expressing. The downside of the skill is damage control. Behaving in female appealing parameters consistently causes conflicts with other males. I been in many situations where their husband or boyfriends are right next to them and the women forget that they\u2019re right there, and I notice the male getting upset about the situation. But! I also did an experiment that shows the males that do get upset won\u2019t have mercy on you if you\u2019re in that situation. So I have a bit of conflict interest when it comes to the touchy situation, because with other males I forfeit and they don\u2019t. I\u2019m still trying to understand the male driven psychology. So often have request for \u201cFavor\u2019s\u201d from males when they have an opportunity a female. Why do you need a favor? and they explain if I don\u2019t do X for them it won\u2019t help them get laid. This gets really annoying when they want free work to help them get laid. My goal with women isn\u2019t to obtain them even with that skill. I know women who have boyfriends and will leave them in second for me. The guys don't know this, but this is true and it\u2019s true for the males on the higher end, and especially true for the males on the higher end who are way more interested in obtaining women than I\u2019 am. 2. I\u2019m a bit way ahead and sometimes too ahead of the economy and markets. I understand for the most part how a good amount of people think. Not every thought, but generalized into actions they will take over the coming years. We are in an upward economy which means people will relax more and do risky behaviors. Relax attitude means they\u2019ll be too comfortable and think everything they do is okay and should be cool with everyone. They\u2019re also competing for social status and their attitudes will reflect this. The amount of knowledge and information they maintain isn\u2019t a great deal. So they\u2019ll use tactics as screwing someone over as an expression that they\u2019re higher social status. Other typical common strategies people use to create an illusion of higher social status is to get people to serve them, and you will see this commonly played out in the US economy. The temptation level should slowly exceed levels which most people can\u2019t resist. Infidelity and cheating should be on the rise. Over the next few years we should have a trend towards higher social status. More people will be inclined to work for themselves for all the wrong reasons, it\u2019s to be the boss, king, queen, princess, elite class, special whatever they want to call it. But for me I understand how it plays out and I\u2019m less inclined to care about it. All this means to me is which markets are going up and which ones are going down. The worst part of all nothing they do will be supported by solid ground so they will keep moving. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few things I made myself believe I can do, and there are a number of things people believe I am skilled at. Let\u2019s see for ourselves, shall we? 1: AUDIO RECORDING, MIXING AND MASTERING SKILLS: I am handy with the following tools (Software)  Fruity Loops for creating beats (instrumentals) and background sounds for short films  Adobe Audition for my recordings, mixing and mastering / editing and background sounds for short films  T-Racks for mastering (Audio) Some_Samples 2: VIDEO RECORDING AND EDITING: (ADOBE PREMIER PRO)    Directed a couple of short films and music videos  3: ARCHITECTURAL SKILLS (TRAINED ARCHITECT)  I use AutoCAD for my architectural designs. 4: WRITTEN A COUPLE OF SHORT STORIES (ABOUT 10+ TITLES TO MY NAME)  Some_Titles Most of the activities above were made/created in my home studio (the one shown below)  Which is also part of the reason why I end up burning almost every meal I try to make. Even boiled eggs and noodles end up burnt to ashes (now this should give you an idea of how much of a terrible cook I am) Half the pots in the kitchen are currently in terrible conditions  Above image is one of my cooking success stories lol Several attempts were made on how good of a Chef I might be, some ended disastrous and some\u2026.well, good in the eye but an awful taste. Whenever i intend to experiment with food, I usually invite friends to come have a taste, however, I always warn them of the possibility of upset stomach, or indigestion after that. BUT, so far, so good\u2026no one had complained, yet! And all who have tasted my meal are still alive! 5 ENGAGED IN NUMEROUS HUMANITARIAN WORK (PART OF MY 9\u20135 TASK) From 2014 to date  6: ENGAGED IN VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION WORKS. (From 2010 to date)  MADE AN ATTEMPT ON SKETCHING  lol She liked it, even said it looked better than the photo i sampled from (of course she wanted to make me feel good) Some of the things you should know about me\u2026 1: I am terrible liar, lots of giveaways when I speak what isn\u2019t the truth. 2: I always want to learn more skills, mostly for fun\u2026I think. 3: I am introverted. Sometimes my neighbours get scared thinking something happened so when worried they\u2019d call to know if I\u2019m okay BECAUSE mostly once I am home from work Friday I lock myself up until Sunday (when or if going to church that day that is). I am only opportune to work in the studio and experiment on my chef-skills during weekends so yes, I miss all the fun and the parties out there but hey\u2026someone said he\u2019s a hardcore introvert. 3: I want to be a chef when I finally retire from my 9\u20135 job and do more humanitarian services\u2026hopefully! 4: I\u2019ve got terrible business skills and ideas. THE END\u2026  Yeeeaaaah! Now, clap for Richard!!!  Source for the last two images: of course, google ",
