            "answer_text": "Forgive me for a long piece here\u2026 I probably contracted the virus about two weeks after Trump said there were only 15 cases and they were getting better. There were already 30 cases here in the area hospitals, but the test wasn\u2019t differentiating between flu or virus. My housemate and I work in the film industry and in the winter he drives for Lyft because most films shoot in Spring and Summer here for continuity. He was doing airport runs, wearing PPE (unlike many passengers), disinfecting, but was asymptomatic. I am immunosuppressed so I couldn\u2019t take hydroxychlorquine as THREE doctors including a virologist thought it was too risky. I was horribly sick for two weeks, low grade fever, weakness, unable to even climb stairs without heavy breathing as if I had run a mile. For the next two weeks the fever subsided, but I was continually coughing up junk. Worse? My young cat Cowboy disappeared and when I found him he was gasping for air. An X-ray showed he only had 15% lung capacity, but no one tied it to CoVID-19 at the time. No one knew pets could contract it. That\u2019s the story I tell those who don\u2019t think they should have to wear masks. They too could infect their family and their pets. They could get very sick and they or those they love could die. And the response? Twice it was implied I was a wimp for not taking Hydroxychloroquine even implying the doctors were wrong! One said that he talked to some nurses and they said it was no big deal. So, apparently their belief in Trump was stronger that in my physicians including one that\u2019s a family member and who helped save my life when I had a rare tumor! There was one poor kid in the Coronavirus group here that was contemplating suicide. His mother is an alcoholic and told him it was rude to wear a mask when his relatives came to help him with his truck. He was terrified he had killed them! Can you see why this might be emotional for me? I am a political writer as well as a filmmaker and I don\u2019t like Trump. I tried to remain unbiased, I agreed with psychiatrists that he\u2019s a Malignant Narcissist, his upbringing (strict mother and generous father), his trouble in school, his twisting stories to make himself sound good and the willingness to hurt even his own family. Underneath all that is someone with little self-esteem and who can\u2019t let criticism stand. That\u2019s got to be tough, but in the end it isn\u2019t President material and Republicans knew it. Then they got their tax cut through. Remember the glad-handing and slaps on the backs? I live in Detroit and like other cities with an international airport we were hit hard. I track those numbers everyday and I publish them on social media so that friends from here and those I know living here still know where we stand. People I know have died. I tried, I really did, to convince people to protect themselves. I am called names, I am called a liar, told the numbers are being inflated, etc. and then? I look at the pictures of all those people entering the gates in Tulsa and I only saw one lone Black women wearing a bandanna in a sea of White smiling faces all crowded together and not a single mask. I am done. He\u2019s killing these people and those remaining Trump supporters don\u2019t care. He marches to St. John\u2019s, doesn\u2019t inform the rector, doesn\u2019t tell those gathered in the Rose Garden for his press conference they are walking with him and NO ONE, but Ivanka is wearing a mask? The rector is mad. And what do I hear? He was caught with little boys. Really? The rector is a woman! Why don\u2019t they wear masks? Because they believe everything Trump and his propagandists say! Junior spends all day on Twitter posting comments from pal Charlie Kirk, an article from Dinesh D\u2019Souza, some parrot on Fox saying the virus is no big deal. Six or eight people that were the advance team in Tulsa are now sick, the Secret Service are getting sick and Trump\u2019s so hopped up on Adderall and Hydroxychloroquine he can\u2019t manage a glass of water or stand straight. I can\u2019t explain it. I started writing about politics over a decade ago and it\u2019s like Night of the Living Dead! Where did all these racists come from, this name calling hoard that will only listen to Trump. I have never seen anything like it. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s set the politics aside, because that has no bearing. I have met people from all walks of life that are anti-mask. There are children, all the way up to octogenarians. There are far left radical communists and socialists, through the moderate spectrums, clear out to radical anarchists. Men, women, trans. From the richest to the poorest. Black, white, Asian, Hispanic\u2026It\u2019s not easily pigeonholed. That said, Because of the vast diversity of anti-mask wearing, you can\u2019t truly pin it on one single belief, and in fact there are as many reasons for not wearing a mask as there are people not wearing them. Some people believe the virus is a hoax. Some believe it\u2019s just a cold.Some believe the masks don\u2019t work.Some believe it\u2019s some thought experiment for government control or some other conspiracy theory.Some will point out the historically proven medical issues with mask wearing.Some will say it\u2019s the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d and refuse on religious reasons. Then there are many other reasons.Some have PTSD from a traumatic event and can\u2019t have anything over their mouth.Some have respiratory issues and have trouble breathing through them.Some claustrophobic people can\u2019t do it.Autistic people sometimes struggle with something on their face.Hearing impaired people can\u2019t read lips to communicate.Some people with anxiety issues have panic attacks wearing something over their face.Some people with depression can\u2019t handle the facelessness. And, of course, some people just don\u2019t want to. In every case, they have every right not to wear one for their own reason, and nobody should judge them for it. I personally do not, have not, and will not wear a mask. It\u2019s my choice to make, not anyone else\u2019s. I don\u2019t have to share reasons with anyone as to why, because it\u2019s not their business why, but I will here.I have put a mask on once for about 20 minutes. In that 20 minutes, my heart rate rapidly climbed, I struggled to breathe. Not from breathing through the cloth, but because it was inducing a panic attack. I turned my back to people constantly and pulled it off my face when I didn\u2019t have to face anyone. The only reason I wore it was to say goodbye to a feline family member. I wasn\u2019t going to be absent in his last moments, and you bet none of his family had masks over their faces during those last minutes. We all wanted him to see our faces, not masks. I also am not a very emotionally driven person. I would rather die from a result of my beliefs than live restricted for someone else\u2019s emotions. I would never want someone to sacrifice any part of their life for me. I don\u2019t think anyone is worth that. For me, life is all about freedom to make what you want out of life. When it comes to government work, the only things that matter to me are logic, facts and truth. With the mask debate, a lot of people will use emotional arguments like \u201cyou\u2019re ok with killing your grandma because you won\u2019t wear a mask?\u201d No, that\u2019s not how it works. If I\u2019m afraid of killing my grandma, I stay away from her (kind of easy when she died 7 years ago, but you get the idea). But I would never tell the government to force compliance on someone else for my own fear.I also analyze the statistics and see what the best action FOR ME would be. I didn\u2019t wear a mask in the beginning like most people didn\u2019t. I was waiting to see how severe it would be. When they started reported 1%, 2% death rates with 0.01% of the population infected, I didn\u2019t bother. When the list of symptoms was released\u2026I felt no need to do anything different than what I do for flu season\u2026which is nothing different to how I live my life anyways. So far, I\u2019ve been fine. Now, with all that said, I believe that myself and my kids have all had it already. Before testing was available. Back in January. I had most of the symptoms except the loss of smell. I had a high fever that wouldn\u2019t break, mild trouble breathing, a cough, no stomach issues or anything like that. Headache. I even told my wife, who thought it was the flu, that I have had the flu, and this wasn\u2019t it. It was something else. I work in IT and can work from home, and I couldn\u2019t even do that for a week because I was so sick. The second week I was able to work from home. The third week I had to work from home because my kid was sick. It was a month later that I finally started to feel normal again, after almost 2 months. My kids, who even when they get the flu, are over it in a couple days, were out of school for a week and would get exhausted quick for a week or two after. But at that time, there was no covid in the US, much less the ability to test. By the time we started being able to test for it, I had been recovered for months, and they wouldn\u2019t develop an antibody test for a couple months after that. Then it was found that we only keep antibodies for 3\u20134 months, so I knew that would come up negative. The only answer for what I had, was covid, but I had no way of proving it. So my opinion on masks, is based on my own experiences. I suggest that everyone do the same thing and decide for themselves what is best for them. It\u2019s not our job to protect everyone in the world. As they say in the safety presentation before flying, \u201cin the event we lose cabin pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the ceiling. Please put yours on first before assisting anyone else.\u201d You have to look out for yourself first, before you can help anyone else. ",
