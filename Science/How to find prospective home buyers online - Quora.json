            "answer_text": "Are you looking to research the needs of home buyers in order to inform a product or service you\u2019re creating? If so, find home buyers online and then smile and dial :) Also, try going offline as well if you need to understand the customer. What I did recently was put together a market research questionnaire to research rental property owners.  I also created a spreadsheet for collecting results and notes. Next, I went to any and all rental listing sites such as Craigslist, Zillow, or Trulia, and handpicked a random sample of rental listings with phone numbers and some info about the rental. I gave them a call and ran through my script\u2014sticking to a consistent set of questions across all participants with minor tweaks as I had conversations and learned what didn\u2019t work. These people were once home buyers so this exercise may be useful for you as well. Otherwise, I think these are some highlights of ways to find home buyers online: Online forums: Check out BiggerPockets where real estate investors who are looking to buy, the Personal Finance Subreddit. Here\u2019s a popular post about advice for first time home buyers.Run a Targeted Paid Social Campaign: Create a landing page or use Facebook\u2019s lead ads advertising tool and run a paid social ad campaign. Offer a small gift card or amount for completing a customer development survey or call. Capture their name, email, phone, maybe location. Set targeting to local neighborhood or community Facebook groups where local residents are likely fans or group members.Go to Local Meetups: I think the best way to develop an understanding of your customer is to go OFFLINE instead of solely ONLINE. Check out local Real Estate Meetups on Meetup.Verify Ownership: Make sure no one is free-loading off your Facebook ad. Check title record database to confirm person is owner of their property.Best of luck! The selling part is also interesting\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "When you find a reliable system of locating homebuyers who are qualified and ready to purchase please call me directly and I will help you turn it into a multi-million dollar business. I know that sounds flippant but the truth is a homebuyer is anyone who at that moment needs to purchase a home. Therefore it's a question of locating people you know at the right moment and offering to assist them based on your professional experience. That's essentially what an agent tries to do with their marketing plan. Try using Facebook ads targeted to your geography. It helps tremendously to have a sexy property photo to click on in your ad.
