            "answer_text": "Q: How does rejecting science make America great? The states has about 1/25th of the world\u2019s population. Let\u2019s be generous and call it 5% of humanity. And yet, in most areas, 50% or more of the top universities are in the USA. Medicine, physics, astronomy, materials sciences, etc. There is zero indication that \u201cAmerica rejects science\u201d. The statement \u201crejecting science\u201d sounds like something picked up in a media story. And unsurprisingly, ironically even, is a non-scientific claim, with no data or study to back it up. Go figure. Just a baseless accusation. Flawed.      ",

One of greatest (actual) scientific minds alive today from Princeton University explained CO2 is really lower than we need it at 400 ppm. (Better at 1200 ppm). Checkout Professor Happer on YouTube. \u201cAccepting science\u201d is President Trump\u2019s greatest single accomplishment in 1st term of 2 amazing terms. Yes - Republicans acclaimed SCIENCE.
