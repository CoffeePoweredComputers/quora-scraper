            "answer_text": "Your parents are probably right.  Prestige is in the eye of the beholder, and matters little, despite what some people obsess over.  All of the curricula you've cited are interesting, and have a decent future.  Materials science is a quiet yet incredibly important field. Aerospace engineering is too, as we're in the middle of a complete rethink of commercial air transport systems, propulsion systems and associated logistics.  The automotive industry is at a wonderful crossroads as well, with propulsion systems, instrumentation, control systems, materials, battery technology, etc, changing rapidly.  Wearables may be trendy on tech blog sites, but as a serious field, its hard to say if it becomes something real, or was the flavor of the month in the press, and no one really cares.   Renewable energy is pretty awesome too,  as we're at some serious crossroads there as well (although the industry was heavily over invested, with disproportionate results unfortunately) Transferring may not get you anything other than having to get used to another schools meal plan.  For undergrad, just pick a discipline, do well, and if you love it, find a grad school where there's authentic real work being done (like automotive eng at Clemson as an example). ",
