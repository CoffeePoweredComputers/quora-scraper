            "answer_text": "Define what do you mean by \"good\" in a particular subject. Does this subject excite you? Or you get good marks. The career after 10ths change considerably. You have an important decision. But it's not hard. I made this decision before I even passed my 10ths. Electrons, Protons, Neutrons, Stars excited me. I was in love with Science. That made me what I am today. I could cope with pressure. Does your family pressure you? If Yes, please made them read this. Hello uncle/aunty, I am a stranger. I know he is very important to you but what do you think about what he should take after 10ths. He is 15-16 years in age, and probably needs to take some decisions. After 18, He/She will need to make a lot of decisions, and I think he should do this one decision on his own. If he takes Arts, he can have a very bright career, if he takes up Commerce, he can be as valuable as any Engineer. And if he takes up Science, he will still be your son and he will have to study as hard as any other good Arts or Commerce student would have to. A few people can't do it. The decisions, which make them vulnerable to psychiatric and social problems. Because, if you want to ride a vehicle, you must start slowly. In midst of traffic, you can't learn.  and if he doesn't make a few successful decisions, he won't. There are successful people in every department. And if he has the commitment, He will shine. If there is just one seat. (for example in astronomy, there are very few seats) he will make sure it is his. Let me tell you a story. A american man, Sgt. Jerrod Fields, he tripped a bomb and one of his leg got injured. On the bed, he needed to take a very important decision. The decision was, whether he would have a surgery and retire from the Army. Because his leg won't be strong enough to handle the stress of the U.S Army. Another option was to have a prosthetic leg and stay in the U.S Army. It is a no-brainer but he said, \"Cut it off! I need to go back ot Iraq!\". He is now training to be a sprinter in the Olympics and serving the Army. Here is a picture of him. He can run 100 metres in 12.54 seconds, many of healthy men can't achieve this, because they don't have that commitment ( ref: HeroPortraits.org: Jerrod Fields )  Now, this is a story worth noting. Commitment makes one work. And if you give your love to your child. He can be the next Olympian, Musician, Scientist. Being an Engineer isn't of extraordinary value. Why run after Success when Excellence is knocking your doors. Now, coming back to India, I have acute migraine. And yet, I code day and night. My passion of computers and coding started when I was eight. And I am on the verge of starting my own startup. Which I am constructing right now. I am no engineer, I must admit. Neither am I a doctor. I don't judge people by their \"status\", but their values. Not their looks, but their hearts. Not their degree, but their education. Whatever you study, follow that. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, But stay committed. God bless you. Be a human ",
