            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is most essential for the survival of plants. Unlike us the plants have the capability to convert CO2 and Water into organic molecules such as glucose or fats or starch, and proteins. They can convert one form of energy into food energy using solar energy. Only plants have this monopoly on photosynthesis, and they are called autotrophs. They use products of photosynthesis for growth, maintenance, reproduction, repair, excretion and storage of food during unfavourable times. We humans and animals use so many of \u2018their\u2019 savings for our selfish use! ",

            "answer_text": " Photosynthesis is a process through which green plants create energy using carbon dioxide and water. The process requires a chemical called chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color and allows them to absorb light. Chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis and makes leaves green.  Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This glucose is utilised by the plants in respiration to produce energy to carry out all the life . Plants use photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates from inorganic substrates. All organisms need energy to grow and reproduce. Many organisms (including all plants) use cellular respiration to produce ATP, which is used for cellular energy. The respiration reaction uses carbohydrates like glucose as a substrate. Whereas humans eat food to provide the fuel for respiration, plants make their own through photosynthesis. Without photosynthesis, plants would not have carbohydrates for respiration. In addition, the carbohydrates produced in photosynthesis are also used to build plant cell structures, like the cellulose cell wall.  ",
