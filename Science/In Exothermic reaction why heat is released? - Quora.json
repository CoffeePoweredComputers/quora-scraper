            "answer_text": "Exothermic chemical reactions often produce an increase in temperature. In exothermic reactions, the bond energies of the reactants are less than the bond energies of the products. As a result, less energy is needed to break the bonds in the reactants than is released during the formation of the products. This energy difference between reactants and products is often released as heat. The release of heat causes a change in the temperature of the reaction mixture. Even though energy is released by exothermic reactions, some energy must first be added to break bonds in the reactants. In exothermic reactions, the formation of bonds in the products releases more energy. Overall, more energy is released than is added. Some reactions are highly exothermic. These reactions produce a great deal of heat and significantly raise the temperature of their surroundings. One example is the reaction of powdered aluminum metal with iron oxide. This reaction is known as the thermite reaction. The equation for this reaction is 2Al + Fe2O3 \u2014 \u2014Al2O3 + 2Fe This reaction releases enough heat to melt the iron that is produced. In fact, this reaction is used to weld iron rails together. ",

            "answer_text": "Exothermic reactions convert chemical energy (enthalpy) inside chemical substances into heat energy. The chemical energy decreases, and the heat energy increases (total energy is conserved).Any reaction requires the necessary bonds in the reactants to be broken - this requires energy to be supplied, so heat energy is taken in. We call this amount of energy the Activation Energy for the reaction.In an EXOTHERMIC reaction, the amount of energy needed to break the necessary bonds in the reactants is LESS than the amount of heat energy released when the bonds in the products are made.That's why a lot of amount of energy is released in order to stabalize the bond and to stabalize that compound and also the bondSimply we can say that in exothermic reaction heat is released only to stabalize the compound.",
