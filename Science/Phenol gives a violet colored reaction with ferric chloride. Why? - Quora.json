            "answer_text": "The sample is dissolved in water, or a mixture of water and ethanol, and a few drops of dilute ferric chloride solution is added. The formation of a red, blue, green, or purple coloration indicates the presence of phenols. Phenols form a violet complex with Fe(III)+, which is intensely colored. Acid-base reactions result in neutralization and a precipitate, ligand-exchanges cause a color change. Excitation of electrons also causes colour change. ",
