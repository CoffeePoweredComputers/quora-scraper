            "answer_text": "Disadvantages of Globalization: Background Much of the globalization has happened in the manufacturing sector (not defense or education or agriculture or textile sectors or aviation sector). Much of these globalization has happened in daily consumer goodsThe West has a advantage of having started the manufacturing much before the East. So it has some early mover advantageEast enjoys tropical climate and abundant rains. It can count atleast THREE crops a year, while some areas FOUR crops in an year. The agriculture was using natural manures only till bio-hybrid varieties started coming followed by chemical & nitrogenous fertiliers. So East was purely organic food, till it fell for Western technology, organic food became chemical food.to West does not have agricultural benefits as East (exclude USA). Considering South America as part of East for this discussion. East is the termed used to denote direction East & also pure forms i.e. uncorrupted, unadulterated. West being exactly opposite.West including USA has exhausted their iron ore reservers and have no alternatively to source from South Ameria, India, Australia. Australia looking for growth committed itself to sell all types of mineral ore to China to sustain its country finances. This includes Uranium & Plutonium reserves.Trade treaties are drawn intelligently, to give advantage to West, & in return impose the treatise on poor / underdeveloped countries in return make them pay heavily for the technology i.e. sell polluting technology first, then make them use it, make them polluters first & then sell technology to clean the pollution !!!India, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia were the cotton growers of the world, till man made fibres (polyester, acrynl, artificial silk\u2026etc..) destroyed the cotton market. In 1960\u2019s, 70\u2019s 80\u2019s man made fibres ruled, rich man\u2019s dress, while cotton was poor man dress. Now it is vice-versa.Analysis With the above forming a small background, MBA\u2019s started to learn marketing - strategic marketing, where they would source material from those countries which were rich in that material, import it, do finishing processing, put their label & sell - make maximum profit. i.e. potatoes from rest of the word landed in USA, who made potato chips and sold to rest of the world, till the locals understood the economics of profit in it, started local units, without global or country foot print, many such local brands coming up, restricted th unrestricted profit growth of Western countries.In this onslaught of technology on \u201cmanual handicrafts\u201d countries, with sleek marketing became - White vs Rest of the world (dark & black skin). In an real incident, an knowledgeable American hadsome furniture breakdown & wanted to repair it, being a technocrat arranged a skilled carpenter with basic hand tools only (without scale or spirit level\u2026etc.) & charged a nominal amount for the repair work, to which American friend surprised & handed him multiples of the invoice to him as bonus for the good work i.e. a ladies hair comb done with normal tools, with each bristle same thickness, space / gap maintained, all in straight line - with carpenter\u2019s eye only being the scale !!! American was tired of machining, had tough time trying to explain how it is done manually !!! Back home, a machine finish was appreciated than manual finish !!! Vagaries of the world & tastes.So world gets Uranium from Australia & block others getting it !!! Globalization does not work here !!!The soil of Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, India, China Malaysia does not require fertilizers (mostly), it has been organic for many centuries / decades now, but they do not create brands but West did - Organic & made standard that the cultivated land shall be 1000 acres, when an ordinary farmer in these countries had 1 acre land only. Canada, USA have vast uncultivated land, no manpower to cultivate also, production is much more than local consumption, but cannot sell to the world without giving subsidies.Addition on 16-Oct-2016. Unable to take time to delve deeper into this question & answer. Some field notes drawn from internet sources, but not well written, it is hazy \u2026. will later give pin point perceptive answers\u2026. Globalization can ruin the environment. Moving things from one area to another wastes oil, etc. Globalization can ruin local economies. There is a movement that wants to buy local - especially organic foods. Globalization can lead to hyper-specialization, which can be good, but also negative. There is something great about being a generalist. Also what if something goes wrong. To know things generally give an incredible perspective that specialists do not have. Globalization can be driven by people with \"know how\" and power and they can systematically fleece the world. Due to globalization, many local brands and businesses in poorer developing countries go bankrupt and can't survive the economic might of these rich countries. Local cultures and traditions change. People no longer wear national costumes because they all want to look like Hollywood stars and wear jeans, for example. People want to become \"American\" and consume everything American. Also because of globalization, more and more people are learning and speaking English to the detriment of local languages. There are more international schools and the focus now is on the acquisition of this global language rather than their own L1 or mother tongue. \u00b7 Developed countries can stifle development of undeveloped and under-developed countries. \u00b7 Economic depression in one country can trigger adverse reaction across the globe. \u00b7 It can increase spread of communicable diseases. \u00b7 Companies face much greater competition. This can put smaller companies, at a disadvantage as they do not have resources to compete at global scale. \u00b7 increases the gap between the poor and rich.-income inequalities-poverty trap- \u00b7 environmental harm-resources are used up-scarcity-creates externalities-pollution-waste products \u00b7 skewed demand more of skilled workers and causing redundancy of skilled workers \u00b7 Globalisation is direct attack on local tiny and small industry. Global companies with deep pockets and cause havoc to local traditional small and medium industriesIncreases cut throat competition.Globalisation increases monopoly by countries equipped with know-how and power.Inconsistency in Consumer Needs: American consumer will be different from the South African. Global marketing should be able to address that.Consumer Response Inconsistency: Consumer in one country may react differently than a consumer in another country.Country Specific Brand and Product: A Japanese might like a product to have a traditional touch, whereas an American might like to add a retro modern look to it. In this case, a global strategy is difficult to devise.Exploitation of Underdeveloped Countries:Multinational Corporations (MNCs), based in developed countries, purchase at lower rates the raw materials from backward countries, process them in their own countries and sell the manufactured goods with big profit in backward countries. Increase in Unemployment:The MNCs employ machines to reduce the number of employees: they are capital intensive rather labor. Further, the governments of developing countries have started withdrawing investment from industries in the public sector. All this has led to huge unemployment in those countries. Widening of Rich-poor Gap:Globalization brings benefits to the rich who are small in number and keeps the vast majority of people in poverty and misery. It is a game of winners and losers. Those who are already rich succeed in taking advantage of privatization while the poor and weak are doomed to suffer. Harmful Effects of Consumerism:Globalization produces consumerism. People being attracted by attractive goods and advertisements, want to buy these goods. They would not hesitate to earn money for this by unfair means. This has resulted in vast increase in corruption and other social evils. Adverse Effects on Social Security and Social Welfare:Because of privatization, governments in many developing countries are withdrawing from the sector of social welfare, and private companies have entered educations, health and other such fields related to .. as a result of this, poor people are facing a lot of difficulties. Harmful Effects on Small Industries and Small Business:In the free economy, the big fish has got license to eat the small fish. Small-scale and cottage industries cannot grow in competition with big ones. Cultural Homogenization:Globalization would lead to cultural homogenization. Each nation/society has its own distinct culture, but under globalization the cultures of developing countries are eroded and they are required to accept the values and norms of developed countries. Hostile to Humanism:Globalization would kill humanism. It aims at accelerating economic growth, and economic growth, according to its protagonists, can be quickly attained through privatization. Pursuit of growth hardly respects human values. Erosion of Democracy:Globalization has led to the weakening, erosion and even destruction of democracy. Globalization has considerably increased the wealth and power of multinational corporations and they have tended to interfere with and control the economic policy and politics of developing countries. Gender-Insensitive: Globalization is gender-insensitive. Women have suffered a lot under globalization. In the privatized economy, the interests and concerns of women, particularly of poor women, have been seriously ignored. Destructive of Environment: Globalization would destroy environment. In the name of economic development, environment is blindly destroyed. International bodies like the World Trade Organization infringe on national and individual sovereignty\u00b7 Increase in the chances of civil war within developing countries and open war between developing countries as they vie for resources\u00b7 Decreases in environmental integrity as polluting corporations take advantage of weak regulatory rules in developing countries Increased likelihood of economic disruptions in one nation effecting all nationsCorporate influence of nation-states far exceeds that of civil society organizations and average individualsThreat that control of world media by a handful of corporations will limit cultural expressionGreater chance of reactions for globalization being violent in an attempt to preserve cultural heritageGreater risk of diseases being transported unintentionally between nationsSpread of a materialistic lifestyle and attitude that sees consumption as the path to prosperityInternational bodies like the World Trade Organization infringe on national and individual sovereigntyIncrease in the chances of civil war within developing countries and open war between developing countries as they vie for resourcespeople from other countries come to ours for a small amount of money which is good for them but for us it eliminates jobs since we cost more money than people from other countriesIt also causes greater risk of diseases being transferred across countriesGreater chances of reactions for globalization being violent in attempt t preserve cultural heritageEffects of Globalization enhancement in the information flow between geographically remote locations\u00b7 the global common market has a freedom of exchange of goods and capital\u00b7 there is a broad access to a range of goods for consumers and companies\u00b7 worldwide production markets emerge\u00b7 free circulation of people of different nations leads to social benefits\u00b7 global environmental problems like cross-boundary pollution, over fishing on oceans, climate changes are solved by discussions\u00b7 more trans-border data flow using communication satellites, the Internet, wireless telephones, etc.\u00b7 international criminal courts and international justice movements are launched\u00b7 It is claimed that globalization increases the economic prosperity and opportunity in the developing world. The civil liberties are enhanced and there is a more efficient use of resources. All the countries involved in the free trade are at a profit.. In two decades from 1981 to 2001, the number of people surviving on $1 or less per day decreased from 1.5 billion to 1.1 billion. Simultaneously, the world population also increased. Thus, the percentage of such people decreased from 40% to 20% in such countries.\u00b7 It has increased inequality and environmental degradation.\u00b7 In many poorer nations, globalization is the result of foreign businesses utilizing workers in a country to take advantage of the lower wage rates.\u00b7 Brain Drain-Opportunities in rich countries drives talent away from poor countries, leading to brain drains.\u00b7 Income Inequality\u00b7 The globalization of the job market has had negative consequences in developed countries. \u201cMind workers\u201d (engineers, attorneys, scientists, professors, executives, journalists, consultants) are able to compete successfully in the world market and command high wages. Conversely, production workers and service workers in industrialized nations are unable to compete with workers in third world countries and either lose their jobs through outsourcing or are forced to accept wage cuts\u00b7 the loss of smaller cultures that don't become globalized.\u00b7 stamping out of local unique-ness that formerly defined each area and made people want to visit in the first place\u00b7 increased dominance of one particular set of beliefs that could cause more people to be close-minded in the long term\u00b7 The most common complaint is that globalization has only served to make the rich even richer while making the poor poorer. It is the general feeling that for managers, it is a great benefit while for nature and workers, globalization is hell.\u00b7 Multinationals have been accused of unfair working conditions and social injustice. They have also been accused of not caring so much for the environment, ecological damage as well as natural resource mismanagement. ",

            "answer_text": "Increased income and wealth disparity. Globalization means that everyone will be set on the same stage, and naturally having more people means that there are more income and wealth disparity. If you have 10,000,000 people, the distance between the richest person and the poorest is likely to be larger than if you have 10,000. Now, globalization means that it\u2019s likely that the richest person and the poorest person actually can live in the same country, and this creates domestic problemsRelated to above note, intense competition. With technology enabling people to work across long distance, in some industries people are starting to compete not in the local arena, but on a global arena. A software developer may not be competing with people living in the same area in skill and cost, but also competing with people living in India. It means that just being the best in the class is no longer enough, you need to be the best in the world, and the person who stole your job is not going to be some guy in your city, but some dude on the other side of the earth. This creates a lot of anxiety, especially while jobs and income can be globalized, cost of living cannot (yet), so it is difficult to live in NY but trying to compete against people in India earning an Indian wageExport of pollution. Modern day technology does decrease pollution, but most of the cleaning up we see is the result of these pollution gets exported. Does manufacturing certain goods create pollution? Just buy these finished goods from China or Vietnam, and let those guys pollute their country. In the short term, it hides pollution where you can\u2019t see them, but in the long run it doesn\u2019t work. We live on the same earth, and pollutants can and do travel. Even if they don\u2019t, there are global effects on pollution such as global warming.",

            "answer_text": "Most damming criticism of globalization is from the perspective of sustainable development. When you consider polluting the Mother Earth as the biggest problem, and not the cost of producing goods, then globalization becomes one of the worst offender. In the name of globalization companies have propped up industries that are abusive to their labor force, natural resources and human right issues. Look at BRIC countries \u2014 they have gone to burn more carbon fuel, destroy their natural resources and are often charged with use of exploitation of their labor force by not providing due wages and working conditions. All this has happened for simple reason \u2014 businesses have put in more emphasis on profit margin, and cost of production while ignoring climate and human values. This has led to many issues indirectly \u2014 Distruction of natural resources \u2014 e.g. rain forest in Brazil and south east AsiaDistruction of local and indigenous industry and handicraft \u2014 due to cheaper option from across the globeViolation of workers human rights \u2014 sweat shops of China, India and all over third world are testamentsEconomic disparities \u2014 because only handful of people in the society benefit from globalizationFinally, the political tribalism all over the western worldIt must also be said \u2014 I am for globalization, but exporting Coal from US to China for cheap production is abuse of the term \u201cGlibalization\u201d. I do believe that Globalization has done more good than bad. Going forward it ought to be rationalized. I would also mention that I do not support the Tribalism and Populist moments across the globe \u2014 tarriffs, anti-immigration, etc. are worst ideas to reform globalization and will take the world back to Iron Age. There is one very good documentary on this topic \u2014 Years Of Living Dangerously Must watch. ",

            "answer_text": "ADVANTAGES In terms of trade and industry: There would be minimum chance of surplus of a good when a state is engaging to International Trade.It\u2019s a positive sum game, everyone gains in trade in the grounds of International Economics.In terms of people and culture: Globalization promotes richer and more diverse culture and fosters the idea of Global citizenship through multiculturalism.Globalization of migration (movement of people from one place to another) helps reduce any labor shortages in the receiving country.DISADVANTAGES In terms of trade and Industry: In the lens of International Economics, competition is inevitable in the Global arena.Although it\u2019s a positive sum game, the gains of country A is different from the gains of country B. Thus, not all states has an equal footing in International Trade.In terms of people and culture: With the rise of multiculturalism through globalization, sense of nationalism or national identity of a state would gradually diminish.With the free movement of people, the receiving state would eventually enhance their national security for the welfare of her citizens due to conflict of religion and culture.Globalization could be detrimental to the citizens of the receiving country due to the decrease of job opportunities. In line with this, the hosting country would also be affected due to the fact that the citizens that are departing are highly trained individuals thus, affects the country\u2019s efficiency.",
