But give some thought to the quality of life and salary you hope to achieve since these will be mostly determined by your career choice. Many young doctors are extremely frustrated because the hours are very long and it\u2019s many years before they\u2019re making decent money and have paid off their loans. It can be frustrating to not be able to afford to buy a new car until you\u2019re in your 40\u2019s while your classmates were living the good life beginning in their 20\u2019s. In other words, a career choice isn\u2019t just about what school subjects you\u2019ve done well at.

Just from those interests I would look into biomedical engineering or chemical engineering. Can you tell I have a bias towards engineering? I admit I do. Try and find some people that are working in jobs you think might be a fit for you and see if anything comes to mind.
