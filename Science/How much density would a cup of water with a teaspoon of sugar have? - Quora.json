            "answer_text": "How accurate do you need an answer? It would be very near the density of water. 1 g/ml. My suspicion is slightly more, maybe 1.01 g/ml. I assume you don't have access to standard lab ware or you wouldn't be asking the question. Take a tall narrow glass, put a cup of water in it and mark it precisely. Put a spoonful of sugar in it and wait for it to dissolve. If the volume went up, the density went down. If the volume stayed the same or went down (that can actually happen with some solutes) the density went up. ",
