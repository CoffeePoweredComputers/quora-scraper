            "answer_text": "In reactions you have seen before (General chemistry, you have an equilibrium, you have reactants and products in a balanced equation.  You balance it, calculate moles, determine the limiting reagent if possible, get moles of product in theory and calculate Keq and crunch numbers. In organic chemistry, you will unlearn all that. Not the basics, the strictness of equations in general. The constant back and forth to calculate molar mass\u2026rearranging gas laws.. You do not need a calculator perhaps ever. You balance nothing, you don\u2019t really care what\u2019s limiting, You\u2019ll study acids put never calculate a pH. if you hate chemistry because of math you may love organic chemistry especially if it clicks. It happens to people at some point when the seemingly non-related info dump begins to have common themes. This is the form of most organic reactions.  You start with a substrate (starting material) and add something (reagent/solvent) and you have a product (C) which you must predict. Given A and B you must predict C. Given B and C you must deduce what you started with from the product. Given A and C you must predict what B must have been. These questions represent the majority of what you will do in organic organic chemistry: Given two knowns, determine the unknown. Your solution takes on this form: The question is what do you add (B)? Often there is more than one step required the further you progress.  It turns out B cannot be one step. If it were, this would be done. This is synthesis. How many steps will it take? Here we think backward or retro-synthetically. Switch these two A and C. Can you go back step by step using reactions you know? If you do you\u2019ll solve it in the fewest number of steps. Planning in the forward direction leads to lengthy dead ends. First you have to activate the nucleophile. That\u2019s what\u2019s in box A. You must determine whether it is a nucleophile or electrophile and then proceed.  As a nucleophile you can greatly accelerate this reaction which is attack of the ortho carbon on carbon dioxide a strong electrophile in the Kolbe-Schmidt reaction. Another thing about organic chemistry, is unlike the reactions you did in general chemistry there are many reactions named for the discoverer (first to publish) which you must be familiar with. Ok we\u2019ve activated phenol. It\u2019s negatively charged and when carbon dioxide is added\u2026  We\u2019re almost there. We made the most important bond (C-C). We want a carboxylic acid not a salt which is soluble in water and therefore can\u2019t be extracted. The final step is always workup \u2014neutralization with acid or base. If you end up with an ion, you must neutralize it at the end to be neutral.  as you learn, it becomes common sense if you\u2019re doing it repeatedly, even a little, with some regularity, you\u2019ll get there. Cram and the subject will be out of reach forever. Now the steps can be ordered (sequence matters). This is B which has three steps for the transformation you chose. Your equation is:  The form of an equation in organic chemistry as you can see is quite different. It is structurally based. In former equations you\u2019ve used, all that mattered is that it was balanced so you could calculate some value. We care about the structure of the substrate and the final product and focus on getting there as efficiently as possible. The details about what happens will be explained because you must reproduce these details in the other unknown on exams\u2014the mechanism.  The mechanism, D is your responsibility to know or be able to draw for any reaction mentioned in lecture. This is the most important thing you can learn to do in this subject. It is a step-by-step story of how the product was made. Here is part of it:  This is what the process of solving problems evolves into. On exams: Given two chemicals, determine the outcome. Maybe a 5\u20136 step synthesis. In synthetic organic chemistry: Given a target (cure for toe fungus or cancer or diabetes or autoimmunity) get there in the fewest steps possible as fast as possible. This was the subject of my dissertation.  It\u2019s a pharmaceutical. Anyone who gets a transplant must suppress their bodies own defenses against \u201cother\u201d recognition. The body would attack and kill the organ or tissue. So they must take it the remainder of their lives. ",

            "answer_text": "My primary college major was in biochemistry (computational) and I will be answering for the undergraduate level (and a few graduate chemistry classes I took with permission). I took organic chemistry and general chemistry classes for my major, as they were pre-reqs for biochemistry. I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re referring to those two. In short, it isn\u2019t much harder at all. I will point out at a high level, both can get incredibly difficult in their own right. I personally didn\u2019t have much issue with general chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and organic chemistry as the quantitative math and synthesis pathways both came naturally to me and I quickly understood concepts - but I wouldn\u2019t say one is easier than the other, and rather the difference in difficulty perception is more of how you organize the information in your mind, as well as pre-existing knowledge. I have also tutored people in both chemistry and organic chemistry courses. I realized natural understanding doesn\u2019t always come to others easily and may require coaching in a structured environment. Often I see the difficulty for others appears to lie in either quantitative skills and/or spatial thinking overall, particularly for organic chemistry - spatial reasoning is often the pain point. Pre-med folks taking this class tend to rote memorize only if they are taking this class, but this is not the right way to go in this specific subject, especially if you need to know how to manipulate a molecule in more than 3 steps for synthesis, the number of combinations for memorization would require too much time. The big picture understanding part is often more important for figuring out how to synthesize complex molecules, and I personally found organic chemistry not as memory heavy, rather biochemistry required much more memory at the undergraduate level. And although you need memory, application with spatial thinking is often the issue for those who already have a strong memory (memory is an underrated skill though!). What I noticed tends to work for others in organic chemistry is using ball-and-stick models to learn concepts cold, as well as tons and tons of practice questions, especially since synthesis was heavily tested for my clients. Ideally, the concepts of these practice questions are spaced out in optimal length intervals. Once the student realizes what spatial visualization is needed, learns a set of heuristics (resonance, hybridization, electronegativity etc), and does select high yield practice questions that I expect to be tested, they tend to do very well and it comes easy, sometimes even better than their general chemistry class (which tends to be algebra/physics heavy, and might be more familiar to some people if they had high school pre-existing knowledge). I realize that some people have trouble with finances and/or may feel they don\u2019t need to get more tutoring hours, but getting the right amount of minimum tutoring hours and self-study hours is important. For memorization of the basic \u201clanguage\u201d part of organic chemistry nomenclature, I generally advise self-study with Anki instead, as I believe that the best tutors doesn\u2019t really need to sell more hours than necessary (note I don\u2019t offer tutoring services right now). I personally didn\u2019t even need to sell more hours as I got really busy with clients during the semester way back. The problem I see for most clients is finding a good tutor. I will note if they already had a strong natural working memory for spatial thinking and already had learned the material ahead of time that tends to help a lot too. Most people cannot easily cram organic chemistry unless you are basically a Mozart of Organic Chemistry. Finally, this may also depend on the test questions in your institution. Mine was heavy on pure synthesis questions for organic chemistry, while general chemistry was multiple choice. ",
