            "answer_text": "Your assumption is not accurate. Disturbances or vibration of particles of matter causes mechanical waves, and the matter that waves are traveling through is called a \u2018medium\u2019. Electromagnetic waves are not mechanical waves; electrical fields and magnetic fields couple together to form electromagnetic waves. These waves do not need a \u2018medium\u2019 to travel through; they can travel through vacuum. The best example of an electromagnetic wave is light \u2013 and you are aware that light travels through the vacuum of space. The signals used to maintain satellites and the space station are carried by radio waves, another part of the electromagnetic spectrum. ",

The space is the planum of plasma with free subatomic particles of free ambient ectrons, protons and neutrons with 99.9% in the vacuumed space. These universal oceanic particles behaves as the mediums of different waves to carry the informations signals through the respective waves such as light and radio waves and other related electromagnetic waves throughout the space.
