            "answer_text": "Summary: Remove hidden subsidies on other forms of electricity generation and provide accurate accounting and costing for negative externalities. Under accurate, level-playing field accounting, renewables are much less expensive than alternatives and would be built out much more rapidly. There would still be a place for significant hydro and nuclear for base load, coal would disappear and natural gas would be used much more sparingly. The US Production Tax Credit (PTC) and the various Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) programs attempt to level the playing field without unwinding decades of entrenched mechanisms that tilt the market heavily in favour of traditional forms of generation. Eliminate hidden subsidies for fossil fuels and fossil fuel generation. In the United States, credible estimates of annual fossil fuel subsidies range from $10 billion to $52 billion annually.[1]  [5]  [9] Eliminate hidden subsidies and support for nuclear power.  [2] Require coal generation to pay more or all of its negative externalities of 17.8 cents / KWh:  [3] Quantify and require natural gas generation to pay some or all of the negative externalities of fracking, GHGs (50 times higher than wind or nuclear although much better than coal) and pollution, presumed to be lower than coal but still in the range of 5-10 cents per KWh. [4]  [6]  [8] Removing these hidden subsidies which society is paying makes the costs of wind -- currently at 5-8 cents per KWh in decent sites and expected to be at grid parity by 2014 -- and solar seem like a bargain.

            "answer_text": "We can't, not in any feasible time frame, in fact the expectation feeds unrealism and eventually disappointment. Even if all electricity were made from other sources (which is itself unrealistic). A far more pragmatic and useful action would be to minimise how much fossil fuel we use, and to diversify our sources of energy. This is in fact already taking place. Here's my list: Improve the efficiency of energy use. This is a big topic, but take for example the European Building Performance Directive (EBPD: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/buildings/buildings_en.htm). The framework requires all buildings to have an energy efficiency certificate, imposes nation-wide building regulations on energy efficiency which each EU country gets to decide how to implement due to climatic differences (something that works in Sweden won't necessarily work in Malta). It has many problems but it's a huge step in the right direction. This isn't even to push Passivhaus (which I don't find realistic for most building uses) but for across the board improvements to building energy efficiency. With all the obsession over electric cars, we forget that commercial and residential buildings consume nearly half of all the energy we make.Start with technologies with little or no downsides, and work your way from there. Take for example PV panels. It's very sexy, free electricity and all that, except if you live in a winter country, the benefits of solar water heating are far more substantial, in that it provides a built-in storage mechanism, it works even on overcast days in winter, it's cheap, it's more efficient, it works even with local shading or dirt, and requires little to no maintenance. It's so cheap that you don't even need a subsidy or high feed-in tarifs to break even, and you don't disrupt the grid supply. There is literally no downside to solar water heating and every building that uses domestic hot water should have it installed. Disconnecting from fossil fuels should focus first on doing the things that have no downsides and require no compromises, since that's what is most likely to be widely adopted and successful.Or, for example, take CHP (cogeneration). Suppose every apartment building and every commercial building and every factory had a cogeneration plant burning natural gas. Yes, it's a fossil fuel, but properly designed and installed and you literally double your energy efficiency. You produce your own electricity and heat, you don't disrupt the grid, and you don't have to compromise on anything. Payback is in 1-2 years. Virtually any building with a natural gas connection can be retrofitted with a CHP. Better still, with a large enough fleet you can actually use them collectively at utility level to compensate for the unreliable nature of wind and solar power. More systematic measurement of energy use. There is surprisingly little information on energy use available for many devices and technologies. Every home or car should have a digital long-term energy meter to assess energy consumption and energy efficiency over time. Every home that uses natural gas has a gas meter; the heat output out of every boiler is surprisingly easy to measure, and yet these two are easy to connect to have proper telemetry on how your devices are performing. Increasingly more buildings are required to have sub-metering, but this doesn't apply to homes and it doesn't apply to older buildings. With a lifespan of decades or centuries, only applying the rules on new builds is inappropriate. Suppose we have a requirement that every device capable of consuming more than 1kW should have energy telemetry with long-term memory installed within the next 10 years. You cannot possibly hope to save energy without knowing how much energy you are actually using.I actually invented an electricity consumption analysis tool for buildings that was far better than any of the very basic alternatives available on the market, and it was specifically designed to highlight the time-dependent fluctuations in energy consumption (daily, weekly, monthly and annual), and especially to highlight the fact that most buildings use around half of all their energy when it is unoccupied and empty, if not more. Every single building I audited showed this. It's usually accompanied by dismissals, that it's specific to the type of occupant, but that's all nonsense.Improve efficiency by focusing on off-design performance. Activist-type environmentalists, design engineers, and policy types often focus on nameplate energy efficiency. Many people have an opinion on energy efficiency, but few understand that energy efficiency is a variable, not a fixed value. Where efficiency succeeds or fails is at off-design conditions, not at peak conditions; the latter is rare, the former is commonplace.Design engineers are notorious for \"margin\", that is, a bump in the required performance to CYA (cover your ass), because clients normally complain when something doesn't have enough power, but rarely when it is grossly overdesigned. I once audited a building that wasn't 10% overdesigned, not 25% overdesigned, but 1200% overdesigned. Nobody complained until they got their first energy bill, which was astronomical. The problem was that boilers have a range of power output where they are efficient, but go too low on the power output and its efficiency drops.  Nevertheless, the building under EPBD rules is efficient because only nameplate boiler performance is considered.Stop the greenwash. People often ask me why I am against wind power. My issue with it is totally unrealistic expectations. For example many people think that 1 GW of installed wind power can displace 1 GW of nuclear or thermal power, which only works at nameplate level and falls apart when you consider that wind power only reaches nameplate power a fraction of the time. Wind power relies on other, dirtier sources of power as backup, and all the while my morning train advertises itself as \"100% powered with renewable energy\", which is essentially a lie. I think the undeserved attention it's getting is rooted in the ideology of getting \"free energy\", not by any of its practical advantages and disadvantages. I would have no problems with wind power if people were openly told of its disadvantages, something which virtually all sources of energy have, instead of feeding fantasies.",
