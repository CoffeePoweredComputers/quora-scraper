            "answer_text": "Organic waste includes items that contain carbon and (usually) hydrogen at a molecular level (hydrocarbons); as well as nitrogen and oxygen. The materials present in organic waste were (usually) once alive; they come from a biological process. Organic materials include obvious things like dead plants, food (meat, fish, vegetables) and wood. Some materials aren't so obviously organic but are made from organic materials, e.g. paper + card (made from wood or other plants), textiles (made from wool, cotton or bamboo). Sometimes people don't realise, but plastics are organic materials. Plastics are almost always made from oil (very small amounts from plants these days). Since oil comes from plants originally, it is an organic substance and therefore the plastics are organic too. This means all the plastic packaging that is thrown away is organic. Other things that come from oil include clothing made from artificial fibres (e.g. polyester, rayon), liquids such as paraffin, turpentine, ingredients of toiletries and cleaning products. Gasses which are considered waste can include methane and carbon dioxide; these are organic wastes. I think there are exceptions where organic materials can be synthesised from inorganic materials; but this is outside my knowledge comfort zone. Inorganic waste materials are those which do not contain carbon. Examples include metals, ceramics, glass, and bricks. They key identifier is the lack of carbon. However some inorganic waste materials can come from life such as sea shells which are made from calcium carbonate which does not contain carbon (well maybe a tiny bit). Many waste materials contain a combination of organic and inorganic materials. For instance many plastics contain additives of mineral origin such as talc, chalk and clay which are used as fillers.

            "answer_text": "The main difference between organic and inorganic materials is organic compounds containing carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, and most inorganic compounds have no carbon. Organic compounds are produced and related to living organisms. Inorganic compounds are created by deadly natural processes or human intervention. Another difference between organic and inorganic compounds is the organic matter will be burned, but inorganic materials will not burn. The organic material is found in living or single organisms, and therefore it is biological in nature. An inorganic material is usually derived from a dead material, so it is mineral in nature. Inorganic compounds are less complex than organic compounds. The presence of carbon protects the organic compounds from the formation of salts. Inorganic compounds can form salts and are readily soluble in water. Organic matter reaction is slower than inorganic matter. Slower reaction speed allows you to develop more complex products during the reaction. Inorganic compounds that are immersed in a good solution are better heat and conductors than organic compounds. Organic materials have lower melting and boiling temperatures than inorganic materials. ",
