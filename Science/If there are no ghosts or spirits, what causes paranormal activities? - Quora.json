The dogmatic answers here to the effect that \u201cparanormal activities\u201d are non-existent have missed the enormous body of research which has been carried out by parapsychologists over many years and is still being carried on right now. Whether \u201cghosts\u201d or \u201cspirits\u201d have an independent existence is an open question, but it cannot be denied that there have been many verified sightings of apparitions and some very impressive demonstrations of mediumship. Forget what you see in TV ghost hunting programmes. The Society for Psychical Research has an authoritative online encyclopaedia. Here are a few articles to start with: Ghosts and Apparitions in Psi Research (Overview) Mental Mediumship Research Experimental Parapsychology ",
