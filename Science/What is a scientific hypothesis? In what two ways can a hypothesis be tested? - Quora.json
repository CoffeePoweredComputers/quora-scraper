            "answer_text": "The term \u201chypothesis\u201d has a few meanings, and unfortunately they are conflated without regard for the system being employed. Science has two flavors, one of which is unjustified and the other which is justified through a mathematical foundation. When people think of scientific inquiry, they are often thinking of some kind of hybrid between Francis Bacon\u2019s formulation of science and Popper\u2019s formulation of science. The former is inductive while the latter is deductive. That\u2019s why a person might reference the need for a theory to be falsifiable, but then go on to explain how theories are confirmed. Unfortunately, the problem of induction, as suggested by Hume, Popper, and many others, presents an issue for confirmation based scientific inquiry. Popper\u2019s science is merely a statistical form of proof by contradiction. Here, a hypothesis can be seen as a probability distribution for a variable being tested, for a given experiment, which can be described as the states of a series of control variables and the one experimental outcome variable. A hypothesis can be tested by looking at the probability of an actual observation, and seeing if it is low. If we assume that our observation is not unlikely, then we have falsified the hypothesis, or really the position that the hypothesis is true and that the observation is likely. Relationship Between Hypothesis and Theory A theory is a model. A scientific theory is a potentially falsifiable model of the empirical universe. Theories may generate one hypothesis, or they may generate multiple hypotheses for different experiments. Also see my article on The Basics of Hypothesis Testing for more information. ",
