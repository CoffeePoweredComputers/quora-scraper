            "answer_text": "Only some mountains are dormant volcanoes. Depending on the level of magmatic activity, tens of kilometers deep below them, some may erupt again. But most mountains are made of layers sedimentary rocks that were thrust up against each other when continents were pushed against each other, tens to hundreds of million years ago. If you recognize the tilted or horizontal layers of sedimentary rocks across a mountain face, there is no risk of a volcanic eruption. However, rock slides are a common hazard.  A view of tilted sedimentary rock layers, in Canadian Rocky Mountains. Figure 10(f) Characteristics of Sedimentary Rocks  Horizontal sedimentary layers from Italy\u2019s Dolomites, Rocky mountain top sedimentary rocks Volcanic mountains, if they are not vegetated or covered by snow, look distinctly different because the ash falls and lava accumulate as a cone. Up close, the texture of the rock is totally different. This example from British Columbia, Canada came up via Stock Photo - Volcanic cone in the Itcha Mountains in the Chilcotin region of British Columbia Canada.  ",

            "answer_text": "A volcano is a specific kind of mountain. Only certain mountains are volcanoes, and volcanoes are (or rather, most are) mountains which have erupted, and sometimes are continuing to erupt, or may erupt in the future. Other kinds of mountains are not the kind which erupt. Most mountains are simply parts of the earth\u2019s crust which are \u2018high\u2019 - pushed up by tectonism, which can also cause the formation of volcanoes. But a \u2018regular\u2019 mountain does not convert to a volcano. It is the eruption of magma from within the earth which defines a volcano, and the material erupted which build the volcano, creating a volcanic peak - a mountain. ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest answer here is no. However some mountains are volcanoes (Mt Kilimanjaro, Mt Etna\u2026.) , they can definitely erupt if active or re activated. To have an eruption of lava you need a close lava source and enough pressure to push the lava to the surface. The lava has to move fast enough so that it doesn\u2019t cool and form solid rock. Mountains that are not volcanic are usually on thick rock and far away from a good lava source. There are other sorts of eruptions, that don\u2019t generate lava flows (phreatomagmatic\u2026 but they still need a good heat source, usually from magma ( lava that hasn\u2019t made it to the surface), so the same answer applies.
