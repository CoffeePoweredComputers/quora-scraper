            "answer_text": "A compass needle is simply a magnet that is shaped like a needle that is suspended by a very low friction bearing. This bearing allows the needle to spin freely on it\u2019s vertical axis. The earth is also a very large magnet. This is caused by the motion of magma moving under the earths surface. The side of the magnet that is attracted by the north pole of the earth is labeled North on a magnet. The magnetic north pole and the axis of rotation of the earth are not in exactly the same place. This creates some error with a magnetic compass and vaires depending on location. ",

            "answer_text": "A good source that answers your question is found here How Does a Compass Work? In it, a magnet is what makes a compass point north -- the small magnetic pin in a compass is suspended so that it can spin freely inside its casing and respond to our planet's magnetism. A compass points north because all magnets have two poles, a north pole and a south pole, and the north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet. The Earth is a magnet that can interact with other magnets in this way, so the north end of a compass magnet is drawn to align with the Earth's magnetic field. Because the Earth's magnetic North Pole attracts the \"north\" ends of other magnets, it is technically the \"South Pole\" of our planet's magnetic field. ",
