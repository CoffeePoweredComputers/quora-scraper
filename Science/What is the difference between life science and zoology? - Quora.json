            "answer_text": "Both Life Science and Zoology are pure science streams and both have vast opportunities as far as research and employment are concerned. The Life Science stream includes subjects like Animal physiology, Plant Physiology, Microbiology, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Immunology, Bioinstrumentation, Biostatistics and other applied subjects covering important topics in detail. However, Zoology syllabus also includes these subjects but they include topics superficially rather than in detail. It's not that applied subjects are not included in Zoology curriculum but they are framed focusing on their applicability in Zoology stream. Doing graduation and post-graduation in Life Science will give you much better insight in all above mentioned subjects and will help you greatly in competitive exams, however, if your aim is to specifically study Zoology and make career in Zoology-related occupations then you should go with Zoology. At last, both Zoology and Life Science streams will make you eligible for research and employment in both streams as they are sister streams. It actually depends on you what career you want to make and accordingly pursue graduation and post-graduation in said streams. Thank you for your request. I hope I was helpful to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Zoology inshort is animal science here you will study everything related to animals plus few basic subjects like Biochemistry, molecular biology ,immunology, cell bio, diversity all these subjects will be animal centric. Where as in life science you will all the above subjects and these subjects will be both animal and plant centric also this will include subjects like plant physiology etc. So all an all zoology is a branch of life science and most of the central universities in india focus on Life sciences more than Zoology or botany in.
