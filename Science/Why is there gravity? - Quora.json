            "answer_text": "That's the million dollar question. For your original question, as many already said, mass attracts mass. So any body with mass \"has gravity\", which means, any body with mass attracts any other body with mass. That's what gravity is about, mass attracting mass. Now the long answer. Why does it happen? We don't know. As someone said, in science we need principles, some simple statements we cannot prove (yet), but we rather accept as true, so we can make progress from that point. Gravity concept is one of those principles. There are actually 4 fundamental forces in the universe (as we know today). Gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear interactions. I don't know how much physics you know, but let me try to briefly explain. We already covered gravity above. Electromagnetic force happens due to electric charges, or magnetic fields, which occur because particles have electric charges (such as protons and electrons), and electric charges in movement generates magnetic fields. Electromagnetic forces are much much stronger than gravity. One way to figure out that is think of a magnet in your fridge. If you try to put some not magnetized object in your fridge it will fall, the gravitational attraction between the object and your fridge is nothing. But put a magnet there and it will stick to the fridge. Yet, when we talk about planets and stars, we talk only about gravity. And there's a reason. There is no way to neglect gravity. On electromagnetism there are positive and negative particles that balance each other, there are materials that \"do not let\" electromagnetic fields to pass. There are no such things in gravity. Mass is cumulative, and so is the gravity fields that emerge from it. So large bodies will have large masses, but will not likely large positive or negative charges. Going further there are two nuclear interactions. If you know the modern atom model, someone told you the atom nucleus is made of protons, positive charged particles, and neutrons, not charged particles. What someone probably didn't told you is that, even though there are neutrons there, there should still be repulsion among the protons, and the nucleus could not exist. Well, what someone didn't tell you about is nuclear interactions. I don't know much about it, all I know is that there are strong and weak interactions among subatomic particles, that exist only in subatomic level, and that's what keep the nucleus together. Now, many people are trying to explain these 4 fundamental forces in a single field theory. A single principle from which would derive all these 4 fundamental forces. If such thing is achieved, we may be able to better understand those interactions, where do they come from, and more important, how to manipulate them. Then we may know why gravity occurs ",

            "answer_text": "In general relativity, gravity is the physical manifestation of the \u201cshape\u201d of space(time). The shape of spacetime is determined by the distance relationship between points in spacetime. From that perspective, the answer to the question \u201cwhy does gravity exist?\u201d is that points in spacetime are separated from each other by distances. This answer is unique to gravity. If you asked the same question of something like electricity or magnetism, or even quantum fields, the answer would be different. The question \u201cwhy is there a (x) field?\u201d - substitute electric, magnetic, etc., for \u201c(x)\u201d - has a two-part answer. One part is about \u201c(x)\u201d as a force or particle; the other is about \u201cwhy a field?\u201d. The answer to the first part comes down to experiment - it either exists or it doesn\u2019t and the question \u201cwhy\u201d is, from the perspective of physics, not admissible. The answer to the second part - \u201cwhy a field\u201d - is one step removed from the first-part question. There are a few principles that underly all of physics. You can\u2019t get-around any of these without breaking all of physics, from the simplest mechanics to the most abstruse quantum mechanics. One of these is conservation of energy. Another is the constancy of the speed of light. A third is the principle of relativity*. It turns-out that you can\u2019t reconcile these three principles unless the force or particle \u201c(x)\u201d is represented by what physicists call a field, which pervades spacetime. Gravity is different because it >is< spacetime. *The validity of the principle of relativity is limited to physics in the absence of gravity. In the presence of gravity the true principle is the weak equivalence principle. The way the three principles - energy conservation, constancy of the speed of light independent of the observer or emitter, and either the weak equivalence principle or the special relativistic principle or equivalence - interact to require a field was first noted, and most easily seen, as a consequence of special relativity, which is why I used it here.
