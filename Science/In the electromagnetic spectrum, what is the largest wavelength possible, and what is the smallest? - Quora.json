            "answer_text": "In the electromagnetic spectrum, what is the largest wavelength possible, and what is the smallest? Well, theoretically, a photon could be extremely low energy and have a wavelength measured in anywhere from light years to the width of the observable universe. And a sufficiently high energy photon could have a wavelength somewhere near the Planck length. However, you\u2019re only going to see super-long wavelengths for sources that have been highly red-shifted, either due to receding velocity from the universe expanding or from climbing out of a black hole\u2019s gravity well. Meanwhile, at the high-energy end, it\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s any realistic way to create a Planck length wavelength photon near [math]10^{-44}[/math] meters, as the energy requirement is insanely high. Getting the energy isn\u2019t the problem - it\u2019s packing it all into one photon rather than 2 photons with half the energy, or 45 photons with 1/45th the energy, etc. There\u2019s also weirdness because at that energy density, you have to start worrying about the gravitational field generated by the energy. Those are theoretical limits, of course, In practice we\u2019ve only actually detected some particularly exuberant gamma rays with a wavelength of [math]10^{-19}[/math] meters , and extreme low frequency radio-range photons with wavelengths around 100,000 km.

            "answer_text": "Types of Frequencies and Wavelengths in the Radio Frequency Spectrum Wavelength indicates alternating current as opposed to direct current, battery level, flat wave. EMF is electromagnetic force and indicates a voltage source. In this case it is AC, alternating current. Sound is an example of audio frequency. RF is inaudible frequency. Frequency base is of course 1 cycle or 1 Hertz. The drum beat and base sounds are the low frequency range sounds. The lowest possible frequency, infrasounds, are vibrations which are felt but not heard. Journey into the world of Hearing - specialists Voice is typically around 1\u20132khz. Human ears will hear from 20 hz to 20Khz if we are young and not a frequent concert attender. The highest is theoretically infinite. The highest is visible light frequencies and possibly invisible light frequencies. Research gamma rays. ",
