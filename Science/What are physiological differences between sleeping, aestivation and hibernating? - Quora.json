            "answer_text": "The three major forms of dormancy in mammals are classified as: Hibernation in endotherms is characterized by reduced metabolic rate, breathing rate and body temperature near ambient temperature over prolonged times in the winter.Estivation is a similar form of dormancy in a dry and hot environment during summertime.Daily Torpor is defined as reduced, metabolic rate and body temperature lower than 32 degrees C, limited to a duration of less than 24 hours.Sleep, by contrast, is mostly a mental change. There are physiological aspects of sleep that are similar to hibernation, such as a reduced heart and breathing rate and lowered body temperature, but these changes are very slight compared to hibernation. If you're awakened from even your deepest sleep, you can be fully awake within several minutes. Sleep is primarily characterized by changes in brain activity. In fact, the brain waves of hibernating animals closely resemble their wakeful brain wave patterns, though they're somewhat suppressed. When an animal awakes from hibernation, it exhibits many signs of sleep deprivation and needs to sleep a lot over the next few days to recover.
