            "answer_text": "CO2 is the linear compound in geometry as it as l.p. on all atoms . O=C=O is the linear compound , in this C atom has sp hybridization . And both O atoms have sp 2 hybridization because of Oxygen has two lone pair that forms O in trigonal planar . All atoms are in a plane . So we can say that Carbon atom is sp hybridized. Carbon atom has 2 sigma bonds with Oxygen atoms.  ",

            "answer_text": "In CO2 , Hybridization is SP. As we know that , Hybridization on central atom = sigma bond + lone pair So in CO2 , sigma bond is 2 and lone pair on C is 0 hence hybridization is SP (2) and structure of the molecule is linear (180 \u00b0). O=C=O ( SP , 180\u00b0 ) I hope it will help you \u263a. Your manu .. ",
