            "answer_text": "Diffusion helps a cell is transportation of its products outside the cell and the reactants, ions and minerals inside. Cell membrane is essentially a amphibolic lipid bilayer which has the lipophilic moieties at the outermost and innermost aspect. Thus lipid soluble substances can easily pass through without any resistance by the cell membrane. This is passive diffusion without the expenditure of any energy. Active diffusion on the other hand uses a minute amount of energy to transport substances likewise. Thus basically diffusion is essential for a cell to acquire the basic substances required for maintaining it's survival as well as for releasing it's products. ",
