            "answer_text": "We do not need the mass in water to calculate specific gravity, but it is very convenient and can be quite accurate. By definition, specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a solid or liquid relative to the mass of an equal volume of pure water at 4[math]^{\\circ}[/math]C. The weight of a given object is, of course, very easy to measure. The weight of an equal volume of water is measured by immersing that same object into water, and measuring the reduction in the object\u2019s apparent weight. The ratio of the first measurement to the second is the specific gravity. ",
