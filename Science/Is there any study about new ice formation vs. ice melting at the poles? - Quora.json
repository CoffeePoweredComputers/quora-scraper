            "answer_text": "It's constantly being observed, studied, and published for maritime navigational, petroleum production, marine biology, as well as geo\"cryoshpere\"purposes. Too much for one dedicated and trained to the task to keep up on. Data isn't \"information\" and such requires context. One can look at the daily and archival reports of the Canadian Ice Service for data. Journals and conference proceedings are a treasure trove of such studies. ",

            "answer_text": "Sea ice does not simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the combined action of winds, currents, water temperature, and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation. ",
