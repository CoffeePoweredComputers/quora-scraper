            "answer_text": "Build a global grid. With that, more countries will be able to afford solutions to global warming. A global grid will also best distribute solar and wind energy from day to night, from windy to non windy, at the speed of light. Only in this way will we be able to transition from fossil fuels in a quick and reliable manner. By the time that is built, the much lessor amount of energy storage needed by then, should be cheaper. Of course, it might be easier just to build a bunch of molten salt reactors, because we're going to have to desalinate huge amounts of water, 24/7 to water the best plants that sequester the excess CO2, which is the actual solution. Not just any plants but the most effective at storing carbon into new soil. Global prosperity and the science of good soil is the prequesite to solving the global warming challenge! ",
