            "answer_text": "A) what is CVD and PVD coating?   Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) are two processes used to produce a very thin layer of material, known as a thin film, onto a substrate. Definition:- 1) Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD):- CVD involves deposition processes in which the depositing species are inlet into the coating chamber in a gaseous or vapor form. 2) Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD):- PVD involves vacuum deposition processes in which one or more of the depositing species are evaporated or otherwise atomized from a solid source in the coating chamber.  B) Difference between CVD and PVD :-  PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) and CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) are two techniques that are used to create a very thin layer of material into a substrate; commonly referred to as thin films. They are used largely in the production of semiconductors where very thin layers of n-type and p-type materials create the necessary junctions. The main difference between PVD and CVD is the processes they employ. As you may have already deduced from the names, PVD only uses physical forces to deposit the layer while CVD uses chemical processes. In PVD, a pure source material is gasified via evaporation, the application of high power electricity, laser ablation, and a few other techniques. The gasified material will then condense on the substrate material to create the desired layer. There are no chemical reactions that take place in the entire process. In CVD, the source material is actually not pure as it is mixed with a volatile precursor that acts as a carrier. The mixture is injected into the chamber that contains the substrate and is then deposited into it. When the mixture is already adhered to the substrate, the precursor eventually decomposes and leaves the desired layer of the source material in the substrate. The byproduct is then removed from the chamber via gas flow. The process of decomposition can be assisted or accelerated via the use of heat, plasma, or other processes. PVD typically uses a pure source material while CVD uses a mixed source material  C) PVD VS CVD :- How to choose the right tool coating ?  PVD, or physical vapor deposition, is a line-of-sight coating process which allows for thin coatings and sharp edges. CVD, on the other hand, stands for chemical vapor deposition and is thicker to protect against heat. PVD is typically applied to finishing tools, whereas CVD proves best for roughing. Utilizing the correct tool coating protects the tools and materials for best results of the process.  D) CVD VS PVD : Advantages and Disadvantages :-  1) CVD processes run at much higher temperatures than PVD processes, usually between 300\u00b0C and 900\u00b0C. 2) Molecular beam epitaxy (PVD process) has a distinct advantage of atomic level control of chemical composition, film thickness, and transition sharpness. This process is relatively more expensive, but is worth the added cost for applications that demand higher  3) Another advantage of physical vapor deposition over chemical vapor deposition is the safety issue of the materials that are used for chemical vapor deposition. It is known that some precursors and some by-products are toxic, pyrophoric, or corrosive. This can cause issues with material handling and storage.  E) Whether it is Via CVD or PVD : which one is better ?  The end result is basically the same as they both create a very thin layer of material depending on the desired thickness. CVD and PVD are very broad techniques with a number of more specific techniques under them. The actual processes may be different but the goal is the same. Some techniques may be better in certain applications than others because of cost, ease, and a variety of other reasons; thus they are preferred in that area.
