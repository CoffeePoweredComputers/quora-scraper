            "answer_text": "I think this depends on what you think the Exclusion Principle is. In my ebook \u201cGuidance Waves\u201d I derive a form of the Exclusion Principle which is different to all others in that it only indirectly involves quantum numbers, and it applies irrespective of magnetism. The condition is that the particles must involve motion in a central electric field, and to be stable and stationary the antinode of the wave function must exactly repeat each period. Because the period of a wave must have a crest and a trough, the period involves some multiple of two cycles; two cycles for an s electron, but a more subtle problem if there are angular nodes. You can get two electrons paired because now you can get a crest and a trough in one cycle, but you can\u2019t get three because perforce if the repeat is 2/3 of a cycle, the exact positions of the antinodes cannot be the same. You can get repeats with 4 electrons, which act a little like bosons, though, which is why the SN2 replacement works (in the activated state, there are technically 4 electrons in the axial wave component) and why in chemistry in general there are so many reactions that are explicable as if the electrons moved around in pairs. Of course the electrons also try to pair magnetically, but the principle would hold even if there were not magnetism at all, at least if this interpretation is correct. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a chemist, but I can Google: Chemistry Semester 1 1s \u2191 \u2191violates the Pauli Exclusion Principle since both electrons in the 1s orbital are \"spin up\". This means that both have the same ms and so they have the same four quantum numbers. ",
