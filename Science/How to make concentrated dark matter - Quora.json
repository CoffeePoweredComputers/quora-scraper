            "answer_text": "Very, very slowly. Since dark matter only interacts gravitationally (as far as we know), basically the only way to concentrate dark matter is through gravity. The main problem is dissipating the potential energy \u2014 imagine marbles in a frictionless basin, none will ever actually go down the drain. To concentrate dark matter into the drain requires dissipating the energy with some sort of friction. The only gravitational form of friction is known as dynamical friction, cause by transferring energy from the orbit to particles in its wake. This is an extremely slow process that only works well for large lumps, and is essentially negligible if dark matter is some sort of subatomic particle. So basically, you can\u2019t. At least not on any reasonable cosmic timescale. ",

            "answer_text": "Romeel\u2019s answer is great! It\u2019s definitely got to be gravity since dark matter doesn\u2019t interact electromagnetically so there\u2019s no regular way of containing it. Since axiflavons (dark matter particles) are the supersymmetric partner of the graviton, we can use gravitons to contain dark matter, Since humans haven\u2019t yet even harnessed a graviton, let alone use it with any other particle, I think we\u2019ll be waiting a long time too! However, in terms of recent M-theory advances here\u2019s how it\u2019s done: Since D9 (Higgs degree of freedom) and D10 (graviton degree of freedom) interact, due to axiflavons being composite Higgs AND Sgravitons, if we wrap certain \u201choles\u201d in the Calabi-Yau Manifold with gravitons (closed strings) and then change the winding number, the more highly strung the graviton strings become, the more tightly confined the axiflavons can be. It\u2019s way beyond the bounds of current human technology but advanced civilizations could master it and use contained axiflavons to do all sorts of things, including inflate spacetime in a controlled fashion. Imagine the uses of this, in terms of propulsion, medical micro-procedures, particle research etc?! However, imagine also giving this technology to humans, when an axiflavon bomb would inflate objects from the inside out at the speed of light? ",
