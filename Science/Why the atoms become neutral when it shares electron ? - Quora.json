            "answer_text": "Outer orbitals made out of unpaired, or even just unfilled orbitals have to do some work to be present in the work of that orbital in the general pressures of being an atom. Exchanging phonons, being under pressure, not emitting endless valence electrons, photon transmission, etc. So much so that bond energy may be available without great force or temperature. That energy provided, groups of atoms can find a new, shared energy orbital that covers as the filled orbitals of each (see orbital filling chart; only 2 electrons in s 1\u20135, 3 pairs in p 2\u20135, 8 in d\u2026) At that point minor jostling or presence of other atoms no longer causes chemical change, hence \u2018stable orbitals.\u2019 Neutral. Noble. There are almost always tons of valence electrons around condensed matter, so it\u2019s not that ion capture has occurred (except in KrF6, where that is a big deal.) The matter is that not only does the nuclear charge need balancing with electrons to make a stable atom, but that they cover the orbital state (which fabulously does not change crazily just because 2 nuclei are involved or a crystal or polymer is forming,) without extra work. Extra work would imply unresolved vibrational states, etc; you can have that mechanically, but not near nuclei much. What about electrochemistry, you say? Stable orbitals with valence state solutions. Beta-emission magnetic moment, you say? That\u2019s something else. ",
