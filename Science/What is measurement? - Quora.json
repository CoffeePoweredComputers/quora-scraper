            "answer_text": "A2A: Measurement implies the use of statistics. An isolated single measurement is not trusted, is disregarded. With multiple measurements a meaningful mean and standard deviation can be computed, and from those it can be determined just how meaningful they are (that is, whether the number of measurements is sufficient), using for example Student's t-test. In quantum mechanics, statistics play an even more critical role. The measuring apparatus (often called an observer) is a big, complex system of particles compared to the 2 or 3 particles being measured. Quantum measurement entails a cascading reaction. A quantum event, with its inherent uncertainty due to multiple solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (not to be confused with Heisenberg uncertainty), sets off a chain reaction in a detector that becomes increasingly more certain and specific as more particles become involved. Thus the outcome of a measurement is more \u201cclassical\u201d than the original event. ",

            "answer_text": "Measurement is determining the size of something by comparing it to something else with a standardized size. A meter is a standardized size. You can have a wooden ruler 1m long and compare it to , for example a door, and see how many times can that ruler be aligned along the door. You can also measure different kinds of qualities, not just length. Things you use to measure other things, are called instruments of measurement. ",

For example if we don't know that distance is denoted by kilometers or miles how can say someone like its 5 km far or something\u2026 So its a process to make things or resources more understandable \u2026 For more info you can take help of Google thanks for your question ",
