            "answer_text": "The horizontal row number on the periodic table is the principal quantum number n for the s and p orbitals in that row. It also indicates that as you move left to right in that row, the diameter of the atom decreases. It also generally means an increase in electronegativity, and a decrease in metallic properties. ",

            "answer_text": "A very short answer. The horizontal rows of a periodic table are called periods. Generally, the period will tell you the principal quantum number, n, of the given atom. However, do note that n is not the same for all elements in the group (see transition metals). ",
