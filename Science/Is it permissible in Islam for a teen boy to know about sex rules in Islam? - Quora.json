            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it is very very important for teen boys and girls to learn about sex and its rules in Islam sometimes after puberty because if not, then they can and will fall into the sin of promiscuity and sexuality. Is it not better to make them aware beforehand. One of the many reasons for Zina to be prevalent and growing in Islamic societies is because we don\u2019t teach our kids about these very important topics on which their life and eternity is dependent.
