            "answer_text": "First, your statement that temperature and volume are directly proportional is misleading. It's correct, but incomplete. To understand why, think for a second about what variables you have direct control over in the real world, and what *else* can change based on those direct changes. Charles' Law states that volume is directly proportional to temperature given a constant amount of gas and a constant pressure. The key is that temperature is the independent variable in Charles' Law; you can't vary volume and expect a temperature change. Why? Because Boyle's law states that pressure is inversely related to volume at a constant temperature. If you change volume, you change pressure, and then Charles' Law no longer holds. This law is also one-way; pressure is dependent on volume in this relationship. In the real world, you can't directly change pressure; a pressure change is the result of a change to some other variable in the gas laws (it can be directly affected by all of them, actually), not the cause. So why does the temperature change? Well, Amontons, building on Gay-Lussac's work of combining volumes, found that pressure and temperature are directly related; increase pressure and you increase temperature, and vice-versa. This relationship, however, is relatively interdependent, because other determinants of pressure can be varied independently of temperature without violating any declared constants in Amontons' Law; you can increase pressure (either by adding gas or by decreasing volume) and temperature will increase, or you can increase temperature and pressure will increase, and the same holds for moving in the opposite direction. So, an increase in volume as the independent variable will most directly cause a *decrease* in pressure. That decrease in pressure then causes a decrease in temperature. So, gases cool as they expand. The ideal gas law, PV = nRT (adding in Avogadro's direct relationship of the amount of gas and its volume at constant temp and pressure), retains the mathematical relationships between amount of gas, volume, temperature and pressure, however it more or less loses some of the subtleties of cause and effect. You could, naively, expect to decrease volume keeping pressure and amount constant, and expect to see a decrease in temperature.  But that's not how it actually works; changing volume will directly change pressure in the opposite direction, limiting the net change on the left side of the equation. Only if there is a net change in the product of pressure and volume for a constant amount of gas will the temperature change to balance the equation. ",

            "answer_text": "Temperature is a measure of the speed and frequency of the collisions of the gas molecules with their surroundings. If your sample of gas contains a fixed amount of kinetic energy (i.e. it's isolated from its surroundings) then the frequency of the collisions will increase as you decrease the volume of the gas and you will measure a higher temperature. The same is true in reverse; if you increase the volume, the collisions become less frequent and so you measure a lower temperature. Think of a room full of rubber balls bouncing off the walls and imagine that the amount of kinetic energy they possess stays constant (that would happen if the collisions were all \"perfectly elastic\" -- i.e. no kinetic energy was lost during collisions). I think it's pretty easy to imagine that if you made the room smaller, the balls would hit the walls more frequently and if you made the room bigger they'd hit less frequently. That's your temperature change. ",
