            "answer_text": "'Why's are really hard in physics. As others have said: because of the spin-statistics theorem. Then you ask - yes, but why? Ultimately the reason we choose to include anything in physics is because it maps well to reality (via experimental results). Therefore, one completely valid interpretation is: \"because experiment confirms that reality behaves as though the spin-statistics theorem is valid\". A deeper explanation (or 'lower-level', in the sense that circuitry is lower-level than a computer and QFT is lower-level than QM), as best I can discern it, is this: Our universe has a geometry which allows for fields which have SU(2) symmetries. We don't 'see' in this geometry so it's unintuitive. These fields do not obey the symmetries you are used to. They have strange symmetry around 720 degree rotations - they're negative after one 360 degree rotation, rather than equal to themselves. Don't try to visualize it, because the geometry of these fields isn't the geometry of regular 3d space (though it can be visualized with some.. tricks). Apply some transforms to the same math and you can also show they're negated if you swap two states. Swapping is a well-defined operator. You can think of it as an active thing (some interaction takes a particle to another's state and vice versa) or as a passive one (a change of coordinates that swaps the two states). But if two particles have the same state, swapping them negates them but leaves them equal at the same time, so their amplitude must be '0'. So it can't happen. You might interpret this as destructive interference. (disclaimer: I'm not a professional physicist. I just spent some time trying to make intuitive sense of this a while back.) ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Why\u2019 questions are always interesting. Most of the time, we answer why something is true by stating that it is true or we cite some reason or principle or equation and it would be just as legitimate to then again ask \u201cWhy?\u201d One of my favorite quotes is by physicist Hans Christian von Baeyer: \u201cScience is an infinite regression - behind each answer lurks a question, and behind that, another.\u201d Related to this question, Caltech\u2019s David Goodstein once asked Richard Feynman to explain to him why spin-1/2 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Feynman said to Goodstein, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.\u201d A few days later he went to Goodstein and said, \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don\u2019t understand it.\u201d Fermions are spin-1/2 particles, obey Fermi-Dirac statistics, and as a consequence, obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This doesn\u2019t say why they do, just that they do. I don\u2019t know if \u201cwe\u201d understand it. I\u2019d love to hear a good explanation. ",
