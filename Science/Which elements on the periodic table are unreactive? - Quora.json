            "answer_text": "The noble gases, mainly. Noble gases are elements in the Periodic Table that have a naturally full valence shell. As such, they don\u2019t need to gain or lose electrons, or share them with other compounds, to create a balance between their electrical charge and their valence state. These elements are helium, argon, neon, krypton, xenon, and radon. Even in those cases, if a highly-reactive element like fluorine is introduced in the proper environment (usually involving heat), you can get compounds like krypton hexafluoride or xenon hexafluoride, which are of interest in nuclear physics as they can be used to prepare uranium hexafluoride, a fluid (a gas at room temp and atmospheric pressure) that can be centrifuged to isolate the lighter and more reactive U-235 isotope. Oxygen, the second-most electronegative element known to man after fluorine, has also been known to create compounds with the noble gases. In short, there\u2019s really nothing in the periodic table that simply will not react with anything else; other elements of the table are just too reactive to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The Group 18 elements (AKA Group VIIIA) were considered so unreactive because of their complete valence shells that they were called the Inert Gases. Then in 1962 Prof. Neil Bartlett mixed Xe and PtF6 gases and got a red solid, then postulated as Xe(1+)PtF6(1-). The Inert Gases were not so inert after all. The name changed to Noble Gases, probably in analogy to the Noble Metals (Group 11), which are resistant to reaction but do form compounds under right conditions. Full disclosure: I did senior research under Prof. Bartlett at Berkeley. ",
