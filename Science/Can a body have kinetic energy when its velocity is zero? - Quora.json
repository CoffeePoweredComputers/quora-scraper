            "answer_text": "According to physics a body can never have an absolute velocity (unless we are talking about the velocity of light) because velocity is always measured with respect to a reference i.e velocity is assumed for a reference against which the velocity of the moving body is to be measured. Normally the reference velocity is assumed to be 0, i.e the velocity of ground. The velocity which we obtain with respect to the reference velocity is called relative velocity. And kinetic energy is the energy of a body by virtue of its motion, which means it depends on velocity (relative velocity). So when relative velocity is zero, kinetic energy is also zero. It can be also be said that speed of earth with respect to sun is 30 km/s yet a body at rest on earth has zero kinetic energy because the relative velocity of the body is zero. ",

            "answer_text": "If I take both Newtonian and Relativistic Kinetic Energy, both will come out to be zero when the velocity of the body is zero. Say, when you throw a stone up in the air, at highest point, velocity of the stone is zero and there at the same point, potential energy comes out to be maximum and kinetic energy to be zero. To simply say things, Kinetic Energy is associated with Linear Momentum and linear momentum cannot exist without velocity. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by a body. If the body is a vehicle with a flywheel storage system, then the body could be sitting still, but the flywheel would still have a lo of kinetic energy. Your question is a bit too vague to answer precisely. If the body is a spinning mass, then the center of mass could have zero velocity but th body would still have kinetic energy. Basically, I just considered the flywheel all by itself as a new body. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if the body consists of dynamic parts. The solar system, for instance, contains a lot of kinetic energy, even when it is for the sake of argument considered non moving as a whole. A non-moving body can as well have rotation, and hence kinetic energy, while its centre of gravity doesn't move. ",

Kinetic (adjective) relating to or resulting from motiondepending on movement for its effectHence, kinetic energy will be applicable only for moving bodies. There are some terms which professors fail to teach by referring to word meanings. e.g. Biasing, Hunting, Harmonics etc. The word meaning itself points to the answer. ",
