            "answer_text": "Lets looks at some hard facts. Now and throughout your entire life, as long as you are not paying for the roof over your head, your phone, your console, with actual money, you havr to pay for it by abiding to the rules of the person who is paying for it. If keeping your room clean is one of the rules, then technically, just look at that as your job or your way of paying for your stuff. But lets now look at the bigger picture. Teenagers tend to only think about now and the comfort they get now. Parents or adults are looking at the end result and future. Besides just wanting their house clean, the benefit is really more for you and not them. Parents know that whatever habits you have as an adult, both good and bad habits, it most likely formed in childhood. If you dont get into the habit of keeping a clean room now, you won't be in the habit of keeping a clean room in college (trust me, my college roommate was sooo messy), and you wont be in the habit of keeping a clean apartment if you have a roommate or a clean house when you get older. Please dont think you will just automatically start being clean. You wont because habits are hard to break. My 14 used to keep a messy room and I used to have this same problem with her. But now she keeps a clean room. Why? Not me taking away her stuff. Her friend popped over unexpectedly one day. So EMBARRASSMENT is what broke my daughters habit. You dont want to get to college or get to a roommate situation or have company pop over get embarrassed and then get talked about (and people will talk about you). That's the first thing. The second thing is I sure you will not be comfortable waking up to something crawling on your face, or pouring cereal and having roaches fall out, cause thats where you are headed. You are creating the mickey mouse clubhouse. I tell my daughter, unless you want to live with roaches and mice\u2026keep the house clean. Now, we unexpectedly didnt come home for 4 days and the dishes weren't done. In those 4 days knats developmented. It bothered and annoyed my 14 year old so much that she Googled how to get rid of them and now, she does the dishes every day without me asking and, get this, gets sooooo mad at me if I don't do them if she's at her grandparents for the weekend. The knats apparently traumatized her. All Im saying is, get into the habit of being clean now, before a traumatic experience of embarrassment, being talked about, or being physically and mentally violated by knats, roaches, and mice break the habit of keeping an unclean room for you.

            "answer_text": "You ask in another question about getting a job. Seriously? This is what you do: Clean your room weekly. This includes changing bedsheets, dusting, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Keep your room neat all of the time. As in put things away when you are done with them. All of the time Help with cooking and/or cleaning up at every meal. Take out the house trash daily. Keep track of your personal money. This simply means having a book where you keep track of income, what you spend, and the current balance . Help clean around the house. Ask your mom what chores you can do and do them. Read a book a week. Or two. Get good grades in school (nothing lower than a B). Limit screen time to 2 hours a day. This means all tv, non-phone call phone use, computer time (not counting if you are doing school via computer due to the pandemic) and video games. In other words, act like a responsible young man. Once you do that, I'll bet mom will give back your phone and console, and she will let you get a job Keep in mind that the money you earn from your job may well be needed to run the home. If so, share it. After what I have read here, I wouldn't hire you to wash my car. However a 14 year old who does all of the above could easily find employment with me, even if it's under the table. Good luck. ",
