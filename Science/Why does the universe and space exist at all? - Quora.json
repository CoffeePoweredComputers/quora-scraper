            "answer_text": "In order to know why it exists, we need to know what it is. The answer to the first question is found in the second. What is the universe? One bubble in an infinite foam of universes. What is a bubble? A sphere that contains bubbles. How could existence not exist? How could it be anything other than exactly what it is, the way it is? I mean, we can say in words all sorts of imaginings about that, but I mean for real, not imaginary. In the 19th century, electricity and magnetism were unified into EM. In the 20th century, EM and matter were unified by the energy mass equivalency equation. QM folks want to find gravitons. Why? The search for Unity. If we take the theory of GR rather than QM as real, then we have the Unity we intuitively feel must be there. If so, what is all the diversity about? It\u2019s our perception. Unity is perceived as diversity because that is what perception is. But we are really clever little perceivers because we suspect Unity on account of us recognizing certain patterns in the perceived diversity. We can\u2019t perceive Unity of course because perception is the act of diversifying the Unity but we can intuit that it is there because logically there is no other way for all the apparently disparate phenomena we perceive to be able to relate to each other and make worlds. A key \u201cingredient\u201d or \u201ccomponent\u201d of Unity is curvature. This is a hard concept to \u201csell\u201d because we are so accustomed to regard flatness and straightness as the normal condition of space but it is not so. On a local scale, curvature is imperceptible but as we scale up our observations, curvature becomes more perceivable. Bubbles are spheres because it takes the least amount of energy to sustain that geometry. Why? How could it possibly be otherwise? ",

            "answer_text": "Why there is something rather than nothing? One possible answer is because it has never not existed. A compelling argument for this take is the fact that we do not know about a way of how to truly destroy (nor create) energy. If we do anything to energy (matter is also a form of energy as shown by Einstein) it only changes form. But it is never truly destroyed. Not even when thrown into a black hole.  This implies that the Universe or at least energy in the Universe has always existed and the only thing that is changing is its form. Space or expanding space as is in the case of our universe is one of many possible arrangements of energy.  Thanks to this arrangement we can be around at this moment of time (because we are 99% empty space) and ask these kind of questions. One should be thankful that we have this opportunity because it was not always so. At least not around 13.82 billion years ago when we suppose all the energy of the universe was concentrated in one point until it ended with a Big bang and our energy-in-space history begun. ",
