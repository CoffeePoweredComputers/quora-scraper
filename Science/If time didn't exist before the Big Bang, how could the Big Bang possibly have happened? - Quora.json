            "answer_text": "Time is just a dimension just like up, down, right left, backwards, forward. The only thing that makes time special is the one way direction of causality. But that is governored by statistical laws. For short enough time periods all fundamental physics laws are reversible. There is an interesting experiment that demonstrates this: Physicists Reverse Time for Tiny Particles Inside a Quantum Computer No, they didn\u2019t really reverse time. But they created an environment where the direction of time had no cause and effect consequences. For small enough time periods this happens naturally. Which means if the universe has a beginning, it took a certain amount of time for the irreversible nature of time to kick in. For those first few moments time was just another direction of space. So this is why physicists like Steven Hawking\u2019s described the concept of before the Big Bang as equivalent to North of the North Pole. As you get very close to the North Pole, the directions take on different meanings. East and West just is directions of rotation around the pole. North and south just means that increasing or decreasing our radius. The actual location of that pole seems arbitrary once you get close. There is no actual candy stripped pole. Rather some scientist had to sit there and take very precise measurements, and say here is the North Pole. If the ice sheet you are on shifts, so that marking is in the wrong spot, you won\u2019t notice. Same with time. When you are very near the start universe. The instant that it started has no special indicator. If you were there to observer and the we were off by a couple of Planck units you would not know it, Because time is just a direction and not a chain of cause and effect, yet, you have no indicator which axis is time, and which direction is past, and which direction is future. From the distant future it is bloody obvious, but it isn\u2019t obvious when you are close to the beginning. If I tell you I am at a point along a circle of radius 1 measured 0 degrees from the axis. Then I tell you I move towards the Center until r=-1, you will tell me I have simply moved to the opposite side of the circle and r=1. It is the same thing with the Big Bang, If the universe is 2 Planck units old, and you ask me what happened 4 Planck units ago, I just move to the opposite side of a universe that is 2 Planck units old. Now the Big Bang is not the only game in town. Continual inflation fits known data just as well. It is roughly equivalent to saying North of the North Pole is straight up towards the North Star. It is a different model, but it works just as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t going to answer until I saw that Marco Pereira is totally misrepresenting Stephen Hawking (and doesn\u2019t allow comments), when he says this: \u201cTo say that since there was no time, there was no physics and no rules is the same as saying God made it\u2026:)\u201d Besides the fact this this is just a subjective assertion, neither Hawking nor any other actual cosmologist (which, I note, Pereira is not) has ever said such a thing. What Hawking said was that the laws break down at the point of the Big Bang, and that is not at all like saying that \u201cthere was no physics and no rules\u201d. What it is saying is more like that \u201cexistence\u201d underwent a phase change, so that from this side of things we can\u2019t look back and get a clue of what happened before (and Pereira, with an actual credential in Physical Chemistry, ought to recognize a phase change when he sees it!). In reality, saying that \u201ctime did not exist before the Big Bang\u201d is an over-reach, which Hawking really recognizes when he says that the laws break down: if the laws break down, that means we have no basis on which to know if time didn\u2019t exist or not. On the other side of the phase change, time might have flowed as we know it, or there might be a different dimension which turned into time, or there might be some other time-like dimension \u2014 indeed for it to be \u201cexistence\u201d as we understand it, there must have been some sort of time-like dimension since existence as we understand it requires duration, which means time or something like it. Hossein Javadi cited a more pertinent Hawking quote: \u201cEvents before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there\u2019s no way one could measure what happened at them\u201d. Another way of putting this is that to even speak of \u201cevents\u201d before the Big Bang is meaningless, since events as we understand them require duration and extension, which means time and at least two physical dimensions; and to speak of \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang is equally meaningless unless we assume that some time-like dimension was in operation the word \u201cbefore\u201d has no meaning (a far better term is \u201cprior to\u201d, which sounds like time but doesn\u2019t require that). So \u201cHow could the Big Bang possibly have happened?\u201d We don\u2019t know. We can\u2019t see \u201cbeyond\u201d or \u201cbefore\u201d or even into the very moment of the Bang, so all we have is speculation. The only hope we have other than mathematical metaphysics (e.g. string \u2018theory\u2019) at this point is the notions of \u201cbranes\u201d, because that conjecture at least offers the possibility of being tested, since it points to events which should have consequences in this universe, though unfortunately even if the concept is correct we may never get to see the evidence of such an event. So \u201cGod did it\u201d is at least as likely as an eternal multiverse or something, because due to the fact that the laws do break down at that point we just have no clue. ",
