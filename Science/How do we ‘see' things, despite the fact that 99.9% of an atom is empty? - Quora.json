            "answer_text": "Let's put it in simple terms. You take a single balloon with something at it center, like those mickey mouse balloons from Disneyland.  You can see through it right??? (I know that the empty space is less than 99% , but I'm just giving an example.) Now take a few of these and keep them in a clutter.  The visibility through the balloons has decreased, hasn't it??? Now just assume a zillion of these in the sky, at a distance where you can't differentiate these balloons. You won't be able to tell that those balloons are mostly empty and transparent. Now, think about it. Such balloon-like atoms are present in numbers ranging from Billions to Trillions and even more, per square centimetre of each and everything you see. That's how we are able to 'see' things. Peace.  These images were taken from Google Images. ",
