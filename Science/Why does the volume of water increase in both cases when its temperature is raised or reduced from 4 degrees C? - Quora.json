            "answer_text": "If water is at 4 degrees C, and at normal atmospheric pressure, it\u2019s volume is minimal. If the temperature is increased the volume increases for the usual reasons, more kinetic energy and more momentum per molecule mean that each molecule takes more time to change its direction of travel as accelerated by the forces of external pressure and mutual attraction of molecules. The distance it travels in this time is a volume increase. If instead, the water is cooled, mutual attraction of molecules becomes relatively dominant in a molecule\u2019s location. Some molecules no longer have enough energy to overcome the specific and asymmetrical attractions caused by the positive hydrogen nuclei and the negatively charged unshared pair orbitals of the oxygen atom. Some molecules are trapped in local potential wells in specific locations. When nearly all are trapped these locations (we actually have to think of the locations of all three atoms in the molecule) the structure formed is a hexagonal crystal less dense than 4 C liquid water. Between 4 and 0 C the structure is incomplete and temporary. It is less dense than 4 C water, because of some accommodation of the hexagonal structure, but more dense than ice because the rigid structure, which encloses a bit of empty space (since the density of ice is 91.7% that of 4 C liquid water, 8.3% of the volume of ice may be considered as empty space) is not yet far enough formed to keep all that space empty. Thus as liquid water cools from 4 C it expands, unless under the roughly 2000 atmospheres of pressure necessary to favor the formation of the higher density ice III with tetragonal crystals denser than liquid water.

            "answer_text": "Let's start it with solid form of water (ice), ice is cage like structure of water molecules, when temperature is increased the structure expand and volume of cage structure increases. It happens upto 4\u00b0C. But at 4\u00b0C, the cage structure is broken and the molecules of water come close to each other (visualise it like when you crush a card board box, the walls of box comes close to each other). Hence At 4\u00b0C and 1 atm pressure, the density of water is maximum. Now as you increase the temperature, the water molecules again start to expand and the volume of water increases. ",
