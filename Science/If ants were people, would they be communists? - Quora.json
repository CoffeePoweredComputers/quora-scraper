            "answer_text": "No. Communism is a society which is moneyless, stateless and classless. Workers own the means of production and manage themselves. \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\u201d Ants live in a monarchy. The queen ant is the most important member of the society, and workers are expected to relinquish their lives if needed in service of the queen.  A mighty struggle for ultimate power, with calls of \"death to the queen\" answered by armies of workers, is routine in some ant colonies. Queen ants are therefore sometimes forced to take care of themselves rather than look out for the good of their colonies, a new study suggests. Queen ants will do whatever it takes to be the last one standing, even if it means producing fewer young workers to the detriment of the collective. Ant colonies work somewhat like a superorganism, with the queen ant producing little workers that will meet her needs and their siblings' needs. But there is always give and take, with individual survival sometimes trumping the good of the group, the research found. Often, an ant colony has more than one queen. The upside: Multiple queens, each raising broods of worker ants, can produce a larger initial workforce in new colonies, increasing the chance the colony will survive the first year. But queen ants don't merrily cohabit forever. Soon after the young workers hatch, the little ones begin to slaughter surplus queens until only one remains.[1] Footnotes[1] Queen Ant Will Sacrifice Colony to Retain Throne",

            "answer_text": "If ants were people they would not live in an anthill nor would they behave as ants behave. Individual ants are genetic clones, cells within the organism that is the anthill. We get confused because these cells are composed of smaller cells and wander around, seemingly independently, while most of us are unaware that some cells within our bodies wander around independent of other cells. We anthropomorphize ants, thinking of ourselves when we see and individual ants, we don't think of a hand or a tooth or a liver. An ant colony is like a human body and not like a human city. Among most species of aunt each colony exists independently, interacting with other colonies only to fight or to breed. This is a life form we are not familiar with, a life form in which individuals of the species are subdivided into distinct and separable components. ",
