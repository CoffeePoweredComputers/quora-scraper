            "answer_text": "It\u2019s more than important, it\u2019s essential, in my opinion, I think understanding basic biology is or was the most important class for me as an undergrad pre-nursing student. This course leads the path to all sciences that involve the medical build, if one can\u2019t understand biology, well he or she will have difficulties understanding A&P, Chemistry, Micro Biology, etc. This is coming from a person who was not a stellar student and most important, I\u2019m generally referring to the nursing essentials and not the more advanced medical careers, as I entered masters\u2019, Bio-Chemistry would branch out further into the CRNA spectrum! The body and mind are everything, I still debate to this day which would take precedence, I would probably go with the mind now that I\u2019ve 23 years experience in healthcare, however, these courses are essential and must be understood!

            "answer_text": "I will give you very precise answer of your question, Firstly it\u2019s name is BIOCHEMISTRY i.e. bio + chemistry means chemistry of your biological body. Helps to learn various metabolic processes in detail. If you know the importance of physiology then Biochem is integrated with physiology example: jaundice in physiology your will study that at functional level of our body when you study in Biochem it will give your detail of each and every step of functional study of jaundice. Base of various pathological tests are on dependent on biochemistry. ",
