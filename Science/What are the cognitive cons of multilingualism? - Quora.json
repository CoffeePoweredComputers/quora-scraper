You'll know all these grammer rules but won't be able to teach it to someone else because you can't explain it. You'll just be able to do it.  Apart from that, I can't see any disadvantages. Well, sometimes you lose words. Like in a sentence or something, you know that theres a specific word to mean what you want to say in that specific sentence, but you forget what the word is. In like 5 minutes you get it though, but it's too late by then.  And that will happen even with your mother tongue.  (I speak 5 languages, learning a 6th) ",
