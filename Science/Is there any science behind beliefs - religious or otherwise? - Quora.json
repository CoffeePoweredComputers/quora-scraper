            "answer_text": "I have a friend who is an atheist and often argues that any beliefs including religious ones are well meaning, carefully thought and well crafted \u2018reasoning\u2019 for people to blindly follow them either in the name of religion or local traditions. I liked his analogy that in most rural areas, it is believed that sleeping under a large banyan tree at night will draw demons and ghosts while his argument is that the tree produces large amounts of carbon dioxide at night, enough to suffocate someone to death. No wonder the \u2018\u2019ghost\u2019 appears only at night and not during the day time. If this is true, there is a very strong scientific basis of such a belief. Having worked in the development sector for decades, I have often heard claims from agencies and individuals that they have \u2018mobilized\u2019 the community. Well, my theory may be a bit far-fetched but I often think of the days when Homo sapiens sapiens very likely first evolved in Africa about 315,000 years ago. I can imagine that while family living may have just started to evolve, humans would often fought violently and were definitely cannibalistic in nature. Who they devoured or spared is not the issue for this write up but for sure the so-called \u2018wise men\u2019 started contemplating of making stronger groups \u2013 the seeds of community mobilization processes were thus sown millions of years ago! Bringing people together had a lot of reasons but for sure it solved a lot of problems starting with closely knit society not killing each other to being able to construct infrastructure \u2013 houses, farms, access roads \u2013 that neither individuals nor families could do alone. If I go by the beliefs of my atheist friend, I would say that to build much larger communities, religion was brought in or shall I say, cooked up? Whatever it was, it came with the goodness of humankind because while the likes of science behind the demon under the banyan tree was a mere observation, it lacked scientific evidence, hence the \u2018wise men\u2019 had to resort to ensure people not only love the Almighty but are also scared of Him. Beliefs around water\u2026 King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, inherited the throne upon the death of his revered father King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016 and His Majesty the King has officially been crowned the King of Thailand during the coronation ceremonies on May 4, 2019. But in Thai royal tradition only after a king is consecrated does he become a Devaraja, or God king, and the upholder of Buddhism. The king performed a series of Brahmin and Buddhist rituals, including a purification ceremony where sacred water that was collected from nine locations around the country, was poured on him. For weeks leading up to the coronation, officials collected water from more than 100 sources across the country between 11:52 h and 12:38 h \u2013 deemed an auspicious time in Thai astrology. The water was then blessed in Buddhist ceremonies at major temples before being combined in another consecration rite at Wat Suthat \u2013 one of Bangkok\u2019s oldest temples. The consecrated water is used in two rituals at the Grand Palace. The first is the bath to \u201cpurify\u201d the king, where the water is poured over his body while he wears a white robe. The second is to anoint the monarch. Eight people pour the water on his hands \u2013 this time that will included Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn \u2013 the king\u2019s younger sister \u2013 Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, as well as Brahmins and royal court pandits (scholars). The use of water is based on a Brahmin tradition dating back centuries, experts say. (Source: www.bbc.com). In a ceremony where the Thai government supposedly spent over 30 Million US Dollars, water was an extremely important part of the ritual. Is there possibly a science behind the belief? We all know that human body constitutes 70% water (well, even the bones are 30% water!). There are ship loads of information on the net to prove that water has \u2018memory\u2019. Yes, you heard it right, water has memory. An extraordinary paper authored by Nobel prize-winning Luc Montagnier has described memory effects in aqueous DNA solutions that the authors propose depend on interactions with the background electromagnetic field. These effects, if real, require the prior processing and dilution of the solutions and are explained by Montagnier as resonance phenomena with nanostructures derived from the DNA and water. Ah! So if you want me to say that in English, it means the structure of the water determines how the molecules are organized and turn into \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 water and behave accordingly. I have seen some extremely interesting videos on YouTube that talk about the memory of water and that without changing the chemical composition of the water, you can rearrange the molecules in such a way that water will behave completely in a different way. I am particularly fascinated by the 9 odd minute video of Sadhguru (Water Has Memory \u2013 Sadhguru at IIT Madras: Part V) who goes on to say that memory of water and what it can do is no more superstition but science. He talks of an interesting story where an upset housewife who was not in the best of moods, offered water which he refused since the water was supposedly \u2018poisoned\u2019 as the molecular structure was rearranged in a harmful way. As said earlier, there are loads of video and documents that prove the memory of water which includes the likes of Prof. Bernd Kroeplin of Germany. And if we go by the beliefs as laid down above, it truly applies to several scientific beliefs including homeopathy. That brings me to the fact that almost all religions and local traditions consider water as an extremely important ally of humankind which is why there is always some form of \u2018holy water\u2019 that forms the spine of such beliefs. My niece who is settled in the Middle East, once gave me a small bottle of aab e zamzam (Water from the well of Zamzam, a well located within the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, 20 m (66 ft) east of the Kabah, the holiest place in Islam!). I carried it to the Philippines where I had lived for over a decade, and carried the remaining of the bottle everywhere we relocated (from Philippines to Chennai to East Timor to Ranchi to Hyderabad) and finally thought that the remaining water must have gone bad after so many years. We finally disposed it off in the most revered way only to realise much later that if the water was truly from there, it would never go bad (unless I decide to \u2018poison\u2019 it). It is only now that I understand why my Maa would read out some dua (prayer) and blow it into the water to make it sacred. The line between belief and superstition I have heard claims from many that they are not superstitious at all. Well, most of the time they are wrong. Do you know what a weed is? It says a wild plant growing where it is not wanted and in competition with cultivated plants. Well, I think a weed is a weed only until we know how to use the plant. Water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) is a good example of a so-called weed until we learnt how to use it for fertilizer, food, fuel, paper, fibre, and energy. So is definitely true with superstition \u2013 until we truly understand the science behind the belief it remains a superstition! So coming back to my friends who claim not to be superstitious, I ask them (and I ask you as you read this!), which foot do you generally set outside the door when you step outside your home? How do you react when your foot touches your notebook or a book? Which hand do you hold your glass when you drink water? Did Mumbai Indian win the coveted IPL trophy just because Mrs. Nita Ambani sat there praying with crossed fingers and watching the game less? I can go on and on but the point I am trying to make is where the line we draw between righteous beliefs or the absurd ones. Are we not surrounded by beliefs that many a times we do not understand or not know of the reason behind it? I am sure that after reading this article, you will pause and start thinking of small things that happen around you that you have believed all the while but have not taken the trouble to reason out and give it a scientific basis. Of course sitting down while drinking water makes a lot of sense as it has been found that our kidneys filter better while sitting. Water intake while standing passes the water with a push without much filtration. I am also pretty sure that there is are strong scientific basis of course meals. A meal, for example, expanded to six courses means adding an appetizer, soup and palate cleanser prior to the main course, and serving the salad after. The order is usually appetizers, soup, palate cleanser, entree, salad and dessert. Oh! and I dare not venture into a 36 course meal such as the Wazwan from Kashmir, which, I am sure, has its own science behind the strictly followed sequence of dishes. Talking of the science behind local traditional beliefs, there are several communities in the world including in India who live near water bodies (rivers, lakes, seas) and do not catch or eat fish for certain months of the year. This belief strongly coincides with the breeding season of some major species of fish and helps maintain natural fish populations in water bodies. While both certain traditional and religious beliefs do not allow beef or pork to be consumed, it makes scientific sense as it is the carrier of largest number of diseases through bacteria, parasites, and viruses. I travel to Ethiopia quite often and have observed that a large section of the Ethiopian community not only abstains from meat and fish during the lent season that lasts about 45 days, but turn vegan refusing any animal products surprisingly including milk or milk products. For a community where almost half of the rural homes are cattle shelters (which means cattle \u2013 cows, buffaloes, and sheep live inside the house and not in the sheds outside), speaks volumes of their scientific reasoning to conserve animals and provide enough opportunities for them and the calf and kids of animals to grown and sustain. There are several other beliefs in Ethiopia but I could never figure out why Christmas in Ethiopia is celebrated on January 7! The rules of seasonal stuff As I grew up, I realized that eating \u2018seasonal\u2019 stuff was a must at home. This could range from drumsticks to oranges to lychee to specific spices to name a few. Mumbai-based eco-nutritionist and the woman behind Farmers\u2019 Market, Kavita Mukhi says, \u201cNature plans for perfection. If we follow its cycle and eat seasonal foods, being healthy is easy\u201d. Not only do foods taste best when they are in season, they are far fresher since they haven\u2019t been transported over long distances (which is why they are often picked prematurely, robbing them of their nutritional benefits). Research has proven that natural foods are nutritionally richest when they are picked in season. Preeti Patil, a Dockyard Road resident and organic farmer, says \u2018eating local\u2019 is the only way urban Indians can beat dubious farming methods and pesticide over-kill. There is a direct co-relation between eating what\u2019s in season and keeping illnesses at arm\u2019s length. Having been born and brought up in North India, I carry a couple of interesting observations; One \u2013 The festival of Holi. Ever wonder why Holi is celebrated more in northern parts of India as opposed to South India? I relate it to the change of weather from extreme cold summer \u2013 somewhere in the vicinity of March when the mercury is rising from the painful range of 2 to 5 degrees and has just about reached the pleasant 20\u2019s. A good mud bath (dhool khel) followed by a wet holi during the day and a dry (abeer) holi in the evening gives you all the reason to literally shed a layer of your skin trying to clean up. No wonder Holi is more prominent in North India. Two \u2013 Talking about changing weather and its preparedness I am reminded of Dipawali. Again, this is in the vicinity of October/November, a distinct transition from end of rainy season to the beginning of winter. You definitely need to clean up your home, shops and establishments once a year, among other things, and rainy season (or for that matter the painful summer!) is not the best of times to do that. Time to pack up your summer wear and get ready with winter wear! Yoga and the science behind it I was a college student when I had the opportunity to hear a well-known yoga guru speak. He emphasized that there are many forms of yoga that are performed naturally without realizing this to be an asana of yoga. These include yawning, cat-stretching, sighs with deep breaths and some other forms. I remember someone as him what is the most natural form of yoga that people practice? His response was \u2018namaz\u2019 (the muslim prayer). Whether yoga borrowed it from the natural abilities of the animal kingdom or vice versa is not the point. During ruk\u2019u, the kidney experiences a sort of massage and this is helpful in dealing with kidney problems. During sajdah, one sits in vajrasana, a very important yoga pose from the health point of view. Vajrasana strengthens the thigh and calf muscles. It is good for digestion and keeps your spine firm and erect. Sajdah is very beneficial in the proper functioning of brain, lungs, body muscles, joints and entire vertebral column. Sajdah helps maintain smooth blood flow to the brain region, and also stimulates pituitary gland as well as the pineal gland. Sajdah reduces the chances of brain hemorrhage and headache due to smooth blood flow to the head region. While performing sajdah, the toes experience acupressure which is good for health, and gives relief from pain. Salam is the excellent form of neck and upper vertebra exercise. Namaz\u2019s salam is the Griva-sakti-vikasaka or strengthening the neck of Yogic Sukshma Vyayama, which is helpful in loosening the neck joints and also helps to relax the shoulder and upper back muscles. Salam relaxes nerves that pass through the neck, hence it is good in case of headaches and migraines. Namaz is also one of the best forms of meditation or dhyana from the yogic point of view, where the person unilaterally surrenders to Allah. Meditation is defined as the uninterrupted flow of mind towards a particular object. One can easily draw parallels of Ruk\u2019u to Ardhuttansana; Julus to Varjasana; Sujud to Balasana; and of course the meditation part of this. Sitting on the floor while eating is more of a tradition and is especially a given in most rural cultures. The posture can be equated to Sukhasana, a yoga posture which helps in improving digestion as the circulatory system can focus solely upon digestion and not on our legs dangling from a chair or supporting us while we are standing. Traditional beliefs Most temples are located along magnetic wave lines of the earth, which help in maximizing the available positive energy. The copper plate (called Garbhagriha or Moolasthan) buried under the main idol absorbs and resonates this energy to its surroundings. Going to the temple often helps in having a positive mind and garnering positive energies, which in turn lead to healthier functioning. It is also a practice to take off footwear before entering places of worship because they would bring in the dirt to an otherwise cleansed and sanctified environment. Interestingly, this is practiced in almost all religions and beliefs with the exception of Christianity. My vague guess is that since a large population of Christians live in climates that can be extremely cold, removing shoes can be a bit of a problem! Traditions in Hinduism are based on scientific knowledge and moved from generations to generations as traditions. In many local traditions, especially in the earlier years, throwing coins into the water body \u2013 rivers, lakes and ponds \u2013 was a given. The coins then used to be copper made which a vital ingredient for health hence the best way to embed it in local cultures and traditions. In Hindu culture, people greet each other by joining their palms \u2013 termed as \u201cNamaskar\u201d. The general reason behind this tradition is that greeting by joining both the palms means respect but scientifically speaking, joining both hands ensures joining the tips of all the fingers together; which are denoted to the pressure points of eyes, ears, and mind. Pressing them together is said to activate the pressure points which helps us remember that person for a long time. And of course, no germs since we don\u2019t make any physical contact! Tulsi is considered a sacred plant and has great medicinal properties. It is a remarkable antibiotic. Taking Tulsi every day in tea or otherwise increases immunity and help prevent diseases, stabilize his or her health condition, balance the body system and most important of all, prolong life. Keeping Tulsi plant at home prevents insects and mosquitoes from entering the house. It is said that Tulis plant also acts as a deterrent for snakes. The culture of fasting Again, not bound by any religion but practiced in almost all of them stands the example of fasting that ranges from longer term fasting such as in Ramadan to intermittent fasting practiced in several cultures and religions. Again, the range is as wide as abstaining from all food in any form including water to selective fasting where fruit juice or milk is taken. Obviously if there was no great scientific basis, fasting could never have been such a trusted and popular belief. Scientific evidence shows that short-term intermittent fasting significantly decreased blood sugar levels. While acute inflammation is a normal immune process used to help fight off infections, chronic inflammation can have serious consequences for your health. Research shows that inflammation may be involved in the development of chronic conditions, such as heart disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis and some studies have found that fasting can help decrease levels of inflammation and help promote better health. There is also scientific evidence to prove that fasting may enhance heart health by improving blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Of course, if done well, fasting aids weight loss by limiting calorie intake and boosting metabolism. And here is a reason to smile: Fasting could delay aging and extend longevity. Mark Mattson, a professor of neuroscience in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging says \u2018Fasting is a challenge to your brain, and we think that your brain reacts by activating adaptive stress responses that help it cope with disease\u2019. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense your brain should be functioning well when you haven\u2019t been able to obtain food for a while. Aromatherapy The use of essential oils for therapeutic, spiritual, hygienic and ritualistic purposes goes back to a number of ancient civilizations including the Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans who used them in cosmetics, perfumes and drugs. Oils were used for aesthetic pleasure and in the beauty industry. It was a luxury item and a means of payment. Huh! While aromatherapy has been criticized as pseudoscientific fraud, it finds its place in almost all cultures, religions and traditions across the globe. Aromatherapy (therapy via a distinctive, typically pleasant smell) which has found its way from the cheapest incense sticks to the world\u2019s costliest fragrances, is the treatment or prevention of disease by use of essential oils, among other things. Other stated uses include pain and anxiety reduction, enhancement of energy and short-term memory, relaxation, hair loss prevention, and reduction of eczema-induced itching. Two basic mechanisms are offered to explain the purported effects. One is the influence of aroma on the brain, especially the limbic system through the olfactory system. The other is the direct pharmacological effects of the essential oils. No wonder by 2024, the global fragrance market is estimated to be worth about 92 billion U.S. dollars. I consider myself lucky to have visited over 30 countries that includes Tanzania and Kenya. I once happened to buy a local weapon made of a very strong wood (to kill animals) right from the makers \u2013 the Maasai tribes who are natives of Kenya and northern Tanzania. While I was not a victim of the ritual, for the Maasai spitting at each other is seen as a way of giving a blessing. While I try to figure out the reason of this rather weird ritual, or that of Friday the 13th or the palm that itches, you look around and find some science behind the beliefs surrounding you! ",
