            "answer_text": "If you have chosen Science and Mathematics as your core subjects, then you will get an ample amount of opportunities, like, you can take exam of the so-called prestigious colleges of India, namely IIT JEE, or you can go with other good colleges like IISER, IIST, and many others, otherwise, there are many private colleges waiting to take your admission. Else, if you are a very bright student, then you can pursue engineering in foreign colleges like MIT or Havard. After this, you\u2019ll get a degree, and a good job, and you\u2019ll lead a good life. Hope it helps. ",
