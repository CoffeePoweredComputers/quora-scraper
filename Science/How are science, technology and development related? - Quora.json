            "answer_text": "Development has many layers. Populations develop naturally via evolution. Human societies develop based on changing socio-economic reasons. And political environment, obviously (namely in the more troublesome times). And, there\u2019s another aspect of development of human society: the urge of finding the truth about what\u2019s around us. Perhaps some reason why we\u2019re here. The goal we should aim towards, some sort of destiny of us all\u2026 The trouble here is that there\u2019s no such thing in the universe. It has no goal, but to be. So has life. But still, we need some goal, some reason, something we can look up to. Something we can aspire to achieve. And, in short, it can be called enlightenment. The word had changed definitions throughout the ages, of course. It might mean a lot of things, starting with getting close to God and ending with accepting the atheistic universal forces. But in general, it was always about one thing: finding out how the world works. And at this point, we start to talk about science. There were a few approaches developed to find out how the world works. The religion was probably the 1st one: don\u2019t you know something? How or why something happens just like it happens? Well, there\u2019s a God of that thing and He/She\u2019s doing that because\u2026 (Whatever was convenient for the Priest/Priestess at the point\u2026) But after a while, we found that thinking itself has some rules and that lies may be detected by them. And logic was found. And that was the point at which proper reasoning emerged. People learned how to think about things properly, how to shield themselves from lies, even well-hidden ones. And religion was challenged by science. Unfortunately (IMO), it was already too deeply incorporated to the human society to be got rid of. Anyway, since then, religion and science coexist and sort of battle; as science succeeds to answer more and more deep questions about the nature of the world, religion is forced to review its dogmas that used to be unquestionable but gradually become obviously silly\u2026 Science will never have answers to everything, though. It can only describe, better or worse, the real world (or other worlds, like the formal world of mathematics). But people don\u2019t (mostly) live in real world. We all spend most of our times in a sort of fictional overlay of reality, where things like good/bad, law/crime, sense/madness, morality/wickedness and all the other purely human-made concepts dwell, although there\u2019s nothing like that in the universe itself. Science will never deal with that. It deals with facts of the world, not with ideals we\u2019ve made up about it. And now, technology. Well, technology is applied science. Actually, it\u2019s the proof that science truly works. Just try to fire a rocket to the Moon based on religion or hope or faith\u2026 I wager that it won\u2019t get any higher than a startled kangaroo. Science is the thing that can get a rocket to the Moon. And technology is the projection of science into reality, the usage of scientific conclusions. Lastly, is that all sustainable? Can science kill us all through abused technology before we wise up enough to prevent it? Actually, that\u2019s my question to you. I\u2019ve no idea. Still, I thing we could do much worse than develop accordingly to scientific findings. Yes, sometimes they may be wrong. But historically, science is the most accurate way of learning about the world there ever had been. Perhaps we might overpower ourselves using it, but frankly, I see no better way forth than the scientific method and the path of logical reasoning. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s best summed up with this truism:\u201cEngineers learn to build things, scientists build things to learn.\u201d. Fundamentally, it is all part of applying what we understand to a problem. The difference lies in the nature of the problem. A pure scientist would likely define that very abstractly as \u201cignorance\u201d. And so, pure science is concerned more about expanding out understanding of the world, than it is about taking that understanding and using it to some particular end. A pure engineer would have a more concrete definition of the problem, which is usually a specific challenge that is being faced. Building a bridge, or a building, or a car, or a computer, or whatever. They would use only what they already knew to be true, and wouldn\u2019t create any new understanding along the way. Those are the opposite ends of a spectrum. Very few pure engineers or pure scientists actually exist. In most cases, somewhere in the middle, new things are discovered over the course of creating practical applications of theoretical knowledge, and similarly, very little theoretical knowledge is pursued without some potential practical application in mind. It\u2019s really a matter of perspective, motivations, and whether the endeavor is meant mostly to create a tangible thing, or mostly to create knowledge. ",
