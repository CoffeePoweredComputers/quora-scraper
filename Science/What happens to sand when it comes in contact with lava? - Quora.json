            "answer_text": "John Flavin's answer is best here so far. It would be very rare and uncommon for any sediment to be melted and incorporated into a lava flow for two reasons: The temperature difference between molten lava at 1100\u00b0C and the sand sediments at ambient means the the lava just quenches as it runs over the sediment not incorporating any.Mostly lava and sediments are of very different compositions. Considering mafic lava at Hawaii, these lavas are rich in magnesium and iron silicates which, even if both were melted, would not mix with silica sand (felsic) or carbonate sand. In Hawaii we alsi have black lava sand made out of the same lava types, but then we are back at reason #1 above.Aside from occasional minuscule entrainment, lava and sand sized sediments never melt and mix together on any meaningful scale.

            "answer_text": "The temperature of lava when it is first ejected from a volcanic vent can vary between 700 and 1,200 degrees C (1,300 to 2,200 F). The melting point of sand, which is predominantly silicon dioxide, is incredibly high requiring a temperature of (1,610 \u00b0C). The boiling point of SiO2 is (2,230 \u00b0C). Sand may become integrated into the lava, but it is doubtful that it will become part of the melt. ",
