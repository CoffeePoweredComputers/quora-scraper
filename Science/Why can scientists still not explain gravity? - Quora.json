            "answer_text": "In this world of rapidly advancing science, it can be easy to get swept up by it all and start believing that we know everything and can do anything. This isn\u2019t a new phenomenon- scientists have been predicting that we will achieve functional immortality sometime in the near future for decades, and they\u2019re still saying it, even though we still have no idea how to even begin with that. So it\u2019s good to remember the things that we don\u2019t know, that we don\u2019t understand and just can\u2019t explain no matter how hard we try. We might find out an answer eventually- given enough time to research, hard-working scientists will come up with an explanation eventually- but for now, plenty of things remain mysteries. Like Gravity. And everything that it does. ",
