            "answer_text": "This is an open ended question. Are we talking in sunlight, in the freezer? Suppose in sunlight then the crushed ice with much more surface area and cloudy surface would melt completely first. The cube with less surface area and more light transmittance from being clear would melt more slowly. This also assumes the crushed is spread out and not crushed but left in a cube shape, for that would introduce a change in variables. Have you ever been drinking a soda with the cup mostly full of ice (McDonalds, I\u2019m looking at you) and gotten a freezer burn headache? I have not. Try the same with a slushy and get a completely different reaction. The liquid loses heat more quickly to the crushed ice in the slushy while the soda loses heat more slowly to the hollow ice cubes. This seems irrespective of cup size, but of course the ratio of ice to drink could be different. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not exactly sure but I think crushed ice does. I think the main reason is because when its crushed the ice is in smaller pieces, the ice has a bigger surface then and the temperature of the surface of the object is going to melt ice faster when the surface of the ice is bigger Here's a link to a site that supports my theory https://www.reference.com/science/melts-faster-crushed-ice-cubed-ice-1c39eca14fbdcb2e&ved=2ahUKEwit0YyAjfTmAhUvyaYKHVX6CuQQFjABegQIDBAG&usg=AOvVaw2fETnNwqxdDT2w7Ee5qV6H ",
