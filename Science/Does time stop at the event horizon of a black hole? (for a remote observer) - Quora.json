            "answer_text": "A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing\u2014no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light\u2014can escape from it.  At the center of a black hole, as described by general relativity, may lie a gravitational singularity, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite. For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point and for a rotating black hole, it is smeared out to form a ring singularity that lies in the plane of rotation. In both cases, the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution. The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite density.  The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory. This breakdown, however, is expected; it occurs in a situation where quantum effects should describe these actions, due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions. To date, it has not been possible to combine quantum and gravitational effects into a single theory. The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon\u2014a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can pass only inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon.  To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole would appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole. Due to this effect, known as gravitational time dilation, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach the central mass of infinite density. On the other hand, indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of these effects as they cross the event horizon. According to their own clocks, which appear to them to tick normally, they cross the event horizon and reach the center after a finite time without noting any singular behavior. In 1974, Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation. This effect has become known as Hawking radiation. By applying quantum field theory to a static black hole background, he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect black body spectrum.  Black holes will therefore slowly \"evaporate\" away the matter contained in them. By the end of the black hole era, the fourth era of the universe, all black holes will have evaporated. Only extremely low-energy photons, electrons, positrons, and neutrinos will remain. Black holes are therefore not the final status of the universe. The point or ring singularity of a black hole with zero volume and infinite density (density paradox) is the steady state solution of the general relativity theory. Steady state would take an infinite amount of time to be reached because of gravitational time dilation. As the age of the universe is finite, no black hole ever reached steady state. All mass that fell into a black hole is still falling to the center and is slowing down more and more as density increases. Furthermore as black holes are slowly evaporating (escape paradox) they will have vanished before reaching infinite density. So would time freeze for someone that reaches the event horizon of a black hole? No indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of the time dilation effects as they cross the event horizon. Would time measured by a distant observer seem to freeze for someone that reaches the event horizon of a black hole? It would slow down but not freeze as the density of the black hole is not infinite at the event horizon. Would time measured by a distant observer seem to freeze for someone that reaches the singularity of a black hole? Yes but the distant observer would not be able to see that person anymore after he crosses the event horizon. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you move and measure. Do you know what a \u201clight cone\u201d means? It\u2019s when you draw a space-time chart where time goes up and space goes in other perpendicular directions, there staying still means moving just in time and not in space, which means directly straight up in this chart, and moving with speed of light means moving along a x=ct line, such lines draw a cone such that light can only move along this cone surface and massive bodies can only move inside the cone.  Now, black hole warps space-time and turns the cones towards its center.  Which means two things. First: a massive body at the horizon, which can still move anywhere inside its light cone, can only move deeper inside the black hole, as all its future light cone lies inside. Second: staying at the horizon means moving along a light cone surface, only light can do it, and it\u2019s effectively the same as moving with speed of light. You\u2019ve probably heard that time slows down for objects moving very fast and stops for light. Here it\u2019s the same: staying at the horizon is like moving with light speed and time stops for whoever does that (and we know that only light can do that). Technically, if you take two events: some point on horizon at time t1 and same point at time t2, then proper time, i.e. time passed on the clock of whoever moves from first event to the second, is zero, i.e. time does not tick for such traveler. Just as it doesn\u2019t tick for light traveling in ordinary space. But just as time doesn\u2019t stop for you when light passes by, if you fall through the event horizon time won\u2019t stop for you as the horizon passes by, time will still tick for you, as you\u2019ll be moving inside your light cone. So it\u2019s not stopping for everyone at the horizon, only for those who try to stay at the horizon, i.e. massless light-like beings. ",

The closer to the center of a gravity field you are, the more time slows for you\u2026 right now, you\u2019re aging *slower* than the guys on the space station. The GPS satellites are basically atomic clocks - they broadcast the time, and the very small difference in time our GPS units \u2018hear\u2019 dictates where we are on the surface of the Earth - but, because of their altitude, the GPS satellites have to broadcast time just a *little bit slower* than time is really passing for them - otherwise, their signals would cause an error in location here on Earth. So, as you approach Earth\u2019s surface, time slows; the stronger the acceleration due to gravity, the more it slows - now, imagine approaching a black hole\u2019s event horizon, where escape velocity is the speed of light\u2026 time comes to a virtual stand still at that location. You could look out at the universe, and see it aging and dying in what, for you, is a few seconds or a few minutes\u2026 but, the downside is, all the in-falling matter, and all the energy from all the events in the universe will come crashing down on you, seemingly all at once\u2026 you\u2019ll be rapidly cooked if you were able to remain on the edge of the event horizon.

            "answer_text": "Just up top, I\u2019m not an expert, just an aspirational astrophysicist whose read a lot of books. Cool? Cool. In short? From what I understand, no. In fact, the opposite. Time dilation as you\u2019re describing happens due to special and general relativity as described by Einstein (it was his whole thing). Special relativity described speed, general describes mass, or more specifically gravity. Again, in short, if you\u2019re travelling really fast, or under intense gravity, or both, you\u2019re internal clock will slow, meaning time outside of you will seem to speed up. Another way of thinking about this is that i would seem like you travelled forward in time. A black hole has extremely high gravity that would affect you more and more the closer you got to the singularity. That high gravity would cause you to increase in speed the closer you got to it. So, at the event horizon of a black hole, just due to general relativity, time would actually speed up for you, instead of slow down and then freeze. But wait, there\u2019s more. Even if you can\u2019t travel back after passing an event horizon, you could still survive for a while after passing it, meaning as you got closer and closer, time would speed up even faster. In theory, if you could somehow stay alive while inside the singularity, the entire universe would seem to play out in front of your eyes. Hope that helps. ",

There is some disagreement about how rapid the aging is. A remote observer will see the in-falling person reach nearly infinite time dilation just as he reaches the event horizon. By symmetry this would imply that everything at a higher altitude than the in-falling person will age infinitely fast and everything that is destined to fall into the black-hole will catch up to you at the event horizon. If Hawking radiation is true then black holes have a finite lifespan and the in-falling person will reach the event horizon at the same time as the end of the black holes lifespan and thus the event horizon will recede from them before they can actually cross it. This means the in-falling observer reaching the event horizon will simultaneously be crushed by all the in-falling matter catching up to them and burned to a crisp by the accelerated rate of Hawking radiation.

            "answer_text": "The event horizon represents an extreme case of what happens to clocks in a gravitational field. Allow me to explain. Suppose you have the following equipment with you: A high-accuracy laser emitter, which emits monochromatic red light at the exact wavelength of 599.584916 nanometers, which corresponds exactly to 500 trillion cycles per second. Furthermore, your laser is set up such that it emits exactly 500 trillion cycles during the course of one second, and then stays off for the duration of another 500 trillion cycles (i.e., another second), only to begin the cycle again. You stand on the surface of a planet, in its gravitational field. You aim this laser at the sky. The light of your laser beam loses energy as it reaches space and escapes the gravitational field of the planet. When light loses energy, it does not slow down. Instead, its frequency changes. In this case, if the planet on which you are standing is like the Earth, the frequency of the light that you emit decreases, by the time it gets into deep space, by 350,000 cycles per second. So instead of 500 trillion cycles, it will be 499,999,999,650,000 cycles per second. Someone sitting in deep space with a telescope will see this light coming from your location. But he will still see the light turning off after 500 trillion cycles. Except that for this observer, those 500 trillion cycles will now take one second and 0.7 nanoseconds to arrive. So you, on the planet, are measuring 500 trillion cycles in exactly 1 second. The observer in deep space, watching your laser beam, sees the same 500 trillion cycles, but according to his clock, they take 1.0000000007 seconds to arrive. And in fact, if you were to modulate your laser beam by something more complex than a simple on-off signal: e.g., live audio or video, that, too, will appear to slow down ever so slightly to this distant observer. Your 500 trillion cycles will carry exactly 1 second of video; but to the deep space observer, it will take 1.0000000007 seconds for that video to play. Of course 0.7 nanoseconds is not a hell of a lot of time. But that\u2019s because the gravitational field of a planet like the Earth is not particularly strong. Try placing that laser apparatus on the surface of a neutron star, and you end up with a 15% or greater difference in the rate at which the laser pulses arrive in deep space compared to the rate at which they were sent. The event horizon of a black hole represents the extreme case: the closer the transmitter is to the horizon, the greater this difference in clock rates, until it becomes infinite when the transmitter reaches the horizon. It simply represents the fact that for anything (including photons), escaping to infinity from the event horizon requires more energy than the total mass-energy of the object itself, i.e., escape is impossible.

            "answer_text": "Its all about TIME, as in time/space. I see few descriptions of Black Holes that include the Time dimension; and yet it was Einstein\u2019s introduction of the time dimension that changed the way we view Gravity. What is not stated in most descriptions of time/space is that the time dimension is not merely a direction; it is movement. Every point in the Universe can be thought of as having three dimensions, and moving at the speed of light through time (the 4th dimension). The speed of light is the speed of time. Everything moves at the speed of light, in some direction through space/time. Light does not move through time so all of its movement is seen as the absolute movement through space. The more of a thing\u2019s time we see, as movement (velocity), the less of the things time we see as the passing of time (its clocks appear slower). We can only see a total of three dimensions at once. I say total, because it is possible to see some of the 4th dimension of an object(velocity); but the more of the 4th dimension you see, the less of it\u2019s three spacial dimensions you can see. Its like rotating a box held in front of you. As the 2 dimensional face is rotated, it appears to get narrower, until the rotation reaches 90 degrees, and it becomes the side. It is now flat to your perspective and is merely a one dimensional line. If we see all of a thing\u2019s 4th dimension, as velocity, then we can\u2019t see any of its TIME, as in the passing of time; and one of its spacial dimensions is completely flat; it is two dimensional and moving at the speed of light. If we see none of a things time movement ( zero velocity), then we can see all of the things TIME, as the passing of time; its clocks would run the same rate that yours would. You both would be moving parallel through time at the speed of light; and because your movement is parallel, you would appear to be standing still, relative to one another. ALL MOVEMENT IS RELATIVE. General Relativity explains gravity, by showing that Mass changes the direction of time, causing time to point to some degree toward the center of Mass. It can be calculated that at the surface of the Earth, time angles in at about .02 degrees. The Gravitational field of a black hole is such that it produces an event horizon. This is the radius at which the time dimension is pointing straight in toward the center of mass; and remember time is movement at the speed of light. Any thing falling into a black hole will reach the speed of light at the event horizon; and because all of its time is seen as movement (velocity), its clocks will appear stopped, and it will be two dimensional, completely flat in one dimension. At the event horizon an object would be seen as having 2 spacial dimensions, and one dimension of movement at the speed of light, we can only see a total of three dimensions at once. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine an earthbound generator spinning at a rate of 10 times per second. If connected properly to an antenna you can make the electrons in the antenna go up and down 10 times a second, which is normally described as 10 Hz. The result will be a radio wave of that same frequency. (This radio wave will have a ridiculously long wavelength, but never mind that for now.) Say you are within sight of the generator, and there is a mark on the spinning part. You will see the mark go around 10 times a second. If you have an oscilloscope hooked up to a receiver that receives these radio waves you will \u201csee\u201d the radio wave \u201cgoing up and down\u201d 10 times a second, in sync with the mark on the generator. (Or you can consider that you had to tune your receiver to 10 Hz, just like you can tune an AM radio on earth to 1010 kHz, e.g.) OK, let\u2019s put you in geostationary earth orbit (so that you\u2019ll go around the earth once a day, meaning you\u2019ll hover above the same spot on earth indefinitely). The photons that make up the radio wave are moving up against the earth\u2019s gravity. Therefore, they lose energy. Using E = hf (E is the energy of each photon, h is Planck\u2019s constant, and f is the frequency, 10 Hz) you can see that when a photon loses energy, its frequency must go down. Now, let\u2019s imagine that in losing energy each photon goes from 10 Hz to 8 Hz. (which is a ridiculously larger change than would actually happen, but it will illustrate the point). When we put you in orbit we equipped you with a receiver, an oscilloscope, and a powerful telescope with a screen. You now use the scope to project an image of the distant generator and oscilloscope onto a white screen. You will of course see the distant generator and oscilloscope in sync with each other on the screen. Since the radio wave has a frequency of 8 Hz, the signal on the oscilloscope will \u201cgoing up and down\u201d at that same frequency, hence the mark on the generator will be turning at 8 Hz (moving in a full circle 8 times per second). So from your point of view, the generator is spinning more slowly than what an earthbound observer would see, from which you conclude that time on earth must be passing more slowly than it is for you. Plug in more realistic numbers and you still get time slowing down, but not by much. (Note: It\u2019s not the change in the strength of gravity that slows time; it\u2019s that given two clocks, the one that is uphill of the other will run faster.) Now, as for what happens at a black hole, it is said, as you approach the black hole\u2019s event horizon, time goes slower and slower (as seen from an outside observer) at such a rate that you never cross it from our point of view. What puzzles me, then, is how black holes can ever collide, and thereby produce the gravitational waves we\u2019ve detected at LIGO and Virgo, if they can\u2019t cross each other\u2019s event horizons. I\u2019m not an expert on black holes or general relativity, so I await an answer from someone who is. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah! So, to answer this question, just remember a simple principle: Time is Relative! I'm going to assume that you're looking for a discussion regarding a person free-falling into the black hole and his perspective of time. First of all, the person, who is falling into the black hole will start to see his field of view change into darkness. This effect will keep on intensifying, upto the point he reaches the singularity, at which the shredder comes into play, and he gets spaghettified and dies. (One of the theories) Now, from the perspective of an external viewer looking at the person falling towards the black hole, he will start to see the light off that person, shift towards the red side of the spectrum due to doppler effect. Now, as soon as the person falls into the black hole, light scattered off his body won't be able to leave and so, the viewer won't be able to detect any further changes and he would see the initial person, hanging at the event horizon. The light scattered from this picture of the 'already spaghettified' human being will keep on red-shifting and soon enter the infra-red region, at which instant, he would stop being visible to the viewer.

            "answer_text": "In a nut shell time does not just appear to stop, but relative to the distant reference frame time does stop. However, the recession velocity continues pulling everything across the event horizon. I could go through a long chain of mathematics, but instead I will just include it as a footnote later.[1] But if you understand special relativity, the answer is simple. Time stops at the speed at the event horizon, because the only speed you can cross the event horizon at is the speed of light. No faster, no slower. It comes down to understanding the relationship between Newton\u2019s escape velocity, and relativity\u2019s recession velocity. They are exactly the same! As your recession velocity approaches c, the space and time are distorted so your velocity relativite to that recession velocity cannot combine with recession velocity to give you a net velocity greater than c prior to crossing the event horizon. So if I free fall from very far away to an event horizon relative to a distant reference frame I will cross the event horizon at c. A bream of light pointed at the black hole will cross the event horizon at c. A rocket trying uncessfully escape with insufficient thrust will cross the event horizon at c. None of these are the same velocity locally. But to us distant observer they are all the same velocity, and the are all time dilated to 0 by that velocity. It is an apparent singularity. Now what is the apparent effect is it appears to the distant observer as if the falling object slowed down and stopped at the event horizon. Indeed this is an apparent effect. The reason being is as light heads away from the black hole the very space the light is passing through is pulled back into the black hole. It is like trying to paddle a canoe upstream. Even if you paddle fast enough to succeed it will take much longer than going the other way. So if all else remained static about the blackhole you would continue to see increasingly redshifted images of the final moment before crossing the event horizon forever. Footnotes[1] Bill C. Riemers's answer to How can black holes collide if it takes an infinite amount of time (from our perspective) for objects to even cross the event horizon?",

            "answer_text": "Time never stops!The effect of time dilation in a black hole is caused by the movement from a high gravitational potential to a lower one (basically, getting closer to a massive object). It is predicted by relativity, but impossible to prove empirically since we cannot go in and out of a black hole at will. Time is a relative issue. The rate at which time moves forward slows down when you're near a very heavy object compared to the rate at which time moves forward for someone who is not near that very heavy object.If you would be inside a black hole, a day would still last a day for you. However the time outside that black hole would have passed at a much higher rate. Would you be truly at the center of a black hole where gravity is infinite, then time would stop compared to the world outside the black hole. So in a fraction of a second inside the black hole, eternity has passed outside the black hole. - taken from wikianswers.com ",

Time just goes on as always for you as you move towards, and pass through, and accelerate toward the infinite curvature of spacetime. But for an observer, watching you fall from afar, they see time slow down, more and more. So much so that it takes an infinite amount of time for you to reach the event horizon. They see you appear to come to a complete stop, but actually it's just that your time is moving super slow from their reference frame. Of course for you time is normal. Nothing unusual at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I will try using words and I hope it gives reasoanble flavour of the mechanism. A man is falling into a black hole. You see the photons that left the man and arrived at your eyes. 1 minute later you observe again and see the photons arriving one minute after the previous observation. However these photons left the falling man a short time (10 seconds say) after the first lot of photons. So if they left 10 seconds later, why do they arrive at your eyes a minute later? The man has fallen deeper into the gravitational field, the photons leaving the man just 10 seconds later have to climb out of a much stronger graviational field so they take longer and they arrive not 10 seconds blater but a minute. The man falls further and after another minute you look again and see photons that left the man only 1 second aftedr the previous lot- same reason stronger graviational field and further to travel out of it. Now think about what you observe. A long way from the black hole - man travels a long way between one observation and another a minute later. Entering the black hole you see the man travel the distance covered in 10 seconds but you see this after the a minute has elapsed. Then you see the man only travel a distance covered in 1 second when lookiung a minute after the prevouds observation. You can continue this until he reaches the event horizon - these photons will never /take for ever to get out and travel to you. From your point of view you have to wait an eternity for the photons to arrive fomr the man at the event horizon. So he never seems to get there - it seems like time has stopped. The falling man - he just falls into the black hole encountering considerable discomfort before he arrives at the event horizon. ",

Unfortunately we can't see objects frozen in time there because of quantum mechanical effects: light comes in discrete packets called photons, and there are only so many photons that can be emitted from an object falling towards the event horizon.  Also, because of various effects of gravity, light from objects falling towards the event horizon is red-shifted.  If you could watch an object as it fell towards the event horizon it would initially speed up, but then start to slow down and appear redder.  It would get ever slower as it approached the event horizon, and also ever redder.  There would be one last red or infrared photon you could see coming from the object and then it would disappear from view for ever. ",

The speed of light simply slows down in gravity wells, reaching zero by the event horizon and thereby freezing the functionality of any clock that you put there and making it impossible for it to travel any further in. Spacetime is just a contrived and misleading mathematical abstraction which breaks by producing an infinite number of event-meshing failures which do not occur in the real universe, so the GTR model should not be taken seriously, particularly when we have a better theory in the form of LET (Lorentz Ether Theory) which can account for all the same observations and experiments using the same maths but in a much simpler way with Euclidean geometry.

            "answer_text": "This nonsense about \u201ctime freezing\u201d needs to stop. You can go to black hole, park yourself where your time goes to zero as seen by us, and fly back to Earth. If time \u201cfroze\u201d(more on that later) how would you do anything? How would anything on the ship work for you to navigate the ship back to Earth if the whole thing is in suspended animation? Answer - you couldn\u2019t. That is because this notion \u201ctime freezing\u201d is nonsense. A Mathematical Proof: For those interested in that sort of thing.The location where our coordinate time goes to zero is found where the time-time component of the metric goes to zero, or [math]g_{tt} =0[/math] and the location where this happens is called the static limit surface (SLS) or infinite redshift surface (IRS). For a rotating black hole this surface marks the outer boundary of the ergoregion. So we have for a rotating black hole a mass parameter [math]m[/math] , an angular momentum parameter [math]a=J/m[/math] (a.k.a. Kerr parameter), and expressed in the usual Boyer-Lindquist coordinates [math]g_{tt}=1 - \\dfrac{2mr}{\\Sigma}=\\dfrac{r^2-2mr+a^2 cos ^2 \\vartheta }{r^2+a^2 cos ^2 \\vartheta}=0 \\tag*{}[/math] upon solving [math]r_{ILS}=m +\\sqrt{ m^2-a^2 cos ^2 \\vartheta}\\tag*{}[/math] and knowing that the event horizon has the r-coordinate [math]r_h=m +\\sqrt{ m^2-a^2}[/math] it is necessarily the case that [math]r_{ILS}>r_h[/math] if [math]cos \\vartheta > 0[/math] and necessarily the case that objects at the infinite redshift surface are outside the event horizon, meaning they can indeed escape. This does not work for a degenerate black hole where the angular momentum goes to zero and [math]a=0[/math] and [math]r_h=2m[/math]. This type of black hole is called a Schwarzschild black hole. However, the reason you can\u2019t fly back from the degenerate black hole has nothing to do with either the infinite redshift or coordinate time diverging but because the location of the infinite redshift surface just happens to be directly on top of the Schwarzschild event horizon - the one way membrane that traps you and is found, not by setting [math]g_{tt}=0[/math] but by setting [math]g^{rr}=0[/math] . In Schwarzschild it so happens that [math]g_{tt}=g^{rr}[/math] but for realistic black holes [math]g_{tt} \\neq g^{rr}[/math]. So you could go where our coordinate time becomes infinite with respect to your proper time, and come back. (How much would elapse? That\u2019s actually a heckuva calculation as the Kerr metric contains mixed terms containing the coordinate time). Generalized Time Freezing NonsenseThe big problem with \u201ctime freezing\u201d is that in the context of relativity, time is a length. Feel free to measure it in meters or inches; it\u2019s a distance. What does it mean to \u201cfreeze\u201d a length? You could do an experiment: Hold a meter stick in hands and ask yourself, what would happen if the left direction suddenly froze? You can ponder this awhile until you come to the realization that freezing a dimension is utter nonsense. It is a fundamental principle of relativity that all identical clocks tick away at the same rate. Whether you\u2019re on Earth or somewhere in a black hole spacetime, your watch keeps marching on to the same beat. ",

            "answer_text": "Now, do you want to know why time appears to slow, or why things actually time slower, as an object approaches the event horizon of a black hole? These are two different questions, with two different answers. The first is an optical illusion caused by gravity delaying the light, by which we see, from reaching our eyes. Basically, the closer an object gets to a black hole, the more it slows down the light heading away from the black hole. It's like pressing slo-mo replay, but it keeps getting slower and slower. The second effect is actual time dilation. Clocks actually tick slower, the closer they get to a black hole. The reason is quite simple. Molecules vibrate. Now imagine you're moving left and right, and suddenly someone starts pulling you to the left. It makes it harder for you to move left and right. This is basically what gravity does. It makes it harder for molecules to vibrate. The stronger the force of gravity, the harder it is for molecules to vibrate. So, clocks tick slower. Hearts beat slower. We say that time slows down, but technically, it's our molecules which are vibrating slower. Now obviously, for the person falling into the black hole, there won't be any visible signs of time dilation. As clocks tick slower, so does our biological clock. Both slow down exactly the same amount, so for that person, everything seems normal. It's complicated, but I'm putting it in layman's terms so people can get the basic idea. ",

Also, time itself never moves and thus has no propensity to freeze nor stop. It is energy and matter that moves. Both can be contained but energy never stops and although matter apparently stops, its energy never does. The idea that time or energy can stop comes from the fact that matter apparently slows down and energy can slow down. So, from the human perspective and conception time seems to slow down or stop when it is actually energy that slows or is distorted and matter that apparently stops although it does not at and below the atomic level.

            "answer_text": "Time can't stop. It might move so slow that it gives the illusion that time has stopped by a black hole. At the event horizon, where the effect ofg gravity is at its peak, it would certainly be difficult to keep track of time. For an observer at a safe distance, it might appear like years have passed by, but the time frame for the one by the event horizon would be a far,far smaller change in time. So its all to do with time frames at different locations and the effect of gravity on those locations. ",

            "answer_text": "Spacetime and relativity are based on three postulates: 1. Light travels through the vacuum of space at a constant speed. This is correct. 2. Light travels at a constant speed which is independent of the velocity of the emitting source. This differs from a jet of water or a bullet from a gun, but due to the nature of propagation of light, this is correct. 3. Light appears to a moving observer to pass through the reference frame of the observer at a constant speed independent of the direction or velocity of the frame of reference of the observer. This is wrong. Because of postulate number 3, relativity would be missing a variable required to make its mathematics work. However, Albert Einstein compensated for this by making the progression of time into a variable. Though unnecessary, artificial and alien there is nothing mathematically wrong with this substitution which should give the same answers as if including the speed of the observer in the direction of the light source. This breach of reality, however, makes relativity unsuitable outside its range validity. ",
