            "answer_text": "Yes- a car rolling down a hill at constant speed or anything falling at constant velocity. Potential energy is being converted into thermal energy. (If you want to call thermal energy the KE of individual molecules then I may have to think again. The question is good and it raises an extremely frequent error when discussing energy transformations. Just because soemthing is moving, it does not follow that kinetic energy is being transformed, Man pedals a bike slowly up a hill at constant speed: chemical energy (in muscles) - gravitational potential energy. NO kinetic energy involved. The man on the bike initially had a small amount of KE (pedalling slowly) but he retained this throughout as his speed did not change. Man pedals very fast approaching hill and then stops pedalling and rolls up hill: Chemical energy ( in muscles)-> kinetic energy (man and bike) -> GPE ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. By definition potential energy is static energy, the energy associated with position or charge or other stationary factors. Kinetic energy IS the energy of motion of something, whether it is the object itself or some particles within the object. I would submit that a change in potential energy requires motion of something, which by definition is kinetic by definition. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but the kinetic energy still must come from somewhere. Rockets are an example. They sink in the atmosphere, but they increase in kinetic energy as they convert the chemical energy in their fuel to kinetic energy. To be clear, if you don\u2019t want to include any other forms of energy in this system, just gravitational potential and kinetic energy, then a decrease in one MUST be accompanied by an increase in the other.

            "answer_text": "I think a simpler way to answer the question is to ask, what is work: The scalar product of force x displacement. W = F \u2022 d Displacement means the object moved. Movement implies kinetic energy. That kinetic energy might have been dissipated quickly due to frictional forces, air resistance, or completely turned into heat and sound energy when it hit the ground. But for there to have been work done, the object has to move. So PE\u27a1\ufe0fKE. ",
