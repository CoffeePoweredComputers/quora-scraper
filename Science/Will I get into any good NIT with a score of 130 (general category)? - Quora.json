            "answer_text": "Yes, u will definitely get an NIT. I myself scored 140 in 2017 and that too from open category\u2026and I got Chemical Engineering at NIT Durgapur. This time the cut off is lowered to almost 70 for open which is less than previous years (81).If I have a home state quota , it will be of great help. So you definitely stand a chance with 130 atleast for Mechanical, Chemical, or may be Electrical. CS is out of question, but don't loose hope. Give the choice of institutions and branches wisely. Hope this helps!!! ",
