            "answer_text": "Chike Obi was a Nigerian politician and mathematician. In 1997, he claimed to have an elementary proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which was later shown to be a false proof (like many other similar claims before and after). While Obi definitely was an important national figure for Nigeria (he may have been the first Nigerian to hold a PhD in mathematics), his contributions to Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem are insignificant.
