            "answer_text": "I am going to write a really gloomy answer and lets be practical and real Most of the people talk about being positive and believing and I dont have any problem with that , that is really necessary but what people often forget while staying positive and optimistic is practicality ,SO you want to earn money online and many other people would also be (who must be seeing this answer ofc) So heres a thing earning money online is very very tough.Its not impossible but its tough ,(AND NO IM NOT DISCOURAGING ANYONE IM JUST TELLING YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO FACE AND STAY PRACTICAL). Sure you can earn a lot of money online but that wont happen in a short duration of time and even earning first 100$ online is very tough so all my boys out there reading this answer , get a real life part time job if you want quick money that would be a wise alternative to this NOW ALL THIS OUT OF THE WAY LETS SEE THE OPTIONS FOR WHAT ALL YOU CAN DO ONLINE TO EARN MONEY (AGAIN NOT HAPPENING FAST ) (its hard to achieve this fruit but it is actually sweeter than any sugar ) sorry i got a bit carried away above SO NOW WE WILL REALLY START TALKING ABOUT THE STUFF WHAT YOU GUYS ARE REALLY HERE FOR - 1.GIGS for Artists- this is kind of a real life part time job kindish.. so what the catch is \u2026no theres no catch basically you just do the job and pretty much get paid for the task you were asked to do .. so yeah this is the way which does promise you some amount if you do the work ofcwhat all you can do totally depends on you got really nice voice ? voice over. good at beatboxing ? try making voice effects for cartoons.good at art make vector , designs patterns ANYTHING!!!and even better\u2026 Good at photoshop ? get paid to edit photos for other people But heres a thing you need to be trusted by them (as per my knowledge I CAN BE WRONG . but you need to complete 65% of your profile on fiverr to start getting gigs and that requires you to mention your certification , education and you know more stuff so that they know that you wont be scamming on their platform and there hell lota more stuff on fiverr to try out (P.S. there are more of these kinds of sites but fiverr is on the top so yeah its more trusted than others) 2.Youtube/Podcast-good at making conversations interesting and love to talk about stuff or heck you can even show of your skills on yt who am i telling this everyone knows about youtube so you pretty much get the idea why i wont get into detail for that but if your voice is good or even if not but yoou are pretty good at talking stuff then you can start a podcast an who knows you might start getting sponsors. 3. Instagram - You can do anything on instagram but i would personally suggest you to stay away from meme pages (idk why i dont like that stuff i mean its saturated as pickle brine HEcK!!) you can make a page about cooking pets games clothes lifestyle you get the idea and let me just get to the revenue model Basically you can get paid for shout outs you can get sponsors , you can set up a store and Yeah \u2026 idk more ways for instagram YEAH you can sell your page if you will after growing it with such hardwork(tbh idt you will) thats another way tho 4.Blogging -you write articles [people come to your website and you get paid\u2026not that simple . you need to rank your website ( you need to do SEO and ooh another way to earn money is if you get to learn SEO you can do it for other people)and then further you can do affiliate marketing or set up a store and get sponsors and basically same stuff over and over NOW this is where i will hit hard THERE ARE ATLEAST A TON!! of ways to earn money online but i cannot talk about all of them and think of it will you read it ? NO and they are kinda far fetched sometimes too with time you will get to know them better if you just start walking on this path trust me its a huge Rabbit hole.HARD HIT- all of this takes hard work , money and PATIENCE all of the people maybe not all but most be faking and be like AYE YO AGE IS JUST A NUMBER AND STUFF but in reality if you are small its good enough to start knowing what you like and stuff but you cant start earning money right away , ",
