            "answer_text": "This is a false duality. Modern naturalism has a host of issues, as documented in the following books: Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals Who Find Darwinism Unconvincing, William Dembski - Amazon.com Illogical Atheism: A Comprehensive Response to the Contemporary Freethinker from a Lapsed Agnostic - Kindle edition by Bo Jinn, Diogo Lando. Naturalism these days lays on the boundary of scientism. \u201cThere being a god\u201d is also a failed premise, since all names and forms are diminished anthropomorphic representations of undifferentiated consciousness. Find your way to Advaita Vedanta, and you can see a Logical Religion. Don\u2019t confuse \u201cgod\u201d with religion or religion with \u201cgod\u201d. God is a poorly defined word that is very nearly a weasel word at this point. The primary thing is to learn how to balance being open and being discriminative. You have two parts of your mind- one literally cannot see ANY differences, and the other cannot see anything unitive. Your job is to learn to balance these perspectives by learning how your mind works. Those who subscribe to modern scientism/naturalism are highly imbalanced and biased- and their bias is nearly identical to that of fundamentalist religions also. Crucially, ego and ignorance are the main issues here, in all walks of life. So, in the future, a better question would be: \u201cHow do I avoid ego (projections) and ignorance (the psychological shadow) when I look to any given topic (in this case, spiritual inquiry)?\u201d Try not to be fooled by such false dualities, and the surface qualities our society is nearly obsessed with. Look deeper, and look within. Find a teacher who will allow you to learn about the nature of your own mind\u2019s \u2018lensing\u2019 of the nature of reality, and you\u2019ll know the answer to you own question. ",

It was incorrect about the causes of lightning and thunder, about tides, about earthquakes and volcanos and storms and countless other things. On the other hand science and naturalism has runs on the board in inverse proportion perhaps to the failures of the god explanation. To me the god explanation is so discredited that it has become ridiculous. It is nothing more than guesswork with the imprimatur of tradition. ",
