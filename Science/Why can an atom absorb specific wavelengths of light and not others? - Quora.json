            "answer_text": "First, you need to know what it is that does the absorbing. While an atom as a whole may get a \"kick\" from a high-energy photon, usually the absorbing is done by the electrons surrounding the nucleus and the atom as a whole doesn't move much at all. Why is it important? Electrons are charged particles, which can emit and absorb photons at any frequency. At least, free electrons can. But electrons in an atom are not free electrons. They are bound to that atom. Not only that, but so long as they're bound to that atom, they can only have very specific, discrete energy levels. And that is your answer. In order for a photon to be absorbed by the electron, it has to have exactly the right amount of energy, which means a specific frequency (i.e., wavelength). Photons that don't have the right frequency will not interact with that atom (or interact with it only very weakly). As a thought experiment, if you take a gas that is normally transparent (as apart from a few specific frequencies, most photons pass through it unimpeded) and heat it to the point that the gas becomes ionized, the ionized gas is no longer transparent. As it is now a medium of free electrons and also free partially ionized, positively charged ions, both of which can absorb photons of any frequency, the gas becomes opaque. As a matter of fact, this same process took place in reverse in the very early universe, as the hot, ionized gas that filled the universe cooled to the point that ions and electrons recombined into neutral atoms, and for the first time, the universe became transparent. The afterglow of this still hot gas, now traveling unimpeded in a transparent universe, is what we observe as the cosmic microwave background radiation. ",

            "answer_text": "Atoms do not just absorb light of one specific wavelength but a number of wavelengths. Like any system, atoms have a number of sates and these come in different energies. In order to absorb light the atom needs to move from one state to one of higher energy. Sometimes this gives a discrete set of possible energy absorptions but it is also possible that a continuous spectrum of light can be absorbed. This is the case for example in the photoelectric effect where energies of the light need to be above 'the work function' in order for the light to expel an electron. Think of the atom having a terraced hill of levels and in order to go from one to another you need exactly that much energy. If you have sufficient energy, however, you can eject an electron completely and have it carry off some energy as kinetic energy. This gives if a continuous spectrum. Here are some examples of atom spectra:  6.1: Electromagnetic Energy ",
