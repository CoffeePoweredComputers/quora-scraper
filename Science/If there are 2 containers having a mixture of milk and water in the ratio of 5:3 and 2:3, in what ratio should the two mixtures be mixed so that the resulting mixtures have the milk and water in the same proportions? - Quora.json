            "answer_text": "convert to percentage. 5:3 mixture is 62.5% milk 2:3 mixture is 40% milk. 4 units of the 5:3 mixture can treat 5 units of the 2:3 mixture to obtain 50% 12.5% excess strengthening the 10% deficit Amreen did essentially the same thing totally with fractions. Kudos to him. If you need to solve this mathematically, solve the following equation where X is the number of units of 62% solution to add to 40% solution X x .625 + 1 x .40 = (1 + X) x .50.625X + .40 = .50 X + .50.125 X = .1X = .8 ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if this is the rigorous way to do it but I\u2019d start with one mixture, the 5:3, and then and the 2:3 to it until the proportions even out (finding a common multiple) and then cancel it down to get the ratio like this 5:3 + 2:3 = 7:6 7:6 + 2:3 = 9:9 a perfect 50/50 mix which cancels down to 1:1 so 1 part of 5:3 with 2 parts of the 2:3 mix.
