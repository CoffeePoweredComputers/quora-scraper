            "answer_text": "Here are some from my mis-spent youth: Make a cloud chamber and observe cosmic rays. All you need is some dry ice and a bit of rubbing alcohol.Make a cathode-ray tube and observe e- deflection as you change the a surrounding magnetic field. (just don\u2019t electrocute your self)Make a Jacob\u2019s ladder using a high-voltage source from a Neon sign (same warning as #2)Make a sextant and observe the angular diameter of the sun over the course of a year. From this, determine the eccentricity of the earth\u2019s orbit.Make an atomic absorption spectrometer using a bunsen burner, a prism, and various some salt solutions. See if you can measure the splitting in the sodium D lines.Repeat #5\u2026.except using a large pickle and passing about 30\u2013120 volts through it (see warning in #2).Obtain radioactive sources (from a smoke detector) and see if you can observe beta and alpha particles in cloud chamber you built in #1. Try photographing these.Repeat #7\u2026.except put cloud chamber in presence of strong magnetic field\u2026see if you can deflect the beta particles and from this deduce their kinetic energy.Build a tube AM radio\u2026.convert this to a guitar amplifier.use a HeNe laser and repeat the Michaelson-Moreley experiment to measure speed of light.Make a Fabrey-Perot interferometer (needed for #10)Make an x-ray source and take xrays images of various objects using polaroid film (VERY, VERY dangerous)Using your x-ray source to take diffraction patterns from NaCl crystals. (see #11 and 2 for warnings)I really did do all of these! Mostly in the basement of my parent\u2019s house. My grandmother was nearly electrocuted when she got too close to #3. Even though I do theoretical physics, I really enjoy talking to my experimental collaborators and thinking about how to do the experiments I propose. Other ideas: Make a Raman spectrometer using a laser pointer, old CD, and Lego. Enjoy ps: DO be careful, most of these experiments can be dangerous and can kill you if you\u2019re not careful. ",

            "answer_text": "I have designed experiments with perpetual motion that show 2-directional motion from rest. A school science experiment might be considered more official than my experiments. These diagrams in particular suggest unique properties, if you read all the details. I know over-unity or perpetual motion is unpopular, but if you can actually show them visual evidence that is not explained by the laws of physics, how could they argue? If you need exact instructions for proven partial perpetual motion, you can try here: How To Build An Over-Unity Device If you succeed with the simple over-unity, it may be important to ask your audience some simple questions: Do you believe this happens? Do you believe it has motion from rest with gain and loss of altitude and no necessary net loss of altitude? Do you see that it can be stopped at the high point, and all additional motions are recoverable and occur naturally from rest?   One possible experiment is an arrangement with the ball and one of the levers in the second diagram, except you just place the ball in such a way where, due to its height, it activates the lever when it has room to move down, but once on the track it has room to move further up (possibly) in the specific arrangement. Now, if the leverage is sufficient to raise the counterweight afterwards (which should be true in 1:1 compensated-for-leverage-mass ratio and 2.4 to 3.2X leverage interval where the marble is rolling and approx 5 to 9 degree slope of lever, with only max 1 degree upward slope of track), and the counterweight can lift the lever again automatically, that may count as a similar proof of perpetual motion, since the net altitude of both elements is allowed to be constant. The day of my recent great discovery is here: The Day Perpetual Motion Was Proven for Certain Additional videos and diagrams here: Have there been any actual demonstrations of over-unity? ",
