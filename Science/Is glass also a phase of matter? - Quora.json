            "answer_text": "Glass is a solid, and solids have a lot of variations within them as to how they are arranged. Glass is an amorphous solid, a non-crystalline substance that lacks the long-range order required to be labelled a crystal. Because of this, glass exhibits a property akin to highly viscous liquids; this is the reason why glass is often called a pseudo-solid, or a supercooled liquid. Glass is not unique in this characteristic, and hence is not a phase of matter. Rubber, gels and most plastics are amorphous solids too.  Image Source. However, this is a debate as to whether amorphous solids should be considered solids in the first place; the \u201csolidity\u201d of a substance depends upon the connectivity between its atoms and unit cells. They do have a structure made of interconnected blocks[1] (called \u201cunit cells\u201d). As such, a clear distinction cannot be made here.
