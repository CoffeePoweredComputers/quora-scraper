            "answer_text": "The shortest scientific name belongs to a Southeast Asian bat, Ia io, the greater evening bat, and to the Chinese dinosaur Yi qi.    The bat was named by Oldfield Thomas, a British biologist who named far more new species of mammals than anyone else, hundreds of them. Since he had to come up with so many new names, he occasionally had some fun with them\u2014another example is the Australian rodent Zyzomys, which was undoubtedly named that so that it would be at the end of any alphabetic list. Allegedly an entomologist once wanted to name a new genus I but eventually named it something else. ",

Or that they don\u2019t run out of ideas\u2026 :P While on that subject, there\u2019s a genus of fly called \u201cPieza\u201d, with a few species, for example \u201ckake\u201d, \u201cpi\u201d and \u201crhea\u201d.
