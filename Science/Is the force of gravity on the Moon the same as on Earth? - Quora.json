            "answer_text": "Arnaud Frenchie answer is correct, though it might need some clarification. The gravitational force between two objects is always equal, but the force between one of those objects and a new object may be different. (The force between the earth and the sun is different than the force between the earth and the moon) The gravitational force between the earth and the moon is equal. It's easy to see if you remember Newtons 3rd law (every force has an equal and opposite reactive force). It's also easy to see when you use Newtons equation for gravitational force: [math]F=\\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{d^{2}}[/math] You'll notice neither objects mass is special. However, Earths gravitational acceleration differs greatly than the moon's. This is given by: [math]g=\\frac{GM}{r^{2}}[/math] Earths gravitational acceleration is about [math]9.8m/s^{2}[/math] while the moon's gravitational acceleration is about [math]1.63m/s^{2}[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "The Moon has less mass than the Earth \u2014 about 1/81 as much. However, it\u2019s also much smaller than the Earth, so when standing on the surface of the Moon, you aren\u2019t as far from its center. This partially cancels the difference in mass, so the gravity you feel is about 1/6 that you feel on the surface of the Earth, or 1.625 m/s^2. (Compared to 9.8 m/s^2 on the Earth.) ",
