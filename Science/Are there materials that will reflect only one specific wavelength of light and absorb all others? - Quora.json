            "answer_text": "You can do this by appropriate choices of compounds, but generally the band tends to be pretty wide. What is more useful is a dielectric (Bragg) mirror. This is a mirror with multiple layers of dielectric materials. The composition and thickness of the layers is chosen so that one specific wavelength gets reflected constructively. All other wavelengths pass through. It is never perfect, so there will always be a wavelength band, not a single wavelength, but with enough layers, the band can be made pretty narrow. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, sort of. Firstly, you can't actually get one specific wavelength that a material will absorb or reflect because of the uncertainty principle \u2014 it's always a range of wavelengths But yes, there are many optical filters that are designed to do just that, transmit a narrow wavelength range and absorb all others. These materials are used extensively in optical detectors such as CCDs or PMTs. ",

            "answer_text": "No. One can make a thin film that preferentially reflects one wavelength (butterflies, tropical fish and some birds are good at that!), but it will never reflect it perfectly nor absorb all the others perfectly. Moreover, integer fractions of that wavelength will also be preferentially reflected \u2014 although we usually won\u2019t be able to see them. ",
