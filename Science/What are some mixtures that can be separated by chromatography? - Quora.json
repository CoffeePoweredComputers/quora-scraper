            "answer_text": "There are several types of chromatography. In gas-liquid chromatography the main requirement is that the analyte is volatile. For this reason it is often used to separate organic molecules. High molecular weight biopolymers are not going to work. On the the other hand some molecular inorganics (say SF6) can be analyzed. You can\u2019t put a lot of material thru a GLC so you would mostly use it for analysis rather than purifying and isolating a synthetic product. HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) involves a liquid mobile phase and solid stationary phase. So the main requirement is that the analyte be soluble in the mobile phase. HPLC is suitable for purifying synthetic products as is the related SFC (supercritical fluid chromatography). There are other types of chromatography such as ion chromatography (which I have never personally used). It is used exclusively for inorganics and in an analytical rather than preparative mode. ",

            "answer_text": "This question as stated is quite broad and it is important to note that different chromatography methods separate different kinds of substances. The most general answer I can find for the question is that in chromatography, substances are separated based on how well they travel along a certain medium (the stationary phase) usually by some carrier (the mobile phase). Column Chromatography separates substances based on polarity whereas in gas chromatography separation occurs based on volatility/size of the molecule. Other methods utilize completely different chemical/physical properties (hydrodynamic volume, charge, \u2026) It further depends on whether you are interested in analytical chromatography (merely for substance identification) or preparative chromatography (to purify a crude mixture). The only widely used preparative chromatography is column chromatography so I am assuming the wanted answer to your question is: compounds of different polarity. ",
