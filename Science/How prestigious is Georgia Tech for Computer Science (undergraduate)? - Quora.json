Had a had half a mind at the time of my admission, I would have declared that major instead of Biomedical Engineering. Alas, we live and grow daily.  In companies like Google, to Apple, to Microsoft, to IBM, hundreds of Tech students excelling and making impacts after graduation and even beforehand. The co-op structure at Tech is renowned nationally. If you're considering a CS career, look into what GT has to offer.  I'm certain you will not be disappointed.  ",

            "answer_text": " Global Colleges Ranked by Subject This lists the best Computer Science programs in the world according to the Wall Street Journal and Georgia Tech is 5th! I know of many CS students who just graduated and are now going to work for Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Tesla; the list goes on and on with prestigious companies. However; each of those students had to work hard for those positions. Luckily for Georgia Tech students, Tech gives you that initial edge with its superb academics, numerous co-op and internship opportunities, and a fleet of CS alumni who would be happy to suggest or hire more Tech students. Also, Tech\u2019s median starting salary for CS majors is $85,000; about $15,000 more than the average for all CS majors. That to me illustrates prestige. Wish you the best in your decision! ",
