            "answer_text": "Mass is the inherent property of the body which can be described  from Newton's second law as the resistance to the change in state of motion when an external force is applied. Moles in other hand is an unit for measuring the amount of substance. In chemistry it is the ratio of number of molecules/ions/atoms etc present in a given mass of sample to that of the number of Carbon atom present in 12g of C12, which equals the Avogadro's number. ",
