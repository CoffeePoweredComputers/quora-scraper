            "answer_text": "The giant squid has an average mass of 275kg, while the giant pacific octopus rarely gets heavier than 50kg. The squid also has razor sharp rings around its suckers, while octopuses\u2019 suckers are \u201cnaked\u201d and just suckers. Squid are sleek fast predators, while octopuses are much slower and clumsier swimmers, though much better adapted for maneuvering in tight spaces and rough irregular terrain. So on paper it is quite mismatch. The octopus could conceivable hide from the squid on an uneven, complex seafloor with lots of nooks and crannies, and escape, but that would be about. But\u2026. The giant squid is a denizen of deep waters. The only times it has ever been observed to venture into shallow waters were when it was already sick and dying, and the low pressure environment of surface waters seems to disorient it. While the giant octopus is a shallow water reef dweller, and would be crushed into pulp at the higher pressures in the depths where giant squid normally live. There is probably no naturally existing environment on Earth where the two could meet and have this fight with both animals still capable of fighting. ",

            "answer_text": "No doubt the giant squid will win as they\u2019re known to attack or fight back against whales. Compared to giant squids, the giant Pacific octopus is relatively small. I\u2019ve dived with giant Pacific octopi and while they do appear large to human beings they are only gigantic when compared to regular octopuses. Giant squid grow to 43 feet while the largest Pacific octopus ever recorded, falls short of 30 feet. Also note that the octopus was measured tentacle tip to tentacles tip so that measured tentacle tip to the top of its head (one end to the other, the same way they measure squid) that octopus could not have been any longer than maybe 18 feet. The size difference alone would make it an unfair fight, add to this the fact that squid are much better swimmers in open water than octopi, it is self evident that a squid could easily outmaneuver an octopus in any duel. Thus, in my view, the giant squid would win such an encounter relatively easily. ",
