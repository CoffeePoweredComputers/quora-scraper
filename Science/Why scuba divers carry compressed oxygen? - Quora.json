            "answer_text": "Typically we don't. The vast majority carry compressed AIR. Only specifically trained divers will carry O2 as well as a mostly air main breathing gas.Some people dive breathing 'enriched Air' or Nitrox (specially measured mixture of NITRogen+OXygen) but that typically is A maximum of 40% oxygen.Underwater, oxygen is served to your lungs at a higher pressure so the total amount of oxygen in each lungful is elevated. Too much Oxygen can be toxic. The rule of thumb is no more than 140% or 160% of a normal pressure lungful of oxygen per lungful breathed under elevated pressures. That means compressed oxygen is not safe the breathe at deeper than about 20\u2032. For regular compressed air, that maximum depth is 212\u2032, but at 60, 120, 145 the required training lis increased further.",

            "answer_text": "SCUBA divers carry compressed air because it takes up less a lot less space than normal air (stored at 3000psi compared to about 15 for normal air). Also you need to have a supply of air at higher pressure than the surroundings else you\u2019d never be able to suck it out of the tank, and pressure increases by about 15psi every 30 feet you go down. They don\u2019t normally carry pure compressed oxygen because that would be a) expensive and b) dangerous to breathe at depth. Some special forces divers do use pure oxygen with rebreathers, so they don\u2019t leave bubbles that an enemy might notice. ",
