Space Ball one turned into a giant transformer \u201cMegaMaid\u201d and used her giant vacuum cleaner to suck all the air from Druidia once the air shield was turned off. The trees and snow were sucked right up and Jerry van Dyke put his head down on his desk and passed out. If Lonestar hadn't used his \u201cSchwartz\u201d powers to flip the switch on \u201cMegaMaid\u201d to reverse, they all would have died! Now\u2026Seriously, did you really need to waste everyone's time with such a silly question. A few hardy spores might last a while but every thing else would die. Any event cataclysmic enough to cause use to lose our atmosphere, would likely wipe out all life anyway. Please try and formulate questions that really require \u201canswers\u201d in the future. ",
