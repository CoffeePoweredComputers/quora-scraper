            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cHow do I publish an original scientific research paper without someone else getting the credit?\u201d Only the authors of a research paper get credit. If you want nobody else than you gets credit from the paper, just publish a paper alone. That is about legal and legitimate credit. But, it is impossible to prevent illegitimate and stealing the contents of your paper when it is published. There are out there charlatan thieves interested in taking the results of your work and getting credit beyond what you get from your own work. ",

            "answer_text": "To be frank, I think we need a little more detail about your circumstances to give you a clear answer. I am going to make a guess, that your are a graduate student or have just completed a PhD, and that there is a culture in your place of work that means that even if the contribution by your supervisor is minimal or even non-existent, his/her name goes on the paper with yours. In some very bad places, a boss may simply send your work off as though it is theirs. I do not know what the institutional rules are at your place of work. Where I am, and wherever I have been, there would be no formal barrier to a student/postdoc simply submitting their paper to a journal. If it is accepted, then you get the credit. In normal circumstances, it would be natural to get your supervisor to read it and comment, and perhaps give you advice as to which journal to try. If they have made a real contribution, then their name should be on the paper. If the situation is abnormal, you may not wish to do this. How this might impact on your career is impossible for me to judge. ",
