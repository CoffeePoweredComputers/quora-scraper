            "answer_text": "Perhaps it\u2019s best to answer this question in relative terms, and this article does a good job of that: \u201cA magnitude 4.0 earthquake is only equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT explosives, but because the Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, the amount of energy released increases quickly: A magnitude 5.0 earthquake is about 200 tons of TNT, magnitude 6.0 is 6,270 tons, 7.0 is 199,000 tons, 8.0 is 6,270,000 tons, and 9.0 is 99,000,000 tons of TNT. As you can imagine, 99 million tons of TNT is enough to destroy just about anything, and is the equivalent of about 25,000 nuclear bombs.\u201d Personally, it doesn\u2019t much matter to me the energy released; it\u2019s really about the destruction involved as a result which, after all, is what we\u2019re all interested in anyway. And that\u2019s where it gets interested (and scary!) because there is a HUGE difference in the destructive potential of a magnitude 6.0 and 8.0, for example. This \"How Much Bigger\u2026?\" Calculator is a \u201cfun\u201d tool to use to understand just how much more destructive larger earthquakes can be. As an example, I was around during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake which was estimated to be about a magnitude 6.9 or so (depends on how it\u2019s actually measured) which was considered a fairly destructive earthquake in the U.S. Recently, however, I have been preparing for the Cascadia megaquake since I currently live in the Pacific Northwest which has the potential for a 9.0 or larger! If you live in the PNW or know somebody who does, read my book the topic so you know what to do because it\u2019s a real eye-opener: 9.0 Cascadia Earthquake Survival (Kindle Book) | reThinkSurvival.com ",
