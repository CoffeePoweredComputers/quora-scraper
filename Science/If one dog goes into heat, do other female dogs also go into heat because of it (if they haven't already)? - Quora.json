            "answer_text": "In a pack, females usually go in heat in the same period (it doesn't mean the same day, but they follow closely). It happens sometimes also in women who live together and have a strong bond (sisters, for example). That's a natural mechanism made to protect the youngs of social animals. If two females go in heat around the same period of time, they will give birth at the same time, kind of. This means a better chance of raising the baby: even if one female dies, or doesn't have enough milk, the other can nurse the baby. If we speak specifically of dogs, then we have to start saying that dogs evolved from wolves, and they are still very similar to them, to the point that many behaviours/instincts they have are still those of a wolf. Synchronised heats are one those. In a pack of wolf, usually only one female will have pups (unless there is an abundance of preys, in which case the pack is bigger than normal and more than one couple may reproduce. Usually it's one only though). The other females going into heat may however cause an \u201chysterical\u201d pregnancy: that happens also in dogs sometimes, the female goes in heat, is not mounted, however two months later (around when she would give birth, if she had been with puppies) she will start behaving as if she did indeed have pups. She may fixate on an object (a plush toy, or any kind of toy or anything, really) and behave as if that were a puppy (protective, always carrying it around\u2026), she may make a den\u2026 and usually she will start producing milk. This is probably something that is \u201cleft over\" from when dogs were still wolves: only the alpha female will have puppies, but the other females will be able to help her, or take her place, should she die.

            "answer_text": "Yup. And then it\u2019s loads of fun at the training kennel. The boys can\u2019t concentrate because the girls are in heat. The girls can\u2019t concentrate because they are horny. And the trainers and staff are all stressed because we don\u2019t want any accidents\u2026 Though, I suppose it might be marginally better than the option of unsynced heats where there is always someone loopy\u2026 ",
