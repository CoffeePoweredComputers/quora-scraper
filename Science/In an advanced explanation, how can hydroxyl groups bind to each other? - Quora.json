            "answer_text": "Hydroxyl groups bind through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The classic example is water (See below H-bond between two water molecules, the hydrogen bond is the hatched one). Also shown are three waters interacting in 6-membered ring. Such interactions can be extended in all directions - it begins to look like the structure of diamond. Of course, these interactions are dynamic/transitory.  ",
