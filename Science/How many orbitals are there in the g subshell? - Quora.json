            "answer_text": "Your g orbitals are one azimuthal quantum number higher than the f orbitals. Remember quantum numbers.[1] Principle (n), azimuthal (l) magnetic (m), and spin quantum number (s). The allowed values for quantum numbers are: n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \u2026l = 0, \u2026, n-1s = -n, \u2026, 0, \u2026, +nThese three quantum numbers define an orbital. The orbital types, relate to the l quantum number as follows: s: l = 0p: l = 1d: l = 2f: l = 3, and finally for this caseg: l = 4Each s (or [math]m_s[/math]) quantum number defines an orbital. The values are whole number values between - 4 and +4. That gives you 9 orbitals in total. Image courtesy File:G orbital.png  Footnotes[1] Quantum number - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re getting different answers here. No known element has an occupied g shell, at least not in the ground state. (Excited states may be a different story, I don\u2019t know). However, we can make the following extrapolation: The s subshell has 1 orbital. The p subshell has 3 orbitals. The d subshell has 5 orbitals. The f subshell has 7 orbitals. So it stands to reason that the g subshell has 9 orbitals. I believe you can demonstrate this, for hydrogen-like atoms at least, since there are formulas for the possible values of n, l, m-sub-l, and s. (The last mentioned, spin, is always +1/2 or -1/2). The g subshell is defined as having l = 4, so m-sub-l can be any integer from -4 to +4: nine possibilities. ",
