            "answer_text": "Hello everyone, Every individual atom or molecule has tendency to absorb or to emit radiations of specific frequencies in excited state, this spectrum of frequencies is known as atomic spectrum. Due to specific spectrum of atoms or molecule, it can be detected easily by investigating their structure. For the purpose of determination of spectrum there are many methods are used as follows :- Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy ( AAS )Flame Emmison Spectroscopy ( FES )",

            "answer_text": "When atoms are excited they emit light of certain wavelengths which correspond to different colors. The emitted light can be observed as a series of colored lines with dark spaces in between; this series of colored lines is called a line or atomic spectra. Each element produces a unique set of spectral lines. ",
