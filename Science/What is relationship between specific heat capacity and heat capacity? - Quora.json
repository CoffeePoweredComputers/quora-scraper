By definition, the two are very similar. However, there\u2019s just an additional variable included in specific heat that makes it differ a little as compared to heat capacity. When you talk about \u201cheat capacity\u201d (having a symbol \u201cC\u201d), it is actually the heat needed for a substance\u2019s temperature to change by one degree. This, therefore, shows that it is applicable to any type of matter. \u201cHeat capacity\u201d is the ratio of heat transfer \u201cQ\u201d to change in temperature \u201c\u2206T.\u201d In formulaic expression, it is C = Q / \u2206T. In its SI unit notation, it uses units of energy / degree (energy per degree). It is expressed as the ratio of Joules (symbol \u201cJ\u201d which stands for the value for energy) to Kelvin (symbol \u201cK\u201d which stands for the value of absolute temperature) C = J / K. In chemistry, however, they make use of molar heat capacity Cmol, which just adds the mol variable in the equation Cmol = J / mol . K. On the other hand, \u201cspecific heat\u201d sounds similar to heat capacity in terms of definition, but the former refers to the needed heat to adjust the temperature of a single unit of a substance\u2019s mass by one degree. It makes use of energy / mass / degree units. C = J / kg . K. In here, the kg (kilogram) is the unit of mass included in the equation. For more information please watch the below video :  ",

By definition, the two are fundamentally the same as. In any case, there's only an extra factor remembered for explicit heat that causes it to vary a little when contrasted with heat capacity. At the point when you talk about \"heat capacity\" (having an image \"C\"), it is really the heat required for a substance's temperature to change by one degree. This, thusly, shows it is relevant to an issue. \"Heat capacity\" is the proportion of heat move \"Q\" to change in temperature \"\u2206T.\" In equation based articulation, it is C = Q/\u2206T. In its SI unit documentation, it utilizes units of vitality/degree (vitality per degree). It is communicated as the proportion of Joules (image \"J\" which represents the incentive for vitality) to Kelvin (image \"K\" which represents the estimation of total temperature) C = J/K. In science, notwithstanding, they utilize molar heat capacity Cmol, which just includes the mol variable in the condition Cmol = J/mol . K. Then again, \"explicit heat\" sounds like heat capacity regarding definition, however the previous alludes to the required heat to change the temperature of a solitary unit of a substance's mass by one degree. It utilizes vitality/mass/degree units. C = J/kg . K. In here, the kg (kilogram) is the unit of mass remembered for the condition. Regarding physical properties, \"heat capacity\" is the broad variable on the grounds that the amount of a specific issue is straightforwardly corresponding to its heat capacity. This implies the greater the issue, the greater is its subsequent heat capacity (for example 2x matter gives you 2x heat capacity). Paradoxically, \"explicit heat\" is an escalated variable, which implies a credit having a place with a particular substance and not to any issue by and large. This makes it more helpful for researchers and different experts to do tests utilizing the concentrated variable. Synopsis: 1.\"Heat capacity\" is a broad variable while \"explicit heat\" is a concentrated variable. 2.\"Specific heat\" has a unit of mass in its condition as suggested by the International Standards of estimation. 3.\"Specific heat\" is more appropriate for use in hypothetical and test capacities. 4.According to SI units, the recipe for heat capacity is C = Q/\u2206T while for explicit heat it is C = J/kg .

Specific heat is heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by 1 degree Celsius. Let's assume substance 'A' has specific heat of 1 KJ/kgK. The specific heat remains the same if I take 5kg of 'A' or 10kg, because it is defined as per Kg of that substance. On the other hand heat capacity depends on mass of the substance. If I have 5kg of that substance then heat capacity will be 5KJ/Kg, if I have 10kg then heat capacity becomes 10KJ/kg . Because more the mass, more it will take to raise the temperature by 1 degree Celsius. ",

Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance by 1 degree Celsius.Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise unit mass of substance by 1 degree Celsius.Heat capacity depends on the mass of substance. Let us assume substance 'x' is 50kg and for heat transfer it would need 50 j/k. Now, if we change the substance mass to 100 kg, then it would need heat capacity of 100 j/k. Means the more you regulate mass the more it will take heat to increase by 1 Celsius.Whereas Specific heat capacity would be constant for any amount of mass to raise the temperature by 1 celcius.Unit for Heat capacity- J/KUnit for specific Heat capacity- J/K. KgThe relation between both- Heat capacity= mass* specific heat capacity.Thank you! ",

It has units as J/kg-K or Cal/kg-K. \uf0d8 With increase of heat energy, dimensional changes may occur.
