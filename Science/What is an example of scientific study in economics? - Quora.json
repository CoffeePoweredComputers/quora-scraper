            "answer_text": "A scientific study first gathers the facts of observation, and after that applies the logic of analysis to the facts to formulate statements of causation. An example of scientific analysis in economics is this. When people go to college, because they have the economic motive of getting professional high-wage jobs (mostly found in towns), they delay the age of marriage and avoid giving births to children before marriage. This is an economic analysis so far as there is a proven economic motive behind delaying the marriage. But sociologists and psychologists can also add their validated views. It is a complex event with an economic angle, but also with non-economic dimensions.Another example of scientific analysis in economics concerns the very simple fact that as more people apply more labor on the same land, they get more food from the same land. The marginal product of labor is positive. This is science, as it is based on universal evidence.The opposite idea of carrying capacity is superstition. The number of people a given tract of land can carry is not fixed, because more labor on the same land can produce more food to carry more people. Those who think of carrying capacity ignore the fact that people not only eat the food, they also produce the food.Any statement that begins with a hypothesis is unscientific. Microeconomics fails to be science because it stands on hypothesis and not on facts. The statement that a rational producer sells his product at a price equal to marginal cost of production is not just factually false, but it is logically absurd. First, an ordinary producer sells a commercial product at a price higher than marginal cost for the very simple reason that his customer buys it at a price that is much lower than the marginal cost the customer must incur if he had to produce it. Even after giving the producer a margin of profit, the buyer is better off to get it at a price much lower than the marginal cost of production he would incur to produce it. Put simply, the fact is that the marginal cost of production incurred by the seller is not the same as the marginal cost of production incurred by the buyer, because the buyer is not identical with the seller.There is no science in not knowing the facts. Microeconomics is not science because it does not know the fact that between the final consumer and the original producer, for nearly all commercial products, there is a merchant in between them, and the merchant adds a markup over the price the producer gets from the merchant. This invalidates the idea of price being equal to marginal cost of production, because it ignores the cost of transaction, and ignores the simple evidence that there are at least two prices for the exact same product: the producer\u2019s price the producer gets from the merchant, and the consumer\u2019s price the consumer pays to the merchant.Here is a thoroughly scientific analysis in economics https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23747629_Money_in_Market_Clearing",

            "answer_text": "Scientific studies in economics are evidence-based where micro and macroeconomics are theory-based. A science in economics looks like Transition Economics - Econometric Science & Sustainable Policy Broad collapse across 70% of 200 econonies today is entirely due to shortcomings in economic theory. Scientifically, their foundational principles are not causal and therefore do not advance or collapse economies - Supply, Demand, Profit, GDP, etc. do not determine growth A Case Study 'Our Academic Mediocracy\" documents the denial of seven major grad schools to read and peer-review Transition Economics (TE) What does a science do that today's theory does not? TE manages mature capitalism(s), social contract (this IS a causal indicator), and automation. Transition Economics proves that Mankind is our Business and it reliably recovers an average $4 billion per day lost to every economy.   ",
