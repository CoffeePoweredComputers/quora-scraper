            "answer_text": "pH is defined: pH = -log [H+] Therefore in any aqueous solution , if you want to determine the pH , you have to determine the [H+] - that means molar concentration of hydrogen ions. This applies to an acid solution as well as a basic solution. Now you ask: Does a basic solution have H+ ions? Yes: Consider a 0.001M solution of NaOH Clearly , because NaOH dissociates completely , [OH-] = 0.001M What is the [H+] in this solution? The equation to use is [H+] [OH-] = 1*10^-14 [H+] = 1*10^-14 / 0.001 [H+] = 1.0*10^-11M Now apply pH formula: pH = -log [H+] pH = -log (1*10^-11) pH = 11 .0 ",

            "answer_text": "pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions. pH is inversely proportional to the hydrogen ions present in the solution. So pH always tells us the hydrogen ion concentration even in a basic solution. The pOH tells us the hydroxyl ion concentration of a solution. pH + pOH = 14 ",
