            "answer_text": "Whenever anyone makes any claim to the tune of \u201ckids these days\u201d, I am reminded of this comic.  A very popular person once said, \u201cThe children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t talking about the millennials or the Gen Z. His next lines were: \u201cChildren are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.\u201d These were, allegedly, the lines of Socrates from more than two and a half millennia ago. Then we have Sallust, from the last century before the birth of Christ. \u201cThe men of to\u2011day, on the contrary, basest of creatures, with supreme wickedness are robbing our allies of all that those heroes in the hour of victory had left them; they act as though the one and only way to rule were to wrong.\u201d In the 17th century, Robert Russel had to say, \u201c\u2026 I find by sad Experience how the Towns and Streets are filled with lewd wicked Children, and many Children as they have played about the Streets have been heard to curse and swear and call one another Nick-names, and it would grieve ones Heart to hear what bawdy and filthy Communications proceeds from the Mouths of such\u2026\u201d  The generational gap is getting wider. The rate at which everything changes around us today adds to this. A few centuries ago, there might not have been a lot of difference between the lifestyles, career choices, hobbies, and general ideologies of two consecutive generations. Things moved at a slow pace. But not anymore. When I was born, almost 3 decades back, there was no concept of a television in my village. When one of the families got one, it became a celebration. People would flock to their house for the weekly Mahabharat extravaganza. Letters were still the predominant form of long-distance communication. I remember my mother saving the ones from my dad very well into my teen years (dad was posted in a far away city, but we moved in, and stayed, with him when I was 5). I remember my first phone call sometime in the early 2000s. I got my first computer in 2006. The first smartphone I saw was in 2007, a sleek Nokia N series. Everything around us in a state of great flux - 3D movies, Augmented Reality headsets, unprecedented connectivity, access to anything anywhere anytime. Its becoming hard for even me to keep up with the rate of change.  Older generations see this and feel slighted. \u201cHow can this latest crop of humans have it so easy?\u201d \u201cWe had to wait months to get our Television. We had to walk for miles to reach school. Everything had to be done by ourselves - no machines, no home pick-up and delivery.\u201d And in all of this, they forget that the current generation has its own set of challenges. Yes, education is easily accessible now. But even a Masters degree no longer suffices to guarantee one a good job.Yes, most young, educated people no longer have physically demanding jobs. But we work far, longer hours.Yes, some of us are earning more in a day than you did in a year. But we still can\u2019t afford a place of our own.Yes, we did not see a great war or recession. Ours is the generation of scattered conflicts through the globe, chemical and biological warfare, and cyber-crime.Yes, we are no longer dying of tuberculosis, cancer, or cholera. But suicide rates and depression is far more prevalent today than ever.Every generation is critical of the one that follows because they fail to see the chasm that separates them. And as humans, we have a tendency to congregate - by nation, by religion, by gender, by generation. And believe that ours is the finest. We see things from our perspective and fail to realize that others have a different vantage point. We attribute our success to our efforts, but that of others\u2019 to luck and perchance. We view the past with rose-tinted glasses, and the future with shades of skepticism. This hasn\u2019t changed much over the course of human civilization, and is not likely to, any time soon. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to wonder why I was constantly criticized / judged by my parents, relatives and certain old people. Now I am not old but I do the same to the younger generation. I am 22 and I go to college with 18 year olds. I did feel that some of their behaviors annoyed me very much. For example you see many people are obsessed with social media these days. When I was 18 I was too afraid to operate a facebook or instagram account for many reasons - my parents might scold me or some unknown person might text me or send me a friend request, etc etc.. These are small things and I still used a fb account but my parents were scared for me and would ask me to quit very often. So I didn't post my pictures and only went for news, memes and stuff. But now when I see young people uploading so many pics I immediately recall my days and I somehow feel that all this is too much. It's because we grew up differently and I didn't have these many technological advancements when I was 18 and these people get to enjoy it. It's also partly because I am unable to accept that their life seems so different. And also since I was brought up in a different way all this seems a little different to me, like this is the way of life now. I really don't know how to put it. Another reason might be that the older generation are used to a certain lifestyle. The world is changing very fast and it has given them very less time to adapt to the changes. Before you adapt to the previous change, something new comes up and it's really hard to cope up with. My parents used to scold me a lot for using my mobile all the time. And when they got mobile phones of their own, they still didn't use it the way I did. They struggled to use a smartphone. My sister and I taught them how to use it , still they didn't understand why we were so obsessed with it. Simply because they need time to adjust, to having a smartphone first.. And after a while they installed whatsapp and started connecting with their friends and relatives.. This was the time when they started to use whatsapp very often and started to kind of getting obsessed over it. So I feel the more and more the older generation are exposed to the current changes, the more understanding they will become. They will criticise us but the frequency may reduce because they will start knowing what it feels like, living with these new things. ",
