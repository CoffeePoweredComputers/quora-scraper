            "answer_text": "\"Many Worlds\" and \"branching universes\" are picturesque ways to describe the interpretation, but those words shouldn't be taken more seriously than they deserve. Quantum mechanical states can be expressed as combinations of other states. For example, the state of the world with a photon polarized at 45 degrees from horizontal can be expressed as a combination of two components, one corresponding to a horizontally polarized photon and another corresponding to a vertically polarized one. Apparatus can be used that would give one result to an observer for a horizontal photon and another for a vertical one. In that case what's called \"the many worlds interpretation\" says that using the same apparatus with a 45 degree polarized photon results in the overall state of the world remaining a combination of two components, one in which the world, including the observer, is as it must be if the photon was horizontal and another in which the world is as it must be if the photon was vertical. Observers who formerly couldn't place themselves in a particular component may add to their knowledge through observation, but there's really just one world with multiple components. ",
