About Hypothesis Hypothesis is formulated to test the Diffrence between the means of the VARIABLES or compare 2 or more groups BEHAVIOUR w r t Dependent VARIABLES 1 May be association or relation ship between X and y VARIABLES 2 May be DIFFERENCEbetween observed and expected frequencies or responses 3 whether the POPULATION and sample differs 4 whether statistical measures correlation coefficients or test measures are significant or not at significance levels /confidence intervals P value. At .05. .01 levels 5 whether data sets differ with population 6 test homogeneity of the group's NPC Hypothesis is formulated mostly in statement form as per suitability Statement or question E.g. Boys and Girls differ in examination grades in mathematics Question Do boys and girls differ in grades in mathematics? Types Null Hypothesis( Ho) No difference exists BETWEEN Boys and Girls grades in mathematics ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS Boys and Girl differ in Grades. In mathematics Hypothesis is tested using relevant tests para metric and non parametric t test F test(ANOVA) ANOVA ANCOVA MANOVA CORRELATION REGRESSION analysis chi sqare tests 5steps in HYPOTHESIS testing Actions 1 state Null and ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS 2select level of significance 0.1(1%) 2.05 ( 5%) 3.10 (10%) 3 Identify the test STATISTICS t test F test and Chi sqare test Find critical values 4 formulate decision 5 Arrive at Decision 1 Descision is possible in HYPOTHESIS testing 2 DO not reject Null Hypothesis If rejected Accept ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS FORMULATED (The five steps are discussed ABOVE) Refer Research Gate Advanced statistics Gupta Search By Gupta Statistics .com ",

            "answer_text": "First. determine what the hypothesis will predict will happen in a new situation. Then design an experiment (if possible) to the test the predicitions. Be sure the experimental design is a free of technical error and human bias as much as possible. Use controls. Reproduce the experiment several times by yourself and if possible by others. If the prediction of hypothesis are correct. The hypothesis can be called a scientific theory (although other scientists will like to see may more predictions proven correct.) If the predictions are not correct, one needs to go back and review the original hypothesis for modification or replacement and repeat the tests. There are certain predictions that cannot be tested with experiments (at least not yet). However, hypothesis can make predictions about future observations of phenomena (like the location of a planet at a certain time in the Soler System). Then the test of the hypotheses will involve careful observation of the location of the planet in the sky. The statistical procedures described by Mr. Srinivasan V are very helpful when the data from the experiment is not robust. When I did biochemical experiments, the data was usually very clear. The experiment worked or it did not work, Repeated trials gave very similar results. Only standard deviations and error bars for data on graphs were needed. I used more elaborate statistics in only a few cases. There is a tendency to over use statistics. It can be a waste of time. But always discuss whether to use statistics with your experiments with your teacher, mentor, or supervisor. ",
