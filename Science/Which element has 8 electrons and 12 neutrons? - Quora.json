            "answer_text": "Would positively charged magnesium be correct? Electrons can move from atom to atom through forces such as friction, hence static electricity. Magnesium has 12 protons, 12 neutrons and 12 electrons when neutrally charged. This would mean that when positively charged it lose some electrons, hence the 8 electrons. This is my first time answering on quora, so let me know if it was helpful in any way if possible. ",
