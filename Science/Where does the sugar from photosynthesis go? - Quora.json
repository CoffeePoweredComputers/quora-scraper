            "answer_text": "The short answer is: it goes everywhere. The longer answer: the 3-phosphoglycerate (a 3-carbon sugar) produced by photosynthesis is interconverted into several other small molecules for use in amino acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis. The excess is stored by synthesizing glucose (a 6-carbon sugar) that is then chained together to make starch. Plants rely primarily on their starch as their source of energy during the night. ",

            "answer_text": "plants convert co2 and water into glucose by photosynthesis. The rate of production of glucose is more than its rate of consumption. So, excess glucose is stored in some plants(such as potato) in the form of starch in the roots. Other plants(such as cane sugar) store it in the form of sugar. Some even store them as oils! Note: sugar(c11h22o11) and glucose(c6h12o6) are different. Glucose is produced after photosynthesis, but it is stored as sugar. ",
