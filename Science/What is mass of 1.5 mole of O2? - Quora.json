            "answer_text": "The solution to this sort of question is to understand the units of molecular weight and think. The molecular weight of the oxygen atom is 16 g/mol, however the oxygen molecule  is 32 g/mol. Mass is measured in grams (g) and you are interested in this in relation to numbers of moles (mol). Since you want 1.5 moles worth, just multiply the molecular mass. The moles will cancel out, leaving your answer in grams. The arithmetic to do this is fairly straightforward. Exercising this on a number of problems should enable you to do this during tests and examinations. ",
