Giant squid 'attacks French boat' As far as legendary attacks involving cephalopods dragging down boats, there are many. There is the Kraken in Norse Culture. There is the Lusca in Caribbean culture. And also the tentacled aliens in Arrival in modern American culture. (Throwing ink at scientists would be classified as assault, especially if someone did it to me and also, unfortunately, if I did it to a colleague). It must be remembered that Cephalopods are predators. You\u2019d need to be very huge if you intended to eat a large Cephalopod (whale sized, for instance). As predators Cephalopods are naturally aggressive. For example Humboldt Squids, which live in the Eastern Pacific(California to Chile), have been known to attack fishermen when they are hunting. All species of octopus are venomous. Blue ringed octopuses around 25 grams in weight can inject enough venom to kill 10 adult humans by paralysing their diaphragm causing them to suffocate to death. What\u2019s 25 grams? A fistful of rice? ",
