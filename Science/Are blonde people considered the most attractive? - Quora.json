So assuming that information is correct, at least in the USA being a blond female has a strong correlation to being in demand.  (I will not say attractive since I personally find women of all hair colors attractive) ",

Actors and models aren\u2019t a faithful representation of a country's population as they are often chosen because they are more attractive than normal. And always remember that less than 4% of the world's population is blonde (16% if we also include dark blondes), so often attractive blondes aren't really blond. ",
