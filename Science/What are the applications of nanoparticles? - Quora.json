The list below introduces several of the uses under development. Nanoparticle Applications in Medicine The use of polymeric micelle nanoparticles to deliver drugs to tumors. The use of polymer coated iron oxide nanoparticles to break up clusters of bacteria, possibly allowing more effective treatment of chronic bacterial infections. The surface change of protein filled nanoparticles has been shown to affect the ability of the nanoparticle to stimulate immune responses. Researchers are thinking that these nanoparticles may be used in inhalable vaccines. cerium oxide nanoparticles act as an antioxidant to remove oxygen free radicals that are present in a patient's bloodstream following a traumatic injury. The nanoparticles absorb the oxygen free radicals and then release the oxygen in a less dangerous state, freeing up the nanoparticle to absorb more free radicals. Researhers are developing ways to use carbon nanoparticles called nanodiamonds in medical applications. For example nanodiamonds with protein molecules attached can be used to increase bone growth around dental or joint implants. Researchers are testing the use of chemotherapy drugs attached to nanodiamonds to treat brain tumors. Other researchers are testing the use of chemotherapy drugs attached to nanodiamonds to treat leukemia. Magnetic nanoparticles are useful to cure cancer using method know as magnetic hyperthermia.  Nanoparticle Applications in Manufacturing and Materials  Ceramic silicon carbide nanoparticles dispersed in magnesium produce a strong, lightweight material. A synthetic skin, that may be used in prosthetics, has been demonstrated with both self healing capability and the ability to sense pressure. The material is a composite of nickel nanoparticles and a polymer. If the material is held together after a cut it seals together in about 30 minutes giving it a self healing ability. Also the electrical resistance of the material changes with pressure, giving it a sense ability like touch. Silicate nanoparticles can be used to provide a barrier to gasses (for example oxygen), or moisture in a plastic film used for packaging. This could slow down the process of spoiling or drying out in food. Zinc oxide nanoparticles can be dispersed in industrial coatings to protect wood, plastic, and textiles from exposure to UV rays. Silicon dioxide crystalline nanoparticles can be used to fill gaps between carbon fibers, thereby strengthening tennis racquets. Silver nanoparticles in fabric are used to kill bacteria, making clothing odor-resistant. Nanoparticle Applications and the Environment Researchers are using photocatalytic copper tungsten oxide nanoparticles to break down oil into biodegradable compounds. The nanoparticles are in a grid that provides high surface area for the reaction, is activated by sunlight and can work in water, making them useful for cleaning up oil spills. Researchers are using gold nanoparticles embedded in a porous manganese oxide as a room temperature catalyst to breakdown volatile organic pollutants in air. Iron nanoparticles are being used to clean up carbon tetrachloride pollution in ground water. Iron oxide nanoparticles are being used to clean arsenic from water wells. Nanoparticle Applications in Energy and Electronics Researchers have used nanoparticles called nanotetrapods studded with nanoparticles of carbon to develop low cost electrodes for fuel cells. This electrode may be able to replace the expensive platinum needed for fuel cell catalysts. Combining gold nanoparticles with organic molecules creates a transistor known as a NOMFET (Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field-Effect Transistor). This transistor is unusual in that it can function  in a way similar to synapses in the nervous system. ",
