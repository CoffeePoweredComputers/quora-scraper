            "answer_text": "I would say this depends of your definition of \u201chibernate.\u201d Early man likely spent 20\u201323.5 hours a day in his home, cave, or den during the coldest parts of the winter. Imagine how cold it was not having layers of clothing especially designed for warmth. Think how cold your feet would get without thick layers of soft socks and commercial footwear. You don\u2019t even have to go back to prehistoric man, even in the 1800\u2019s, many families would bundle up and sleep 14\u201316 hours a day, or at least severely limit their activity, because it was dark and in many parts of the world, uncomfortably cold. A common day might well have included just a few hours of activity during the warmest part of the day. I\u2019m sure they not only slept and rested a lot because it was cold, but also to conserve energy, as think how difficult it was to hunt and gather during the coldest period of the trip around the sun. Do not forget, while they had ways of preserving food, they did not have anything resembling our current methods, and we have tons of food spoil and go to waste. I\u2019m sure it was early man\u2019s goal to stockpile food and extra weight in the warmer weather, but due to illness, bad weather, lack of game, and so on, it was probably a goal rarely met. ",

            "answer_text": "This is highly unlikely, because there are no primates that hibernate. And our species originated in warm climates. When our ancestors migrated to colder regions, they underwent some genetic changes, the most notable one being pale skin to allow for more UV absorption abd adequate vitamin D synthesis, and very likely by the time they (and the Neanderthals as well) reached the Northern latitudes, they already were efficient tool users and skilled hunters and they made clothes. They would have had no reason to undergo a massive evolutionary change in so many systems, to evolve the capability to hibernate from scratch. Let alone lose it afterwards.   ",
