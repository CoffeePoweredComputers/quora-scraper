            "answer_text": "Well, I think this is one of those things where if you ask a million people, you'll get a million different answers. It can range anywhere from having an actual brain with significant activity to having a brain that can process certain types of information and think beyond mere instinct to self-awareness to the ability to handle calculus. Some people have used what they call the \"mirror test\" to see how self-aware an animal is and guage their intelligence from this. Essentially, they test to see if an animal can recognize itself in a mirror. They put a mark of some kind on the animal and if the animal looks in the mirror and tries to wipe off the mark, they decide the animal has passed the test. But still, what if the animal actually does recognize itself but just doesn't care that it's got this mark on its body? What then? But to generalize, I think a safe answer is to say if we naturally consider a creature to be intelligent without bothering to concern ourselves with hard criteria, that's probably good enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the meaning of intelligent life is to be found in its purpose? So, what is the purpose of intelligent life? Is intelligence an advantage in the struggle for survival? As Arthur C. Clarke said, \u2018It has yet to be proven whether intelligence has any survival value.\u2019 In the long-term we\u2019ll see but in the short term intelligence does seem to confer advantages on those who have it; or just to humans who have conquered the Earth and become the dominant species on it. Intelligence and curiosity seem to go together. We want to know the why and wherefore of the universe, who we are, where we\u2019re going, what\u2019s it all for? So, perhaps intelligent life is this search for answers and meaning? Paradoxically, the meaning of life is revealed to those who have, at least for a while, suspended their intellectual quest. For example, in zen, conceptual thinking must be halted. ",
