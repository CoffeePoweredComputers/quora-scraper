            "answer_text": "Normal oxygen levels while you're awake range between 95-100%. However, your levels do naturally drop while you're sleeping. Normal oxygen saturation levels while sleeping usually fall between 90-100%, and if levels fall below 88% during sleep, you may need supplemental oxygen for sleeping. You can get the Bipap/Cpap Machine for Sale or Rent from pluspin for Oxygen Levels increasing if you have problem in Breathing.  What is a good oxygen level during sleep? An oxygen saturation level over 95 percent is considered normal. Anything below 92 percent oxygen in your blood may be a sign that you have breathing problems during sleep, which could mean you have sleep apnea or another disorder like severe snoring, COPD or asthma.

            "answer_text": "Oxygen levels generally stay at or above 90% saturation while sleeping. Normally, oxygen levels are higher in young people while the lower limit for normal oxygen levels declines very slowly with age. I would therefore expect a 20 year old to have an oxygen level greater than 95% saturation but will commonly see healthy senior citizens with oxygen levels of 90 to 94% saturation while awake. Persons with underlying lung disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological conditions and sleep disordered breathing (obstructive sleep apnea) may have oxygen levels that drop below 90% saturation while sleeping.

            "answer_text": "Everyone's oxygen levels in the blood are lower during sleep, due to a mildly reduced level of breathing. Also, some alveoli drop out of use during sleep. If your waking oxygen saturation is greater than about 94 percent on room air, it is unlikely that your saturation during sleep will fall below 88 percent. ",

If your normal oxygen saturation is above 94% while you are awake, your oxygen level is unlikely to fall below 88% while you sleep, but if your doctor is concerned, they may order an overnight pulse oximetry test to be sure.
