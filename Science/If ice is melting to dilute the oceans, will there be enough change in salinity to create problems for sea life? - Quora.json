            "answer_text": "The world ocean averages over 3,600 meters in depth. If all the current ice on the Earth melted sea levels are estimated to rise by some 70 meters. That is an increasing depth of 1.94% in the water column that makes up any random average place in the ocean not close to a land mass or subsea mountain. Call it a 2% change for easy math and you get a 2% less salty seawater as a result. The thing is average saltiness of the sea water today is much more variable than that. Sea surface water in the Eastern Mediterranean is very salty indeed compared to most other places while the deep water in the Black Sea is about half as salty as the world average. Most fish would never even notice such a small change in the salt level in sea water. In this image you can see the differences in average sea surface salinity, how much salt is in the water, and the differences are much more than the 2% change that will happen when Earth goes back into the hothouse climate pattern with no ice.

            "answer_text": "No. As a matter of fact the oceans are salty because of all the fresh water rivers etc that continue to carry ice melt and rain water run off to the oceans and seas. Along with this fresh water is minute amounts of salts . These salts are forever left in the oceans and seas . The water is evaporated and will repeat the cycle but the salts will only get more and more concentrated through the evaporation of sea water and the added minute salt particles brougt to the sea by the rivers of the world.
