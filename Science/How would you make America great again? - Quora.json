            "answer_text": "First we have t restore the basics: Congressmen & Senators must be made to understand that they are not sent to Washington \u201cto fight about which party is better\u201d, \u201cto resist the sitting administration\u201d, nor \u201cto find ways to make themselves wealthy\u201d. They are Representatives of the people, and sent to Washington to \u201cwork every day to make life in the United States the most safe, secure, beneficial, satisfying, and productive life for it\u2019s citizens possible. That means helping us cut through the \u201cRed Tape,\u201d Help us navigate the hierarchy, provide new laws and regulations when they are most helpful, and keep an eye on the obsolete laws and rescind them when they no longer fulfill the best interest of the majority of citizens. Congressmen & Senators MUST maintain a meaningful working relationship with their constituents, and ensure that their needs and interests are transmitted to the capital, because THAT is the job they were elected to do - and are paid to perform.Money should be handled more like it is by each of us at home: We pay our bills first, we identify the \u201cnice to haves\u201d second, and if we can\u2019t afford it, we either don\u2019t buy it, we save up for it, or we establish a reasonable payment plan to obtain it. We don\u2019t spent double our paycheck every week or extend the credit limit on our credit cards every week to buy more crap. We are limited by the amount of income we have, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t all drive Ferraris, and take vacations in Figi every Winter. When we have to control our money from payday to payday to be sure that we have enough to get through. It takes planning, discipline, and sacrifice. The government should be no different. They should not have a bottomless checkbook with which to spend money that our grandchildren haven\u2019t even earned yet.People should salute ONE flag in the US, the \u201cRed, White, & Blue.\u201d Every emphasis should be on \u201cI the American.\u201d While it is all well and good to be proud of one\u2019s previous home ( heritage ) once here, in the \u201cMelting Pot\u201d we are from many places, many cultures, many religions, of many colors, and creeds, but HERE we are \u201cAmericans!\u201d That\u2019s why we are here. Stop the Racist BullSuat! ) Stop caring who is from where, what they sound like, look like, or do differently. They are here by choice, they are \u201cAmericans\u201d now. Those who truly prefer their previous life, refuse to assimilate, and demand we change to be like their home country should leave. Join us or Leave us, we will not tolerate you coming here to fight us, steal from us, or to stir up hate. \u201cAmerica wants to welcome you, but you must be willing to enter as a friend, and leave your \u201cRace\u201d behind. No exceptions.The government should immediately get OUT of out restrooms, bedrooms, sexual preferences, and other private ( personal ) decisions. They have no business passing laws to allow boys in girls restrooms, forcing a businessman to bake a cake which he doesn\u2019t want to bake, nor making it legal for a 13 year old girl to get an abortion without her parents consent. ( to name a few ) The country has plenty of problems that can be dealt with by the Federal government, they do not need to micro-manage our lives to this meddlesome degree. Return the empowerment of discipline, responsibility, and authority to the adults and parents of this country to run their own families and businesses as they see fit.Kill Obamacare. Forcing people to have insurance that they cannot afford is wrong. Even more so when the cost climbs by huge percentages every year, and the alternative is government invoked \u201cFines\u201d and/or jail time. Removing the mandate will open private competition and bring costs back down to an easier to afford level. Mandating coverage allows the insurance companies to hold fast and require you to pay whatever they ask\u2026or pay a Fine. They\u2019ve got you, and they know it.Lower the salaries of Congressmen and Senators by 25% There is no reason why we should be paying 535 people $175000 a year, particularly for the little they have done for us recently. Pulling 25% would still allow each congressman & Senator to make a Salary of $131,250 a year, and that should be plenty. ( The savings would be $23,406,250 a year or in a four year term: 93.625 million dollars ) They could put that back into Social Security\u2026The IRS Needs \u201cOversight. Like the Mueller investigation on steroids, the IRS has Absolute Authority to do whatever they want, to whomever they want, they can devastate an individual take his home, business, bank accounts, leave him homeless over an audit. They will fight in court until the victim gives up. If proven wrong, there is no provision for them to even apologize. No reparation. When Lois Lerner targeted the Tea Baggers ( under Obama ) she was found guilty. As punishment, she was transferred to another department, kept her pension.. and laughed.These days, parenting skills are severely lacking. Anybody can have a baby, and the baby will grow in spite of the mother and father\u2019s interest, ability, presence, and interaction. Years ago mothers were at home and fathers worked. That arrangement allowed for a stable home life and a well-rounded childhood development for children. Then too, kids attended Sunday school which provided an education in moral, ethical, humanity, and Christian values. Sunday was often a day that provided social interaction with friends and family or neighbors and community. All of those things are missing today. Sunday is just another day to sleep in, return to greatness, we\u2019ve got to go back to purposefully instilling meaningful moral and ethical values into our children. Parents need to require respect, manners, etiquette, courtesy, and decency again.We\u2019ve got to stop rewarding mediocre, substandard, and bad behavior. We have to prepare American kids to compete in a Global world. Make them \u201cHungry\u201d for competition, shun complacency, and strive to do better, to succeed. Do away with the \u201cAttendance Trophey\u201d reward excellence again.More tomorrow. It took years to get this messed up, it\u2019s going to take time to explain how to correct it all\u2026 Good night.",

            "answer_text": "We can honestly start by removing money from politics and the idea that corporations are people. You will find at the root of every problem we have in America is based on some corporation or rich guy paying off our public officials. This causes them to represent the telecoms, healthcare insurance companies, foreign governments influencing in our elections, NRA/Interest groups, taxes/tax cuts for rich and corporation only, etc.. Pretty much every problem today that is not being solved becasue the political officials are representing \u201cwe the corporation and rich guys\u201d. It is also why the politicians when getting elected say one thing and do something else when they get into office. It has been what happens for decades and it needs to truly stop if we want to actually solve any of these problems because the status quo likes it and does want it to change since they reap the benefits of socializing the losses and privatizing the gains. In other words during the 2008 crash the banks kept all the previous made profits, but forced the tax payers to pay to fix the mess. Even now the protections to prevent 2008 were removed under Trump and the ones put in place by Obama were not good to begin with since they both represented their donors rather than the American people. So we need to stop this legalized bribery and then sort out the real problems and come up with real solutions preventing the very organizations causing the problems to not have their voice. After all a corporation is a business, NOT a person and they should not get a vote in our government based on how big their financial wallet is. Then we can solve healthcare, predatory lending, living wage, welfare, food stamps, prevent corporate welfare, reduction in military spending, etc because Congress will be representing you, \u201cthe people\u201d.
