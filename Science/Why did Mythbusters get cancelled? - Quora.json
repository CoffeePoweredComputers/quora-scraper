            "answer_text": "Question: Why did Mythbusters get cancelled? Because Jamie Hyneman got tired of the series and of working with co-host Adam Savage. The two men were never friends, and both have made it publicly known that they are very unlikely to work together again in any professional capacity. They apparently had different temperaments and they seem to have been unable to move past their personal differences during the run of the series. Even if they had been able to co-exist, the series was \u201crunning out gas\u201d anyway. The \u201csecond team\u201d on the series (apparently created and enhanced to give the series\u2019 leads more off time) were let go in the 12th season and Hyneman and Savage appeared alone for the final two seasons. Additionally, the ratings were beginning to sag and that is always a reason for cancellations. Reference: 'Mythbusters' to end with final season: Adam and Jamie react ",
