            "answer_text": "I have been to Trump rallies, know a lot of Trump supporters, none of the answers get to the core reason why they are passionate about Trump and it is not about MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, that is just a slogan. Here are the realities: It starts with this: They are Anti Anti Anti Abortion, Anti Family planning, Anti any govt support for anything that would limit or stop conception and/or end a pregnancy. This is an inviolate principle for the vast majority of evangelicals who are the strongest Trump supporters. If Trump went back to \u2018pro choice\u2019 perhaps 40 million of his supporters would drop him in a nano second.Unlike what the media says or portrays quite often, By and large Trumpo supporters are very good people and very solid citizens paying their taxes and going about their business. And they want to keep it that way, a white Christian country and that is what Trump tells him he will deliver every single day, 10 times a day. They are not as HRC said \u2018deplorables\u2019.They truly believe reinforced by incessant pounding of the right wing media, The Democrats are not like them and they have to have someone to blame for their loss of jobs; the Democrats; Democrats Do not have the same values.They truly believe they are backed up against the wall, threatened on all sides with Losing what they have worked their entire lives for; Especially for older white people as they are;FEARFUL FOR THE FUTURE AND ARE DESPERATE TO HOLD ON TO WHAT THEY HAVE GOT.They DO NOT WANT TO RETURN TO THE PAST, THEY WANT TO HOLD ON TO THE PRESENT.They are STRONG CHRISTIANS WHO HAVE BEEN PROPAGANDIZED TO THINK THEY ARE UNDER THREAT. They have no idea how much the constitution protects them and also others, they just feel they have a lot to lose and have been led to believe;A CHRISTIAN THEOCRACY IS THEIR RIGHT AND IN THE CONSTITUTION, the entire one nation under god;They have bought into the 2nd Amendment NRA propaganda that Dems will take their guns so they wont stand up to anyone and say it is ok because;The 2nd Amendment means they can \u2018stand their ground\u2019 and shoot who they want too and defend themselves.They do not care about foreign relations, they are in general isolationist which is Trump all the way.They dont really care if China is threatening the US or Russia or anyone else, they feel the US military is strong enough to protect the country so the allies can just go on their own.They do not trust people of color and are desperate to remain either a white dominated or at least white controlled country and they totally get it that;Trump/McConnell are doing this via court appointees which for many is the only reason they vote Republican to protect their white privilege.There are lots of reasons that Trump supporters support Trump and will not switch or change. It has NOTHING TO DO WITH MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, it is all about holding on to what they have and that is why 95% of all Trump supporters are white as they are not going to give up anything. ",

            "answer_text": "America has always been great. If we judge our history in common with contemporaries of any era in any part of the world, since our inception we have been the beacon of hope, freedom and liberty. To judge any historical incident, policy, institution or action in light of 21st century standards is ludicrous. Further, for subjects like slavery - the institution would have to have been ended globally, been isolated to the United States, have affected only black people and instituted only by white people for today\u2019s bull shit to even apply. NOT ONE OF THESE THINGS IS TRUE. The decline of our nation started with the abrupt end to the Kennedy administration, but has accelerated exponentially since GHW took office. Those four people (Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama) sold us off to not EVEN the highest bidder. Our jobs, our industries, our wealth, our sovereignty, our futures. And on a smaller scale, state level politicians and some city level are doing the same d***ed thing. It isn\u2019t America that is not great, it is the people we put into office because we have been taught to believe their lies. Were it not for Trump, and you will have to actually go LOOK for the information from first hand sources because media will not share, we would pretty much have been destroyed by now. To ME, his accomplishments are well known and its sometimes hard to remember that there are many who are completely unaware of them. People have been lied to blatantly, and that is a shame. Its easy to read any bill, any executive order, any declassified documents (located on the websites of the agency that declassified them, FBI, DOJ, etc). There are also lists all over (almost exclusively at conservative sources, though) that are several pages long. The lack of popular media coverage is why Trump and those close are always talking about them - in the hope that people will do some research to see for themselves!! ",
