            "answer_text": "Trends in periodic table:  This table shows the periodic table trends of six different physical properties of the elements: atomic radius, electron affinity, electronegativity, ionization energy, and metallic/nonmetallic character. Force of Attraction Definition: How much the outer electrons (-) are attracted to the nucleus (+)Increases going up periodic table because there is one fewer energy level of electrons that will separate the outer electrons from the nucleusIncreases going right across periodic table because the nucleus gains protons and the atom has the same number of energy levels as you move across a period2. Shielding Effect Definition: How much the outer electrons are repelled by inner electrons (negative repels negative), and also describes how much control the nucleus has on outer electronsIncreases going down periodic table because there is an extra energy level of electrons that will shield the outer electrons from the nucleusIncreases slightly going left on periodic table because the nucleus loses protons and the atom has the same number of energy levels as you move across a period3. Atomic Radius Atomic Radii Trends on the Periodic Table  Definition: A measure of a neutral atom\u2019s size based on the radius of its volume as a sphere Increases going down because there are more energy levels of electrons and therefore more shieldingIncreases going left because as you move across a period right-to-left, an atom loses a positively charged proton and therefore its electrons become slightly less tight and compact4. Ionic Radius Definition: Same as atomic radius, but for the size of a charged ion, not a neutral atomIncreases for anions (-) because they gain an electron, which leads to more shieldingDecreases for cations (+) because they lose an electron, which means less shielding5. First Ionization Energy Definition: The amount of energyneeded to remove an outer electronfrom an atom and make it into an ionIncreases going right because there are more protons in the nucleuspulling in electrons, so it requires more energy to remove an outer electronIncreases going up because there are fewer energy levels and less shielding, so the outer electrons are more tightly held by the nucleus6. Metallic Character/Metallic Reactivity Definition: The tendency of an atom to lose an electron (a key characteristic of metals is they lose electrons to become cations)Increases going left because metals are on the left side of the periodic table and they have fewer protons in their nucleus that are holding in the atom\u2019s electronsIncreases going down because there is more shielding, so outer electrons are easier to lose7. Non-Metal Reactivity/Electron Affinity Definition: The tendency of an atom to gain an electron (a key characteristic of non-metals is they gain electrons to become anions)Increases going right because non-metals are on the right side of the periodic table and they have more protons in their nucleus that attract outer electronsIncreases going up because there are less electron energy levels and therefore a greater attraction to the nucleus for electrons***Fluorine has greatest non-metal reactivity because noble gases are not included due to the fact that they have a full shell of valence electrons and cannot gain more or react8. Electronegativity Definition: The tendency of an atom to attract a shared electron in a chemical bondIncreases going right because there are more protons in the nucleus attracting outer electronsIncreases going up because there are fewer energy levels of electrons shielding/repelling new outer electrons***Fluorine has greatest electronegativity because noble gases are not included due to the fact that they have a full shell of valence electrons and cannot attract moreCertain properties\u2014notably effective nuclear charge, atomic radius, IE, and EA\u2014can be qualitatively understood by the positions of the elements on the periodic table.",
