            "answer_text": "There are multiple different ways to define a \u201cspecies\u201d, and traditionally the one that involves interbreeding is used only for living species, because it is rather difficult to determine whether or not two creatures you know only from fossil bones could or could not actually interbreed. Thus for extinct fossil species the traditional method for determining species involves using anatomical differences and comparisons. By that measure, over time and with much debate, the Neanderthals were eventually regarded by a majority of scientists to be a distinct separate species to modern humans. Because modern humans are still around and Neanderthals died out recently enough that we were able to recover some DNA from their fossils, they are one of the very few exceptions where we actually can gather evidence on whether or not an extinct fossil population could or could not interbreed. However, the current evidence points to a handful of DISTINCT periods of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals. Nearly all of that 1\u20133% of Neanderthal DNA that modern humans outside of Africa have can be dated to have entered our gene pool during a handful of distinct, discrete time periods. In between those episodes of genetic exchange there appear to have been long periods of tens of thousands of years where modern human populations and Neanderthal populations lived side by side, sharing the same environment (sometimes occupying in alternate succession the exact same valleys and caves), and yet with no evidence of any successful interbreeding going on between them. From the period of the last demonstrated bit of gene exchange to the Neanderthal\u2019s final extinction, there appears to be a period of a couple ten thousand years where there was no evidence for any genetic exchange, despite ample evidence of contact, and even some cultural exchange, where the two populations were adopting each other\u2019s distinct tool-making technologies. This evidence suggests that there were in fact barriers to gene flow between Neanderthals and modern humans. If there were no barriers to gene flow, as would be expected if the two populations were the same species, we should see evidence of CONTINUOUS genetic exchange, with Neanderthal genetic markers entering the modern human population steadily and continuously over the entire time the two populations had contact. Since so far the evidence we have does not show that kind of pattern. Instead the pattern seems to fit with one of continuous and gradual divergence, with the genetic compatibility between modern humans and Neanderthals getting less and less over time, until finally, for a fairly significant period of time before the Neanderthal\u2019s final extinction, almost all, if not absolutely all, genetic exchange ceased. The moment when the last bit of genetic exchange stopped could be said to be the moment when the modern human and Neanderthal lineages finally completed the speciation process, and since the Neanderthals seemed to have endured for several ten thousand years after that point, it can be argued that this means they legitimately should be considered a separate species from modern humans. One can also argue from the same evidence that one should instead classify modern humans and Neanderthals as subspecies rather than species. This is a debate that is still ongoing in the scientific community, and future genetic evidence will likely weigh in on it. The thing is, every species classification system we use ultimately only works for classifying the creatures that exist during a SINGLE slice of time. When we try to look at populations over longer periods of time, during which the populations and the genetic exchanges between them are continually shifting, all our classification systems break down and stop working. Consider, for example, that when looked at in the entire fullness of evolutionary time, you, and every living thing on the planet today, must have a line of continuous free flowing genetic exchange back through your many ancestors all the way to LUCA, the last universal common ancestor of all life on earth (and likely even back before that). And there never would have been any point in that chain, where your ancestor of one generation would not have been interfertile with another member of its own species from the previous (or next) generation. And that would mean that applying the interfertility species definition would mean that the whole population of your ancestors, from bipedal hominid you to single celled LUCA, must all be the same single species. The species definition simply does not work for populations spread over long periods of time. In the end species classifications are arbitrary, and used for convenience. In reality all life on earth is one gigantic continuum of continuous genetic exchange over all of earth\u2019s evolutionary history. But we humans evolved in such a way that we need labels for things in order to communicate ideas. We simply would not be able to do science if we were forced to accept that in reality all life on earth is one population with just one name. And so we divided the phenomenon of life on earth into discrete categories and gave these categories different names, just as we gave different names to each of the colours of the rainbow, even though that too in reality is a continuous spectrum. What we ultimately call Neanderthals doesn\u2019t really matter that much. (In the same way, whether we collectively agree to call Pluto a \u201cplanet\u201d or not is also, in the final analysis, sublimely irrelevant) ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s so much to talk about here, I guess I\u2019ll have to just bullet-point it. Where did you get the idea that Neanderthal Man and Homo sapiens are different species? I mean: who have you been talking to? Not that they\u2019re necessarily wrong\u2014I'm trying to say it's subjective: it all depends on the family tree you use. According to one model, Neanderthal Man is a subspecies (that is, a race) of Homo sapiens, and is called Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, that is, Homo sapiens from the Neandertal (which is the name of a valley in Germany), along side our own subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens. Admittedly, describing Neanderthal Man this way is not as common as the other way, as a separate species, Homo neanderthalensis, but it\u2019s got its supporters. Everything is moot in hominid taxonomy. Lumpers want to lump everything together into fewer species and genera. Splitters want to split them up into more species and genera. It\u2019s an ongoing controversy which has been raging for nearly two centuries, ever since the first specimens of Neanderthal Man were discovered.Historically speaking, the idea that Neanderthal Man is a separate species seems to have won out in the late 19th and early 20th century because the opposing view, that Neanderthal Man is a variant or close relative of our own modern Human Race, was associated with anti-evolution naturalists (that is, the holdouts, the hard-liners who opposed Darwinian evolution). Pro-evolution naturalists, on the other hand, wanted to portray Neanderthal Man as another species in order to emphasize the mutability of species. Since the latter group was generally correct on other things, they seem to have gotten their way on this issue, too.It\u2019s important to point out that two populations\u2019 being able to interbreed is not sufficient to say they\u2019re the same species. That\u2019s Ernst Mayr\u2019s definition of biological species, and it\u2019s a useful rule of thumb, but it\u2019s not the only definition of species out there (if it were, how would we classify asexually reproducing lifeforms into species?). Ernst Mayr\u2019s biological species concept is particularly difficult to apply to extinct organisms. This just goes to show that the division of the tree of life into species is necessarily arbitrary and messy, and attempts to come up with more objective definitions of species create only the illusion of precision. Bottom line: separate species are separate because some (probably long-dead) naturalist judged they were sufficiently different that it was useful to give them distinct names in the Linnean system, and he may or may not have had any theoretical justification for where he drew the line.How do you know that Neanderthal Man and Archaic Humans could regularly interbreed? All we have evidence of, so far, is gene introgression. That\u2019s not the same thing. Sheep and goats can, in principle, interbreed, and such hybrids have been reported throughout history, but it\u2019s very much the exception. Sheep and goats don\u2019t regularly interbreed. It\u2019s not practical to determine, in a finite amount of time, whether any two species can or cannot interbreed ever. All we can tell is whether they, for whatever reason, usually do or don\u2019t, and we extrapolate from there. Of course, this method is fallable\u2014it\u2019s the old problem of empirical induction\u2014and, as a result, biologists are constantly discovering different species that can, in fact, hybridize, or have hybridized in the past, under rare conditions. Sometimes we witness the interbreeding, and sometimes we only find evidence of it by sequencing the genomes of wild animals\u2014we find that they have genes they shouldn\u2019t. It's interesting but not particularly anomalous to discover that one \u2018species\u2019 contains genes introgressed from another, distantly related \u2018species.\u2019To know whether our own subspecies and the Neanderthal subspecies could regularly interbreed, we\u2019d have to know how often they tried to, and what sort of selective pressures there was on the resulting offspring. Perhaps members of our line and the Neanderthal line shtupped weekly, in grand, sticky, bonobo-style orgies, and a hybrid only resulted once every hundred years or so (which would indicate a very high failure rate), but those hybrids had enormous reproductive success due to immunological adaptations, hybrid vigor, or something. It\u2019s possible. If that\u2019s the case, them gene introgression could happen even with a very low rates of successfully hybridization. All we know for sure is that genes passed from the Neanderthal line to our line a handful of times over about 100,000 years.Maybe the Neanderthal line and our line couldn\u2019t hybridize directly at all. It\u2019s possible for genes to flow between two species that can\u2019t regularly interbreed with each other via other species that act as mediators. For instance, there may be three species, A, B, & C, such that A can produce viable offspring with B, and B can produce viable offspring with C, so genes can flow back and forth between them, but A can\u2019t produce viable offspring with C. We call those three (or more) species \u2018ring species.\u2019 We don\u2019t have any evidence of the existence of this intermediate species, but there\u2019s actually a lot we don\u2019t know about or own evolutionary history. Nobody expected to find the so-called Hobbits of Flores, for instance. It\u2019s important to occasionally step back and consider the limits of our knowledge.For what it's worth, Ann Gibbons has argued from the lack of Neanderthal Y chromosomes and our understanding of the differences between human and Neanderthal body chemistry, that male hybrids were not viable. That is, all offspring of such unions were female. That sort of sexual differential (if it is real and not a statistical artifact) represents a pretty strong reproductive barrier; it\u2019s unusual and significant if Neanderthal Man and our own Human Race were as closely related as most mammals who are classified into the same species are.Don\u2019t forget about the narcissism of small differences. It\u2019s a general rule in taxonomy that the more distantly related to us humans a lifeform is, the coarser the classification system is, and, conversely, the more closely relayed a lifeform is, the more precise and finnickly the classification is. We emphasize details that are most salient to us in our everyday lives. Thus, mammals are exhaustively classified (wolves and coyotes separate species? Black bears and polar bears separate species?), while insects, for instance, are very crudely and broadly lumped together.",
