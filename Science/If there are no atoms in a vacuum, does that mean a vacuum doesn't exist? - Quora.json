            "answer_text": "If you take a volume and remove all the matter out of it, you have a vacuum in that volume. There are no atoms, as you have removed all of them. This leaves us with a volume of spacetime only\u2026\u2026 the fabric of space. This will be a mix of fields, which average zero energy, and a higgs that is not zero. It seems that it still boils with activity where particles and their anti particles blink into existence and destroy each other and blink back out again\u2026. so a seething mass of temporary particles and their anti particle pairs. So the vacuum actually exists, and is full of activity, none of which we can see, but we can measure it\u2019s existence\u2026..( yes we have measured the pressure exerted by these denizens of the vacuum of space) In fact the Shanghai Superintense Ultrafast Laser Facility (SULF) is currently building towards a 100 petawatt laser to experiment in releasing the matter into the universe from a vacuum. Currently in the 10 pwatt range they seem able to tear electrons and their positron counterparts from out of the perfect vacuum into reality\u2026. ie make matter out of nothingness using only light. You must think of matter as condensed energy, and it takes a whole heap of energy to create matter\u2026.. but it is doable\u2026. opposite to a nuclear explosion where we do the opposite, turn matter into energy\u2026. so we expect the reverse to be just as energetic ( in reverse) ",

            "answer_text": "A vacuum is an empty closed space. So space empty of atoms could be at least an imperfect vacuum. Even if all atoms are removed from a space there still could be energy, free electrons or photons in the space. In this case it would be an imperfect vacuum. Space itself is virtually empty and an imperfect vacuum. There is no absolute or perfect vacuum in physics and does not likely exist. Even absolute nothingness would not be a vacuum since it would not be closed empty space. Nothingness would be unbounded and would not be considered a space. There would be no energy, charges, forces, fields, dimensions nor time within nothingness. It would simply be a great void. ",
