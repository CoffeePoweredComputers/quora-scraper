Look, America is in decline and Republicans and the 1% have strived to make that happen. Covid to them is an opportunity to make us a 3rd world country. The citizens of America are all okay with that, many hate everything America stands for and support Trump. The rest are apathetic or hate Biden because he can perform progressive miracles. The middle aren\u2019t enough to keep the country going as an American ideal. We aren\u2019t good at much of anything anymore other than having the biggest military budget in the whole world. People just don\u2019t really care no matter what they do for a few weeks. In the long run, they just exist. I just see us going down down down and the 1% will own us in the Oligarchy that we become. Moscow Mitch will be very happy. ",

Further, because Trump did not contain this early, we now are seeing organizational structures failing: small businesses are going bankrupt, people not progressing in their professional experience, and volunteer organizations withering. This will ensure that China becomes the world\u2019s dominant economy. Oh and if we continue like we are, at least 2 million people in the US will be dead from covid-19. ",
