            "answer_text": "Rate = k[A]^n. If n=1 (first order reaction - in other words rate is proportional to concentration) and you solve for k, you would get a constant with units of time^-1. For a 1st order reaction tripling the concentration would triple the rate. By the way: a zero order reaction would have units of L x mol^-1 x s^-1 (AKA 1/(M\u00d7s); in which case the concentration would not effect the rate. ",
