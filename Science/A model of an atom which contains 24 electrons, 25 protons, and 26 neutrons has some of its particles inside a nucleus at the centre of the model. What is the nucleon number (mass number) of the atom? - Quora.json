            "answer_text": "If there are not as many electrons as protons, then it is an ION, or ionized atom. When you just say \u201catom\u201d that is referring to the neutral atom. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus and it defines which chemical element it is. The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons. The atomic mass is the mass of one mole of the atoms in isotopic proportion as they normally exist on Earth. The different possible isotopes have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons. The protons an neutrons are always inside the nucleus. The electrons exist as wave/particle dualities in orbitals around the nucleus. ",
