            "answer_text": "NO!!! You can\u2019t just add those up and then call it a day! That\u2019s like saying \u201cPerson A needs 3 hours to work, while person B needs 4 hours. That means when they work together, they\u2019ll need 7 hours!\u201d Furthermore, a percentage for a composition can\u2019t be over 100%. Yes, the atmosphere contains roughly 21% oxygen. That means that roughly 1/5th of it is composed of oxygen, while the other 4/5 are other gases. If you pump 100% oxygen in the room, that means the air that you pumped contains almost nothing but oxygen. Now, just think. What will happen to the amount of oxygen? It will increase, right? What will happen to the other gases? They will stay the same, right? Yes, the amount of oxygen will increase, but there\u2019s still other gases (primarily nitrogen), so it will NEVER reach 100% unless you literally take out ALL molecules of the other gases, which isn\u2019t easy. Now, the percentage in the end depends on the volume of the room and the volume of the 100% oxygen that you pumped. If we know both of them, we\u2019ll be able to calculate the percentage that you should expect. ",

            "answer_text": "The other respondents are right. You cannot get more than 100% oxygen in the room, no matter how long you pump it in for. But there is a special case where the answer to your question is yes. Assume your room was completely airtight, and you started off with air, at 21% oxygen and 1 atmosphere pressure. Then you pump in an exactly equal volume of 100% oxygen, without letting any leak away. The total pressure in the room is now 2 atmospheres. The percentage of oxygen has increased to 60.5% by volume. But the partial pressure of oxygen has increased to 121kPa. The reason this matters is that partial pressure, not percentage by volume, is the main factor governing the behaviour of gases in chemical reactions\u2014and in physiology. So the gas mixture in your sealed chamber would behave exactly as if it contained 121% oxygen, even though such a thing is \u201cimpossible\u201d. Taking time to consider questions like this can actually shed light on some really cool and interesting scientific principles. Partial pressure - Wikipedia. ",
