            "answer_text": "That is an awesome question - with a slight problem.The problem is that most people believe that in science - terms are clearly and precisely defined. That is generally true except in evolutionary biology. The word \"species\" does NOT have a commonly agree to meaning.Biology Book 1, page 230, Judith Kinnear, Marjory Martin, Jacaranda Press states:\u201cSpecies can be defined in different ways including:\uf0a7\tClassic definition \u2013 the use of structural similarities\uf0a7\tBiological definition \u2013 the ability to interbreed\uf0a7\tModern definition \u2013 the use of DNA\u201d Note that the 3 definitions are totally different. I have scoured the evolution resources for the evidences supporting macro evolution. They are:Evidence 1: Extrapolation of micro evolutionEvidence 2: Homology = Comparative AnatomyEvidence 3: Fossils and Geologic columnEvidence 4: DNA / Genetics / Junk DNAEvidence 5: Anti-bacterial resistanceEvidence 6: Comparative embryology (Ernst Haeckel deception) Evidence 7: Vestigial organsEvidence 8: BiogeographyEvidence 9: Bad design in livng organismEvidence 10: Phylogenetics = Cladistics ~ Family Tree After careful examination; I can state with confidence that these evidences are significantly inadequate to support the wild assertion that macro evolution is a scientific \"fact\"They do not come even close to demonstrating that from a simple beginning (eg a bacterium) the prevailing world came into existence due unguided natural forces.The evolution literature is full of bold, wild and brash claims but when you scrutinize the details you realise is it total BS. Malcom MuggeridgePascal Lectures, Ontario Canada, University of Waterloo said:\"I, myself, am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially\ufeff to the extent to which it's been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books of the future. Posterity will marvel  that so flimsy and dubious a hypothesis  could be accepted with the credulity that it has.\" ",

            "answer_text": "There is no evidence. The final arbiter of all theories, conjecture and hypotheses, is the fossil record. Despite claims to the contrary, a careful and objective, (this is crucial!), study of the Paleantological timeline shows zero examples of what they call macro-evolution. In particular, the Cambrian Period shows most life arose suddenly, simultaneously and with every creature fully formed, completely functional and identifiable. Completely opposite kinds of living things, warm and cold blooded, invertebrates anc vertebrates of every kind. Insects, animals, mammals and so on. Not one coming from a previous life form, nor changing from one to another during its tenure. No time for gradual evolution over billions and millions of years. No fossil ever found was of any stage of one life form gradually forming new features unrelated to the organism. If such could and did occur, the record would comprise fossils at every stage. Evolutionists ignore all this. It is illogical in the extreme to believe a single -, (by the way unkown, unfound and mysterious), celled organism, presumed to be some form of primitive bacteria, could gradually develop into anything but what it is. Stop fantasizing and consider all the functions of a living creature. Where, from a multi-celled organism even, could respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, skeletal, brain - systems, each dependent on the other to function - along with limbs come from? Anyone arguing this is easy to believe, is totally ignorant of biology. Even a cursory study of the living cell says gradual evolution is ridiculous. Anyone believing Abiogenesis is possible is a science denier who doesn\u2019t know what it is. The big problem here, is not science or the fossil record, these are clear. It is religion. People can\u2019t separate religion from the issue. The stupid assertions of religions and young earth creationists that also deny science has meant that people refuse to consider the only alternative. So evolutionists will continue to deny science and \u201cexcuse\u201d the fossil record, blindly clinging to falsehood because they can\u2019t stomach the alternative. ",
