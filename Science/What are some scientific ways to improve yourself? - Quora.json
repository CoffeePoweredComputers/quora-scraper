            "answer_text": "I think that this question really could use a little more clarification, It truly depends on what type of person you wish to become, what you hold valuable in your life, and what do you feel like you want to change about your life. \"Improve\" is where I find trouble in the question, find happiness, have better health or be more successful in relationships might be better. Meditation, Exercise, Balenced Diet, regular relationships on different levels, all have been shown to have increased physical health and generally a more positive mental health. I would be interested to know if anyone has seen a study on prayer and religion on mental health. ",
