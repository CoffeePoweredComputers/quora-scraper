            "answer_text": "As you have asked about phase change a isobaric or not so we can go through two alternatives as below-Case 1- suppose we are boiling a liquid then in this case we can observe that after a certain time the liquid starts evaporating means the liquid is changing its state i.e. from liquid to vapour state. Here you can observe that liquid is changing its phase in a condition where temperature is changing but the surrounding pressure i.e. atmospheric is constant.Case 2 - lets this time take a container with a piston covering its surface. Now we make the temperature fixed constant at certain value. Then lets make the piston move by compressing it. Slowly a while later finally we will observe the gases molecule came closer and condensed in the form of liquid i.e. the gas is changing its phase from gas to liquid. Here in this case temperature is const but pressure varies.  So in case 1 we observe a isobaric process and case 2  a isothermal process but in both cases change in phase is taking place. So i think now you have got some idea about whether to call phase change an isothermal or isobaric. ",

            "answer_text": "As long as nothing restricts the volume changes that occur during phase change, then the process will be isobaric (constant pressure).  But if the process occurs in a fixed volume, for example, then the pressure will change.  In fact the heat of phase change is slightly different depending on whether the process take place at constant pressure or constant volume.   ",
