            "answer_text": "The other answers are essentially correct when it comes to mixing a vivid (full saturation) blue - it cannot be mixed from non-blue pigments. However, it is possible to mix a rather lovely subdued (greyish) blue with dioxazine purple and thalo green (although it would be a quite dark colour so a little bit of mixing white would be needed to let you see that it was blue). It is actually a version of one of the tertiary colours and was traditionally known as \u2018olive\u2019. Note: \u2018Olive\u2019 in this case is obviously not the olive green that we know today - also note that traditionally the tertiary colours were made by mixing two secondary colours - today it is more common for the colours between a secondary and a primary on the standard colour wheel to be called tertiaries - I would prefer to call these \u2018intermediate colours\u2019. For completeness: Pigment primaries = red, blue, yellow Pigment secondaries = Purple, orange, green Pigment tertiaries = olive, russet, citrine red + blue = purple red + yellow = orange Yellow + blue = green Purple + green = olive Purple + orange = russet Orange + green = citrine Sorry - but for absolute completeness - it is more accurate to treat magenta, cyan and yellow as primaries - when used with black and white this palette can be used to mix a broader gamut of colours than red, blue and yellow (but this is a bit pedantic - for most purposes red, blue and yellow are fine) ",

            "answer_text": "The real answer is nothing. Blue is a primary color, which means that you can't make it. The three primary colors: red, yellow, blue are colors that can't be created by mixing colors. Obviously, adding white to blue will lighten it, and adding black would darken it. But it is best to use the commercially produced various shades of blue that are available in an artist supply shop, etc. Creating a darker shade of blue can be achieved by simply mixing your current blue with black color. Learning to mix your colors will greatly expand the options you will have at your fingertips for any project. There are several colors you can add to blue to darken the shade. Carefully adding one of these colors to your current shade of blue will give you the control to create the perfect dark blue for your project. ",
