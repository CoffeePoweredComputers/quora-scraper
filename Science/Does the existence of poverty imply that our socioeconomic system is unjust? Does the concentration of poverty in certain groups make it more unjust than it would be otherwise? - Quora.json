            "answer_text": "The existence of poverty in not an issue or just or unjust. People in poverty are that arbitrary percent of the people whose income and ability to sustain themselves is the the lower group of the population. It is in the interests of the federal welfare establishment to always identify that lower level of people as those in poverty. It is not an actual measurement of some specific minimum level below which self-sustainability is not possible. It is simply that group that fall below a certain arbitrary level. You might argue that it is unjust to refer to people at that level as being in poverty. I think it is demeaning, insensitive and probably painful, hurtful and damaging to them to so labeled. The injustice is in singling them out and constantly reminding them that they are some how lesser people, of less value, and devoid of the respect all people deserve. We as a nation can do everything possible to raise those folks out of poverty, but that is a fools errand because the government will simply raise the bar such that there is always around 15% of the population \u201cin poverty\u201d. What would the politicians and bureaucrats do if suddenly there was no one \u201cin poverty\u201d? What would they be able to wage a war against? What great tragedy is there that can replace the altruistic and humane and sympathetic emotions that comes from waging war on poverty? If we simply recognize that some part of the population is always going to earn less than the rest and then concentrate all of our energies and funds on teaching, training, mentoring, apprenticing, and hiring these people they would soon be able to earn more and begin to find a place in that massive middle class that we once had. Of course the politicians and pundits would then concentrate their attention on the lower middle class just so they have some group to concentrate their war on. ",

Addictions, gambling, lack of Education, out-of-wedlock children, children before you're even an adult yourself, and lack of Education. This is self-induced poverty and has nothing to do with socioeconomic poverty. Put down the Marxist handbook and educate oneself is the answer to climb out of poverty. There is one other thing you must develop a work ethic. Do everything you can to the best of your ability. Every job that you do, do it well do every detail of the job don't cut corners. This is the best advice anybody can give you in life. I'm a small business owner but I worked for people before I started a business. I did a great job on everything I did and it got noticed and I made more money. Just like I noticed when people do a good job for me. Do the little things. These are the wonders of capitalism. It's called a meritocracy. The best candidate gets the job. I see and everyone else sees, the people who don't want to work but still want to collect a paycheck. This is a huge problem. So the moral of the story boys and girls, if you don't educate yourself and you don't have a work ethic you restrict yourself to poverty. This is your fault not society. ",

The important thing is that a government provide opportunity to people with both educationally, and job training, and unemployment. This is what capitalism accomplishes. This is why a large number of the wealthy In the United States started out as poor or people of low average wealth but over a lifetime of 30 to 40 years working in investing in such things as a business, real estate, or the stock market became wealthy.

Where true poverty, extreme poverty, still exists, you will find none of the above systems in place. Even so, we have gone from the 99+% of the population in extreme poverty to now only 8%. It was double that just a few years ago and doubled again about 35 years ago. While the pandemic is going to put a crimp in things, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s less than 20 years or so to see its virtual end.

            "answer_text": "So far, the question of poverty is about how many resources are available to the people at the lower levels, and how many people are at the lower levels. A system that reduces the number of people at the lower levels (by enriching them, not murdering them) and provides a better minimum for them than other systems is better than a system that provides a lower minimum or puts more people at the bottom. Our system (assuming you mean capitalism) appears unjust, since some have much less than others (even in Norway) and the poverty is not equally distributed across the groups we are looking at. (Our current categories are not all the same as the categories we had 30 years ago.) But evidence suggests other systems may do worse since they have weaker systems for maximum production and efficient distribution. Given the devastation of screwing this stuff up, I\u2019d say we should be careful. A little tweaking, for which we can find test cases, is safer than a radical change that makes everyone equally poor. ",

You see, exceptional people will almost always succeed. And those less exceptional, those unable to try and those that choose not to try will often not succeed. If all wealth in the US was redistributed equally among all citizens, the same people that have wealth today would have it again within a few years. And most of the same people that are poor today would be poor again. The better answer is to help assure two things. We need to ensure that those unable to succeed due to illness, impairment or other conditions beyond their control are taken care of. And next, we help ensure people have more equitable opportunities. And we do this by promoting two-parent families, providing more educational opportunities and putting our greatest efforts into promoting the growth of good jobs. ",

Mitigating general poverty (say in a society which has 10 percent poor people belonging to all social groups) is relatively easier than addressing it when it is concentrated in certain groups. The adversarial relationships between groups may matter then. The features of these groups may matter then. Ideally there should be a strong overall social commitment, a willing government, and capable leadership and intra-group mobilization within these groups to address their poverty. ",

Like: What is the most effective way to provide clothing to as many people as possible? Poverty would include not being able to wear clean clothing every day, right? But why is the social system giving people money then? From the little money they can only buy cheap and shortly lasting clothing. Why not use that part of the money to provide jobs that provide the poor with the most effective clothing? Durable and flexible basic stuff that people could design as they please, if they need design? Of course it is not done, because it would hurt the market for those who profit from selling garbage to people and selling their rags to other people as clothing as well. The socioeconomic system is still not a system of support, but a system of suppression. Expensive, but ultimately run ineffectively to ensure maximum profits. ",

Clearly some people produce more desirable products than others and it is only just that they receive appropriate compensation.

Possible, but the group itself would have to be determined as equal to all others. For example, the educational level of a group may not be equal to another group. In a case like that, it is not unjust to be unequal. ",
