            "answer_text": "I am going to start to answer that question by first giving some background. I think this is an important question. A quick answer wouid be that empty suave is not empty. That there is small amount of energy in empty space. But since there is a lot of space, that small amount of energy is more than half if all that exists. Sometimes it is called Vacuum Energy. And Einstein\u2019s Cosmological Constant was another approach to solving this problem. Einstein used an average amount from a typical region of space but it turns out the amount of Vacuum Energy can vary and vary by huge amounts from 10 to the negative 3 joules per cubic meter of so-called empty space to 10 to the 19th power joules per cubic meter at the center of a Black Hole. And the amount of Vacuum Energy can change over time in the same region of space. So the Cosmological Constant ( the figure used to represent the amount of energy in empty space) is not a constant. So that is a problem. Asking the question in a slightly different way, we can ask: \u201cWhat is outside the physical universe?\u201d A question that has been asked fir a few thousand years. So that is the short answer. I was just answering another question about Epigenetics and I was thinking some other topics related to your question. Here is the longer answer to your question: Does Epigenetics play a large or small role in brain development? I\u2019m going to give an answer that is a bit unusual. One of the writers on Quora works for CRISPR which is a company that does gene sequencing. The guy is brilliant and he does this stuff for a living. And he self-published a book. He starts out talking about Epigenetics and he goes into great detail. But he never explains exactly how it works. He says we don\u2019t know exactly how it works. He said it has quite a bit of influence but of course it\u2019s difficult to say how much. It just seems like there is a lot that DNA does not explain. But it is difficult to quantify how much we don\u2019t know. Then in the book he starts talking about other topics besides Epigenetcs - about philosophy and the general human condition - and he has absolutely no idea what he is talking about. It was as if he was just copying and pasting some almost random things he got off the internet. And what he got from the internet was not any kind of scientific research. It was just a hodgepodge of different things. Some from philosophy and some new age religion stuff and some of his own opinions. None of it made much sense. So he works for CRISPR and they take a more or less trial and error approach. They develop new medicines based on knowledge of genetics. But there is a lot they don\u2019t understand. And I think you will find this same kind of drop off of knowledge in a lot of areas. I was reading that Einstein had been able to unify gravity and electromagnetism but other scientists didn\u2019t believe him. They said things like: \u201cEinstein refuses to abandon his old methods\u2019. But the real problem is that there are flaws in the Standard Model which works very well but which is based on a Materialistic model of the universe. Einstein talked about De Sitter Space which is 7 sets of nested dimensions plus one Large Extra Dimension which encompasses all the other sets of dimensions and is infinite in many ways - which is very similar to the Christian model of the universe with the physical universe, heaven with multiple different levels and then God and the spiritual realm. So there have been many attempts to fill in this chasm of this dropoff of knowledge. Dark Matter, Dark Energy, String Theory are all attempts to fill in these mysteries. Catholic priests used to just say \u2018It\u2019s a mystery\u2019 and I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve progressed much beyond just saying \u2018It\u2019s a mystery\u201d. It would seem that there is a lot outside the physical universe. There is God and the spiritual realm. And there is a lot in between the physical and the spiritual. Let\u2019s say there are 8 sets of dimensions each with its own set of rules. We know the physical universe is complicated. It would seem that each of these other 8 sets of dimensions is complicated too, each with its own governing laws. It would seem that Epigenetics is another area where we begin to bump up against these other sets of dimensions and the mysteries of life and the universe.. The problem is we cannot study these other sets of dimensions in a scientific way . The energy just seems to jump around at random. Einstein had famously said: \u201cGod does not play dice.\u201d If you look at the movement of Quarks, they look like popcorn popping, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any detectable pattern. I would say it is because the source of the energy is partly and mostly outside the physical universe and involves multiple other sets of dimensions , each with differing rules, one expert on Gluons used the analogy of two people on roller skates, each carrying a basketball. There is also an observer and when the observer blinks, the two people on roller skates exchange basketballs. But there is a bit of a tussle and all we can see is the new position of the roller skates. Protons become neutrons billions of times a second. Their movement diesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because its source is outside the physical universe and in multiple sets of other dimensions each with its own set of rules. A comment on scale: We began to run into these great gulfs of knowledge when we are dealing with what is very small in the physical universe. But some of the other dimensions do not have the same rules in terms of large and small and linear time. There are many things we do not know about the brain, about Quantum Physycs, about Epigenetics. Often we can find practical work-a-rounds sometimes by averaging the wavelike aspects of fundamental particles. But that does not mean we have a deep or complete understanding of what us going on. It continues to be a mystery. Thomas Edison, the great inventor, said we know one millionth of what is knowable. If we figureout a few pieces of the puzzle, that is progress but in some ways it barely makes a dent in what is unknown. We will always be living in the presence of mysteries. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing means the non-existence of anything. That is not any thing but a negation of anything. Nothing is not any kind of actual thing but a concept or place holder for the concept of that which is opposotie of something. Since there cannot be a negation of things, therefore that is how the universe and everything in it has always existed, as something existing. That can be also shown other ways. Energy cannot be destroyed. Once it exists, or more correctly, since it exists, it always existed, or eternally. That also entails no beginning point for that existence otherwise, there would have been nothing before that point and then be considered as something similar to the big bang. An original time of its existence cannot be defined since that original time would again go back to a big bang or something like that. So the universe has to just exist, at all times. Since it has to exist then, there is no start. A start would be a point where before there was some thing. So existence is therefore a circular self sustaining aspect of everything that does exist. There is no way to get out of that circle that affirms existence. Therefore existence is eternal and applies to everything that does exist, including everything in the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cNothing\u201d can be defined in various different ways, depending on the context. As a predicate, \u201cnothing\u201d is the absence of relevant meaning. \u201cNothing\u201d is also widely used as pronoun subject. It then means the absence of some particular thing that one might expect to be present. In computing, to order processor to do nothing a \u201cno-operation\u201d order has to be issued. A control abstraction - a processor executing \u201cno operation\u201d infact behaves identically to a processor not following any directive. (Although one is computing and the other is not.) If nothing happened, was it really \"nothing\" that happened? Or was it rather something not happening. The term that is more unequivocally defined is Nothingness. It is general state of nonexistence, void of any thing. No thing can exist within nothingness. Existence is the ability to interact with physical or mental reality. General state of non-existence means no interactions. Although nothing and something seems to exclude eachother they can infact coincide. When you say \u201ci am doing nothing\u201d then you are really doing something. In there something can be included into nothing, the only requirement there is that nothing equates to not changing the outcomeI hope i was able to be some help rather than no help.
