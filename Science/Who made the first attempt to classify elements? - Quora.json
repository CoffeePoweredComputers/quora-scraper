            "answer_text": "Well, early chemistry delves back into the mystic arts and the trials and tribulations of people who had the desire to find a substance that could be transmuted into gold. Yes, alchemy paved the way for the interactions and bondings that were known with everyday practical substances. So since alchemy as a pseudoscience goes back to bronze making the first charts of the early elements known are that old, if they exist in written format at all anymore. However we can use relatively recent scripts and books to get a better idea of what they knew, what sort of science is passed down from ancient knowledge and when newer knowledge came forth to fill in the gaps. So from the last will of Basil Valentine we can derive an idea of a 17th century knowledge of Alchemy  C1670 - Basillus Valentinus Note in this what was not all together yet - each substance was not simplified to an element level, there were multiple symbols for each ingredient depending on where in the world you were based, and it read more like an extended shopping list than a list of elements yet. There was no unity or standards yet. But this is early days for Chemistry and Science. Here is a result from the great Antoine Lavoisier who laid out one of the first tables of chemical elements in table format combining both metals and nonmetallic elements in the one list. Its over 100 years later - this is now 1789  We are starting to group things according to their characteristics so the grouping systems and a greater understanding of chemistry (which Antoine is right in the middle of) is happening in the 18th century. So what did we know before we had a comprehensive list? Let's go to an early table by the great Dmitri Mendeleev who formulated the idea of a Periodic Law and using that was able to predict elements that hadn't even been discovered yet! This example is a 1904 compilation of what was known. In 1860 when he started there were only 53 known elements with one new element being discovered roughly every year.  This is starting to look VERY modern and for the Chemist it provides a standard for documentation and an atomic weight for the element. But to the modern observer it is still missing bits due to rough classification of the elements. This table also includes six elements that were predictions that hadn't been discovered yet. Things like Eka-aluminium (gallium)Eka-boron (scandium)Eka-silicon (germanium)Eka-manganese (technetium)There is also a grouping of the noble gases to the LEFT as opposed to the RIGHT as you would now find them. The pieces come together gradually and the knowledge map improves. This wasn't the only way of representative diagrams but the Periodic Table graduated to a standard due to its utility value and easy reference. Later editions threw elements around until the grouping systems finally made a degree of sense with the final addition and classification of the Transuranium elements c1945 rounding off the chart ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a shame that Mendeleiev gets all the credit for the periodic table.The sorting out started in the first decade of the ninteenth century, when Prout suggested that all the elements were mass multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom, and that certain properties recur at increasing mass increments. He was astonishingly close to being correct in this, but his hypothesis was widely rebuked. The detractors said it might be better to classify elements by the first letter in their name.Cooler heads realized Prout had something there, and they discovered new elements that fell into line, according to their atomic mass, in periodic mass increments. The work was continued by Dobereiner, Berzelius, Kremers, Cooke,Dumas, De Chancourtois\u2019, Newlands, Mendeleev, and then Lothar Meyer.The ultimate sorting out was realized in the early twentieth century by Mosley\u2019s discovery that the properties of the elements were a periodic function of their atomic number, not their atomic mass. Mosley could determine the number of protons in the nucleus of an element ( the atomic number ) with his method of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Using this method, and the atomic number criteria, the identity of elements could be established with certainty. The periodic table was then reordered, \u201csorted\u201d to the way we see it now, making it easy to see where \u201cunknown\u201d elements lay to be discovered. When they actually were discovered, their atomic number placed them in the appropriate slot. It was only at that time that we realized that uranium ( discovered in the late eighteenth century ) was the heaviest naturally occurring element. This sorting also clarified many unresolved problems with the properties and identities of some elements. 231 Views ",
