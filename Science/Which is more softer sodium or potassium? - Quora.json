            "answer_text": "Note that both metals readily demonstrate metallic properties, i.e. malleability\u2026the ability to be rolled out into a sheet\u2026and in fact you can roll out these metals as you would pastry (in fact better than pastry because the metallic films tend not to break)\u2026and ductility, the ability to be drawn out into a wire. And some labs have a sodium press, i.e. a LARGE thread leading to a die with a small whole at the end. You screw down the thread, and from the other end a thin wire of sodium emerges\u2026 Anyway, in answer to your question (finally!), potassium is SOFTER than sodium.. ",
