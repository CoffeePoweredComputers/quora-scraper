            "answer_text": "If you break blood down, there isn't really much in it that's good for you. Iron is there to make it red, and there's water and a little bit of protein. However, human blood is put together in such a way that the body isn't meant to digest. Otherwise you'd be able to ingest your own blood without worry or care. However, if you drink too much blood (a pint is the most that the human body should be able to ingest) you get violently sick. That blood is thrown up in a rather disgusting display so that it's ejected from your body where it won't make you ill or damage your stomach lining. If you don't drink enough blood to make you throw up though, it isn't likely to nourish you. True you can absorb the iron in blood, and you could use the water, but if you drink more than a little blood then you're likely to get too much of a good thing and it can upset the balance of nutrients in your system. Generally the blood is expelled through your stool (which can be alarming if you're not expecting it), your urine and your pores. Your body wants to get rid of it so that you can take in proper nutrients from food. ",
