            "answer_text": "Selective heating zones will be most efficient - keep the house cooler and only normalize the heat in occupied rooms - but that might not be possible with central heating.  Cost of fuel is dependent on the energy source - oil, gas, wood, electric are each priced differently.  Efficiency of your heater and home insulation matters most; modern high efficiency oil/gas furnaces or wood stoves can save fuel; electric furnaces are 100% efficient but electric heating might cost more.  A poorly insulated house with drafty windows and doors will waste energy.  A South facing house with large insulated windows can increase solar gain.  If you just want to save some money without investing on renovation or upgrades, then simply turn down the thermostat and wear a bit more clothing, and optionally have a small electric heater in occupied rooms.  These are some of the considerations. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question, while extensive, is lacking the details that would be necessary for anyone to give you an accurate and definitive answer. One of the biggest variables would be the region you live in. Are you in an area with primarily mild winters or do you live somewhere that the temperatures fluctuate greatly and will experience below freezing temperatures throughout the winter months. Some heating systems are more effective than others in extreme temperatures. Another important factor is the type of fuel that you use to heat your home; oil, natural gas, propane or electric. Each fuel source comes with its own cost. No matter what heating system you choose, you want to find one that will efficiently heat your home. The question then becomes How do you measure efficiency for a heating system? Higher efficiency systems will save you money on your energy bills but come with a higher price tag. A heating system with a rating of 90 -95% can save you approximately 8% on fuel costs and a rating of over 96% has the potential to save 13%. Another option might be a heat pump. There are several types so you want to look at The Most Efficient Heat Pump. A heat pump\u2019s efficiency is judged by its Seasonal Energy Efficient Ratio (SEER), Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF), Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) and Coefficient of Performance (COP) ratings.
