            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is an organic compound is any member of a large class of gaseous, liquid, or solid chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon. There is a lack of an \"official\" definition of an organic compound. Some textbooks define an organic compound as one that contains one or more C-H bonds. Others include C-C bonds in the definition. Others state that if a molecule contains carbon\u2015it is organic. A compound does not need to contain C-H bonds to be considered organic (e.g., urea), but most organic compounds do. The word organic is historical, dating to the 1st century. For many centuries, Western alchemists believed in vitalism. This is the theory that certain compounds could be synthesized only from their classical elements\u2014earth, water, air, and fire\u2014by the action of a \"life-force\" (vis vitalis) that only organisms possessed. Vitalism taught that these \"organic\" compounds were fundamentally different from the \"inorganic\" compounds that could be obtained from the elements by chemical manipulation. Even though vitalism has been disproven, scientific nomenclature retains the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds. The modern meaning of organic compound is any compound that contains a significant amount of carbon\u2014even though many of the organic compounds known today have no connection to any substance found in living organisms. The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS, Chemical Abstracts Service Home Page) database is the most comprehensive repository for data on organic compounds. Using the CAS number one can look up Toxicological and Physical traits on ECHA (Homepage - ECHA) ",
