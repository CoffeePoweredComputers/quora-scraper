As they made clear during their conventions, Republicans consider the pandemic to have ended and want everything to get back to the way it was before that (who cares if a few hundred thousand more people die). Hence trying to make all Trump\u2019s media appearances appear as if there is no COVID anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "What does this mask do? Ask yourself that. if covid was the size of a basketball, the holes in the mask would be the size of a house. The mask does stop some liquid droplets when you are talking, coughing, sneezing. it does very little to nothing to stop individual virii in your breath. And instead of your breath going straight out, it is now difused out the top and sides of your mask. So not just people in front of you get a shot, albeit a shortened shot, also people on both sides of you do to. ",
