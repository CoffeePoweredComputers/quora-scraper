            "answer_text": "Decades ago, during nurse training, we were told to use fresh (fizzing) hydrogen peroxide on (a) deep wounds and specifically (b) when horse manure might be around (stables, gardening,\u2026). The reasoning was that the clostridium tetani bacteria, found (amongst in other places) in (horse) guts, is anaerobic and the oxygen in hydrogen peroxide had a good chance to kill it off before it could settle and produce toxin. As I recently came in contact with a gardener using horse manure I did some reading up on the matter. This as in the UK there doesn\u2019t seem to be a follow up program to get boosters or even initial vaccination against tetanus. In other countries (Belgium e.g.) one is advised to renew the booster shots every 6 to 10 years depending from what activity one is regularly involved in (gardening, horse riding, \u2026). Moreover I did not see hydrogen peroxide as upfront available nowadays as how I had known it many years ago (outside the UK). It used to be part of the standard First Aid kit. This already suggested it had fallen out of grace. Hydrogen peroxide always had been a bit controversial as it does NOT disinfect and it looses its characteristic and capacity relatively quickly: when it stops fizzing its barely more than plain water. My short research showed that the use of hydrogen peroxide in 2016 indeed is no longer advised for wound care. No matter how deep the wound might be. If I had kept working in healthcare I might have known about this much earlier. So, hydrogen peroxide seem to have gone the same path as mercurochrome: once praised and then scrutinized and abandoned. Washing out wounds with water, maybe the application of some disinfectant, and knowing the early symptoms of tetanus seem to be the modern approach to wound care. An approach that is not without risk if not vaccinated as treatment of tetanus is (was?) only successful during the earlier stage and rarely in the later stage. Hope this is of any help. ",

            "answer_text": "Use only on very superficial wounds, if at all, because hydrogen peroxide damages tissue. I think people like to see the bubbling as an indication that something is happening, but this is not necessary or desirable for good wound care. Use plain mild soap and warm water, and pat dry. Leave the wound open to air unless there is a danger of contamination or re-injury; then dress and bandage it. I worked in surgical intensive care for years, and we used hydrogen peroxide to help remove scabs from incision lines, but we didn't apply any friction, and we only used it on closed, healing wounds to help remove dry, caked up blood. We also used it on our shoes and uniforms to remove blood spots. ",
