            "answer_text": "The best place to search depends a lot on what you are trying to find. There are websites that can hold a very large proportion of studies (citations of them) of many fields. The first option is just to search with general-purpose search engines like Google. The second option are more specific databases of citations (links to articles in journal websites or other databases) and search engines to them. You can see one list of them in this Wikipedia entry: List of academic databases and search engines.  There are usually, though, a few central databases that contain most of the meaningful studies for a specific field, but it may be hard to find what those are if you are new to the field. In (bio)medicine and health sciences, MEDLINE (via free Home - PubMed - NCBI) and EMBASE (no free access) are the most used databases but there are many others (e.g. PsycInfo and Scopus). In a typical systematic review of literature on a specific topic/question in medicine, ten or so databases may be searched to make sure that as many studies as possible are found (some minor journals may be indexed only in few of the databases). This makes also systematic reviews a good start to find all studies on a specific subject. In medicine, Cochrane Library is a specific database of systematic reviews but it is seldom searched directly; it's all indexed in PubMed for example. One increasingly common place to find studies are pre-print servers. You can find a list here: Preprint. There is also the illegal source, Sci Hub, that contains pay-walled full text articles for free download. ",

            "answer_text": "Much depends on your area of scientific interest!  The link below is to the US Geological Survey Publications Warehouse -->  U.S. Geological Survey Publications Warehouse  You will find greater than 130,000 peer-reviewed publications, many available as PDFs ready for download. The scientific studies cover a broad range of topics including geology (earthquakes, volcanoes, paleontology, stratigraphy), geography, ecosystems, biology, hydrology, resource assessments (oil, gas, coal, minerals), water resources (surface water and groundwater),  mapping, and Geographic Information Systems. Should any of these topics be of interest to you...enjoy!  ",
