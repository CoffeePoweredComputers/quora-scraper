            "answer_text": "A lot of them. In fact, most of them aren\u2019t even tangible. I\u2019ll put a nice list to express my view... in my own definition of \u201cevil\u201d. I didn\u2019t intend to offend anyone, but really, evil pays better, and guess who\u2019s the most evil guy in your room? Tribalism : Funnily enough, the most evil thing humans had ever invented was made back when humans haven\u2019t even discovered fire yet, and already it is the very evil that kept our whole human race alive all along. But when civilizations started to meet each other, soon enough they think they\u2019re the master race just because they can cross the sea before anyone else figured it out. You know the rest, as slavery and racial divide become rampant in the name of white men\u2019s burden and other such nonsense. The sheer scale of the racial superiority humans can express makes Adolf Hitler looks like a saint in comparison to the whole world put together.Communism : A stupid and unrealizable dream, at least not realizable in our mortal realm, that\u2019s what it is. Because someone must be at the top of the whole system, when they goes corrupt, as power does that to almost anyone, the nation that practices that goes nowhere but down. China is about the only nation that claimed to be Communist that is not evil\u2026 in the sense of actually care about their citizens\u2019s wealth, but that\u2019s not saying much, cuz we all know China and USA are \u201cevil\u201d. It\u2019s kinda necessary if you wanna be big. Being evil, that is.Democracy : Democracy coincides with the interest of more people, but it is a double edged sword that Socrates quickly catch up on its consequences, but somehow Americans have decided that it\u2019s the best thing ever despite its increasingly visible flaws in its implementation, if only in order to maintain a sensible-looking mask of pro-citizens government to avoid a French Revolution. I mean, we got more prosperous nation and more informed people, but that haven\u2019t stopped people from trying to subvert it. We got miracles from democracy sometimes, but without evil, where would democracy go? A childish dream at the same yet different league with communism, that\u2019s what. And where did America go with it? Plutocracy. Apparently the rich has more voice than millions of citizens combined and should stay rich forever like a modern feudal system. Oops.Copyright: Apparently entertainment is such a fickle thing that it needed patents all on its own. The gentleman in the last century are so concerned about their paycheck that they invited some dollar-eyed mafias to publish things for them. Come a century later and these same mafias says that downloading free media that they arbitrarily copyrighted are the same as downloading communism, but really, communism from the Internet is less evil than the media mafias limiting our experience.Gunpowder : Originally made by accident in pursuit for a potion of immortality. Then Mongols traded that away to bloodthirsty Europeans who live in a kill-or-be-killed game of thrones world, who proceeded to merrily built the boomstick they used to shoot anything they don\u2019t like to extinction. They also accidentally bred the biological weapons that killed off most of the native Americans too, but nobody at that time knew about this.Fiat Currency : Sly way to make the world go round in your palms, it seems. We fixed US dollar to gold, but then took that pesky gold standard away and printed absurd amount of money to buy some damned pointless stuff. And a good portion of it was embezzled by immoral rich devils.And now for something totally physical: Project Pluto. That is all.Project Pluto - WikipediaTake a nuclear bomber and strap a nuclear ramjet on it and lo, behold, the child of Legion of The Death Star to behold, death offerings for the Rulers of the Underworld, built under the trust in the Lord (or Jewish Science?). I dunno what mad science of logic or mysteries that led the land of the free to concoct this death-ridden craft straight from the corpse of a death-ridden black hole that was once a blinding superstar, brighter than any stars we could ever produce in any sense of word. But one thing is certain: once it took flight, it would herald the Apocalypse as it flies as an unstoppable phoenix of death and destruction\u2026 But at least this thing never existed, unlike hundreds of peacekeeping ICBMs that will kill us all if anyone pressed it.",

            "answer_text": "The hand gun. Humans are separated from other species in the animal kingdom, largely by our ability to make tools. Tools can be thought of as any device that provides utility for fulfilling a human desire or need. The invention of gun powder gave rise to the rifle: a tool of significant utility. Humans cannot compete in combat with other apex predators absent tools to gain advantage. Spears, clubs, knives, snares, traps; all have been useful for humans in their confrontations with large, dangerous animals. Rifles proved the ultimate tool for hunting large prey and protection from apex predators. Before the invention of the rifle, packs of wolves, sometimes in numbers greater than thirty individuals, ruled the night, whereever the habitat spawned them. In 18th century Russia it was highly hazardous to venture out at night because large packs of wolves routinely tore humans apart enroute. The rifle allowed for the culling of large wolf packs and therefore mitigating the threat such packs posed to our safety. Rifles also proved useful for hunting large animals suitable for eating. But hand guns serve no such purpose.. Their sole utility is to kill other human beings in close combat. They are much less accurate at the distances often required to hunt large prey. Hand guns are , as I call them, Human Being Killing Machines. They automate the dispensing of another human being, and thats about all they are good for. While it unfortunately, on occasion, becomes necessary to forge into battle, war is, more often than not a gross misuse of manpower and resources. Most wars end with the parties involved finally sitting down together to work out the terms under which they will coexist peacefully in the future. In other words: the warring nations eventually resolve to coexist peacefully, deciding upon terms agreeable to all parties, so, since diplomacy always provides the solution to the problems nations confront, why not cut to the chase and use diplomats to settle disputes in all cases? But I digress somewhat. My point is that it is rifles, not handguns, that play the dominant role in modern warfare. Side arms are carried into battle and are useful in policing nations too. But in every instance the hand guns utility is reduced to that of a Human Being Killling Machine. And in my opinion, killing other human beings is something mankind is better off not participating in. We need to rely upon our reasoning skills to resolve disputes that arise amongst our people's..We are after all, all one big family. At the end of the day we share in common the title: Earthlings. And it is my view that we should do all we can to avoid killing one another. It is an occasional necessary evil, But ultimately it remains an evil. ",

            "answer_text": "Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missiles. Chemical weapons, like sarin gas, a nerve agent. Guns, and automatic rifles, like the Ar-15 that can fire 400 rounds per minute. Cigarettes, the smoking of cigarettes kills more than 480, 000 people a year. Drugs, like heroin, cocaine, crackcocaine angel dust, acid, crystal meth. Human governments, that have failed all through human history, to bring an end to crime, violence, murder, war, racism, homelessness, starvation, poverty, and death. Human rule has contributed to, and is the root cause, of all the most demented inventions that humanity has created, as described above. Human governments are not based on love, but on power, greed, and war, and injustice. The bible book of Ecclesiastes, tells us of the results of human governments. Ecclesiastes 8:9 reads: \u201cMan has dominated man to his own harm.\u201d Do you know why human governments are failing? It is because who is backing human rule. Luke 4:5\u20137, identifies the one behind human governments. Luke 4:5- 7 reads: (5) \u201cSo he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time.\u201d (6) \u201cThen the Devil said to him:\u201d I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.\u201d (7)\u201cIf you, therefore, do an act of worship to me, it will all be yours.\u201d Who was Satan the devil, making this offer, to rule human governments to? It was Jesus, the son of God. Jesus replied to Satan at Luke 4:8, saying this: \u201cIn reply Jesus said to him: \u201c It is written, it is Jehovah your God you must worship and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.\u201d So we learn two things from these verses. (1), That Satan is behind human rule, he tried to tempt Jesus with being ruler of human government. (2), Jesus response showed that we all should worship only Jehovah God alone. It also shows that Satan wants to be worshiped as a god, he tried to get Jesus to worship him. According to the bible, this all started in the Garden of Eden. Jehovah God told Adam and Eve they would die if they disobeyed and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (Genesis 2:16,17) This was a law that Jehovah God gave to Adam and Eve, and if they obeyed, it meant that they respected Jehovah God as their lawgiver. And that Jehovah God has the right to determine or set the standards for his human creation, as to what is good, (approved by God), and what is bad,(condemned by God). To obey God, would thus have showed that they respected their Creator, and his position as Almighty God. But an angel turned wicked, and wanted Adam and Eve to worship him, instead of Jehovah God. Jehovah God called him Satan and devil after this. Satan told Eve by means of a serpent that she would not die if she ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. Genesis 3:4, reads: \u201cAt this the serpent said to the woman: \u201cYou certainly will not die.\u201d Satan used a serpent like a ventriloquist use a doll, and made it appear to speak. At Genesis 3:5 Satan tells Eve this lie: Genesis 3:5, reads: \u201cFor God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.\u201d Eve was deceived into believing the lies, ate the fruit and gave it to Adam, and he went along with her and ate it also. (Genesis 3:6) That was the start of human rule, where humans decided what was good or bad independent of their Creator, Jehovah God. Satan lied to Eve, he said she certainly would not die. Eve is dead, and Adam is also dead, for disobeying Jehovah God. Satan has also been sentenced to die for what he did in the Garden of Eden, read the account at (Revelation 20:10) Jehovah God could have executed Satan right away. But he made a claim that humans could rule themselves, without Jehovah God and have peace and prosperity. Had Jehovah destroyed satan right away it could have been said that he did it to silence him, and maybe satan was right. So, Jehovah God, in his divine wisdom allowed the challenge to his sovereignty to prove that his way of ruling is in the best interest of his human creation. There were also many faithful angels that were watching to see how Jehovah God would handle this rebellion to his sovereignty. So, Jehovah God allowed humans to form governments, and rule themselves with Satan as their leader, to solve the issue once and for all. And what has been the results of human rule, promoted by Satan? A world full of crime, violence, murder, racism, rape, poverty, terrorism, war, hunger, injustice, domestic violence, child abuse, mass killings, nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, out of control gun violence. The F.B.I. Crime clock statistics say: A violent crime occurs every 24.6 seconds. A murder occurs every 30.5 minutes. A rape occurs every 3.9 minutes. A robbery occurs every 1.7 minutes. A motor vehicle theft every 40.9 seconds. A burglary every 22.6 seconds. So it is very clear that Satan lied, again. This world under human rule, by human governments, is out of control. In contrast, if every person earth wide, were to obey just (3) of Jehovah God's commandments, Not to steal, Not to kill, To love your neighbors as yourself, There would not be any murders, No crimes of violence, no rape, robberies, racism, no war, or weapons of mass destruction, no need for jails or prisons, no need for police. No food shortages, or greed, no need for guns. So we can clearly see, that to have the terrible problems we as humans face solved, we need to obey God as ruler, not man, or Satan. Isaiah 48:17,18 reads: \u201cI Jehovah am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in the way you should walk.\u201d \u201cIf only you would pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.\u201d To choose Jehovah God as ruler, and follow his way, and to be declared righteous by him, will benefit you greatly. Psalms 37:29 reads: \u201cThe righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.\u201d Psalms 37:34 reads: \u201cHope in Jehovah and follow his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth, when the wicked are done away with, you will see it.\u201d So according to the bible those that choose to follow Jehovah and his way will live forever on earth. Those who choose to follow Satan, and man as ruler, will be declared wicked by God, and done away with by God. So the most demented invention humanity has created, is human rule, independent of Jehovah God. It has caused all mankind's problems, and was started by Satan. It has now been over 6000 years of failed human governments. Jehovah God has allowed humans more than enough time to rule themselves independent of him, and that time is nearing its end. According to the bible God will put an end to human rule as a failure, and replace it with his own government. (Daniel 2:44) Jehovah God is also going to eliminate Satan, the instigator of this whole mess.(Revelation 20:10) To learn how to take God's side and live forever, visit http://jw.org Thank you ",

It just seems really dumb to make a machine, with their capacity to malfunction, and then give it a mind of its own. Some people will say that there are the famous 3 Laws of Robotics that are meant to protect people. But how is a malfunctioning machine going to adhere to any programming? Connect it to an oversight system? Well, then it could get hacked. Even if it weren't connected it could be hacked, or tampered with, or sabotaged. Also, how many ways could someone get around the rules? I'm sure someone has been thinking about this already and has figured out how to manipulate the rules for their own personal gain. Then again, what would stop someone bent on evil doings from creating their own AI with no rules? So essentially, a life sized human figure made of metal with the strength and ability to break down your door and squeeze the life out of you (if so inclined by design or accident) is a reality. They aren't yet able to pass as humans, looking and acting in a way that would make them indistinguishable from us, but they will be. I'd guess that within 20 years we will see really lifelike robots. I've already seen some fairly good ones, but still obviously machines. And there may be some perfectly harmless, even extremely beneficial, uses for a lifelike robot, but there are also some terrifying ones. ",

The ICE allowed engines to become smaller, separated them from the need to be attached to a power source all the time, and allowed the exploitation of ultra volatile fuels like gasoline, diesel and kerosene. So you could have one of your own. Or, unfortunately, several tens of millions of people could afford to have one all of their own. Instead of, you know, taking the train or something.  Now, for individuals, this was a positive boon. For society as a whole, not so much. Forget about climate change for a minute - places with a lot of these things became polluted - air pollution, soil pollution (from leaking gas tanks), space pollution (the need for wide roads and lots of parking spaces), etc. ",
