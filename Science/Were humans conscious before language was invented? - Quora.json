            "answer_text": "Were humans conscious before language was invented? Gerald M. Edelman wrote a book called \u201cWider Than the Sky: The Phenomenal Gift of Consciousness.\u201d He says that consciousness is like the \"remembered present,\" which means when you are viewing a scene, this scene and all past experience is engaged in forming an integrated awareness of this single moment. In this book, he talks about two levels of consciousness. Primary consciousness is the state of being mentally aware of things in the world, of having mental images in the present. He feels that many animals have primary consciousness that are lacking semantic or linguistic capabilities. Higher-order consciousness involves the ability to be conscious of being conscious. Recreate past episodes and form future intentions. We can create something that does not exist \u2026 abstract reasoning. Abstract reasoning is the ability to understand concepts that are real, such as time or economics, but which are not directly tied to concrete physical objects and experience. I can point to a tree but I can not point to a thing called economics. Higher-order consciousness requires semantic ability, which gives the ability of assignment of meaning to a symbol. It requires linguistic ability, which is the mastery of a whole system of symbols (words, etc.) and a grammar. A raccoon (or any mammal) awareness of the moon, planets and stars has to be very limited. The moon to me is much more meaningful than it is to raccoon! Abstract reasoning is a cognitive mechanism for reaching logical conclusions in the absence of physical data, concrete phenomena, or specific instances. No other animal seems to have this ability. Humans can think of things with in the mind that do not exist. Most all animals live in the here and now, while humans can live in the past or the future. Language is a means of communication. But humans have many types of language such as linguists (sound and meaning) math (operations and processes and relations between quantities expressed symbolically), writing (long term communication), sign language, computer language, spoken language (all 6000 plus), touch (e.g. Helen Keller), etc. Many mammals seem to have some kind of communication using sound, signs and touch. A horse may use each of these methods to come up with about 120 \u201cwords.\u201d But, a recent study (2010) on the number of words in the English language is estimated to be a total of 1,022,000 words and that the number would grow by several thousand each year. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed. It appears that we can indeed think without language, it is also the case that there are certain kinds of thinking that are made possible by language. The main use of language is to transfer thoughts from one mind, to another mind. Language is a social phenomenon, and where there is no language, there is no society. Our thought comes first, while language is an expression of those thoughts. It is interesting that there are certain limitations with language, and humans cannot express all that they think. Therefore, the answer to your question is Yes! ",
