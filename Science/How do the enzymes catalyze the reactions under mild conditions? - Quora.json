            "answer_text": "Essentially, two molecules to be joined by an enzyme attach to the enzyme in close proximity. The attachment tugs on the electrons of the two molecules so that the probability increases that the electrons of the two molecules will assume a configuration so the molecules spontaneously form a bond between them. The same idea applies in for the breaking of bonds in a molecule during enzymatic cleavage. See Enzyme catalysis - Wikipedia ",
