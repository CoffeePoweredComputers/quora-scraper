            "answer_text": "We do not know what is inside of a black hole\u2026 however, to be a black hole it cannot have an other end. A black hole with an exit has a different name, it\u2019s called a \u201cwormhole\u201d. Specifically, a one-way wormhole. Think of it as a tunnel with a one-way street running through it. The other side of a wormhole is another place in the universe. All the holes you have ever seen, the only way out is the way in \u2026 a black hole: the way in cannot be a way out. You goes in, you ain\u2019t getting out. The inside of a black hole is \u201cthe other side of the event horizon\u201d\u2026 some black holes have several event horizons, but there is always one you cannot get back from. That\u2019s the one I\u2019m talking about for this discussion. Inside a black hole, our physics breaks down: we don\u2019t know what happens there \u2026 but that does not mean we cannot make reasonable guesses. The simplest approach as a starting point is that space and time swap roles there \u2026 from the POV of a free-falling observer. You know how you have 1 dimension of time, and you have no choice but to move forward in time? We-ell, that is the \u201cradial direction of space\u201d inside a black hole, with a singularity somewhere about a fixed point in the future. You have no choice but to approach this point. I say about because not all singularities are a point. We don\u2019t know what there is where the singularity is\u2026 the word, \u201csingularity\u201d just means, \u201cthis is the special situation where our maths fails\u201d. The previous model is just a topology trick \u2026 it allows us to consider the event horizon as part of continuous space-time without breaking maths. For context\u2026 the usual map of the Earth has two singularities, one at the north pole and one at the south pole. According to the map, anyone standing exactly at either pole is smeared over the whole edge of the map\u2026 but we can use a topology trick to show the actual situation just by changing the way we make the map.

            "answer_text": "A black \u201chole\u201d is not a \u201chole\u201d with another end. It's simply anybarea with such extreme gravity that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. Going in one will not pop you out somewhere else. You will simply get smooshed and fall to the middle. You won't get a \u201cgood answer\u201d because black holes break relativity, and relativity is such a popular theory that it's considered more likely that space and time and all reality must break down before the theory can be violated, so the resulting paradoxes are simply accepted. For example, it's assumed anything passing the event horizon would feel as though it were falling forever because it would accelerate to relativistic speeds, which would make the rest of the universe appear to slow down, until you hit the speed of light, which would make the rest of the universe appear to stop as time would be infinitely dilated, but also space (in the direction of travel) would be infinitely compressed\u2026. Therefore you would be traveling toward a destination 0 distance away at the speed of light for an eternity. You can take your pick: Black holes are magic and break reality in order to preserve relativity throughout all of \u201creal reality\u201d OR black holes really exist, but relativity's math fails in that context and therefore is not a truly universal constant. Also, everyone should appreciate Neil DeGrasse Tyson's explanation of spaghettification. (Yes, that's the scientific term)  ",
