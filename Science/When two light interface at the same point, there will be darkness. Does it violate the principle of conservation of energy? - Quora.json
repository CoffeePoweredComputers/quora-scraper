            "answer_text": "Photons are quantum particles. When they destructively interfere to create a dark spot, it\u2019s not destroying the photons, it\u2019s merely altering the chance of finding a photon in that spot. If you look in the right place elsewhere, you find that the chance of finding a photon has gone up due to constructive interference, and created a spot that is brighter than it otherwise should be without the overall interference. In short, if it gets darker somewhere due to interference, it has to get brighter elsewhere. It is impossible using any arrangement of photon sources to cause destructive interference globally where you end up essentially losing photons and violating the conservation of energy. If you try to work out the possibility it ends up with the source never emitting the photon in the first place, and so the energy stays with the source. Same goes for global constructive interference and gaining infinite energy. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the question is about destructive interference of two light beams. From a classical point of view, we say that there will be some other location where there is constructive interference. So all that happens is that instead of uniform spread of the light energy, it is clumped together in places- maxima and minima of the interference pattern. Fom the quantum perspective, it means that the probablity of detecting a photon at that location is very small/ zero. All that means is that the photons are more likely to be detected at some other location. In quantum mechanics there is a calculation called normalisation and in essence it ensures that if you look everywhere, the probability of detecting the photon is one. This means that the photon and its energy arrives somewhere just not the location you had in mind. Because it does arrive somewhere, clearly energy is conserved. ",
