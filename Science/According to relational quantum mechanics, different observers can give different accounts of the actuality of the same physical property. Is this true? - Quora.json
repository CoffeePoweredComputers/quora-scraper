            "answer_text": "Yes , it is true. It is the refinement of the Copenhagen School. Account of one physical state by an observer is also dependent upon the presence of a neighboring physical state. I'm not familiar with this new (20 years old) variant of quantum mechanics. However, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online) describes this formalism in great depths and how it differs from conventional quantum mechanics in its conceptual structure (with some philosophical flavor).
