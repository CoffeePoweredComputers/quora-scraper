            "answer_text": "How can complex physical constants in the theory of relativity formulate new mathematical theories? Ah, it\u2019s Ahmad Mbark, once again on his quixotic search for the mythical complex constants. As has been explained to you multiple times before, the constants don\u2019t matter anywhere near as much as the equations the constants appear in. And we\u2019re all wondering why you\u2019re on a quest to make things even more complicated, when your questions indicate that you don\u2019t have a firm grasp on the current theories. Meanwhile, don\u2019t you have a PhD thesis to finish writing, so you can get that PhD in particle physics your credentials claim you\u2019re getting next year? ",

            "answer_text": "What is a \u201ccomplex\u201d physical constant? Physical constants are unitless numbers, like the fine-structure constant, approximately 1/137; or are numbers with units, so the number depends on what the units are. But I don\u2019t know what would make a constant \u201ccomplex\u201d.Relativity either has no constants at all or has only the constants G (Newton\u2019s constant) and c (speed of light). (In theoretical work, units commonly are chosen so that G = 1 and c = 1, hence, \u201cno constants\u201d.)Constants, physical or otherwise, \u201ccomplex\u201d or otherwise, do not give rise to mathematical theories.",
