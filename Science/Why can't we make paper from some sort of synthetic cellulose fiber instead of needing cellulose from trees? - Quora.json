Bamboo and hemp both make nice paper products in addition to incredibly soft durable clothing. Papyrus has also been used for paper and clothing for millennia. By it\u2019s very name, synthetic, implies an artificial substitution. Synthetic fibers, a petroleum derivative, have been in widespread use since first invented in the 1880\u2019s. A synthetic cellulose fiber is a blend of wood and petroleum products. Most paper manufacturing involves the use of chemicals to break down or create the fibers. Some methods are more environmentally friendly than others. Synthetic Fibers Synthetic fibers for reinforced speciality paper.

            "answer_text": "Synthetic paper is already a real thing. It is water resistant and good for applications where you need that. It also makes for good lithograph prints (arguably). Pulp from trees is readily abundant and a renewable resource. When you cut down a tree, you don\u2019t just leave an empty space. You plant a new one. By FSC standards, you plant 3 new trees. After you\u2019re done with that paper, you can throw it out, and it will naturally break down faster than most household waste. Conversely, synthetic paper, which is made from petroleum, will not break down for a very long time. Which do you think is better for the environment? ",
