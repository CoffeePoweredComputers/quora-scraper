            "answer_text": "Now, if you're taking about iodized table sale (the most common type) then no, it's not a pure substance because you can remove the iodine without changing the chemical nature of the substance. Iodized table salt is a mixture, not a pure substance. NaCl with no iodine is a pure substance. Chemical substance  A chemical substance is a form of matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.[1] It cannot be separated into components by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds. Chemical substances can be chemical elements, chemical compounds, ions or alloys.  Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold, table salt (sodium chloride) and refined sugar (sucrose). However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical. To paraphrase: a chemical pure substance is one in which you cannot break down its particles (molecules or atoms) into anything smaller without changing the nature of the substance. Pure elements are easy examples, because you cannot divide an atom further without great effort.  Table salt is composed of sodium and chlorine, NaCl. It's a compound of two distinct elements that cannot be broken down further without changing the properties of the substance. If you were to take one molecule of NaCl and divide it further, you would no longer have table salt; you would have a sodium atom and a chlorine atom. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn't a pure substance. It's a compound of sodium and chlorine. Most table salt has other substances in it as well, some of which occur naturally (such as iron oxide, boron, copper, sulfur, and phosphorous) and some of which are added (such as iodine, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate, and silicon dioxide). Of the many things table salt is, a \"pure substance\" is definitely not one of them. ",
