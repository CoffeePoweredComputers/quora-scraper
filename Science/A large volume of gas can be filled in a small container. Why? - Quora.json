            "answer_text": "It is not true. The volume of gas can only be the internal volume of the container. If it comes from another larger container, the mass will be the same, but the volume will be reduced. However, you will have to do work in order to push it in, and the pressure in the small container will be larger. Conversely, a small volume of gas (e.g. from a cylinder of helium) can be used to fill a large container (e.g. a balloon) if the smaller container is at a higher pressure. To a first approximation, the product of pressure and volume (any units) remains the same if the temperature is the same. PV = k For example, 1 cubic meter at 100 psi can fill 10 cubic meters at 10 psi. (I meant what I said about any units.) To squash the 10 cubic meters at 10 psi into 1 cubic meter you will have to do work (e.g. with a compressor). There is a limit to how far you can compress gases. In many cases they condense (turn into liquids) which is why camping gas containers slosh about. ",

            "answer_text": "If you take a container of a certain volume and put any amount of gas in it then, the volume of the gas will always be equal to the volume of container. What I think you meant by the question is that we are able to put large no. of molecules of a gas in small containers. Now this is because gases are highly compressible, molecules of gases have space between them. when sufficient pressure is applied, these spaces are filled by the gas molecules thus making the gas more compact than before ",

            "answer_text": "Gases are mostly empty space, meaning that there is lots of room between individual particles. This empty space is caused by a lack of strong attraction forces. The empty space is able to be reduced, so this is what happens when you put the gas in a container with a smaller volume. There is a limit to how much a gas can be compressed though. ",
