If \u201csmart\u201d describes their talents and gifts, both boys were undoubtedly very gifted people. The older son realized his talents by becoming a world-renowned expert in hydraulic engineering. The life of the younger one, an excellent musician with a particular gift for language, was spoiled by miserably treated schizophrenia and a quite unfavorable life situation. Unfortunately, most authors who feel called to report about his life, mainly spread legends. ",

            "answer_text": "His first born, Lieserl, died of scarlet fever or was adopted. No one knows for sure. He had two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard. Eduard was a Med student but developed schizophrenia and was institutionalized. Hans Albert was brilliant and became a professor of hydraulic engineering at UC Berkeley. They inherited their parents IQ but inheriting a trait is a tricky thing. Like eye color or hair loss, it can go through generational changes and can be less or more as you go down the line. My grandfather had a full head of hair when he died at 92 but most of my uncles are bald or mostly bald. ",
