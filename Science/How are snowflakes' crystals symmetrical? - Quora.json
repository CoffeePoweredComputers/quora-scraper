            "answer_text": "Pretty much the same way you are symmetrical.    8)    Your left side didn't know what your right side was doing as you developed, either. A highly specific set of (atmospheric, in the case of a snowflake) conditions sets the stage for the specific geometric crystallization of a snowflake. Since those conditions are pretty nearly exactly the same in the entire vicinity surrounding a budding snowflake, the entire snowflake will take on the character dictated by those specific conditions.
