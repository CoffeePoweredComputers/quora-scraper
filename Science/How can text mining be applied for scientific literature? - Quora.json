            "answer_text": "[A2A] A few angles not mentioned by other answers: There exist excellent ontologies of biomedical concepts (such as SNOMED and UMLS), so you can try to identify mentions of those concepts and link them to the ontology.  More generally, check out past proceedings of the BioNLP workshops, which can be found at SIGBIOMED - ACL Wiki. A scientific paper usually refers to other scientific papers.  The citation graph is interesting, but would be more useful if we knew why one paper is citing another - what is the relationship between the two papers?  More generally, you may be interested to see the topics covered in this workshop on mining the ACL Anthology. As your question suggests, there's been a lot of interest in topic modeling.  For example, check out Blei & Lafferty's work on modeling how the topics in the journal Science evolved over 100 years. ",
