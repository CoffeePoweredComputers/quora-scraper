            "answer_text": "yes it is. oxidation means increase inn oxidation number and reduction means decrease in oxidation number. now here in this reaction hydrogen and oxygen being in molecular state has by default oxidation number as 0(zero). but in water the oxidation number of oxygen is -2 and that of hydrogen is +1. so ON of oxygen decreases hence undergoes reduction, and ON of hydrogen increases so undergoes oxidation. hence it is a redox reaction.
