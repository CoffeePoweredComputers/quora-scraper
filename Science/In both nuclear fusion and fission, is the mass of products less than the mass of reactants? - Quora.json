            "answer_text": "How can the mass of the products be less than the mass of reactants? In thermonuclear reactions, we know that a large amount of energy is released because some mass is converted to energy. How can that be true for small nuclei like hydrogen, helium, and lithium (in fusion) as well for large ones like uranium (in fission)? It makes sense that a large nucleus like U-235 could fission because it is unstable due to the repulsive electric force between the many protons packed into the nucleus. We know that the strong nuclear force holds the nucleons (protons and neutrons) together and is very short ranged. So the nucleus is near a balance of forces and in time some will alpha decay or spontaneously fission. Nuclear fusion - Wikipedia fusion process that produces a nucleus lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally yield a net energy release. These elements have the smallest mass per nucleon and the largest binding energy per nucleon, respectively. Fusion of light elements toward these releases energy (an exothermic process), while a fusion producing nuclei heavier than these elements will result in energy retained by the resulting nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. In small nuclei, there are few proton to proton repulsions. In cases that produce fusion energy, the nucleons in the product can be strongly bound and reach a more stable energy state due to the strong nuclear force if there are some neutrons to make it more stable without contributing destabilizing repulsions. The neutrons also bind by the strong nuclear force and help to counteract some of the proton repulsions at short range. Thermonuclear weapon - Wikipedia the energy released by the detonation of a primary fission bomb within, compressing the fuel material (tritium, deuterium or lithium deuteride) and causing a fusion reaction. Some advanced designs use fast neutrons produced by this second stage to ignite a third fast fission or fusion stage. The fission bomb and fusion fuel are placed near each other in a special radiation-reflecting container called a radiation case that is designed to contain x-rays for as long as possible. Since protons are stable reactant particles, it takes a very powerful source of energy to force them together to fuse. The H bomb uses a fission reaction (bomb) to get the fusion reaction started. ",

            "answer_text": "In fission, the products are less as you've split a heavier atom. In fusion, you get more massive products due to the energy put into the fusion and this is why we cant get good energy from fusion reactors. Conservation of energy is a shite bag. P.S not sorry about that last part because its true! ",
