            "answer_text": "Teach what you\u2019ve learnt. Expecting to teach what\u2019s been learned has been shown to be better for learning and memory than expecting only testing. It\u2019s a subtle shift in mindset, but the effect on learning is an important one.Learning material with an intention to teach ensures that material is actively understood and stored away in memory, and not passively looked over. Test yourself. Testing yourself will force you to remember information. Every time you remember something, the information becomes a little more enduring. Testing yourself might also help to take the fire out of test anxiety, in the same way that exposure to any feared object eventually makes that object less frightening. Take a break. Taking a short break after every hour of learning is better than working straight through as it improves your ability to focus on a particular task without being distracted. ",

            "answer_text": "As an engineering student my frank answer would be,the most basic ,easy and efficient way to gain knowledge or to be excellent learner is to read. simply read alot. Be highly selective about what you are going to read /learn. In fact our mind is not infinitely powered, but is limited. Its like the muscles. More you exercise, stronger and better it will be. As we all know that the health is wealth and without a sound health nothing is possible. A student must maintain a good mental, physical and soul health. It can be gained by regular simple meditation(yoga), simply for about 10\u201315 minutes. This will help you to maintain a sound soul and mind. For your physical fitness you should go for a regular walking or running because i find it very simple and efficient as a student. Drink enough water cuz this helps you in efficient blood circulation and alot which is very important for your nervous system. Give your best effort and energy to understand and learn in class. Class is your mind\u2019s warehouse. Interact with your teachers and superior friends, believe me it helps alot in learning process. For me the most important way to study is by studying myself alot. I just revise what i learnt today when i arrive home and then i read same things from books. And another important thing is to stay as far as possible from devices you-know..Just turn off your mobile phone put it far away from yourself collect all required things around your study area, take a deep breath and just start to study from the easy part. Take rest frequently because resting your body is far better than simply doing nothing at all. Btw resting does not mean hanging with TV, mobile phones or any devices. simply rest , close your eyes , lie down, make yourself comfortable and breath. I hope this helps you a bit. ",
