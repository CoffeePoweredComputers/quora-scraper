            "answer_text": "Science is all about understanding anything and everything having to do with the physical world or universe. Every single bit of knowledge or data, new or old, helps scientists understand THE BIG PICTURE. Think of the universe as a giant jigsaw puzzle. Every time you put a piece in such a puzzle, you know a little more about what it\u2019s going to look like when you finish it. Of course scientists probably won\u2019t ever know EVERYTHING, but every year they put some more pieces in the right place the puzzle, and every year they discover some new pieces that will eventually be put into their proper places. As a practical matter, a good understanding of black holes will throw some light ( a sort of pun is intended here since black holes trap light, lol) on practical problems. We would like to have fusion based nuclear reactors to generate electricity. They would run on hydrogen, and they would be quite safe, no spent fuel, no danger of meltdowns or explosions, no danger of ever running short of fuel. If we know more about black holes, we can put a lot more pieces of the big picture puzzle in the correct places, and maybe have some new technologies that will seem like magic. ",

            "answer_text": "Because studying them gives us access to data and observations that allow us to test many of our theories in the most extreme conditions within our universe. This either strengthens our confidence in our theories or exposes weaknesses that can then be used to improve the theories to make better predictions in the future. It is these theories that lead to new technologies and understanding of our universe. The more accurately our models/theories of the universe are the better our technology which is based off those models/theories will be.
