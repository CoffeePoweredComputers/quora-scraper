            "answer_text": "One of the downsides of teaching science (or anything really) as \u201cseparate subjects\u201d is that it's hard to grasp similar underlying principles. During the Enlightenment period, scientists made many discoveries about the natural world. Physics, astronomy, chemistry, and yes, even biology begun to lay bare their secrets under the scrutiny of the scientific method. It is helpful to understand that back before this time, we didn't really know what life was? What does it mean to be alive? How does life work? Where did it come from? Where and how did it start? You may notice we still don't have complete - or even partial - answers to these inquiries. But what other fields of science demonstrated was that there were underlying mechanisms to what we observe out in nature. I'm going to skip around a lot of the details of who did what, when, and how, but the key take aways are as follows Life is made of cells; cells are the fundamental unit of life.Organisms can be larger than a single cell (like us) which are just made up of many individual cells, but things smaller than a cell such as proteins, DNA, lipids, or any other molecule are not living. Imagine a car and all of its parts. A tire, gas tank, engine, brake pedal are not cars. But a car needs all of them - more on that later.Life is an emergent property whereas the sum of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is what makes biology, and the study of life on general, so fascinating to me because even very complex arrangements are ruled by principles that are quite simple and ubiquitous in the universe. Going back to the car analogy, those parts are randomly thrown in a pile - they are arranged in a very specific way - and the vast majority of auto maintenence is maintaining that order. But take those parts in isolation and you see their mechanisms too follow laws of chemistry and physics.These emergent properties themselves are consistent with what we were (and still) learning about how chemistry and physics works. The actual mechanism of how biology works align perfectly with what we know from other fields, and that's very important becauseLife isn't special. What I mean by that is that it doesn't require some inanimate \u201clife force\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d or \u201cdivine spark\u201d or whatever you want to call it. Cells use energy concerned in chemical bonds to establish and maintain concentration gradients that, in turn, are coupled with reactions that cost a lot of energy to do work for the cell. What is the work of a cell?Cells create life by creating order. You might think of life as the antithesis of chaos - the tendency for disorder to increase over time (or said thermodynamically, entropy increases with time). That's why we eat - to provide energy to literally keep our molecules from losing their order that's requires to maintain life. GoijgAnd relating to those last few points? Life follows perfectly the laws of thermodynamics, which again, is support for mechanisms tjay are consistent with what we know about the universe and everything in it.Now, I agree. These are some very lofty ideas, especially for middle school to freshman biology. And in defense of students of that age group, these concepts are not taught very well. In defense of teachers of these age groups, they are not provided with the means or time (most especially in the US) to impart these concepts on their students. So, in conclusion, the history of cell theory is to encapsulate what were the prevailing thoughts about life during that time, and how using scientific method could shed light on the secrets of life, in similar fashion that scientific method was and is used in other fields. This, in turn, is to reinforce the importance of the scientific method and also that life and the many related fields of biology are 100% consistent with all other fields. ",
