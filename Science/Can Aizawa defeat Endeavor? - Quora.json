            "answer_text": "Aizawa is an incredibly skilled fighter and has a lot experince fighting without using a directly offensive quirk. He also has that capture rope and is very proficient with it. That being said Aizawa said himself that there are no one trick ponies among the top pro heroes so Endeavor must know how to fight to, especially since overuse of his power causes him to overheat. However, I don\u2019t really think we seen him fight hand to hand yet. He is also super swole and in a complete different weight class than Aizawa (although that doesn\u2019t always mean much in anime). Also it is note worthy that Aizawa can\u2019t cancel out powers forever and he also has a tell for when his powers are active. That menas Endeavor could still time some fire attacks when Aizawa\u2019s powers are down. It\u2019s also very likely that Endeavor would know about this weakness before hand too. All in all I think their is a reason Endeavor is the number 2 hero. Aizawa will probably go down most of the time but he\u2019d definitely make Endeavor suffer before doing it. ",

But when you are now both normal humans in your own right, it comes down to your human qualities. Physically, Eraserhead is absolutely no match for Evdeavor, I mean, just look at the difference. Eraserhead.  Endeavor.  Now I know Eraserhead is a good melee combatant and he does have his trapping bandages, but I just don\u2019t see it being enough to stop Endeavor, let alone beat him. ",

I would bet on endeavor in the end, he is HUGE in muscle mass and like shoto said \u2014you have to respect the instincts of a man who worked his way up to the number 2 spot Endeavor probably has some great reflexes and I\u2019m sure he knows what aizawa\u2019s quirk is so I\u2019d say Aizawa loses the element of suprise I give it to endeavor in this case ",

I don\u2019t know who exactly would win but comparing the two in body type, experience in fights, and powers/quirks. I\u2019d have to say stalemate. I do NOT believe either would win against the other. The two have experience in a lot of fights. Aizawa may have Endeavor beat in quirks/powers but Endeavor could still beat Aizawa without his power. This is mostly compared to their body types. Endeavor having a strong muscular body type in contrast to Aizawa with I wanna say about average body type. But it\u2019d be close for them. If I had to chose personally I\u2019d say Aizawa because he specializes in stealth and could possibly deal with any situation. That\u2019s personal opinion. I feel though someone else could give a better answer than mine. That\u2019s all. ",
