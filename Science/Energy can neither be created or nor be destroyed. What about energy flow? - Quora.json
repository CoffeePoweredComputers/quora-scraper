            "answer_text": "To answer your question, energy can neither be created or destroyed BUT change from one form to another. Chemical energy in batteries is converted to electrical energy. Thermal energy or heat energy from burning of coal is converted into mechanical energy used in running machines. Similarly in vehicles, petroleum products (chemical) produce heat which runs the engine, this in turn is transferred to the wheels that helps the car move. Although in practical purposes there is always some loss in the form of resistance or friction due to air, in some cases some part of the energy is also released in the form of heat. Hope this helps. :) ",

So KE is converted to work (energy transfer) Part of the mechanical energy is also converted to sound, light, heat etc due to air resistance, road friction, etc ",
