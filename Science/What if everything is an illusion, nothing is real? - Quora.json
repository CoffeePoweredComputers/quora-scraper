            "answer_text": "This is a burning question that has been asked and contemplated for thousands of years by many before us. First, the definition of reality is important. We can define reality as an experience: a bunch of stuff that we perceive in our own subjective way. Overall, the answer to this question comes down to this: Being locked into a constrained, subjective reality that\u2019s a function of your current state of limited, primitive evolutionary progress and specific essence as a \u201chuman\u201d. Let\u2019s explore this. The likes of people like Plato, and onto 17th century philosophers like Rene Descartes delved deeply into this question. All of these great thinkers have effectively one thing in common: they saw something suspicious about reality. They questioned it outright. Plato\u2019s view is that the physical form (your body, tables and chairs, etc.) is the perceivable layer that is far removed from what the true reality is: that there is this underlying, mathematical substratum of things\u2026 a blueprint\u2026 that things like objects in the world are modelled on and trying to be like. The physical form is in many ways a low plane of existence; the human body a detriment to existence. Rene Descartes investigated reality as well with his I think, therefore I am (Cogito ergo sum) conclusion. As he writes, watching wax burn and melt and questioning whether anything is \u201creal\u201d\u2026 what is so different about this reality compared to a dream? How does he know that reality isn\u2019t just a dream? What if this is all nothingness? Ultimately, his conclusion is that, because he has thoughts\u2026 he\u2019s at least a thinking thing and that in a way can mean he exists. I think, therefore I am (basically a thought machine)\u2026 a thing with thoughts. But not being able to know much really beyond this. It brought a first principle of existence for him. This brings up the notion of Solipsism: the concept that all we can ever know, in the context of this discussion, is our thoughts. That we\u2019re trapped in our own experience and can\u2019t really know anything else. Movies like the Matrix and Bladerunner are about this question and about these different treatise on understanding the world. In the Matrix, people didn\u2019t know that reality was a sham: they were so locked into their own experience that they were unaware of any alternate truth of reality. Plato\u2019s Allegory of the cave is worth mentioning as well. In this, prisoners are shackled and not able to turn their heads. They\u2019re facing a wall in a cave. Behind them are puppeteers whose puppets cast shadows on the wall the prisoners can see. The prisoners can\u2019t see the \u201creal\u201d objects behind them, just the shadows cast in front of them. The prisoners may refer to the shadows as the real objects, but that\u2019s mistaken. The real objects - the puppets behind them - are not perceivable by them. Packaging all of this up\u2026 the answer to the question of whether things are an illusion or whether they\u2019re real\u2026 is this: Reality is an illusion because we can\u2019t know anything outside of our own experience.That experience is arguably primitive (e.g., 5 senses, un-evolved physical bodies, etc.) meaning it\u2019s limited.Reality is effectively a logical construction of our minds/experience, so it traps us in this recursive loop: we want to reach out and grab \u201cobjective reality\u201d, but we always end up back to the reality of everything being subjective and limited; a mirror of our own mind: a mind that is not all knowing.When we factor in evidence that reality may be \u201cchoppy\u201d, where our brains string together frames from our visual system that we pereive as a smooth perception; or Libet\u2019s studies on conscious awareness lagging events in reality\u2026 the proposition that our lives are illusions has some support in science. So tying this all together\u2026 what\u2019s reality? It\u2019s the function of your primitive state of mind and perceptual tools. It\u2019s a locked in experience constrained by your current state of organized matter and evolutionary progress as a \u201cbeing\u201d in this universe\u2026 a moment in time in this corner of the world, whatever the world is. Totally subjective. Reality, in this way, is an illusion\u2026 because the being (you) perceiving it is so limited that you can\u2019t know anything but that limited subjective experience, but we\u2019re intelligent enough to think how limited we are and to imagine something so much greater than ourselves: it\u2019s an awkward state of being. We can say that we\u2019re primitive because we can postulate things like there being billions or even trillions of potential planets in this known universe and how there can be life that is billions of years more advanced than us given the apparent age of the universe. That some other intellgent life\u2019s experience, form of being, etc. can be surmised as being markedly and shockingly more advanced and different from ours, almost certainly in cases not even perceivable by us. In other words, an alternate reality; an alternate truth. A quick analogy illustrates this: imagine an ant trying to \u201cperceive\u201d human life/reality. It can\u2019t. It will never \u201cunderstand\u201d at any deep enough level such a \u201creality\u201d, especially from the perspective of a human. It\u2019s locked in its own state of being given its essence (e.g., its construction of matter and given its state of evolutionary progress). And it will never know an \u201cobjective reality\u201d: this latter is beyond its abilities. This analogy can be applied to humans and something much more intelligent and evolved than us. Primitive state of being combined with a locked in, subjective experience Necessary truths are what we\u2019re after when it comes to understanding and knowing some kind of objective reality: breaking out of our limited shell/hacking the illusion. Necessary truths are something explored by the likes of Aristotle. Necessary truths are truths that exist in all possible worlds. An example is: 1+1 will always equal 2, no matter what because it effectively doesn\u2019t rely on a specific perceiver to make it true or some other condition accordingly. But the statement, The sun heats the earth\u2026 that will eventually not be true (e.g., the sun will burn out): it\u2019s a contingent truth. We hardly know any necessary truths when you think about it. Most everything around us that forms our reality is not a necessary truth, meaning it depends on us (the perceiver), and will eventually be gone and make no sense. For example, transport yourself back 100 years and go into an office where people are working. You will experience things there that you don\u2019t understand; that serve no purpose to you or have any real role in the world. That\u2019s only 100 years ago, a brief blip in time. Now travel into the future say 700 years (not that long relatively) and imagine what it will be like. A lot of the things today that surround us such as computers, shoes, houses, cars, businesses with physical objects for sale\u2026 things that form the quantum of our reality\u2026 will likely be completely gone or drastically different that the world - \u201creality\u201d - will be, in many ways, foreign to you. You may not even be able to perceive everything in your current form. For instance, imagine a world/reality where not only do cars not have wheels but they don\u2019t exist; roads are made of what looks like tennis balls; the sky is pink; there are no homes (people have nano-particles built into their cells that shields them from the elements); there are no power lines; no farms and no food because \u201chumans\u201d don\u2019t require food anymore; people have closed mouths with thin lips and no teeth because they no longer talk or have to eat; they have advanced energy creation systems built into their bodies, etc. Businesses with physical goods: gone. Roads that people walk on: gone. Human beings that look different to the point of frightening you: check\u2026 and so forth. Now transport yourself 1 million years into the future: you wake up in that future, and everything is black, you can\u2019t perceive anything. It\u2019s a nothingness because you\u2019re too limited to perceive and understand that reality (e.g., the life around you bends light and you can\u2019t see them). It doesn\u2019t take much to imagine a world\u2026 a reality\u2026 so drastically different than today that one realizes how the world/reality around us at any one point in time is effectively a mirror\u2026 a pure function\u2026 of the perceivers at that given point in time. And it is precisely this that makes reality an illusion because it\u2019s not real: it\u2019s a logical construction of our primitive minds and we simply can\u2019t know anything outside our own thoughts\u2026 meaning objective reality (the reality outside our locked in experience) is elusive\u2026 meaning we live in an illusion because we\u2019re removed from objective reality, and our reality is our mind, and our mind is not all knowing.

This is an example of how our \u201creality\u201d may not be what it seems. Also, check out John Locke\u2019s primary and secondary qualities in An Essay concerning Human Understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "What are you? Think about this for a minute or two. Really, what are you? If the physical world exists, you are not your body. You are not your brain. You, the experience of you, are a mathematical abstraction upon the constituent particles of your brain. You are information, thoughts\u2014nought but. What is the worst possible consequence of cogito ergo sum? That you may be the only thought ever. I have faith that if there is only one thought, it is my own, and you have a similar faith. If there is only one thought, one of us will most surely be right. You are, therefore, right, if you are reading this. So all is not lost. Consider this; if you perform a thousand experiments on your surroundings, testing the physics to the most minute level, observing the LHC in action, measuring redshift, opening bugs, predicting the weather, you will find that all phenomena abide by, or very nearly by the mathematics we use to model them. They show enough consistency to garuntee that your memory of them is consistent to you at any point in time. Even if you are a timeless thought, just an instant of you, you contain the mathematics of the universe, the basic form and function of a beautiful and complex existence far greater than \u201cyou\u201d, in your limited cognitive horizon. In fact, you need math\u2014or things which are mathematically predictable in behavior\u2014to have a thought at all. Even the colors you see have their own maths. Red and blue together produce purple. From the simple elements of your mind, 7.6 billion unique variations on the theme of human life and existence on Earth can easily be abstracted, by rearranging the \u201cdigits\u201d. If you have a brain, all it does is rearrange digits and cache a memory of it. Now consider this? Does the Mandelbrot set require a computer to create it? Does the Mandelbrot set already exist as a mathematical abstraction? Certainly we can never process it fully, and the framework is there whether we use it to create pretty pictures or not. Is your memory, your conscious experience, as a mathematical thing, dependent on the brain to exist? Surely it is dependent on the brain to interact with matter\u2014but the thoughts you never had, like the Mandelbrot set, exist in some capacity. The infinite possible lives of all of us, the paths of particles, the deaths of stars, they all exist as abstract concepts, if not tangible things. Do you really rely on a computer to exist? No. Even if nothing else exists, you, the mathematics of you, are as real as the abstraction of your brain\u2019s activity. So what of the rest of the world? If a structure behaves, to the finest detail, as a rock, and interacts with things that behave like people\u2014who may observe it\u2014is it a rock? It is close enough. It may indeed be a rock. The mathematics for \u201crock\u201d, like the Mandelbrot set, exist as a concept whether you like it or not. The world exists in some form. It doesn\u2019t matter if it exists \u201cphysically\u201d. I think therefore all is. ",
