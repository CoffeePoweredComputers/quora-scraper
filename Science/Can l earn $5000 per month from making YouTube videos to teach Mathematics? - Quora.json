            "answer_text": "As a Youtuber and a mathematician, allow me to give you some insights.  I was an avid gamer of a video game called Bloons Tower Defense back in my high school years. I was older than most of its players, so you could say I had a leg up on maturity/intelligence.  In my peak of making videos, I earned roughly $50/month for maybe weekly videos with  1000 views a piece.  I had a few hits that kept generating revenue. A few over 100,000 views, etc.  There was a few million people I could market to, and I feel like I got enough to keep it a habit.   Now compare this to math. Is there a market for it?  Well, depends on the math. You want to target self taught mathematicians. Usually that's around the college linear algebra/differential equations kind of math. So I'd start with that.  How big is this target? Id say large. Many people need these tools, not bad.  How are you going to make yourself different?  Although you have a huge target, you're splitting it with Khan, MIT, etc.  It's free so no doubt you'll get views. However, you're an unreliable instructor. To start, you'd need an endorsement or some credibility. Perhaps start the project with another well known person?   How many views is 5000$/month?  Judging from my numbers and changes to YouTube, I think you'd need tens of thousands of views on every video. Also, you'd need to do more than just one unit. You should set a very large goal for yourself with lots of little check points so that you don't ever stall out.  Do you enjoy it? I really enjoyed playing games. I would've done it without the money (and I did for a while). This can't be a \"get rich quick\" scheme. You have to honestly love it.    All in all, my advice? Give it a shot. Shoot for the moon but don't be upset if you land among stars. Get a solid foundation by doing a few minor videos. Brand yourself. Your YouTube channel is a company. Start small, don't expect huge dividends, but if you keep producing quality videos, the money will come.  Cheers  ",

            "answer_text": "Brady Haran, creator of many famous youtube channels, such as numberphile and sixty symbols, said that the advertising income from YouTube is not enough to sustain his projects. Since his videos are basically himself interviewing some professors, which seems to be very low cost, I take that to mean YouTube doesn't pay him enough to live. However, he does get sponsorship from the University of Nottingham among other organisations, and that's how he manages to survive as a youtuber. So, bottom line, if you want to make money as a math youtuber, you will need an external source of income. source: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jvrj7/i_am_brady_haran_behind_various_youtube_channels/cbirder ",

Check out Udemy, Skillshare and many, many more. Since you are teaching Math, check out also tutoring websites. If you are willing to host your owns website I highly recommend also having your own online school - Thinkific is great option if you choose to have your own school. Once you have course up, use your Youtube video to drive sales of paid courses. ",
