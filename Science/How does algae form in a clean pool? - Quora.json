            "answer_text": "\u201cHow does algae form in a clean pool\" \u2018Clean\u2019 is by definition, wildly variable in swimming pool terms. Just because the water appears crystal clear with no debris visible, does not mean it is \u2018Clean\u2019 as in safe to swim in. As a general guide, pool water should be clear and transparent, even if debris is present, It should have a pH between 7.2 and 7.6 and Maintain a free chlorine level above 1 part per million, and a total chlorine level ( given the 1 ppm baseline ) of not more than 1.1 ppm. ( Combined chlorine level ) If the free available chlorine was at 2 ppm the combined chlorine should not exceed 2.2 ppm and so on\u2026.. That extra 10% difference between the Free available chlorine and the total chlorine is the \u2018Waste component\u2018 or used chlorine that has already been converted to \u2018spent\u2019 chlorine. This is the component that actually smells like chlorine in an enclosed high use facility such as a public pool. If algae is growing in a perfectly visually clear and clean swimming pool you should look at the following reasons\u2026.. Algae is a basic plant. Whatever makes ideal growing conditions for any plant also applies to a primitive, and highly successful plant like algae. They are about as simple,and successful as a plant can get. As a rough guide, I always look for the following issues, and not necessarily in this order\u2026\u2026. Lack of chlorine, below 1 ppm, although Algae can and will tolerate higher levels under certain conditions. Chlorine is a simple oxidizer. It chemically \u2018burns\u2019 the algae and spores to kill them off\u2026. Lack of a growth regarding agent. 0.1 ppm of available copper in a swimming pool will be a deterrent to algae. It is toxic to them and they won't thrive. See \u2018Copper nails in tree trunk' for terrestrial plants\u2026. pH. Algae likes basic conditions, and most natural bodies of water will naturally be more basic than acidic due to dissolved naturally occurring compounds and the simple exposure to oxygen on there surface. There are of course many exceptions to this generalization. Chlorine being slowly added to a swimming pool will naturally raise in pH as it is a very base compound. Maintaining Pool pH at below approximately 7.5 will naturally retard algal growth compared with 8.0 and above. Chlorine is also much more effective sanitizer at pH of 7.5 than 8.0. Nutrients. Testing the pool water for levels of Phosphates, Nitrates and a myriad other compounds can be a useful guide. It's a plant. It will thrive if there is a useful source of food around. Low nutrient levels equals slow growth. Moving water. Algae will generally grow 1st in a pool in the areas of lowest water movement. Firstly, the chlorinated pH neutral water isn't getting to the \u2018dead\u2019 or stagnant areas of the pool. The chlorine is mostly \u2018spent\u2019 and ineffective by the time it gets to the stillest areas of a pool. Secondly, the mechanical action of the water moving actually scrubs the algae off the pool surfaces before they take hold. Ever notice that terrestrial plants in harsh ( windswept ) locations are often stunted and not as healthy or lush as there same counterparts in more protected areas ? Same applies. Water temperature and Sunlight. Green algae photosynthesise in the same way as terrestrial plants. Algae will generally grow most virulently in ideal sunlight conditions. Growth will be highest in sunny and warmer locations. If the pool has a \u2018blackout' cover with no sunlight wavelengths light hitting the algal spores they generally won't thrive. Same as terrestrial plants. The warmer the water, to a certain level, say around 30 degrees Celsius, the more accelerated the growth will be. Once again, this is highly variable depending on the algae species. Subtropical to tropical rainforest, in areas of high warmth and high sunlight, all year round are an ideal example. Here in my location, It is pretty frequent to have a perfectly clean and clear operational pool go from clean and clear \u2018Safe\u2019 to guacamole in the space of 48 hours. It just takes Ideal conditions such as low to non existent chlorine levels, High pH, warm, still water, High concentrations of nutrients and the presence of a large amount of algae spores ( even airborne on the wind or bird droppings ) I have actually watched pools turn green, if even very gradually, before my eyes under ideal circumstances. Algaes are one of the oldest and most adept organisms on our planet and they have very simple requirements to survive and thrive. Hope this helps. Cheers Darren ",

            "answer_text": "while a swimming pool makes a very inviting growth medium for algae a \u201cclean\u201d pool with a well balanced chemistry will (should?) never allow algae to grow. That\u2019s the whole point of keeping things balanced. Btw: algae spores are airborne and pretty much rain into your pool all day long. They also hitch rides on any vegetation that finds it to way to not your pool. ",
