            "answer_text": "About the same as a sword with two sharp edges. Science has brought about technology, and as a result we live in a society with many luxuries that couldn\u2019t have been dreamed of 100 years ago. We now no longer need to slave away on a farm, or have women die during childbirth for the most part. We can travel from one end of the earth to the other in short periods of time - much faster than what was traditionally possible by horse or weasel (weasels are useless at pulling sleds!), and we have more time to do the things that we want to do. Now, we have nice jobs, in nice places, with nice computer assisted/robotic assisted tasks to do, clean water, tasty food to eat and shoes that have been designed to exactly fit your foot. But\u2026there\u2019s some drawbacks. With all this extra technology, we have forgotten how to communicate with each other, social interaction skills are largely missing or incomplete in society. Large portions of the population would rather just throw an E-mail or a text message at someone else and expect that they\u2019ve read and understood it. The transition from farms to desks have brought about an unnatural level of posture related issues, eye-sight problems, radiation levels, as well as exposure to synthetic materials that \u2018bass-off\u2019 and slowly kill us via the \u2018slow-kill\u2019 process. Our food is largely tasty and pleasing to the eye, however it\u2019s generally always been sprayed heavily with pesticides just to keep the bugs off, and everything in this life is done purely for a profit. The children of this world are now consumed by little gadgets and \u2018screen time\u2019, they find it almost like a drug (as to even some adults). Can people remember what they used to do when they were on a train or a bus even 20 years ago? Patience is diminishing as we are all getting used to the \u201cI want it now\u201d syndrome that science has made possible, by making things so available in all aspects of life - things that become too easy are taken for granted. People become vain, self-centred, time-wasters, back-biters and vengeful, Science has created a divide between what has been used for good, and that which has been used for not-so-good. Sorry, I think my intentions were good about writing a really concise answer to this question, however I have been distracted by numerous computer related issues. I hope the point still got across though. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology are the drivers behind things like health care, even equal rights and social justice. In medicine itself, science has enabled us to: Treat disease through immunization. At its peak, polio claimed the lives of almost half a million people. The lives of people infected were terrible - it causes paralysis (or the inability to move). Polio is almost eradicated now through global efforts for vaccination. Wiping Out Polio: How The U.S. Snuffed Out A KillerAntibiotics. Things like a urinary tract infection, or lung infection, or even tonsil infection may seem like minor issues but in the past, these were major problems that killed many people. Antibiotics were developed through research, and even have gotten us to the point where we consider HIV, which used to be deadly, a chronic illness.Surgery. The first suturing techniques (stitches) were first perfected in the 1900\u2019s which allowed us to remove organs that were dtysfunctioning, and tie up blood vessels that were leaking, and even attach new limbs, organs, or blood vessels to improve people\u2019s lives. Surgery involves a lot of new technology and there are even robotic approaches being developed.Structures of care. Although the electronic health record isn\u2019t perfect, it allows us to see patient\u2019s past histories easily and their lab values. We used to have to go to medical records and get a stack of patient charts, but now we can click through health information easily.There are important next steps however, with technology. This includes. Personalization of data. Even though we can say in a population 3/10 might have a heart attack, it doesn\u2019t do you much good to know that you might have a chance of a heart attack. We are moving towards new ways to analyze data and understand disease that can tell you with much more precision if you are at risk of disease.Improvement in systems of care. New technologies like blockchain have promise for ensuring data is easily accessed, stored, and reducing redundancy in health systems. This has important implications for patient\u2019s own data as well as drug delivery.There\u2019s a lot of other ways but technology and improvements in technology have enabled us to live much longer lives than those in developing countries (70\u201380 years vs. 50) and there are many more important things to come!
