            "answer_text": "Oh yes, just not in the way you are probably thinking. Mythbusters was, and as far as I\u2019m aware still is, frequently used by teachers in schools and educational projects to teach science. A lot of kids ended up studying science due to the show; I seem to recall Adam Savage for one mentioning running into adults who are now scientists thanking him for inspiring them to study science. A number of their experiments confirmed hypothesis scientists themselves had never tested. Bullet Drop, that a bullet fired parallel to the ground would hit the ground at the same time as a bullet dropped had never been tested. For one of the \u2018\u2019Bullet proof\u2019 episodes Jamie came up with the idea of crushing up soda cans and embedding them in tile grouting to make a bullet proof material. It turns out that what he created not only was bullet proof but was just as good, if not better, than what the US Army was using to armor some of its vehicles against small arms. While also being a lot cheaper and lighter. Last I heard he was still working on developing it for the US Military. These are the examples I can think of off my head. Now the show WAS entertainment, and all ideas had to pass the \u2018will it be interesting on TV?\u2019 test. But while messing around they got to do science full scientists wouldn\u2019t have been able to\u2026and help create a new generation of scientists too. ",

            "answer_text": "Mythbusters was a very entertaining show, I enjoyed it a lot. But what they were doing was not actually \u201cscience,\u201d per se. Rather, it was a popular presentation of science, directed to an audience that was composed of intelligent people who were not, themselves, scientists. Most actual science is pretty boring to watch. Mythbusters took the results of the long, slow, tedious process of science and made them fun to watch. ",
