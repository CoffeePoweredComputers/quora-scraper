            "answer_text": "No, No, and No. Edison invented the first bulb. Where I grew up had Wabash, Indiana, the first electrically lighted city in the World. They had mounted huge electrical arcs in the top, the bell tower on top of the court house, with the generator in the basement. The arcs were over 9 inches in length and an inch in diameter. The court house is on a bluff overlooking the town which descends into the Wabash river valley. According to a newspaper account of the time, a newspaper was readable from that single light 10 miles out of town. That was 1887 or 8, as I remember. There is (or was at least) a display including a sample of the arcs in the Central Hall of the Court House. If you are interested, it might be worth the detour. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, let's get a grip on some facts, here! The Global Industrial Revolution was well on its way to forging, full-steam-ahead (puns intended) by the mid 1800s. Many, many inventors and scientists were breaking new ground in many very important fields of study including medicine, mechanical engineering, construction, and electricity. One of those inventors was an Italian, named Alessandro Volta. As early as 1800, he was the First to have used a very thin wire element to glow when voltage was applied to it. Other developments proceeded in the creation of better materials, in the development of batteries, and in the design of new types of electrical generators. Thomas Edison only furthered the development of an existing invention to be a money making product. He did this by patenting his particular design and creating a Company that would manufactured it. Thomas Edison never invented anything new, he just figured out a way to make a profit on devices and inventions already in existence. See Link: Who Invented the Light Bulb? ",
