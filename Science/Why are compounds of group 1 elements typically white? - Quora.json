            "answer_text": "In colored ionic compounds, the colors are coming from the ions. The reason why compounds made from Group 1 elements generally don\u2019t have any particular colors is because Group 1 ions are colorless, and the ions they generally get paired up with, the Group 17 elements, are also colorless. In ions, color comes about in two different ways: either in d-d transitions in ions of the transition metals, or charge-transfer transitions in polyatomic ions. Thus, the only way for an ionic compound with a Group 1 element to have a color is to be bound to a polyatomic anion that has a color. This does happen; for instance, sodium permanganate ([math]\\text{Na}\\text{MnO}_4[/math]) has a distinctive purple color, which comes from the permanganate ion.  An image of sodium permanganate. Transition metal ion colors The colors in some transition metal ions comes from the fact that transition metals have partially filled d-sublevels. An transition metal usually has degenerate d-orbitals, which means that all its d-orbitals have the same energy. However, when the ion complexes with other ions or molecules, this can change, making some d-orbitals higher in energy than others, as shown below.  The energy between the two d-orbital energies happens to be just enough energy to absorb photons with frequencies of visible light; the electrons in the lower energy d-orbitals become excited by these photons into the higher energy d-orbitals (A \u201cd-d transition\u201d). Thus, transition metal ions sometimes exhibit colors, like the greenish blue of [math]\\text{Cu}^{2+}[/math]. Colored polyatomic ions In these polyatomic ions, electrons absorb photons to migrate from the atoms attached to the central metal atom into the latter\u2019s d-orbitals. The photons required to excite these electrons happen to have frequencies in the visible spectrum, leading to polyatomic ions to have strong colors, such as like permanganate\u2019s ([math]\\text{MnO}_4^{-}[/math]) strong purple color.
