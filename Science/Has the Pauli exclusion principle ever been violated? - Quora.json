            "answer_text": "Yes: in Neutron stars. The gravitational collapse of white dwarf stars is resisted by the electron degeneracy pressure i.e. the matter in these stars is so dense that if it were to be compressed any further the electrons would need to occupy the same set of quantum numbers thus violating Pauli\u2019s principle. The tendency of nature to avoid such a situation results in a kind of pressure exerted against forces that try and push the electrons into the same orbitals. When the mass of such a star is increased further (for example if it accretes matter from its companion star in a binary system) then it can reach the Chandrasekhar limit where it experiences so much gravitational attraction that it collapses further causing a type Ia supernova and a neutron star remnant. In the neutron star, gravitational collapse has proceeded to the point that not only were electrons forced into the same set of quantum numbers: the electrons were forced into the the nuclei and captured by the protons, thus creating neutrons. Then, with essentially all of the star\u2019s matter converted to neutrons, the neutrons were compressed until they were themselves at a point where further collapse would cause them to occupy the same sets of quantum numbers. Then neutron degeneracy pressure kicks in to stabilize the star. If further mass increase via accretion occurs, the Pauli principle can be broken for the neutrons too and the result will be an unstoppable collapse that results in a black hole. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is not known well. But \u201ceverything gets collapsed if Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle is violated\u201d Everyone knows that according to Pauli no two electrons can share the same quantum state. If electrons share the same quantum state, then all the electrons would occupy same quantum state. As a result there won\u2019t be any valance electrons to make bond with other atoms and hence no molecule formation at all. We can guess the consequence of this result, if there is no molecule formation\u2026\u2026..Everything gets collapsed. Thus, The existence of molecules itself says that Pauli\u2019s principle can\u2019t be violated ",
