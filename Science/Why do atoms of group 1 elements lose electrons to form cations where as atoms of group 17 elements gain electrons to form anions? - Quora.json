            "answer_text": "By doing so, both end up having a noble gas configuration, with 8 valence electrons (known as an octet). They do this to become chemically stable. They become stable as they have filled their outer shell of electrons. Atoms of groups 1 elements have only 1 electron in their outer shells, which means to stabilize themselves it is easier for them to give this atom away, rather than trying to gain 7 more. Once they have given the electron away there are more protons than electrons in the atom and so the atom become positively charged: a cation. The reverse of this applies for group 17 - it is easier for them to gain electrons, thus becoming negatively charged and an anion. ",
