            "answer_text": "Wavelength isn\u2019t important for absorption. The energy is what matters, and that the wave packet of each photon is large enough to overlap with the atom at some instant in time. Suppose you have laser light at, say, 600nm wavelength. It\u2019s best described as a continuous plane wave, but realistically, and especially if it\u2019s a cheap laser, the light has a finite coherence length, which is to say, the waves aren\u2019t perfectly regular but the photons making up the light might be said to have some finite \u2018size\u2019. This could be several inches or meters. If we try to turn the laser on and off real fast, or gate the beam somehow, we can\u2019t make a light pulse any shorter than a few wavelengths, that is, a few microns. Attempts to make it any smaller, by diddling with the pulse on a time scale of femtoseconds, make pulses best described as containing a wide range of energies or wavelengths, according to Fourier theory. And still, that pulse will likely be way larger than an atom. An atom absorbing a photon seems as sensible as a cheetah eating a whale. Hard to picture in one\u2019s mind. The electrons have sharply defined energy levels. The hop up from a lower level to a higher level when an external electric field vibrates at a frequency corresponding to the difference in energy levels. If it\u2019s not an exact match, the probability of absorption goes down, less likely as the mismatch increases. The fact that the electron\u2019s former energy level has come to an end, and that its new level has come into being, and that the photons have existed only a finite time over a finite distance from the laser, all mean that Heisenberg allows a little mismatch. The quantum mechanical details are covered well in almost every college level QM textbook. Point it, energy is what determines if a photon has a chance of being absorbed, or just fly by without being affected. When the absorption does occur, the wave-function for that photon, its contribution to the total electromagnetic field around the atom, vanishes. It\u2019s as if a cheetah bites a whale and the whole whale disappears. This is the famous \u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d which quantum physicists have never really come up with a good explanation of. Sadly, no one has yet come up with a good, satisfying explanation of what\u2019s really going on, other than to just say: that\u2019s how reality is. Attempts such as de Broglie\u2019s Theory of the Double Solution, or its later watered-down form as Pilot Wave Theory, and the related ideas from Bohm, have philosophical difficulties and can\u2019t deal with more complex situations. Abstract quantum logic does a fine job describing quantum states, quanta, and so on in an abstract mathematical way, but often doesn\u2019t provide any conclusions satisfying to our minds. Many Worlds just seems silly, a matter of blowing words around, without any math or picture of what happens. There are other ways to interpret things, but all fall apart after too much thought, and all have critics. Some very abstract ways of looking at quantum theory, such as David Finkelstein\u2019s quantum relativity logic or \u201cSpace Time Code\u201d do away with space, making it a derived concept. Those are the approaches to physics and philosophy I prefer. If \u201cspace\u201d isn\u2019t such a fundamental concept, but derived from sequences of sub-quantum operations, then maybe we can\u2019t truly ask embarrassing questions about light waves being larger than atoms :) ",
