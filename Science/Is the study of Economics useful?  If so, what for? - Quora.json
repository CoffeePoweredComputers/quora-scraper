            "answer_text": "I studied Economics, Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. I truly believe, it has helped me with the fiscal management of myself and family. One good example is on investing. Many financial pundits recommends that you increase your bond holdings as you grow older to protect your investments. I believe that\u2019s the most foolish recommendation during a period of the longest economic expansion our country is now enjoying. Just observing the fact that our country\u2019s economy is growing at around 2% every year is healthy (microeconomics); it\u2019s a bit inflationary, but that proves our economy continues to grow. We are now in a global economy environment (macroeconomics). That means competition is working at its best to assure consumers with price and quality. The biggest issue concerning most consumers is the fear of recession or depression. That fear is misplaced, because nobody is capable of predicting them. Economics is not science. There are no tools to predict recessions; they are always declared after they happen, not before. From my POV, our economy is chugging along as well as anyone could wish. There is no way to predict a coronavirus (or any natural disaster) that will impact the economy. Worrying about them is a waste of time. The strength of human nature that works towards improving our lives is the best we have. ",
