            "answer_text": "Difficult problems requires a systematic approach while \u201ceasy\u201d ones typically do not. If you apply the same levels of reasoning to more intuitive problems, you will be surprised at the number of different approaches you will find, some of which will e quite simple in retrospect. For example, why do you need a common denominator when adding fractions? The answer should not be, \u201cMt third grade teacher told me so.\u201d Sometimes, obvious answers make reason unnecessary, or at least that is the assumption. This leads to why do I have to show my work. The reason for showing your work lies in the more difficult applications later on. If I give you three apples and 4 oranges, what do you have? Answer: three apples and 4 oranges Basic Law of addition: You cannot add apples and oranges. If I give you three apples and 4 apples, what do you have? Answer: seven apples Basic Law of addition: If you add apples and apples, you get apples. If I give you three apples and 4 oranges, what do you have? Answer: 7 pieces of fruit because fruit is the common denominator between apples and oranges. Your question illustrates the differences between philosophy and laziness. Of course, some view the search for efficiency as being lazy when, in all honesty, almost everyone including mathematicians seek after the most efficient way to do things. Given a difficult way to do a problem and an easy one, which would you choose? And along with this, jumping at an answer without any real basis is hardly acceptable. This may not answer your question at the level you would like. ",

            "answer_text": "Initially I would say it\u2019s because you have a predisposition to thinking things are difficult. Simple concepts are being over complicated and therefore seem more difficult than they should be. It's a common thing in accademics. I went into signal processing and then in my senior year tried to help someone who was just starting out and I could not for the life of me remember some of the basic equations. After a while I figured it out but I was over complicating the simple questions with the higher level knowledge I had gone through in my upper division courses. \u201cpractice makes perfect, but nobody is perfect therefore pactice simply makes you better than you were before\u201d ",
