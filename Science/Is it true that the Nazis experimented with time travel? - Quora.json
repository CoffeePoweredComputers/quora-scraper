            "answer_text": "After the war turned against Nazi Germany, Hitler talked of \"wonder weapons\" that would turn the tide.  Several of these did appear - jet aircraft, drone aircraft (V1s) and long-range rockets (V2s).   Full details of all these were handed over after the war. There is no solid indication of anything else.  There was an atomic program, but it looked just to power production.  They intentionally avoided mentioning nuclear weapons to Hitler, thinking that these could not possibly be produced in time to influence the war.  (And it is indeed unlikely that Germany had the resources to have managed it.) But because of earlier secrecy, it became a rich field for fiction and fantasy after the war.   A convenient set of villains for thriller movies.  The reality seems to have been that surviving Nazis had few ambitions beyond survival, and traded what useful secrets they had to either East or West. ",

However, no such device, nor the plans or blueprints to build such an object were ever found making this likely to be more of a \u201cwonder weapon\u201d rumor and nothing more.
