            "answer_text": "The answer to this question, has changed significantly over time. I am dating myself here, but when I went to university this is precisely what many physicists thought would happen. The consensus was we were either in a closed universe, or a precisely open universe, and most were still betting on the closed universe. In a closed universe, eventually the expansions stops and reverses itself. In the same time period it took the universe to reach maximum expansion, it collapses back down into a singularity again. That means everything is pushed together. Eventually, you can\u2019t step out your door without tripping over a black hole. So all the black holes merge, and everything is swallowed by a black hole. But it doesn\u2019t really matter in that model, because the entire universe would have already been a giant black hole we were trapped inside of. Now, since most physicists thought we were either in a closed universe or a precisely open universe, astronomers decided to measure precisely how rapidly the expansion of the universe was slowing down. To there surprise, they found what nobody had expected. The expansion was speeding up. So no big crunch, no merging everything into a black hole. The only way to get swallowed by a black hole is to have the misfortune to come too close to a black hole. A black hole with the mass of the Earth would have a diameter slightly under 2 cm. Which means even if you were to pass such a black hole at the radius of the Earth you would be thousands of miles away from being in any danger. The moon would never fall into such a black hole. In fact it would continue to drift away from it. Of course, we don\u2019t know of any black holes of such a low mass. But for stellar mass black holes it is equally absurd. The orbit of all the planets would remain precisely the same if we replaced our sun with an equal mass black hole. The biggest difference would be comets that break up from the heat and crash into the sun, would follow an smooth orbit back out of the inner solar system without crashing into anything. Given the chaotic nature of the stars orbits around the galaxy. Given enough time you might think eventually all the stars, or whatever remains of them will end-up crashing into the super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. And indeed, that will happen to some. But most would actually more likely to escape the galaxy altogether than ever crashing into the super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. And even more likely, the remains will essentially decay away still in orbit around the galactic centre. ",

            "answer_text": "Allow me to offer a silly analogy. Imagine the following: You dig a giant cavity underground. A cave big enough to contain all the tennis balls in the world. You connect that cavity to the surface, say, in the middle of a tennis court, with a tiny hole. A hole just big enough to swallow a tennis ball. And now you make a misleading but technically correct statement: \u201cI dug a hole big enough to consume all the tennis balls in the world!\u201d And the press takes your statement and hypes it further: \u201cTennis balls doomed! Giant cave soon to swallow all tennis balls in the world!\u201d But wait. The actual hole in the ground that the tennis ball must find and enter is tiny, just a few inches across. In fact, people could continue playing tennis in that very tennis court for years, only occasionally losing a ball. And even if every ball swallowed by the hole erodes away its walls a little, making the hole slightly wider, it will still take a very long time for it to swallow more balls. And of course most tennis balls in the world will never even come close to this tennis court. So they will never be swallowed. This is how black holes work. Sure, they have the capacity to swallow things and grow. Their \u201cinsides\u201d are technically limitless. But they are geometrically quite small. For something to be swallowed by a black hole, it first has to find that black hole. Never mind doing so at random, it would be difficult even for precision-navigated spacecraft to actually hit a target so tiny and be swallowed by it. So no, the universe is no more supposed to be consumed by black holes than tennis balls are supposed to be swallowed by a tiny hole in the ground, no matter how big the cavity is underneath.
