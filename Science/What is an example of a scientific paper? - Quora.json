These journals are either run by various scientific societies (e.g. Science is run by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), PNAS is published by the US National Academy of Sciences etc), or by various either non-profit or for-profit enterprises e.g. Nature, published by the Nature Publishing Group, and PLoS Biology, which is published by the nonprofit Public Library of Science group.  Different journals have different amounts of prestige attached to them, based on their publication history, breadth of readership, and diversity of fields that publish in it. Typically, Nature, Cell and Science are considered the top biological journals, with Cell being more specialized in Biology while the others publish from all scientific fields (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering etc.) ",
