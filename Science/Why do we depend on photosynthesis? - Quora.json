            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is essentially the basis of all life. Plants use photosynthesis to produce sugars that they can consume and store. Now it may seem like \u201cwell, plants need it, but I don\u2019t, right?\u201d But if we look at the food chains of all animals, they all start with a creature or plant that uses photosynthesis to produce food. Therefore, humans need photosynthesis to not only consume plants, but to also eat meats like beef and pork because those meats come from creatures that eat other creatures that eat plants. ",
