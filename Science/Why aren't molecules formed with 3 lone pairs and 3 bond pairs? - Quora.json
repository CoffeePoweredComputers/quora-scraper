            "answer_text": "Well, a molecule can surely be formed with 3 lone pairs and 3 bond pairs. But\u2026there could not be 3 lone pairs + 3 bond pairs on the Central Atom of molecule (at same time). Reason being, according to VSEPR Theory and noble gases configuration\u2026the Valence Shell cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons \u2026or\u2026 There could not be more than 8 electron in Lewis dot structure of an Atom in a Molecule. In the given condition: 3 lone pairs + 3 bond pairs As we know, a lone pair consist of 2 electrons of same atom & a bond pair consist of 2 electrons (one of each atom) So, total no. of electrons on Central Atom = 3 (lone pairs) x 2 + 3 (bond pairs) x 1 = 6 + 3 = 9 electrons in Valence Shell Which is Not possible or Invalid. Therefore, Molecules cannot be formed with 3 lone pairs + 3 bond pairs on Central Atom. Hope that helps Thanks ",
