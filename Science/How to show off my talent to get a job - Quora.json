            "answer_text": "No matter how modest it is,  you will have to make a start. Considering your talent, i would have suggested you to do something of your own. These qualities can make a great entrepreneur but given your preference for job, startups would be the best bet. f6s.com - #1 for startup founder deals, accelerators & funding has some good startup job opportunities. Amit Mishra can help you with that :) Startups might not offer you the best salaries in the beginning but the growth will be terrific. With talented pool of people, your skills would get groomed up and less number of people and hierarchy, your talent would get noticed and would reward your career in a significant manner. ",

You may find enough intellectual stimulation in newly setup companies or as other answers alluded to - starting your own gig. If you do end up working for a company - choose a role that changes constantly and throws new challenges at you - so that you feel engaged for long haul. Take an inventor of your top 3 talents and check them against the job description when applying. It will make it easier in interview as well whe your natural flair comes to play. Good luck.
