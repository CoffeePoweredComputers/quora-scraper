            "answer_text": "Before starting to actually answer your question, Let's put it in a illustration, your question reminds me of a famous quote i.e. \u201cChild is in the armpit, chaos in the city\u201d. People here has mentioned about many amazing tech invention, no doubt but they have forgot the very best unconventional platform on which they are writing their views. Yes, I am talking about none other than Quora. To be honest after it's launch in 2008, my respect for Adam D'Angelo & Charlie Cheever( Founders of Quora) has gone way higher than anyone else. Being an engineer at Facebook till 2008, Adam & Charlie decided to start their own venture which in near future may stand equal to their boss. I know after making such statments many will contradict me saying that they are way below the Social Network Giants. Agreed, they are behind Facebook and LinkedIn but they are the turtles of social networks. They are gonna slowly and gradually increase their phase and will bypass the existing ruler. Why do I think it is possible? Because the overall idea behind ths platform is way matured than any other tech platform in the history. You can ask whatsoever shit you want to without even giving it a thought. Man, Thats Amazing! Can you believe it, how powerful its potential is? People haven't understood the true essence of Quora. Secondly, it has been successful in crossing 200 million active user but the race is still long away to go but when that happens mark my words, Quora will beat the shit out of each and every social network. But my only concern with Quora is Quora Ads; they have started Advertising much earlier than expected. They should have wait, atleast till they reach half a billion because people started understanding it's importance and have been aggressively active on it since this year but it would be great if it not ends like Orkut.
