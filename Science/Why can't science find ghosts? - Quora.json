            "answer_text": "The most likely explanation is that ghosts don\u2019t exist. Many attributes associated with ghosts directly conflict with the observed laws of the universe, people who talk about the supernatural tend to use lots of big words and scientific terminology incorrectly, and evidence that should be there if they did exist isn\u2019t there. If ghosts interact with reality, there should be some sign of them, even if the ghost itself is not detectable. Science observes non-visible, hard-to-detect phenomena all the time through energy output and interactions with nearby matter. Ghosts should operate in a similar manner, but there\u2019s no evidence left behind at all. While people may claim science can\u2019t find ghosts because we don\u2019t have the technology, there\u2019s almost always an alternate explanation for \u201cparanormal activity\u201d, and the people claiming to have evidence of ghosts on camera or audio or cold spots or whatever have not been able to prove any of those things are caused by ghosts, nor can their results be replicated. Also, personal experience doesn\u2019t count as evidence. We can\u2019t verify personal experiences, and thus they aren\u2019t trustworthy. Even if a million people claimed they saw a giant teapot descend from the sky on the backs of winged possums, it still wouldn\u2019t be evidence unless they could back it up. We\u2019re already very aware that human senses are prone to malfunction, our memories aren\u2019t good, and people will say pretty much anything to fit in and gain recognition. Multiple anecdotes does not data make. And finally, quantum mechanics says nothing about consciousness or the soul. Anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they\u2019re talking about. With all this information (or lack thereof), it seems science can\u2019t find ghosts because they don\u2019t exist. ",

            "answer_text": "One perfectly obvious answer is that they don\u2019t look for them. I\u2019m not saying they would find them if they did, but obviously the first step is to look. If a place has a reputation for being haunted, it would be theoretically possible to wait there until the ghost arrives, and then photograph it. Now, of course, some obvious problems arise, even if ghosts do exist. There would be no guarantee that the ghost would show up when you want it, and no guarantee that it would show up on film or digital devices, because it might be a simple psychic phenomenon. Also, the better class of psychic researchers do perform certain tests such as recording sounds, temperature, and vibrations during alleged hauntings. But then you come up against another obstacle: peer reviewed scientific journals would refuse to accept such a paper. Somewhere along the line, \u201cscience\u201d decided that ghosts don\u2019t exist, and therefore there is no need to investigate them. ",
