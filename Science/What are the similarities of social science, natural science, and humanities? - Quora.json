            "answer_text": "According to Kuhn, the common practice in the natural sciences is puzzle-solving, or the articulation of a specific guiding paradigm. This paradigm is a way of looking to the world, a habit of mind, shared by a scientific community, thus tying it together. Shared habits of mind are the only essential constitutions tying together a scientific community : without shared habits of mind effective scientific communication becomes impossible. Science evolves gradually by the process of puzzle-solving, until some unexpected outcomes occur. Once the existence of an anomaly is accepted, normal science turns into crisis. When the crisis has been overcome by a new paradigm, a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals takes place. Revolutions can thus be viewed as changes of world view. Kuhn states that his theory can only be applied to \"mature\" science, a science which possesses a generally accepted paradigm. Since in the social sciences more than one paradigm exists, application of Kuhn's theory to these fields of inquiry seems problematic. \"Normal social science\" cannot be identified within the global process of scientific development, only within the context of one of the competing \"paradigms\". \"Revolutions\" do occur here, but they do not necessarily lead to the abandonment of an older \"paradigm\". As in social science, in art history more than one \"paradigm\" can be identified at one moment. As in the social sciences, artistic development can only be identified within the context of one of the existing \"paradigms\". This does not necessarily mean that these \"paradigms\" are competing. Moreover, a controversy between supporters of a new and an old \"paradigm\" often only means the acceptance of the new tradition rather than the end of the old; on the whole, older paradigms are kept alive. Kuhn's theory does make sense in the three branches of human knowledge investigated, but in a differing way. The natural sciences work with one predominant paradigm, whereas in social science and art more than one \"paradigm\" can exist at the same time. A \"revolution\" has a different effect : in the natural sciences, it leads to the abandonment of the older paradigm; in the social sciences, this abandonment can occur but not always does, and in art this abandonment does not occur. According to the sociologist Barnes, science is a constructivist human activity. Science tries to represent reality by constructing metaphors, but in conjunction with certain socially and historically established conventions. According to Barnes, ideas should be viewed as instrumental tools with which social groups try to achieve their purposes in particular situations. A scientist creates a metaphor concerning the surrounding world, starting from initial knowledge, and guided by overt and covert interests. The overt interests are concerned with prediction, manipulation and control; the covert interests deal with rationalisation and persuasion, but are not identical to ideology. Since individuals are embedded in specific social institutions, those should be kept in mind when trying to understand what scientists meant by what they actually said. Scientific development takes place within social institutions, for the greater part universities. A natural scientist studies the standard textbooks used in his discipline, thus learning the predominant paradigm. Although there are different textbooks available, the contents will be nearly the same. This does not apply to the social sciences. The books used by the tutor will depend on the paradigm he subscribes. Recruitment will take place by teaching the new members the appropriate methods and examples. \"General\" textbooks do however exist, as in economics, but they subscribe the \"mainstream\" paradigm. The existence of alternative paradigms is shown by the existence of alternative textbooks. For art, the institutions are generally described as the art world : a network of people whose co-operative activity, organised via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produces the kind of art works that the art world is noted for. As far as recruitment is concerned : an artist can only present himself as an artist if his claim is institutionalised. This means that the artist places himself within an already existing artistic context (by exposing or performing his work). This context is controlled not by him, but by `significant others' (the colleague, the maecenas, the academy, the salon,...). Thus the artist is recruited in a tradition, similar to those of scientists. Natural sciences, social sciences and art and aesthetics have a common point of departure: the existing institutions that guide further development of social metaphors. These institutions are socially mediated human activities. They are guided by two kinds of interests, and they start by the metaphors used in the past. ",

            "answer_text": "I would firstly and grossly mix social sciences with humanities. Then I'd say that those are not experimental as it could be in a laboratory where scientists (let's say physicians, biologists etc) apply an accurate protocol to confirm/infirm one hypothesis (e.g. you try an experiment, if changing that parameter/factor would give expected result). That said, natural sciences are very wide and a continuum between experimental/non experimental sciences, ranging from molecular biology, pharmatical sciences, geology and Earth sciences to ecology. The most significant similarities I could underline are represented by the use of mathematics and standards when publishing : uni-, bi- and multivariate statistics as well as informatics, machine learning represent the transverse tools (and sciences/disciplines!!) that are used in social and natural sciences.
