            "answer_text": "These links imply all the time. wave interference takes place whenever two waves of any frequency, same, nearly the same or widely different interact. An air molecule next to your ear, for example, can only respond to the sum of all the different sound waves reaching it at any moment. Does wave interference happen only to same frequency waves? Actually, the interference between two waves, as they pass through each other, happens regardless of their frequencies: the signal at any point in space and time will be equal to the sum of the signals from the two waves.Why radio waves from radio-stations don't interfere with each other?
