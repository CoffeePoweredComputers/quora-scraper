            "answer_text": "I hold in my hands a book, written about ten years ago, by one of the living giants of physical cosmology: It\u2019s simply titled Cosmology, by Steven Weinberg. It is a very comprehensive book, a thorough review of modern cosmology, still very much up-to-date, as at the time of its publication (2008) it already benefited from some of the latest results, such as the confirmation of the predicted angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background by the WMAP satellite. Here is what you don\u2019t find in this book: Any mention of the \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d. You see, despite the fact that this phrase has been popularized by a television sitcom that I happen to like, or its theme song by the Barenaked Ladies that I also happen to like, physicists do not usually talk about the \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d. Nor do they usually talk about (despite what the song says) how it \u201call started\u201d. Because, while that would certainly be a worthy secret to uncover, that is not what physical cosmology is about. So what do they talk about, then? Well, let me give you the list of chapters in Weinberg\u2019s aforementioned book: The Expansion of the UniverseThe Cosmic Microwave Radiation BackgroundThe Early UniverseInflationGeneral Theory of Small FluctuationsEvolution of Cosmological FluctuationsAnisotropies in the Microwave SkyThe Growth of StructureGravitational LensesInflation as the Origin of Cosmological FluctuationsNow you might be wondering, perhaps the \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d is discussed in Chapter 1? Well, let\u2019s see what its main subheadings are: Spacetime geometryThe cosmological redshiftDistances at small redshift: The Hubble constantLuminosity distances and angular diameter distancesDynamics of expansionDistances at large redshifts: Accelerated expansionCosmic expansion or tired light?AgesMassesIntergalactic absorptionNumber countsQuintessenceHorizonsAgain, no \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d. Nothing about how it \u201call started\u201d. Rather, this is a chapter that provides plenty of details about observations, such as redshifts; it provides details about the theory, namely Einstein\u2019s general relativity, which offers a description of spacetime geometry; and it also discusses alternative theories (and why they are not favored) as well as speculative theories (notably quintessence, a term used to describe time-varying vacuum energy due to one or more scalar fields.) So perhaps there is a discussion of a \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d in Chapter 3? Nope: Thermal historyCosmological nucleosynthesisBaryonsynthesis and LeptonsynthesisCold dark matterThis time around, in addition to general relativity, quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics is used to explore the early universe, and the manner in which the building blocks of ordinary matter formed. So, no \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d, no explanation of how it \u201call started\u201d. It is precisely the other way around: Physical cosmology is about observing the cosmos at the present day, and then using our knowledge (earned, in part, through astronomical observations but also through laboratory, e.g., particle physics experiments) to extrapolate backwards in an attempt to understand the history of the universe. Now it is true that under a wide-ranging set of assumptions, general relativity predicts the existence of an \u201cinitial singularity\u201d, aka. the \u201cbeginning of time\u201d. But this is not the theory. This is a specific prediction. And, I hasten to add, a prediction that we do not necessarily take literally, because we know that in the extreme early universe, our knowledge breaks down and our predictions become unreliable. So while it is convenient to talk about the \u201cage of the universe\u201d, measured either in terms of billions of years (at present) or in terms of microseconds or less (in the very early universe), it does not imply that we know for sure that there was a moment of beginning and that it was a past singularity, as general relativity implies. To sum up, the expanding universe paradigm (which the astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle called a \u201cBig Bang\u201d, rather disparagingly, in a 1949 BBC radio show) is the outcome when we apply our two great physical theories \u2014 general relativity, and quantum field theory in the form of the Standard Model of particle physics \u2014 to numerous observations (the existence and detailed features of the microwave background, the number distribution of galaxies, the chemical composition and morphology of early galaxies, the statistical features of large-scale structures in the universe, the abundances of primordial isotopes, just to name a few of the important ones) and extrapolate these observations in the past time direction to explore the history of our physical universe.

            "answer_text": "Was Big Bang really happened? is it true or not? we know that scientist practically try to examine the Big Bang in Large Hadron Collider but there are some logics that are not true or bloody meaningless. And also unable to answer those questions. Now I am going to discuss on it. One day I was reading an article.. what's wrong with big bang.. then I found some logics that can challenge the Big Bang Theory\u2026\u2026.. 1\u2026. Stephen Hawking said that the time and everything were created after the Big Bang so there was no time before bigbang so there was no space as the space and the time are related. So as there was no space where the small point singularity located. Because we know that the smallest particle in the universe is quark the size of quark is 10^-18 metre. So it takes a minimum space to stay. So it is meaningless to say that there was no time and no space before the Big Bang. 2\u2026. We know that Big Bang happened about 13.8 billion years ago in a massive Dense small point. And after the massive explosion happened, the universe was created. So we know that anything in the world in the universe made with atom. So I can say that the particle when the Big Bang happened was made with atoms. So there was electrons and we know electrons have a velocity. So there was the concept of time. So there was space but it breaks The Big Bang Theory. Besides you can say that there were quarks which is the smallest thing in the universe in the time of Big Bang. I will answer that the quarks not only quarks but also everything in the universe vibrate. So as there was vibration there was also time, but It Breaks the law of Big Bang. 3\u2026.We know that when we heat a small particle, it will vibrate from time to time when the temperature increases. As it vibrates so I can say that there was a concept of velocity and also there was a concept of time. Stephen Hawking said in the Big Bang Theory that in the point of Singularity, the temperature was infinity. As the temperature was infinity it Vibrated highly. So there was a really existence of velocity and time which breaks the rule of Bang. 4\u2026.We know if anywhere a big bomb blast in makes a big hole pore space or vacuum in any place so if you bigbang really happened there was any big vacuum aur big hole in the space universe as Big Bang was a big explosion it created a big hole massive hole but our scientist cannot find any big hole or vacuum in the space for now 5 ....In previous point, I say everything in the world have vibration and we all know a small particle much much small particle need a minimum space to vibrate. So if Big Bang really happened, there was a small particle which was vibrate as their placed a big explosion in the point Singularity. I mean in the small particle also vibrate. So it needed some space to vibrate but by Big Bang, there was no space. 6\u2026..By the big bang theory we know that the point where the explosion made was infinite in mass, temperature and density. But after Big Bang Infinity mass density or energy became finite, but it also breaks the energy conservation law. So the Big Bang is proved as wrong. In this chapter I give six Logic that break the law of Big Bang. Now I am going to tell you where from I get the information\u2026. Vedic scientist Acharya Agnivrat said the logic. It is correlated with Vedas. I think you are now laughing hearing the word Vedic scientist or Vedas but I say we need to study our own Indian old books which are full of scientific definition and some of the books content much thing which are very amazing and the scientist become amaze. Now stop laughing about this. This is in brief of the wrong information in Big Bang Theory. It is my vision of the wrong information of the big bang. But now I am giving some articles which are written by some cosmologists. Could the Big Bang Be Wrong? By Corey S. Powell | June 15, 2019 3:02 pm 1K A short history of the universe since the time of the Big Bang. We can directly observe more than 13 billion years of change, but the beginning itself is an enduring mystery. (Credit: ESA) The Big Bang is the defining narrative of modern cosmology: a bold declaration that our universe had a beginning and has a finite age, just like the humans who live within it. That finite age, in turn, is defined by the evidence that the universe is expanding (again, and unfortunately, many of us are familiar with that feeling as well). Those two ideas\u2013a singular cosmic beginning, followed by billions of years of cosmic growth\u2013are so strange that some people have never made peace with them. As a result, skeptics have been questioning the validity of the Big Bang model for as long as there has been a Big Bang model. Among mainstream cosmologists, doubts about the Big Bang largely melted away in the 1960s with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background\u2013an omnidirectional buzz of radiation that makes sense only as a relic from the hot, early era of the universe. But around the fringe, the doubts have persisted. Lately they have intensified, inspired by a puzzling discrepancy in different measurements of how the universe is expanding. Even scientific centrists acknowledge that our understanding of the early universe is glaringly incomplete. So now is a prime time, it seems to me, to dig into the big question: Could the Big Bang be wrong? This question comes up all the time in public forums and on social media. In most cases, it seems rooted not so much in misgivings about the science as in misunderstanding of what science is. Any meaningful answer therefore has to begin with a crucial piece of clarification: The Big Bang means two quite different things depending on who you are talking to. In popular conversation, the Big Bang is often used broadly to mean the mysterious primal event that created the universe, and it is commonly envisioned as a tremendous explosion emanating from a single point. (To be fair, popular articles and illustrations often reinforce those ideas with oversimplification and confusing language.) But that is not what cosmologists mean by the Big Bang. One key point is that the Big Bang was not an explosion of the kind any person has ever witnessed. \u201cThis is a hard concept for people to get their heads around,\u201d says Wendy Freedman, a veteran cosmologist at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe first thing to get rid of is an image analogous to a bomb \u2014 which is our first tendency to imagine, and which is wrong \u2014 where you have an explosion with matter that flies outward from a center. This is not what happens in space. The Big Bang is an explosion of space, and not into space. There is no center or edge to the explosion.\u201d There was no place outside of the Big Bang, so it was not expanding into anything. Rather, all of space began expanding, everywhere. That is why galaxies appear to be moving away from us in every direction. Any observer, anywhere, would see the same thing. I sometimes think of the Big Bang as a metaphor for human psychology. In a sense, you can think of yourself as the center of the universe, since that\u2019s how it looks to all observers. But in a deeper sense, nobody is at the center, since the expansion is everywhere and all of us are in the same situation. For anyone wondering how the universe could have formed from an explosion at one point in space, the answer is that it couldn\u2019t. That idea truly is wrong \u2014 but it is also not at all what the Big Bang describes. Which brings me to another key point: The Big Bang is a description of how the universe began, not an explanation of why it began. It does not assume anything about what (or who) made the universe, and it does not assume anything about what (if anything) came before. The expanding universe stretches light, causing it to appear increasingly red with distance. There is no other known explanation for this cosmological redshift. (Credit: NASA/ESA/L. Hustak) To modern cosmologists, the Big Bang is a model describing how the universe expanded from an extremely hot, dense early state into the reality that we see today. The evidence for this interpretation overwhelming. Certainly, nothing else has come anywhere close in the last 50 years, even as our knowledge about the universe has grown tremendously. The most famous evidence for the Big Bang comes from \u201credshifts,\u201d the observed stretching of light from distant galaxies, but that\u2019s hardly the only source of support. The spectrum and distribution of the cosmic microwave background exactly matches expectations of the hot Big Bang. The evolution of galaxies testifies to the finite age of the universe, and the observed ages of stars exactly match up with the age of the universe deduced from the cosmic expansion. The large-scale distribution of galaxies displays a subtle rippling pattern that corresponds to the inferred rippling of acoustic waves in Big Bang\u2019s primordial soup of particles and radiation. The observed abundances of hydrogen, helium, deuterium and lithium in the universe exactly align with models of the nuclear reactions that occurred in that soup. Could that entire Big Bang framework of interpretation be wrong? I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible, but I will call it \u2026 inconceivable. One of the last serious holdouts against the Big Bang was late cosmologist Geoffrey Burbidge, who had championed the Steady State cosmology early in his career and refused to abandon his pet theory even long after the evidence falsified it. Later in life he came up with a complicated oscillating-universe model, which effectively incorporates many small big bangs. So really, he accepted the Big Bang, just without saying so. Discover ran a detailed profile of Burbidge and his ideas in 2005. All-sky map of the cosmic microwave background, created by the Planck spacecraft, provides a snapshot of the temperature of the universe when it was 380,000 years old. The Big Bang is the only known explanation for this radiation. (Credit: ESA/Planck Collaboration) I\u2019ve come across many proposed alternatives to the Big Bang, but I\u2019ve never seen one that deals honestly and comprehensively with the vast observational evidence that our universe had a hot, dense beginning about 13.8 billion years ago. The closest to a true outsider alternative that I know of is the plasma-cosmology model of Eric Lerner, a plasma physicist who developed a cult following for his view that the Big Bang never happened. His model is thoroughly inconsistent with the data, however. At the same time, it is important to be open about how much we don\u2019t know. It is not only possible, it is absolutely certain that our understanding of the Big Bang is incomplete. Cosmic inflation is a widely accepted theory about what happened during the first fraction of a second during the Big Bang, but it is not proven. The current dispute over the cosmic expansion rate may be a reflection of our ignorance about that early era. Why and how the Big Bang occurred are complete mysteries. You may have heard cosmologists speculate about the \u201cMultiverse,\u201d or about the idea of an oscillating universe with many beginnings, or about a collision between two membranes of reality that created our universe. Nobody knows which of these ideas, if any, is correct. But what they all have in common is that they all accept the evidence that our current universe emerged from an intensely hot, dense early state \u2014 which is to say, they all take the Big Bang as their starting point. Was there a time before the Big Bang? Will the universe expand forever? Will there be another Big Bang? Is the universe finite or infinite? Do other universes exist? These are all exciting, wide open questions. We have a lot to learn about our place in nature\u2019s grand scheme. But we can be quite confident that, wherever future theories and discoveries take us, the Big Bang will be a part of the picture. Another paper on the wrong side of the big bang : The Big Bang Wasn't The Beginning, After All Ethan SiegelSenior Contributor Starts With A BangContributor Group Science The Universe is out there, waiting for you to discover it. This article is more than 2 years old. A Universe that expands and cools today, like ours does, must have been hotter and denser in the past. Initially, the Big Bang was regarded as the singularity from which this ultimate, hot, dense state emerged. But we know better today. The Universe began not with a whimper, but with a bang! At least, that\u2019s what you\u2019re commonly told: the Universe and everything in it came into existence at the moment of the Big Bang. Space, time, and all the matter and energy within began from a singular point, and then expanded and cooled, giving rise over billions of years to the atoms, stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies spread out across billions of light years that make up our observable Universe. It\u2019s a compelling, beautiful picture that explains so much of what we see, from the present large-scale structure of the Universe\u2019s two trillion galaxies to the leftover glow of radiation permeating all of existence. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also wrong, and scientists have known this for almost 40 years. The idea of the Big Bang first came about back in the 1920s and 1930s. When we looked out at distant galaxies, we discovered something peculiar: the farther away from us they were, the faster they appeared to be receding from us. According to the predictions of Einstein\u2019s General Relativity, a static Universe would be gravitationally unstable; everything needed to either be moving away from one another or collapsing towards one another if the fabric of space obeyed his laws. The observation of this apparent recession taught us that the Universe was expanding today, and if things are getting farther apart as time goes on, it means they were closer together in the distant past. An expanding Universe doesn\u2019t just mean that things get farther apart as time goes on, it also means that the light existing in the Universe stretches in wavelength as we travel forward in time. Since wavelength determines energy (shorter is more energetic), that means the Universe cools as we age, and hence things were hotter in the past. Extrapolate this back far enough, and you\u2019ll come to a time where everything was so hot that not even neutral atoms could form. If this picture were correct, we should see a leftover glow of radiation today, in all directions, that had cooled to just a few degrees above absolute zero. The discovery of this Cosmic Microwave Background in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Bob Wilson was a breathtaking confirmation of the Big Bang. It\u2019s tempting, therefore, to keep extrapolating backwards in time, to when the Universe was even hotter, denser, and more compact. If you continue to go back, you\u2019ll find: A time where it was too hot to form atomic nuclei, where the radiation was so hot that any bound protons-and-neutrons would be blasted apart. A time where matter and antimatter pairs could spontaneously form, as the Universe is so energetic that pairs of particles/antiparticles can spontaneously be created. A time where individual protons and neutrons break down into a quark-gluon plasma, as the temperatures and densities are so high that the Universe becomes denser than the inside of an atomic nucleus. And finally, a time where the density and temperature rise to infinite values, as all the matter and energy in the Universe are contained within a single point: a singularity. This very final point \u2014 this singularity that represents where the laws of physics break down \u2014 also is understood to represent the origin of space and time. This was the ultimate idea of the Big Bang. Of course, everything except that last point has been confirmed to be true! We\u2019ve created quark-gluon plasmas in the lab; we\u2019ve created matter-antimatter pairs; we\u2019ve done the calculations for which light elements should form and in what abundances during the early stages of the Universe, made the measurements, and found that they match with the Big Bang\u2019s predictions. Coming forward even farther, we\u2019ve measured the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background and seen how gravitationally bound structures like stars and galaxies form and grow. Everywhere we look, we find a tremendous agreement between theory and observation. The Big Bang looks like a winner. Except, that is, in a few regards. Three specific things you would expect from the Big Bang didn\u2019t happen. In particular: The Universe doesn\u2019t have different temperatures in different directions, even though an area billions of light-years away in one direction never had time (since the Big Bang) to interact with or exchange information with an area billions of light-years in the opposite direction. The Universe doesn\u2019t have a measurable spatial curvature that\u2019s different from zero, even though a Universe that\u2019s perfectly spatially flat requires a perfect balance between the initial expansion and the matter-and-radiation density. The Universe doesn\u2019t have any leftover ultra-high-energy relics from the earliest times, even though the temperatures that would create these relics should have existed if the Universe were arbitrarily hot. Theorists thinking about these problems started thinking of alternatives to a \u201csingularity\u201d to the Big Bang, and rather of what could recreate that hot, dense, expanding, cooling state while avoiding these problems. In December of 1979, Alan Guth hit upon a solution. Instead of an arbitrarily hot, dense state, the Universe could have begun from a state where there was no matter, no radiation, no antimatter, no neutrinos, and no particles at all. All the energy present in the Universe would rather be bound up in the fabric of space itself: a form of vacuum energy, which causes the Universe to expand at an exponential rate. In this cosmic state, quantum fluctuations would still exist, and so as space expanded, these fluctuations would get stretched across the Universe, creating regions with slightly-more or slightly-less than average energy densities. And finally, when this phase of the Universe \u2014 this period of inflation \u2014 came to an end, that energy would get converted into matter-and-radiation, creating the hot, dense state synonymous with the Big Bang. This was regarded as a compelling-but-speculative idea, but there was a way to test it. If we were able to measure the fluctuations in the Big Bang\u2019s leftover glow, and they exhibited a particular pattern consistent with inflation\u2019s predictions, that would be a \u201csmoking gun\u201d for inflation. Furthermore, those fluctuations would have to be very small in magnitude: small enough that the Universe could never have reached the temperatures necessary to create high-energy relics, and much smaller than the temperatures and densities where space and time would appear to emerge from a singularity. In the 1990s, 2000s, and then again in the 2010s, we measured those fluctuations in detail, and found exactly that. The conclusion was inescapable: the hot Big Bang definitely happened, but doesn\u2019t extend to go all the way back to an arbitrarily hot and dense state. Instead, the very early Universe underwent a period of time where all of the energy that would go into the matter and radiation present today was instead bound up in the fabric of space itself. That period, known as cosmic inflation, came to an end and gave rise to the hot Big Bang, but never created an arbitrarily hot, dense state, nor did it create a singularity. What happened prior to inflation \u2014 or whether inflation was eternal to the past \u2014 is still an open question, but one thing is for certain: the Big Bang is not the beginning of the Universe! Other information : Big Bang theory wrong? Star older than Universe discovered - threat of \u2018scientific crisis\u2019 big bang Big Bang theory wrong? Star older than Universe discovered - threat of \u2018scientific crisis\u2019 THE Big Bang theory has been thrown into question after scientists discovered a star which appears to be older than the Universe itself \u2013 and it could lead to a \u201cscientific crisis\u201d. The Universe is thought to have popped into existence some 13.8 billion years ago when an infinitesimal point expanded in just a fraction of a second. The Big Bang theory has stood for the best part of 100 years after Belgian physicist Georges Lema\u00eetre first proposed in 1927 the expansion of the Universe could be traced back to a single point. However, the well-accepted model is now under the microscope after a team of researchers found a star which appears to be older than the cosmos. A star known as \u201cMethuselah star\u201d, or scientifically called HD 140283, is situated about 200 lightyears away and has stumped experts. Analysis of the star showed that it contained very little iron content, which would suggest that it formed during a period when the iron element was not abundant in the Universe. This in turn led to the discovery of the star is 14.5 billion years old, some 0.7 billion years older than the Universe. Experts met at a conference in California in July in an attempt to solve the mystery, but so far the questions have just led to more questions \u2013 and it could lead to a \u201cscientific revolution\u201d. \u201cMethuselah star\u201d, or scientifically called HD 140283 (Image: NASA) British physicist Robert Matthews wrote for UAE-based media outlet The National: \u201cIt\u2019s a riddle of cosmic proportions: How can the universe contain stars older than itself? \u201cThat\u2019s the conundrum now facing astronomers trying to establish the age of the universe \u2014 and its resolution could spark a scientific revolution. \u201cAstronomers now know it contains very little iron \u2014 which means it must have been formed before this element became common in the universe. \u201cAnd that implies HD 140283 must be almost as old as the universe itself. The first is that the assumed age of the Universe is incorrect. The Big Bang was traced back to its starting point when scientists measured the rate of expansion of the Universe. By discovering how fast the cosmos was expanding, scientists were able to essentially apply their equation in reverse to trace everything back to the beginning. \"HD 140283 must be almost as old as the universe itself.\u201d With scientific tools now more advanced and accurate, it could be time to measure the expansion yet again to deduce a better time frame. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy could be to do with the dark energy \u2013 the mysterious substance which acts as a counter to gravity. Dr Matthews continued: \u201cDays before last month\u2019s meeting, the journal Nature Astronomy published an estimate of the cosmic-expansion rate based on analysis of gravitational waves detected from such an event in 2017. \"The time may have come to think the unthinkable.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s still too rough and ready to resolve the paradox of the Methuselah star or the mystery of the two cosmic ages. \u201cAstronomers already think this so-called Dark Energy played a critical role in the Big Bang \u2013 although they still have no idea where it came from. \u201cBut with one leading astronomer at last month\u2019s meeting describing the current impasse as a scientific crisis, the time may have come to think the unthinkable.\u201d ",
