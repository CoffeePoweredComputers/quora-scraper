            "answer_text": "Maybe the question would be better asked\u2026 \u201cIs non-contained energy a contestable theory or an established fact, and if not contestable, then why?\u201d And provide this image for context?  What if there are immutable fundamental \u201cGroup-Wave\u201d physical building blocks? And \u201cenergy\u201d= time + motion (aka momentum).   From Einstein, and Newton and Mr (is the cat in the box there or not there)\u2026 (is the 1 amidst the surrounding 12 needed, or can it be worked without\u2026 in the right balance situation?) Create\u2026mechanically generate, physically\u2026 a solid-unit-groupwaveshaped-building block based\u2026 Bohmian Pilot Wave / Quantum Field when in motion.   So maybe\u2026 the better question, to get the point across, is to not focus on \u201cForces\u201d\u2026maybe that weirds people out too much, because they know they can fall off things\u2026 so to suggest \u201cforces don\u2019t exist\u201d is maybe to high a first hurdle? The weight of gravity and the gravity of the suggestion all being factors to weigh in.  So maybe the easier mental achilles heel is our imbedded notion of what the concept of \u201cenergy\u201d actually is. Whether it can be formless and bodiless like Star Trek would suggest. (among others)\u2026  So maybe asking\u2026about \u201cenergy\u201d (yes quotes)\u2026 is the better head shaker?? People can \u201csee\u201d themselves falling, cause \u201cgravity\u201d. But \u201cenergy\u201d is more aethereal. Obviously not clearly defined by what is \u201cis\u201d, but only by what \u201cit does, and can do\u201d. Tough. Cracking the nuts.  To get to what\u2019s inside, sometimes. I think pictures help. ",

Probably he would have liked Einstein\u2019s General Relativity and various field theories. You gotta say the guy had good instincts. Einstein said that for Newton, the pages of nature were an open book. ",
