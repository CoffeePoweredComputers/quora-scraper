            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question!  Aside from any cultural traditions or practices, this would be an answer based on science: 1. Your body is covered in bacteria every day of your life. That's true for everyone. It doesn't matter how often you bathe or shower, you have them on your skin, your hair, all over,  billions of them. And there's nothing to fear! Many are beneficial. When you get a cut, they help keep bad bacteria out of the wound. In fact, some people who shower too often (several times a day) can be sicker, not healthier! 2. You wash your hands in the sink. You might have been gardening or playing with an animal. Maybe your palms were sweating or you touched some garbage so you wash your hands. Obviously, that's okay in that same sink. You probably wash yoru hands every day in that sink.  3. You brush your teeth in the sink. Your mouth also has billions of germs and bacteria. Again, they are part of you and your health. You'vd had them every day of your life. The good ones keep the bad ones under control. you need them!   4. So feet? Feet are like your hands (with nails) and also like your armpits, where you have more sweat glands. BTW, sweat is normal and healthy, mostly salt water. Sweat has no smell unless some of the bacteria in the area grow into a colony in the sweat.  From a scientific perspective, washing you hands, your hair, your mouth (brushing) or your armpits with a washcloth, which you then wash and rinse in the same sink makes no significant difference. It's mostly the same bacteria on your skin. So your feet are about the same. There is no real difference and no reason you can't wash your feet in the sink (I'm assuming you dont' have any foot problems or athlete's foot. If so, just wash the sink with some soap and water)! Here is a fun link that may shock you! The germs on us and in us outnumber our human cells by about 10:1!  http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/06/13/154913334/finally-a-map-of-all-the-microbes-on-your-body ",

            "answer_text": "I used to do this every night of my life when I lived in an apartment that had a sink the right height. One at at time, of course. It was a nice custom. It felt great and it was relaxing. You should keep your sink clean and of course you should not drink from the sink in any event, only water from the faucet, but there is no reason not to wash your feet. As User-9790185175995880719 says, if you live in your mother's house, and she prefers you not do this, then you should respect her wishes, but in the abstract, if it is comfortable for you to do this and if you maintain reasonable standards of cleanliness for your sink, it should be fine.

            "answer_text": "If the sink is clean then washing your feet in it should be fine. Of course you should clean the sink after wards, at least nominally. But, if the sink is dirty then it overrules the whole purpose of washing your feet. It'll come out dirty with germs, obviously.  In India we don't face such dilemma, because we have bathrooms where we can put water anywhere. So, I wash my feet like that or in a tub if I need to soak in warm water. When I travel to some foreign country then I do so in the bath tub provided. I would have used the sink if it were lower.  I tried washing my feet in the regular height sinks but that was simply uncomfortable for me. Although if I have to wash feet of any kids, I do so in the sink as it is more comfortable, ensuring not to touch the sides. ",
