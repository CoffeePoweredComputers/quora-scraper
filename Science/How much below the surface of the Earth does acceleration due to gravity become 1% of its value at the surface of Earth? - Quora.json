            "answer_text": "In a homogeneous and spherical earth with a uniform density \u03c1, the value of g at a distance r from the earth\u2019s center is given by (4/3)G\u03c0\u03c1r or (4/3)G\u03c0\u03c1(R-d) where R is the radius of spherical earth and d is the depth below the surface. The value of g at the earth\u2019s surface is 9.8203 m/s^2. Let the value of g at a depth d be g1 which is 1% of the value at the surface, i.e., 0.098203 m/s. The depth d will then be d = R - g1/((4/3)G\u03c0\u03c1) = 6371000 - 63710 = 6307290 m or 6307.29 km. So, at a depth of 6307.29 km below the surface, the value of g will be 1% of the surface value. However, the earth is not homogeneous and its density varies with depth with a value of 13000 kg/m^3 at the center. The depth at which the value is 1% of the surface value is, from table of values given in Preliminary Reference Earth Models is 6102.8 km below the earth\u2019s surface. ",
