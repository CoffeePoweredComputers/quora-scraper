            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you are precisely referring to, however your starting point is to look at electronegativity (in Pauling units): H 2.20; Li 0.98; Be 1.57; B 204; C 2.55; N 3.04; O 3.44; F 3.98; Na 0.93; Mg 1.31; Al 1.61; Si 1.90; P 2.19; S 2.58; Cl 3.16.   The higher the value the more electrons are attracted in that direction, so in a bond the atom with the higher number is slightly more negative and the lower number slightly positive. The greater the difference between the numbers the stronger the dipole. ",
