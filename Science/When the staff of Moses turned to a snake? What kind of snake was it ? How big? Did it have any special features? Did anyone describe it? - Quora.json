            "answer_text": "Probably (but we don\u2019t know) it was the same kind of poisonous viper which bit and killed many of the sinning Hebrews (Semites?) in the wilderness. Moses had to then build a bronze statue of a poisonous viper to hold up on a pole for the sinful Hebrews (still alive) to come and behold so that their sins would be forgiven and they themselves would not die from the bite.  Jesus compared his being lifted up on a cross to Moses lifting up the bronze statue of the viper (see Gospel of John chp. 3). Those that behold Jesus lifted up are saved too. The \u201capostle\u201d Paul only has contempt for Moses and Jesus. In Book of Acts chp. 28, Paul is bitten on the hand (Mark of the Beast to the hand) by a poisonous viper. He then shakes it off (\u201cshakes off the beast\u201d - KJV lingo) into the fire as if to say, \u201cIt is you Moses and Jesus who will be cast into the Lake of Fire, not myself and the Anti-Christ.\u201d I can almost hear Paul myself. Can you? If one compares Jesus\u2019 teaching in Gospel of John chp. 3 to Paul\u2019s teaching in 1 Corinthians chp. 10, it is apparent that Paul does not want us to understand the Grace of God exhibited through the lifting up of Moses\u2019 viper and Jesus Christ on the cross. Paul says the episode in the wilderness is only a warning to us not to sin or else suffer the same consequences i.e. death. How pathetic is that theology! Basically, the Benjamite Pharisee wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, Paul of Tarsus, wants us to maintain the Pharisaic \u201cWay\u201d of salvation i.e. salvation through not sinning. That is NOT the \u201cGood News\u201d i.e. Gospel of Jesus Christ. Of course, Paul never met Jesus and never witnessed his life/ministry and passion and resurrection and ascension.   ",
