            "answer_text": "In my View Jagadish Chandra Bose was one of the finest among the great minds of 20th century. Western world made his contributions look so tiny as happens as usual. And 1900s when India was still under British rule, many of his contributions went on unnoticed or say were suppressed by western world. Here I will talk about him in brief.  Jagadish Chandra Bose was born on 30 November, 1858 at Mymensingh, now in Bangladesh. He was raised in a home committed to pure Indian traditions and culture. Bose attended the University of Cambridge studying natural sciences after graduating with a physics degree from Calcutta University. He returned to India in 1884 after completing his B.Sc. degree from Cambridge University and was appointed professor of physical science at Presidency College, Calcutta (now Kolkata). Famous Experiment and a great contribution to the humanity. The central hall of the Royal Society in London was jam-packed with famous scientists on May 10, 1901. Everyone seemed to be curious to know how Bose\u2019s experiment will demonstrate that plants have feelings like other living beings and humans. Bose chose a plant whose roots were cautiously dipped up to its stem in a vessel holding the bromide solution, which is considered a poison. He plugged in the instrument with the plant and viewed the lighted spot on a screen showing the movements of the plant, as its pulse beat, and the spot began to and fro movement similar to a pendulum. Within minutes, the spot vibrated in a violent manner and finally came to an abrupt stop. The whole thing was almost like a poisoned rat fighting against death. The plant had died due to the exposure to the poisonous bromide solution. The event was greeted with much appreciation and applause; however some physiologists were not content, and considered Bose as an intruder. They harshly knocked the experiment but Bose did not give up and was confident about his findings. Using the crescograph, he further researched the response of the plants to fertilizers, light rays and wireless waves. The instrument received widespread acclaim, particularly from the Path Congress of Science in 1900. Many physiologists also supported his findings later on, using more advanced instruments. Many of his other contributions most of which went unnoticed are: In November 1895, Bose presented a public demonstration at Town Hall in Calcutta where he sent an electromagnetic wave across 75 feet, passing through walls to remotely ring a bell and to explode some gunpowderBose is known as the father of wireless communication. He had invented the Mercury Coherer, a radio wave receiver that was used by Guglielmo Marconi to build an operational two-way radioThe science behind capturing radio waves was first demonstrated by Bose. While Marconi was celebrated for his invention, Bose remained unknown to many, as he never patented his workBose was appointed as a professor in Presidency College (now University) in Calcutta by the order of Lord Ripon on his return from LondonBeing a colonised Indian, Bose was denied access to laboratories. He would conduct his experiments only at his place. He would work inside a 24-square-feet room, which is hardly enough for any scientific experimentHe was considered as the pioneer of Bengali science fiction. His book 'Polatok Toofan' (Absconding Storm) described how a cyclone could be averted by using a bottle of hair oil. It explained how oil changes the surface tension and holds waterHis book 'Niruddesher Kahini' (Story of the Untraceable) was the first major Bengali science fictionJagadish Chandra Bose was one of the most influential teachers of his time. Two of his students were Meghnad Saha and Satyendra Nath BoseThere is a small crater on the moon named after Jagadish Chandra Bose. The Bose Crater is located at the far side of the moon close to Crater Bhabha and Crater Adler and has a diameter of 91 kilometres\u2026\u2026..Kapil Bharadwaj Source: How Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose proved plants have life 115 years ago Jagadish Chandra Bose ",

Here is a short list of inventions that have contributed to the modern age: Created AC (Alternating Current) electricity generation. The irony here is that Tesla was brought to America by Thomas Edison to solve Edisons DC transmission issues. Invented Radio Invented The first Remote Controlled vehicle Invented the Fluorescent bulb Invented the AND/OR gate; which all transistor and solid state electronics are based on and make the computers we use possible.
