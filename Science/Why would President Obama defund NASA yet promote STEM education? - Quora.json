            "answer_text": "Obama is a political animal. He doesn't get political support from either NASA or the space industry which has grown up to support NASA. So he cut their throat. His talk about 'investing for the future' is all hot air. Funding for NASA is one of the most efficient means of creating new technologies and new industries on the planet, but Obama is so short-sighted he'd rather cut the \"Space Coast\"'s throat than create new technologies. When Obama had an ally in the House (Nancy Pelosi) as Speaker and an ally (Harry Reid) in the Senate the budget that was rammed through decimated NASA to go along with their Democratic priorities. As Harry Reid remained in charge of the Senate for four more years he held the budget process hostage, insisting on a continuing resolution, not a new budget. Reid wouldn't even let any discussion of the budget come up. That was six years of burning down the Space Coast and NASA all brought to you by the Democratic Party which claims to be \"pro-science\" \"pro-technology\" and \"investing for the future.\" Since the GOP now has budget control they have started refunding NASA. Over half of STEM graduates in the USA don't work in a STEM job. Obama's push for STEM education is typical Obama smokescreen. ",

            "answer_text": "Obama doesn't fund anything. That's up to Congress. Congress cancelled the Constellation program because of the financial crisis. The American people were not interested in funding Bush's ambitious space exploration plans when 10% of them were out of work. STEM education, and for that matter all education, is the best investment a country can make. It pays off in a more-employable, better-employed citizenry who need less assistance from the state and pay more taxes into it, thereby growing the country. But education is a long-term investment -- it doesn't start reaping rewards until 15-20 years down the line. ",
