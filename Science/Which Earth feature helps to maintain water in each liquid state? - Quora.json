            "answer_text": "I'm going to go with curvature. A smaller planet like Mars has a tighter curve requiring it to be closer to the Sun to maintain the warmth needed to keep water in a liquid state. The atmosphere is important for cloud formation allowing it to condense at the different levels. Unfortunately, the atmosphere also helps the moisture to be toward the poles where the slight angle of the Earth's curve allows it to turn into its solid form. The water or ice found near the moon's pole suggests that an atmosphere isn't needed for this to occur, just the curvature. Thereby pointing out the dual nature of such features working for and against the liquid state. ",
