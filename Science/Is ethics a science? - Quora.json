            "answer_text": "Ethics is an integral part of science. Like science, it requires us to be consistent and empirically justified in our interpretations of the actions of scientists. The ethics of science and science itself share the goal of comprehending in human terms scientists' actions in manipulating the physical world. The division of science and ethics has been driven by an increasing interest in the actions of scientists by non-scientists. An unfortunate result of this has been a shift away from the consistent and justifiable methodology of science to an approach based on an often ill-defined 'personal philosophy' and 'gut feeling', for instance as described in Correspondence by D. P. Leader: \u201cReproductive cloning: an attack on human dignity\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is widespread acknowledgment that it is very difficult to get a base for morality in science. Albert Einstein saw this clearly. In a discussion on science and religion in Berlin 1930, he said that our human sense of beauty and our religious instinct are \"tributary forms in helping the reasoning faculty towards its highest achievements. You are right in speaking of the moral foundations of science, but you cannot turn round and speak of the scientific foundations of morality.\" Einstein proceeded to point out that science cannot form a base for morality: \"every attempt to reduce ethics to scientific formulae must fail\". Richard Feynman, also a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, shared Einstein's view: \"Even the greatest forces and abilities don't seem to carry any clear instructions on how to use them. As an example, the great accumulation of understanding as to how the physical world behaves only convinces one that this behaviour has a kind of meaninglessness about it. The sciences do not directly teach good or bad.\" Elsewhere he states that \"ethical values lie outside the scientific realm\". ",

            "answer_text": "Yes of course. Simple meaning of science is knowledge. Knowledge means use of gathered information in effective manner. Sameway ethics is code of conduct. Information about what is right and what is wrong. So first of all we have to gather information about it and then apply that principle in our own life. Most of us able to find out information but failed to use it wisely. To use info is quality or say it's habit. It is not derived by born but we have to develop it through continuous observation and experience. Ethics is eternal truth, that can not be changed in any situation like sun rises in east. We have to adjust. ",

Science even in a limited sense means knowledge about the structure and behavior of the natural world. AS the overall objective has to be moral values, what is to be done to ensure that itself has to be a science. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is subjective since if, you are an aethist I believe, well, personally that yes because whenever you do something religious or related something to the temple or mosque It always ends up with a scientific logic \u2026but being religious I do think that Ethics are something that have been taught to us by our parents and by our grandparents\u2026. So basically it's all about the way from which we see all this. ",
