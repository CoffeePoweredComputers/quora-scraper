            "answer_text": "Well I've been learning methods involved in cooking since I was about three years old so I think by this point, 23 years later, that I have a decent grasp on the in's and outs of basic culinary skills. I can cook just about anything with or with out a recipe. I can cook a good soft scrambled egg, I can poach a filet of fish, I can debone poultry, I can roast meat, I know a few tricks to making a steller salad. I can carmalize vegtables and make theminto amazing sauces, I can make a dish tasty with just salt, pepper and fresh ingredients. I like to make \u201csimple\u201d dishes that shine, like lemon herb roasted chicken on salad, roasted beef with a simple peppercorn pan sauce, roasted vegetable soup with crispy garlic, Seared steak with rosemary butter, sliced tofu poached in a soy broth with fresh asian vegetables\u2026 One of my favorite dishes is crispy salted salmon with rice and lemon. It's easy, simple, hard to mess up and its tasty. I'm embarrassed to say I am not very good at grilling things\u2026 I tend to over cook things when using this method as I don't have much practice cooking things with charcoal. I am very much still learning to cook and I hope I never stop learning, I really do like to figure out new and better ways to make simple ingredients become delicious meals. ",

            "answer_text": "I pride myself into being an educated and proficient cook. I never shy away from a good culinary challenge, and I have a deep passion about food.  I know how to season and cook a mean roast. Pictured here is a French Pork Roast braised to pink perfection.  I am also proficient in baking. Pictured here, pear cake with caramelized hazelnuts.  I have learnt the classics of French cuisine. Duck confit with baby spinach, apples and grapes sauce.  My baking knowledge includes how to proceed with cake decoration and \u201cpi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es\u201d. This 4 layers strawberry cake is stacked between layers of whipped chocolate ganache, covered in a chocolate glaze, along with hand made marzipan roses.  In addition to those, I also use my baking prowess to produce cookies. Those are Bredele cookies, a traditional Alsatian cookie made for Christmas.  This is a kind of improvised broth based soup like a kind of pho. It consists of home made chicken bouillon in which I simmered aromatics and vegetables. I cooked rice noodles in a different pot to keep the bouillon clear. I put the noodles, raw vegetables, some fine pork strips, and poured scalding hot bouillon on it to cook.  These are soft shell tacos made with roasted turkey leftovers, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, sour cream.  Those are one of my favorite cookies. They\u2019re almond cookies, and are two-bites of awesomeness. This picture was taken while I was learning composition in photography.  I know the art of preservation. These were Christmas gifts for family, and contained plum jam that I water bathed. I also know how to pressure can non acid foods, but sadly, the picture wouldn\u2019t load on Quora.  I also make a delicious lemon marmalade for which I have received rave reviews. Notice how there are no pieces in that marmalade; it\u2019s sweet instead of bitter because I supreme all the citrus going into that mix, instead of throwing the whole lemons. What causes bitterness in marmalade is the pith, the \u201cwhite flesh\u201d under the colored exterior of the citruses.  I don\u2019t bake bread often, but I like to do on special occasions. This was the second time I was attempting bread.  I like to do pretty breakfasts. Oatmeal with blood orange supremes, fanned strawberry, pear slices and two carambola slices, with a supremed grapefruit. There was also a strawberry cocktail, not pictured.  Delicious, delicious guacamole. I used not to like avocados, and started doing this for my husband. Turns out, I like avocados too, now !  I have a repertoire wide enough to produce a soup with anything left in the fridge. I remember this one being celery root and something else soup.  I know how to produce excellent, luscious molten chocolate lava cake. In addition to being super decadent, you can make them in advance\u2026 a real life saver !  And talking of chocolate, here is a poached pear chocolate cake. Moist, decadent and super delicious, I sneak pieces of this for breakfast.  Another recipe of bread. Soft rolls, made in individual portions for Christmas. Those were awesome.  Orange blossom flavored nut stuffed dates. This is a medieval recipe I made for a special event.  A spread of handmade goods for a Knigthing in the SCA. Shortbread cookies, pecan tarts, an assortment of cheeses, honey candied nuts, bread and honey butter. The jug contained home made ice tea, along with ice in a special compartment to keep it cold while avoiding diluting it, and the tarts have been arranged in a pattern to look like a flower from above, even if it\u2019s less noticeable from this angle.  A platter of salmon roses made for another Knighting in the SCA.  A medieval Normand spread of food including roasted marrow hand pies, sourdough bread, grapes and brie cheese, dried duck sausage, pears poached in spices and red wine, smoked salmon roses and almond shortbread cookies. This one was done for an elevation to the order of the Pelican.  Lemon cake, with mango sorbet on a meringue nest. Everything on this plate is home made. I indulged myself at my last birthday, because I can.  Mama squash soup. This was done as part of a \u201ctavern\u201d evening for a game of D&D.  Pork souvlakis, with green beans covered in cheese and couscous. Casual dinner at home.  Grattin Dauphinois, roasted Brussel sprouts and roasted pork (French Roast) with demi-glace sauce. (Not so pretty because leftovers, but still tasty !) As you can see, my culinary expertise is broad, and while I sometimes do recipes I find tempting, I do most of my cooking by improvisation, using what\u2019s in the fridge, leftovers or whatever else is on sale that week, to make them into whole new meals. I am known as the chef in my family and group of friends, and often partake in food making in the Society for Creative Anachronism, where I have held banquets for up to 140 persons. Unfortunately, some of my pictures were not recognized as a valid format for Quora, so some were left out, like dumplings (siu bao and sui mai), almond souffl\u00e9, with a red wine poached pear, accented by a pear and Sortil\u00e8ge (whisky and maple syrup liqueur) coulis, and hazelnut pralines, sushis, peanut butter fudge, home made pasta, brownies, pork burgers (with naan bread !), chicken nuggets, fish with a Parmesan crust, etc... If you ever need culinary advice, I\u2019d be happy to provide you with some insight ! Just write to me in private message. ",
