            "answer_text": "If you're asking about part of Thar in Sindh, Pakistan, then I may give the best answer here as I just came back from a relief trip to Thar.  Thar is 400km (9hrs drive) away from Karachi, Pakistan. But in every way its locked 1000 years ago.  Karachi, Pakistan to S62-791, W\u0101ori, Pakistan - Google Maps Here's how a typical home in Thar looks like, this single room koopa (local name) consists of everything a family needs like place to cook, sleep etc. The walls are made of mud bricks and plastered with mud. The roof is made with grass found in the region. Roof gets worn out in a few years and need repairs.   Main source of food for people is livestock and a few vegetables that grow in the region. It's been more than 18 months since it rained there, causing the water level to  decline by many 100 feet. Here's a short list of the major issues I saw there, Scarce Water - 2 members of each family are dedicated to fetch water. Alongwith Camel/Donkeys who could pull the rope from 250ft - 500ft. Nobody until 2014 thought of working on water pumps to make their lives easier. This would free these 2 persons, who can get some work to reduce poverty. I was told that people wash clothes when it rains.Highly Contaminated Water - Whatever water there is, its hazardous for drinking. People, animals drink the same water causing bone and tissue damages and several diseases. There's no treatment plant in the region.Extremely Fast Aging - A 25yrs old male has the skin wrinkles like a 50 yrs old. Old people can't even stand. Teeth start decaying from the age of 5. All due to contaminated water.Cut From Modern Civilization - Chchro, Sindh which is the closest bigger city is a very small town. Soon after Chachro, roads cease to exist. Only 4WDs have access to far of region. In case of emergency a trip to city costs PKR.4,000/- where people don't even have a PKR.100/-.Beauty of Thar Thar is blessed with beauty in its own way. Peacocks can be seen roaming around freely.     I'll edit this answer for more details, later. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello My friend A \u201csimple\u201d life is not necessarily an easy one. The Thar Desert, or Great Indian Desert, is an arid region that forms a natural boundary between India and Pakistan. A relatively large area, it spreads across four Indian states (Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan) and two Pakistani states. The Thar Desert is the most densely populated desert in the world, with 83 people per square km. This population lives in small villages, far apart from each other. The people are often nomadic: moving when their sparse water supply dries up. In most villages, the familial generations live together in one complex, and any money earned by family members becomes the common property of the family as a whole. A walk around the small village of Khuri, within the boundaries of Desert National Park, and only 45 km from the World Heritage city of Jaisalmer, demonstrates how little people make do with.  Welcome Khuri\u201dIt\u2019s a simple sign that welcomes visitors to a simple village.  Camel \u2013Camels \u2013 which provide rides for tourists \u2013 \u2026  \u2013 in his Finery\u2026 are the village\u2019s economic mainstay.  Skinny Calf and Fallen LaundryMost of the houses in the village are simple clay-and-dung walled huts with thatched roofs and packed-earth courtyards.  Water PotsWater is carried \u2013 not piped.  Family at the GateMost houses have a fenced-off courtyard. Clearly, the lifestyle is simple, \u2026  Woman at the Gate\u2026 but the smiles are generous.  Child at the Window  Rajasthani GirlChildren, with their dark eyes rimmed with kohl, are everywhere, \u2026  Rajasthani Boy\u2026 though it might take a little while for some of them to come out of the shadows.  GoatThe presence of livestock \u2013 goats and cows \u2013 signals that this village is doing well.  Sweeping the HousefrontMost tasks are performed manually, \u2026  Machine-Worker\u2026 but there is some electricity, running off a generator.  Man on the Stoop  Woman and ChildrenFirewood or clay pots are stored on flat roofs. There are surplus bricks scattered all around the place; \u2026  Woman and Child\u2026 I can\u2019t tell if they are from buildings going up or coming down.  \u201cWashed\u201d PotsI suspect these utensils have been sand-scrubbed. Water is at a real premium around the village; \u2026  Women with Water Pots\u2026 as I ride into the dunes on one of the camels, local women are returning to the village with water pots on their heads.  Camels on the SandLike most tourist who visit this part of Desert National Park, we are there to ride the camels into the dunes.  Dancing BoyIn the falling afternoon light\u2026  Dancing Boy\u2026 a young boy entertains us with dance \u2026  Musicians in the Sand\u2026 music and song.  Riding the CamelI was travelling as part of a photo-group with Karl Grobl and local guide DV; \u2026  Running the Camel\u2026. we were in the dunes to take pictures of the camels against the lowering sun; \u2026  Walking the Camel ",
