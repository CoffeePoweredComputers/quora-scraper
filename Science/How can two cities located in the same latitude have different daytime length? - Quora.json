            "answer_text": "The others have already shown you have made a mistake - your example cities have different latitudes. The small difference in latitude is enough to account for the difference you have noticed - despite the difference in altitude. Just in case someone googles to this answer later\u2026 Regardless of latitude, the time from midday to midday is always the same. Daylight depends on the latitude and the height of the horizon compared with the height of the city. So the top of a tall tower gets slightly more daylight than the base. Similarly a city surrounded by mountains gets less daylight than one that is at high altitude. Consider how much daylight a geosynchronous satellite gets compared with the ground :) Your mention of the altitude suggests you already know this. ",

            "answer_text": "London and Calgary are not at the exact same latitude: London is slightly further north, at 51.5074\u00b0 N, while Calgary is at 51.0486\u00b0 N. That\u2019s a difference of 0.4588\u00ba. Keep in mind that we are approaching the summer solstice, which means that Earth\u2019s north pole is pointing more and more towards the Sun. The further north you are, the more time you spend under the Sun. There\u2019s not a huge difference between the latitudes of Calgary and London, but it\u2019s enough of a difference that London gets 5 more minutes of sunlight than Calgary does. In winter the situation ought to be reversed; the more northern city will receive less sunlight while the more southern city receives more. On December 22, 2017, the Sun will rise above London at 8:04 AM local time and set at 3:54 PM, a duration of 7 hours 50 minutes. On the same day in Calgary, the Sun will rise at 8:38 AM and set at 4:32 PM, a duration of 7 hours 54 minutes. So yeah\u2026the cities aren\u2019t at the exact same latitude, and it depends on the time of year. ",
