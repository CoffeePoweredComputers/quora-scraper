            "answer_text": "Something can be said to be real if it exists as it appears to exist. Something can be said to be illusary if it does not exist as it appears to exist. The body feels like a single object. When asked how many bodies are in a room we count them up. At that time they appear as single objects. There may be the appearance of a single object \u2018body\u2019 but can it really be found? Which atom is this body? If it\u2019s not any particular atom then the collection of these \u2018not the body\u2019 bits is also not the body. A collection is an idea with a label. An idea with a label does not create an object extra to the atoms (none in themselves being the body) Is the body something separate from the atoms? Imagine the atoms disappear, will there be this single object \u2018body\u2019 remaining? We\u2019ve now searched everywhere. This single object \u2018body\u2019 that appeared cannot be found. This is one of the delusional perceptions that occur. Call it no-self or anything else you want to call it. It\u2019s the unfindability of the perceived object that is the truth of the situation. The object itself cannot be found. So we can say the object has no-self but I think that is confusing language, it invokes questions like the one asked. Just try to find the way the single object appears to you then try to find it within it\u2019s parts. Nothing more, nothing less. If you stick at looking on the level of interdependence you\u2019ll skim the surface. You\u2019ll still perceive a non existent object and decide it definitely exists as an object. Just because individual objects cannot be found does not mean there is not general appearance. This is the Middle Way. Not findable objects and not nothingness. Mere appearance. That is not illusary.

            "answer_text": "Very important question! The Messenger of Allah (S) said the following in his speech, \u201cDo not be like the one who was fooled by the transient world and was deluded by the long desires which kept him pre-occupied. Thus, he pinned his hopes on the material world that is full of evils and shall pass by quickly. You should know that all that remains of this world (its time span), in comparison to that which has already passed is like the amount of time which a camel lies down on the ground (when a person goes to mount it or place some load on it). Its worth is the (monetary) amount of that thing which a person uses to tie the udders of an animal (to prevent the child from taking milk from its mother or so that the milk is not wasted in other ways). Therefore what do you raise yourselves upon (where do you live and build your dwellings upon), and what are you in anticipation of?\u201d1 In this speech, the Noble Prophet (S) has brought forth some very important issues.2 The first thing he has spoken about is: \u201cThe gold and glitter of the material world is an illusion which tricks a person - both from the internal and external aspects of the world.\u201d These things have been referred to in the tradition as being \u201c\u062e\u062f\u0639\u0629\u201d or an imposter and cheater and as \u201c\u063a\u0631\u0648\u0631\u201d or delusion and trickery - just as it is stated: \u062e\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0639\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0648\u064e \u063a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062a\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f\u2026 \u201cThe fast ending material world has cheated the person, and the long desires which the material world contains have deluded him.\u201d In reality, the two characteristics of cheating (\u062e\u062f\u0639\u0629) and delusion (\u063a\u0631\u0648\u0631) are one and the same and very close in meaning. However, in this tradition, the term 'imposter' or 'cheater' (\u062e\u062f\u0639\u0629) is in relation to the internal illusions of the material world, while 'delusion' or 'trickery' (\u063a\u0631\u0648\u0631) is in relation to the outer illusions of the material world. A person sees the gold, glitter, status and apparent lofty position of the material world and sees one who possesses these bounties and other good things and it is these things which end up keeping him preoccupied and ultimately, negligent of Allah (SwT). Through this, he becomes completely unaware of Allah (SwT), the next life and the spiritual attractions of the faith. Thus, the Noble Prophet (S) has stated that we must not be like the one who is sometimes cheated by the outer forces of the material world, while at other times is tricked by the inner powers!3 The second point mentioned in the tradition is the instability of the transient world. In reality, the one who is deluded by either the inner or outer aspects of the material world has placed his trust on \u201c\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0621\u201d or \u201cThe wicked abode\u201d and that too, a locality which shall very soon be destroyed! As we know, the person shall move from this abode to the next life and at any time, \u201c\u2026the bell shall toll (and it will be announced) that you lazy people must now move on\u2026\u201d In this part of the tradition, we see that two words are used - namely \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0627\u0644\u201d and \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u201d. These two words carry a very important point since \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0627\u0644\u201d means that the person will have to give up whatever he has in his possession, while \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u201d means that a person will be transferred to another area (the next life) in which he must give full account for the actions performed in the world. Thus, the blessings of the material world are not only given to us very quickly, rather they are taken away from us just as fast! The Qur`an also emphasizes this issue and in regards to the material world, its delusionary tactics have been referred to as the glitter and attraction. Sometimes the attraction is attributed to Allah Himself; sometimes to the person; and in other times to Satan. However, from one point of view, all of these are correct: 1. Attributing the glitter and attraction of the material world to Allah (SwT) is in reference to Him being the \u201cMusababal Asbab\u201d or the \u201cCauser of all Causes\u201d as all things which occur in the universe are through His permission. 2. Attributing this act to Satan is due to the evil whisperings that he is known for which affect a person - both from his outside surroundings and from his inner self. 3. Attributing this act to the person is because of following the lower desires and negative, inner characteristics. From the point of view of the common people who look at things at a very rudimentary level, the material world is one of gold and glitter. However, the person who has delved deep into the material world knows that there is no beauty to it! The luster of the material world is only there so that the person is able to see these things from far away and then judge (the true worth of the world)! However, when one gets close to it and falls into its trap, then his entire life is engulfed in flames and such a person becomes confused to the realities. Since a majority of people rely on what they see and perceive (with their other senses) as their only form of knowledge and do not go deeper in issues which come up in their lives, they are caught up in chasing the foolish things of the material world. With this said, when we look deep into the private lives of those who have achieved status, wealth, position, hold a great rank in the material world and whose entire presence is busy with these things, we see that their lives are not even worth \u201cporridge in the mouth.\u201d Thus in summary, from afar, the material world is attractive and beautiful, however when a person enters into it, he would then realize that there is nothing of worth present! There is a very beautiful phrase given by the Commander of the Faithful, \u2018Ali b. Abi Talib (as) where he says: \u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0651 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064d \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064f\u0651\u0646\u0652\u0640\u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0633\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0638\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0639\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0647\u0650\u060c \u0648\u064e \u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0651 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064d \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0639\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0638\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0633\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u0647\u0650. \u201cEverything that one hears about the transient world is greater (in the person's estimation) than what it actually is when he sees it; and everything that he sees which is in the next life is greater that is heard about it.\u201d4 The next life is indescribable with words and keeping in mind the words of Imam \u2018Ali b. Abi Talib (as) mentioned above, it is possible that one may state, \u201cThe transient world is all a delusion! The material world has announced to us with 100 tongues that it has no loyalty and is not going to last!\u201d In addition, the Prophet (S) has also stated that, \u201cAre these destroyed graves of your fore-fathers that which has deluded you? Are the remains of those who have passed away that which deludes you? Are these sick people whom you were sitting beside from morning till night and taking care of, that which is deluding you!?\u201d In summary, if we study this issue carefully, then without doubt we would realize that we are actually trying to delude our selves! Continuing on, the Noble Prophet (S) then mentioned a phrase which is not commonly used in the Noble Qur`an or the traditions. The phrases used in regards to the transient world are usually things such as 'disloyalty', or 'lack of foundation' or that the material world is something that cannot be trusted. However in this tradition, another comparison is given. The Prophet (S) tells us that in comparison to that which has already passed us by, whatever remains from the transient world is insignificant. To further elucidate on this, he has given us two parables: 1. The first is the phrase, \u201c\u0625\u0646\u0627\u062e\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u0643\u0628\u201d or 'the camel that is lying down on its stomache.'In order for a person to sit on top of a camel, the camel must lie down since it is not possible to mount or dismount the camel while it is standing up due to its height! One of the amazing qualities of the camel is that while it is lying down, if a person was to put some heavy load on top of it or was to sit on it, the camel could still easily stand up. However, when we look at other animals, we see that this is not the case! It is due to this characteristic of the camel that has led some of the commentators of the Noble Qur`an to state that this may be the reason why Allah (SwT) referred to the camel with the following verse: \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0640\u0646\u0652\u0638\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0640\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0644\u0650 \u0643\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641\u064e \u062e\u064f\u0644\u0650\u0642\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u201cWhat then, do they not look at the camel and how it has been created?\u201d5 A great deal of the camel's unique abilities lie in the special characteristics of the head and neck; its head works like a lever or crow bar and it is through the rocking and specific movements it makes that it is able to stand up while carrying heavy loads. The time which the camel spends lying on the ground is very short and similar to the transient word! Just as the camel does not spend much time lying down, so too is the length of this temporal world short\u2026 2) The second parable given is that of \u201c\u0635\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0628\u201d and this parable refers to the stomache of the animal when it is full of milk. If a person did not want the child of the animal to drink its mothers' milk, then they would cover the udders with a bag; or in order for the milk not to be wasted, they would cover the udders and tie a knot to prevent the bag from opening. That thing used to tie the udders is referred to in \u2018Arabic as \u201c\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0631\u201d. Thus, without doubt, the choice of these two parables is an interesting way to look at the material world. Therefore, when the Prophet (S) stated \u201c\u0625\u0646\u0627\u062e\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u0643\u0628\u201d, it means that since we are at the end of our journey, we must get down! Comparing the act of the camel to us leaving the transient world is completely in order and can be best understood when one dismounts his ride when he reaches the end of the journey. The camel would be made to lie down and the person would then dismount. In addition, when it is stated \u201c\u0635\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0628\u201d this means that just as baby of an animal is given the opportunity to drink its mother's milk however after a period of time, the child is prevented from drinking more, in the same way we see that every human being is given a specific length of time to live in this world, and at some point, death will come to cut these roots from this life! The Prophet (S) then stated, \u201cYour share of the transient world is nothing more than the amount of time which a camel lays down in order for a person to mount or dismount it nor is it worth more than the amount of the string which is used to tie the udders of the animal so that its child can not drink the milk!\u201d At this point, a question may come up: what is the meaning of, \u201cThe time remaining in the life of this world, in relation the time of the world that has already passed, is something short?\u201d Is the life of the entire world like this or is the life of the human being measured in this way? If the meaning of this statement is the life of the physical world and refers to the time remaining in the life of the Earth in comparison to that which has already passed by as being something short, then this could refer to the fact that millions of years have already gone by in the life of this world. However if this refers to the life of humanity, then it means that mankind has been living on this Earth for countless number of years. However it is unknown if this is relation to the children of Adam (as) (or others) since in this case, the life of humanity which has passed, compared to that which is remaining is something very small. It is possible that the life span of Adam (as) was not much, however humanity is not limited to Prophet Adam (as) alone and we have proof that before Adam (as), there were other human beings on this Earth and that this Earth existed! It is also possible that the meaning of this phrase is the life of each one of us which has passed and that which remains of our lives with the difference between these two being a very small amount of time. Therefore, a person should have any certainty in his life, as it is possible that there may be only one hour left in it! Thus, he should remove the thought from his head that he still has a long time to live.If the life of this world is like this, what can we place our trust and reliance upon? What can we use to advance and spiritually ascend in life? There may not be but a moment left in our lives and thus, even this one moment which remains must be valued. If we wish to turn back to Allah (SwT) in repentence, then we must do so now and must not lose this valuable opportunity! Today we see that events are occurring in greater quantity and must faster than they used to in the past and thus, we are being put face to face with many challenges. We have to deal with things that people of the past could never have even imagined in their dreams! Without doubt, the life of today, in relation to the life of the past, has become very untrustworthy! Discourse 12: A Description of The Material World and a Comparison Between its Past and Future ",
