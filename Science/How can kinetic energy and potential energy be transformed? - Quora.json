            "answer_text": "I assume you are interested in how kinetic energy can be transformed into potential energy. The most common example would be a person on a swing. When the swing is at the end of its 'swing' (highest and furthest out) the person has potential energy. When in mid swing (lowest) point the person has kinetic energy. Inertia then carries the person to the other end of the 'swing'. Kinetic energy has been converted to potential energy. If you throw a ball up into the air it will have kinetic energy when it leaves your hand and this will steadily transform into potential energy until the ball reaches the top of its trajectory. More on this with diagrams in Kindle book 'Zero to Physics in 60,000 Words\u2019. You can read the energy chapter for free by using 'look inside'. ",

            "answer_text": "Potential energy is the energy associated with the force (e.g., gravity) pulling or pushing something. The process of the force pushing or pulling something coverts the potential energy into kinetic energy, because as the object moves in response to the force is accelerates (unless there is something preventing it form accelerating) and the force decreases. For example, if your lift a ball a height h, it has a potential energy of mgh, where m is its mas and g is the acceleration of gravity. When release the ball as it falls (1) the height decreases, decreasing the potential energy and (2) the ball accelerates increasing its velocity and therefore increasing its kinetic energy (the kinetic energy is mv^2/2, where v is the velocity).
