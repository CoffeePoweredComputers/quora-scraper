            "answer_text": "The proteins formed inside the cells have a kind of \u201csignal sequence\u201d attached to them, present mostly at their N-terminals. With the help of this signal sequence the proteins end up being at different places inside the cell. The signal sequences in some cases are even modified in a process called post-translational modification to enable their transport. A particular signal sequence of the protein helps them to be inside an organelle like mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum(ER) etc and others enable them to get transported outside the cell or to the cell membrane using golgi apparatus as a kind of vehicle. Some proteins even have more than one signal sequence in order to enable their entry at a particular location inside an organelle. For example, a protein with a particular signal sequence gets to the membrane of mitochondria or nucleus and with another signal sequence (present within the protein itself) gets inside the organelle where it is required for its function. Along all this transport the proteins are protected against their interactions with the surrounding macromolecules by a special class of proteins called chaperones. A protein\u2019s journey from cytosol to ER may be aided by one class of chaperone and after its entry into the ER another chaperone gets to protect it, then another and so on till the protein reaches its destination. There are transporters present on the surface of the organelles like mitochondria and others which enable entry of protein into them and eventually cleaving off the protein\u2019s signal sequence as the proteins reach their destinations. There are many known methods of transport and translocation of proteins inside (to the organelles) and outside of the cells. However, the signal sequences are the major players responsible for the presence of proteins at locations where they need to be. Hope it helps! ",

The ribbon-like protein structures are already pre-existed even before mitosis, just like fetus developing into full grown infant inside the womb, or a chicken egg develops into chick. The life blue prints orchestrated the development of any living things from beginning to the end. ",
