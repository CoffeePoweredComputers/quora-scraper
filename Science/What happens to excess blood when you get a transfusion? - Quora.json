            "answer_text": "There's always a small amount of blood left in the bag, but they transfuse the whole unit unless the doctor requests a half unit (Very rare). The only time blood isn't finished with any regularity is if there is a transfusion reaction. In that case, the transfusion is stopped, and a standardized work up is done to try to find a cause\u2014 like repeat cross match to see if an antibody was missed somehow or cultures to see if there was bacterial contamination, plus another check to make sure the right unit was administered. Any volume not going into the patient usually goes in bio waste bins for incineration. Occasionally a unit is sent to the floor and not transfused at all; if it is sent back right away, it can be put back in the fridge and possibly used later for someone else. ",
