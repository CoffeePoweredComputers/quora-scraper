            "answer_text": "A solute is a substance that is dissolved in a solvent. A solvent is a substance that dissolves a solute in its intermolecular spaces. A solution is a homogeneous mixture containing in it one or more solutes. Solute + Solvent = Solution Solute = Solution \u2013 Solvent Solvent = Solution \u2013 Solute Dissolved in a solvent, the solute assumes the characteristics of the solvent. A solute and a solvent assume the characteristics of a solution. A solute, a solvent and a solution are \u2013 thus \u2013 interrelated. A solute is a component of a solvent which, upon getting dissolved, changes its form and loses its original characteristics. Solute is usually in smaller amounts in the solvent. A solvent has a power of dissolving a solute in it, forming a solution. A solvent when dissolves a solute in it does not change its state. However there is a loss in its original characteristics. In a solution it is only the solute that loses its state (from a solid to a liquid, for example) Units to measure a solution: mg/ litre; g/kg; ppm (parts per million); ppb (parts per billion). ",

            "answer_text": "The solvent is always liquid and is usually in excess. The solute is usually solid but soluble to some extent in the solvent. Water is the commonest solvent with which to make a solution but the solute is not always freely soluble depending on its properties. For example iodine is sparingly soluble in water giving a very pale brown solution. The solubility increase when you add ethanol to give and typical intense dark brown solution known as a tincture. Calcium sulphate is not very soluble in water but it would still be classed as the solute in permanently hard water. Sucrose is very soluble in water and a lot of the solute can be added to the solvent water to make a saturated solution, in other words until no more sucrose will dissolve. In fact sucrose may be the larger component in that situation and outweigh the solvent. Just looked that up and the solubility is 200g% (200g/100ml water) The amount of solute is more than the solvent in this case Obviously some liquids are miscible with each other but you would be stretching it to suggest one was a solute and the other a solvent, because in that case they are mutually soluble, for example water and ethanol as above, maybe hexane and ethyl acetate.
