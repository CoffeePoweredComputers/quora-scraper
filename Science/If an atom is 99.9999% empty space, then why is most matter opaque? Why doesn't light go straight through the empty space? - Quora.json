            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure I like any of these answers too much. They all attempt to mix classical and quantum reasoning. Classically, the answer is that light is an electromagnetic radiation field! It is not localized at points in space. Classically, an atom is made up of a bunch of interacting, \u201cpoint\u201d charges (where the quotes are so I don\u2019t have to discuss radiation reaction, preacceleration, and other really advanced topics in Classical Electrodynamics \u2014 CED) that are in some sort of solar-system-like orbits that \u201cmagically\u201d do not radiate (again, deliberate quotes \u2014 such orbits contradict Maxwell\u2019s equations, the classical field theory that describes electrodynamics, and it is usually assumed that the nucleus is pointlike and massive, while the electrons are smeared out in space and have no observable dynamical multipolar moments that would then perforce radiate). Any such atom will polarize in an external field. Polarized, it generates a field of its own. Polarized by a time-varying electromagnetic field, it generates a time-varying electromagnetic field of its own with a spectral response that depends on the (semi)classical model one is using for the atom. This time-varying electromagnetic field reradiates power in exactly the right way to remove forward directed energy from the incident EM field, and scatter it to the sides. This general description is given in any classical electrodynamics textbook at the intermediate level on up, and is given in considerable detail in graduate textbooks such as J. D. Jackson\u2019s Classical Electrodynamics. So in purely classical models with a moderately inconsistent, but reasonable, model for the atom (such as the Lorentz oscillator model, see e.g. http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/phy319/phy319.pdf section 9.3 or google up a reference for yourself) there is no paradox because the \u201cempty space\u201d simply represents the smearing out of the electron charge into a semiclassical density of some sort. In quantum electrodynamics (QED) it is (as several replies DID note) not correct to say that the atom is mostly empty space. However, it is equally incorrect to assert that the electromagnetic field consists of localized photons. This is difficult to explain in words; the best one can do is state that the best description one can come up with the for quantum dynamics of a single atom interacting with an electromagnetic field \u2014 one that depends very much on the assumptions made for the preparation of both of these things together \u2014 describes both the electromagnetic field and the atom as wavefunctions. Or (to use a different, but arguably more descriptive name for wavefunction) probability amplitudes. Or (in an arguably better representation for doing QED) a density operator or density matrix. Now for the hard part. Just what are these things (whatever \u201cpicture\u201d one uses to analyze the problem) and how are they interpreted? They are complex functions\u2026Supported on all space (usually called [math]\\cal{R}_3[/math] or the like)\u2026At all times (and technically, we should be building a relativistic QED from the beginning, so they are supported on all of space-time, so I\u2019m cheating a bit here but in a context where it won\u2019t matter much)\u2026Whose complex square is/are themselves functions that are\u2026Probability densities where\u2026These densities are usually strictly interpreted as the probability of measuring a particle, e.g. electron or photon, at a particular place, per unit volume. Treating these probability densities as actual charge densities is one heuristic way of arguing that the semi-classical description above is \u201creasonable\u201d if not quite consistent or correct\u2026Note well that these functions evolve completely deterministically in time in a closed system with a completely specified description and initial state. There is no randomness at all in the time evolution of quantum systems at the microscopic level, arguably less randomness than there is with classical systems that at least have deterministic chaos to wrangle with if you try to do actual arithmetic with them.Again, there is no paradox here. There is no such thing as \u201cempty space\u201d in this sort of quantum description. Indeed, there truly is no such things as a separate description of the atom(s) and the field \u2014 there is just one big unified wavefunction. If this wavefunction is initially prepared with the atom centered at some point inside a volume where the field is non-zero, the amplitudes for both will be non-zero in a significant shared fraction of the volume surrounding that point, and the probability amplitude of the dynamical solution will predict a scattering of energy from the original modes of the electromagnetic field propagating past the atom into spherical modes centered on the atom. Again, this doesn\u2019t predict specific events or measurements, it gives one the probability of measuring e.g. a scattered photon in given directions and the reduction of the probability of measuring unscattered photons in the original direction the EM field is propagating. This verbal description itself is inadequate in many ways, and I apologize. But the point is that one should either commit to the classical world \u2014 in which case an atom may be made largely of empty space, sure, but where the real problem with that isn\u2019t why/how it interacts with an external radiation field, it is why it doesn\u2019t radiate all of its energy away in [math]10^{-20}[/math] seconds or so as the electrons spiral down into the nucleus. NO description that doesn\u2019t predict that as a direct consequence of (and failure of!) classical mechanics and electrodynamics used in a single problem will be consistent, and the empty space problem is then the least of your worries as the Universe dies an instant, permanent, violent heat death in a huge spasm of radiation. Or, sure, go with relativistic QED, in which case the question never arises in the first place, because the atom is no longer a bunch of marbles orbiting a central bowling ball and the field is, well, a highly abstract mathematical entity and the correct equations of motion for the unitary time evolution of the closed system is both impossible to solve exactly and not terribly easy to even interpret in classical ideas and words\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how an answer that\u2019s so wrong, gets nearly 6500 upvotes. Seriously, who\u2019s upvoting these answers?  First, let me tell you what light actually is. Let\u2019s say there are two elementary charged particles (they could be electrons, protons or quarks). These charged particles, by their nature of being electrically charged, emit an electric field. The electric field emitted by each particle mutually acts on the other.  The electric field also depends entirely on the distance between the particles. Since these are three dimensional space, the strength and direction of the electric field between the two particles depends on their positions. So when you move one charge, the electric field around it changes and it is felt by the other charge. This change in the electric field isn\u2019t instantaneous but broadcast at a precise speed. I\u2019ll get to this speed in a moment.  If both particles are initially stationary, basic mechanics tells us that you have to accelerate it to get to another location. And what happens to an electric field when you accelerate it? One can deduce this using Maxwell\u2019s equations. The nature of the electric field (and magnetic field which also depends on the electric field) is describe by Maxwell\u2019s equation, which are the fundamental equations of electro-magnetism. Here are the Maxwell\u2019s equations:  For an accelerating charge, one can see that the following equation is true:  Further reading [1] at the end presents the whole mathematical routine as well as serves as credits for the equation\u2019s images. Now what can you tell about this equation? It turns out that this is precisely the equation for a wave. A wave that\u2019s travelling at [math]c[/math] . And [math]c [/math] is, wait for it, the speed of light!  So, light is nothing more than information of the change in electric and magnetic field dissipated by an accelerating charge. Note: if someone has something to say to me about double quantization[2] , quantum electrodynamics [3] and field theory[4], I don\u2019t know anything about these sub-fields and you are encouraged to write your own answer. The approach here is semi-classical. Now you understood what light essentially is, let\u2019s see what happens in the case of atoms. Atoms are in a very, very, very loose sense electrons orbiting around the nucleus like a, sigh again the very, planet orbiting the sun. And according to quantum mechanics, these orbits can have only certain shapes.  (Image from Atomic orbital - Wikipedia) Since electrons are orbiting the nucleus, they don\u2019t accelerate*.(*See this comment). They don\u2019t emit light.  But what happens when they shift orbits? Below is an example of an electron in a higher orbit.  When it shifts to a lower orbit (either by spontaneous emission or stimulated emission), it accelerates and decelerates and winds up being stable. As it accelerates (and decelerates) it changes the electric field it emits. And as said before, this wavy change is broadcast at a fixed speed [math]c[/math] \u201cthe speed of light\u201d to every other particle in the universe.  The change in electric field has an energy to it that\u2019s precisely the same as the difference between the energies of the higher and lower orbit. And it\u2019s because of the law of conservation of energy. Let\u2019s say there is another atom. When it feels the wavy change in the electric field it reacts by shifting its orbit. But, as said earlier, according to quantum mechanics an electron can only take up orbits of certain shapes. That means it can only take up an orbit whose energy difference is same as the energy of the change in electric field.  If there are no orbits within that energy range, light just passes through!  As you can see, whether light passes through an atom has absolutely nothing to do with being a \u201cfence-like\u201d filter. Leave alone radio waves, that answer doesn\u2019t explain why visible light that\u2019s over half a micron in wavelength gets absorbed by atoms that are around an angstrom in size! (1/2 the bond length). On top of that, an atom (by itself!) doesn\u2019t really have a size. Since the orbitals extend to infinity, the size of an atom is actually the same as that of the entire universe! Even considering what I\u2019ve said, the picture isn\u2019t that simple. First, an electron shifting orbits (technical word orbital) isn\u2019t the only way an atom interacts with light: off the top of my head, the effect on the interaction of light is influenced when two or more bonded atoms stretch, vibrate, form bands of quasi-continuously varying orbitals & energy levels, free electrons in those bands change movement, their spins become unequal, the nucleus influences their spins, etc. and even weird things happen when you go to 4.2 kelvin or nano-pattern things, (excitons for example!) and many more. Second, absorption/emission is only one way matter interacts with light. Light also diffracts, scatters, refracts and reflects. Finally, it isn\u2019t easy to calculate what precisely happens when light is shone on atoms. Sure the transition rates using the dipole approximation gives a rough picture or a decent picture in some cases, but its never that simple. And that\u2019s what keeps physicists, chemists and materials scientists in universities everywhere busy. Finally, I\u2019d like to say this: an atom is NOT 99.999% empty. That is a myth. You can read about it here: Marceline Hosenback's answer to How can atoms be 97% empty space? Isn\u2019t everything made out of \u201csomething\u201d?
