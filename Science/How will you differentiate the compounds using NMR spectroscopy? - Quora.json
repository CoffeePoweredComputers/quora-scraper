            "answer_text": "Perhaps this question requires some more hands-on explanation. These molecules are acetone and propanal:  As you can see, these molecules seem to be fairly similar. As a matter of fact, they are isomers: the carbonyl group is in the center of the acetone molecule, but is in the end of the propanal molecule. Their 1H-NMR spectra, however, couldn't look any more different:  1H-NMR spectrum of acetone (SDBS No. 319)  1H-NMR of propanal (SDBS No. 2899) The position of the carbonyl group makes a big difference. In the acetone case, the molecule is symmetric and all the hydrogen atoms display the same chemical shift approximately at 2 ppm. In the propanal case, the molecule is not symmetric and the chemical shifts of the methylene and methyl hydrogen atoms will be different. The first noticeable difference is the presence of a very unshielded peak approximately 9.7 ppm, a singlet corresponding to the hydrogen bonded directly to the carbonyl. By shielded I mean \u201cshielded from the magnetic field by the electrons in this particular chemical environment.\u201d At approximately 2.5 ppm one sees a quartet which means that this signal corresponds to a methylene group. The triplet at approximately 1 ppm corresponds to a methyl group. The methylene group is slightly more unshielded than the methyl group because it is directly bonded to the electron withdrawing carbonyl group. As you can see, minimal differences \u2014 such as different positions of a carbonyl group \u2014 can generate huge differences in NMR spectra. ",
