Evaluation: Quantify resources spent on different media resources used and quantify public response based on which media outlets used to reach out in regards to the campaign Measurement: Create graphs/charts/tables to show the correlation between media outlets and positive/negative response from the public Assessment: Analyze the graphs/charts/tables to determine what is working to reach the intended population, what is having no effect and what may be having a negative effect. Correct your procedure as needed to determine the most effective procedure going forward. ",
