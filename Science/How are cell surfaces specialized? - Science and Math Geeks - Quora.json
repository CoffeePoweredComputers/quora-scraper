            "answer_text": "From what I remember from AP Biology class, structure dictates function. Specialized cells have specific receptors and pathways embedded in their membranes to allow for specific functions, among many other distinguishing factors. One molecule binding to a receptor on a cell\u2019s surface can result in a myriad of chain reactions inside the cell. A well-known example of this is one of the processes that creates a cancer cell - harmful UV rays can alter a pathway to be activated all the time, where it would normally depend on the requisite molecule being present.
