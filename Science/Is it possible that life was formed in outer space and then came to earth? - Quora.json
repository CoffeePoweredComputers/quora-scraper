            "answer_text": "It is doubtful that life could spawn in outer space but it could have developed on another world and then been transported to Earth. There is a radical theory called panspermia which states that life developed on Mars, was struck by an asteroid, and pieces of the planet were hurled into space that made their way to Earth. Primitive organisms survived to seed our planet with life. Meteorite ALH84001, is believed to have once been a part of Mars and to contain fossil evidence that primitive life may have existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. The rock is a portion of a meteorite that was dislodged from Mars by a huge impact about 16 million years ago and land fell on Antarctica 13,000 years ago. The meteorite was found in the Allan Hills ice field, Antarctica, by an annual expedition of the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Meteorite Program in 1984. It is preserved for study at the Johnson Space Center's Meteorite Processing Laboratory in Houston.  There is also a hint of biological organism in this meteorite and features that resemble bacteria.  Another theory suggests that the building blocks for life came from space on board asteroids and comets.  ",

Another is it could have first started on Mars and then an asteroid kicked a piece of rock that somehow ended up on earth. I\u2019m in that camp that believes God is the author of DNA. Seriously, DNA, and RNA before it, is incredible. It is far more complex than a silicon based computer. It simply isn\u2019t possible for me to fathom random chance pulling together an RNA based life form. And without RNA you don\u2019t have evolution. But I haven\u2019t studied the various first life theories in a couple decades. At that time they really weren\u2019t worth much consideration. ",

Amino acids form in space and rain down on us by the ton, but the few chemical precusors to life that we have identified need a protected, planetary environment in which to occur, and an extended era of relative stability to permit the slow process of pre-biological chemical evolution to produce the first cells. It does seem likely the life will apear anywhere conditions allow, but those condictions are not in space. ",

Any alien would then see that Earth\u2019s atmosphere contains about 20% free oxygen. Oxygen does not like being free. It likes to oxidise. It likes to be rust, CO2, water, silicon oxide, anything but free oxygen. So if there is free oxygen, something is happening that replenishes the supply, or it would be long gone. If you are a wee bit closer, like in orbit (which is in outer space: it begins above the K\u00e1rman line, which is 100 km up), is to look out the window on the night side.  That doesn\u2019t look that much like natural light, neither fires, volcanic eruption or weather phenomena. ",

If you can see the colors of the continents (beyond the clouds) the change of seasons should be visible. But if you can see that, you should be able to see the lights of civilization, too. So either way. From further away, an analysis of the chemicals in the atmosphere might prove there\u2019s life. There\u2019s certainly a lot of strange chemicals there, so if they are detected, that should indicate our presence. Otherwise, a good radio-telescope could pick up our broadcasts. The \u201cbroadcast envelope\u201d is close to a hundred light years out, although the power of the signals would be decreasing the further out you go and you\u2019d need a really good receiver to pick up the Chase and Sanborn show staring Egar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy (and only be 78 light years away).
