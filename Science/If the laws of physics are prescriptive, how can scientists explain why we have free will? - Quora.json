            "answer_text": "I suppose the laws of physics are prescriptive in the sense that if we consider them correct we would not want to believe something that conflicts with them, since it would be irrational to do so. And the short answer is that the scientific world view has no room for the notion of free will. There is a philosophical position, compatibilism, which holds that determinism and a diminished version of free will are compatible. In a nutshell it views personal freedom as an absence to physical or human constraints which allows all the freedom that one could want or even conceive. Kant, William James and Elizabeth Anscombe were scornful of this position as inadequate for grounding moral behaviour. Anscombe in her paper Causality and Determination memorably described it as gobbledegook. Let me take a contemporary physicist, Sabine Hossenfelder and see what she thinks. She has some excellent videos on YouTube on Physics and broader scientific issues. One video is called 'You don't have free will, but don't worry.' It is short, clear and utterly dogmatic. To me it shows an over-confidence in the power of science to explain everything. It is a cogent position, hence its appeal, but in my opinion shows an ignorance or lack of understanding of the great philosophy of the past, and also a lack of understanding of the value of great art. Hossenfelder, quite rightly explains that quantum indeterminacy does nothing to provide a loophole through which an account of free will can be squeezed. Radical unpredictability at the subatomic level may dent the claims for a deterministic universe, but does not provide a way of giving an account of self-actuating selves. What an account of free will requires is an explanation of how a person, when confronted by a moral dilemma, is able to act in a way for which there is no sufficient cause, before resolving the dilemma through action. And this hightlights the fundamental premise on which the physical sciences are based, the Principle of Sufficient Reason. It was first formulated by Leibniz, and the shortest form is Nihil est sine rationem. Nothing is without reason, or nothing exists without a reason/cause. Leibni is not very rigorous indistinguishing reason from cause. At any rate Causality is the necessitating principle which is assumed when we predict the future from past precedents, the assumption of the regularity of nature which we rely on to navigate the world. Heidegger asked 'Is there a sufficient reason to believe in the principle of sufficient reason?' Of course there can't be, because it is a generalisation of our experience of the regularity of nature. I am clear that I cannot provide an account of free will in the strong sense described above. I take comfort in the fact that there is a whole tradition of thought which Hossenfelder ignores in her smart but superficial video on free will. It might be said to begin its modern secular form with Kant and continues through Schopenhauer, William James and C.S. Peirce in the nineteenth century, and through Wittgenstein and Heidegger in the twentieth century. It should also be added that that the tragedies of Shakespeare, and the examinations of the depths of the human psyche in Dostoevsky and Proust would not have the profound interest that they do, for anyone who felt that out behaviour was determined by a combination of our genetic makeup and environmental experiences playing out in us as we age. What are the titanic struggles we seem to experience vicariously as we listen to Beethoven? For a determinist existential angst can only be the product of the whirring of the neurological machinery, the heat/emotion a byproduct of the nervous sustem as it calculates a path forward. Physics has no account of consciousness other than to describe it as a function of neurological complexity. But what possible role can be assigned to consciousness in a fully determined being? Because if the nervous system does the steering, consciousness must be a passive spectator. As Wittgenstein said in the Tractatus, ' We feel that if all possible scientific questions have been answered, the problems of life will still not have been touched at all.' And on the will, 'Doing itself seems not to have any volume of experience. It seems like an extensionless point, the point of a needle. This point seems to be the real agent. And the phenomenal happenings only to be the consequences of this acting. I do. . . seems to have a definite sense separate from all experience.' Let me conclude by quoting the great physicist Max Planck against the superficial plausibility of Hossenfelder's breezy dismissal of free will. 'I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing presupposes consciousness.' To me this seems no more than a logical truth with which many physicists have not wrestled sufficiently. Now, it may be that Hossenfelder would dismiss Planck's remark as a specimen of German idealism, or neo-Kantianism, but I would feel equally inclined to dismiss her view of the free will question as an example of Scientism or Reductive Materialism. Morality, if it is anything, shakes us up as a series of imperatives about how we should act. ",
