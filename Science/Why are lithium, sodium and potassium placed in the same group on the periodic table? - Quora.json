            "answer_text": "This is an answer that can be answered from different angles. First up, each are Metals. So they belong in the same group. Secondly, the particular group you refer to (group one) are actually the most reactive Metals on the periodic table. These are the elements that most easily loose their electron from their outer valence shell (if you look at this relectron configuration, you will see that their outer valence shell is composed of one electron each) when they form a positive ion. This is because there isn't a large enough effective nuclear attractive charge on the nucleus in each of these elements - this means that the nucleus lacks enough electrostatic attraction to hold onto it\u2019s valence electrons as well as other metals can do. Remember that in a reaction, the only electrons that are important are the valence (outer shell) electrons m. So they each very easily give up their valence electron in a reaction to form a positive ion. These are the most easily reactive in this way. Finally, if you're still a hit stuck, flick me a message as I'll be happy to help more!! ",

            "answer_text": "Elements in the periodic table are grouped according to their valence electrons \u2014 the electrons in the outermost shell(s)/orbital(s) that can participate in chemical bonds (both ionic and covalent bonds). This grouping is useful because the valence electrons largely dictate how a given element will react as well as other properties. To illustrate how this grouping works, the first group indicates elements with one lonely electron in its outermost shell. This electron can easily be given up to make the element \u201ccomplete\u201d in the sense that there are no partially filled orbitals. The next group has two electrons that can be given up to be \u201ccomplete\u201d. Going from the other direction, the last group correspond to the \u201cnoble gases\u201d which have fully saturated their outermost shell and are \u201ccomplete\u201d (and, therefore, rarely react). Just before the noble gases are elements that just need one more electron to be complete; these elements often grab and gobble up that extra electron from other elements easily and are also reactive, but in a different way, compared with the first group.
