            "answer_text": "Hi Anchal Singh Infact not the position but the reference point or frame of reference (FOR) must be defined before describing motion of an object. This is because motion is a relative concept hence to describe it uniquely without any confusion I first have to describe the point in respect of which I may make observations. For example, in order to describe the position of a given object I\u2019ll need a fixed point with respect to which I\u2019ll make the measurements of distance so of the object. Now, all other quanantities for describing motion like velocity, acceleration etc may or may not directly depend on position. Hope it helps Enjoy Stay safe indoors ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. You can describe the motion of an object w/o knowing where it is. Motion is movement through space, but you don\u2019t need to know where that space is to describe the pattern of motion. Perhaps you thinking of classical initial conditions of time, position and velocity that determine the trajectory of an object? ",
