            "answer_text": "What does \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d mean? I would like to know from those who wear MAGA hats and support this ideology. Wow. OK, I\u2019ll give it a shot. Here is the thing. People hate politicians. Once you understand that, you can start to comprehend why people like Trump. Yes he is corrupt and entitled. However, if you understand that people hate politicians, you will already know that all politicians are corrupt. All politicians get money from special interest groups. All politicians lie while campaigning, and can rarely deliver on those promises. All politicians get in office and realize they can rarely make everyone happy and therefore can rarely make any real difference. All politicians are \u2018politically correct\u2019 in publicly saying on those things that are \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018polite\u2019 as to not offend anyone. Trump is not a politician. He is rude, and vulgar, and doesn\u2019t really like people. The one thing that Trump is, which makes him similar to anyone who runs for office, he is a patriot. Whether Democrat or Republican, anyone who sacrifices and puts up with D.C., does so because they truly believe they are making a difference. They really believe they can fix the numerous issues with the country. Unemployment. Jobs going overseas. Corruption. Foreign nations stealing our intellectual property. Terrorism. Trade. The bankrupt entitlement system like Social Security. Take your pick. Everyone wants to fix them when it politically expedient and then run as far away when they become bricks that drown your campaign. Trump came in talking like no politician. He didn\u2019t care what people thought of him. He made big promises that other candidates and most of the media thought were crazy. Every president has tried to fix the Mexican border and drug war. Obama, Regan, both Bushs. They all tried and failed to control the influx of immigrants. Trump came out and said he wanted to build a wall and eliminate immigration loopholes. Most people laughed and said it would never happen. Most people also said he would not get elected, not leave Nafta, not pass the tax bill, not pass all of the drug laws, not stand up to China or North Korea, and would never actually stand up to the UN. He did things like pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reauthorized Perkins CTE, added over $6 billion more dollars to fight the opiod trade in the US. He made claims and followed through. Make America Great is about fixing all the crap that is broken. It is about allowing someone into office who will actual do what they say they will without making apologies. That is why Trump will not give in on the border. To him it is a moral issue. He gave his word and like his other promises, he will not back down. People voted for Trump because they figured that election after election after election have gone by with politicians making the same promises and doing nothing. Crime and poverty stays the same, more kids are addicted, and other countries are passing America at an alarming rate. Why not give Trump a try. Ironically, despite his innumerable flaws, he seems to have been the right person at the right time to actually get the job done. Yes, he gave way and lessened restrictions on Russia, but the truth is that they said Clinton would have caused a war because of her stance. However that is the thing with Trump. It is not about making the world a better place or helping everyone else. It is about fixing our own crap first. That is what make America great is. Fix our roads, help our kids, help the unemployed, and fix our economy. ",

            "answer_text": "It is the election slogan of Mr. Trump during the 2016 elections. In literal terms, what a great slogan. It means to tell the American people that everything that you have known or seen before Mr. Trump had filed for his nomination, America was in shatters. It was going down. The normal people were becoming poor and losing their jobs and houses. However, little of that is true. Look at the unemployment statistics and the year 2016 was the best year in falling unemployment rate. In perceived terms, it is as fake as any politicians slogan could be. America was great in the 20th century and is still the greatest nation on earth by some margin. Read my answer Vivek Dahiya's answer to Why do you think America is the best country in the world? But, now that the elections are over and Trump has won, it is far easier to comprehend it. The slogan is meant for people who are not progressives and have either lost their jobs or businesses in the last 5 to 10 years. The majority of them belongs to the rust belt states where manufacturing jobs have evaporated due to the natural reasons of low cost of manufacturing to other countries. This is where Trump\u2019s team was instrumental in undertstanding the real under current. The people who were not happy with the democratic administration of Barack Obama. These were the people who because of losing jobs or businesses can vote for any candidate except the democratic candidates. So, let us now talk about how America can become much more greater and keep the politics aside for a minute. When America will stop bombing countries and stop making wars. The wars in the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s were the single most reasons why China was needed to pay the government debt and keep the government functional.When America will stop pretending that it can grow by making the same mistakes of discriminating against the immigrants. The recent elections were in a sort an election of the white supremacy that some Americans were dying to bring back.When America will provide equal rights for women. Even today, being the most powerful country in the world, American women are paid less for the same jobs than their male counterparts do.When America stop this non-sense of reverse brain drain by discouraging more and more high skilled and educated people to look for alternate geographies to live and work for. The situation is so worse that the high skilled people are turning to other countries like Canada and Australia for finding better job opportunities and relaxed visa rules.When America will stop the gun violence by taking away the guns from the hands of normal people. This is something that no nation on this earth could ever understand as to why a normal household needs to have guns. Not good for the safety of right minded people.When America will stop the loot going on in almost all the universities and colleges by bringing down the exorbitant tuition fees so that students can get higher education at much more affordable amounts. Right now, every student is under debt that goes for an undergraduate and post graduate studies. Each one of them. That's why people are now finding it better to study in other countries with comparatively better education facilities and lower education costs.You stay great when you stop pretending that everything is wrong with you and start to act like a mature nation.

            "answer_text": "I really don`t know. Gathering information from what Trump supporters have said, I deduce that they mean a time when the U.S was strong militarily, the economy was booming thanks to a strong labor force fueled by mining and manufacturing, feminism wasn`t a thing, and people generally fighting for their rights as human beings wasn`t a thing either. A simpler time, when Christian values reigned supreme and people took life on the chin. Probably a time before Jimmy Carter, a self-proclaimed \u201cnice guy\u201d. It was during his presidency that manufacturing peaked, after all. Except, before Jimmy Carter you had a war in Southeast Asia that was majorly unpopular, worsened by the biggest crook possibly ever to inhabit the White House (except for Trump himself, maybe). These Trumpers are also big on honesty in politics- didn`t have that 50 years ago! Going back further, we had MLK, Malcolm X and others constantly fighting for black civil rights, so so much for no one complaining and taking life on the chin. Feminism was also the rage, and was largely incorporated into the black civil rights movement. Double oops. OK, so they must mean the 50s, a quiet, prosperous time for (white) Americans. The men went to work and the wives stayed home, like the Bible intended. Oh, but wait; corporations were taxed at over 90%\u2026.by a Republican president?? No, no, that can`t be it. Ooo\u2026this is tough. Given the lack of utopia in recent American history I can only assume they mean a pre-war time, when black people were doing their own thing and whites didn`t have to worry about them and working people were the face of the labor force. Or, even further back, when we were fighting a war over whether or not the southern half of the country was allowed to own slaves and leave the union. Well, that was a pretty discordant time, too\u2026. You get the point. America has always had problems as a nation. With all these ethnicities and races and religions running around, of course they clashed. What these Trump supporters want is to Make America Great Again FOR THEM. The things they complain about and claim to have voted Trump in to fix are the same things they`re disparaging young, working people in other industries for wanting. Or feminists and POC for prostesting. I guess Make America Great Again For Us wouldn`t fit on the cap. ",

            "answer_text": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d is very clever. It said \u201cI will fix what you believe is broken (fill in the blank) about America.\u201d First it appealed to all those voters (70%) that believed the country was going in the wrong direction.It was a clarion call to all of those voters dissatisfied with eight years of Barack Obama as President - half of the country and nearly 100% of Republicans that Trump was trying to win over.It was a dog whistle method of courting all voters that are upset about what has changed in the America - gay marriage, expansion of women\u2019s roles including in the military, inter-racial marriage, growth of cities and decline of rural area economies, immigrants, loss of manufacturing jobs, increasing population of people of color and so on.\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d takes many Americans back to a past utopian time. This works because people forget the bad times and remember the good times of the \u201cgood ole days\u201d. For example, when people reflect on growing up in the 1950\u2019s they will remember small towns, kids playing in the street, less crime, a whiter America, women staying at home etc. They will not remember the poverty of older Americans that had no Medicare, the segregation and discrimination Black Americans suffered, the abject and widespread poverty of Appalachia, the fears of the Cold War and nuclear holocaust etc. It is about a \u201cfeeling\u201d not a logical and factual evaluation of whether America of 2016 is a better place than America of 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s. It was a very effectives political slogan at this point in history for an outsider candidate like Donald Trump. To Trump\u2019s creative credit his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d continues to have good utility to mask the actual negative effectives of Trump policies. Even though repeal of the Affordable Care Act would cause 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance, Trump and supporters can trumpet their slogan loudly and repeatedly to create their own reality. Trump is the consummate salesman and has formulated a very effective slogan. ",

            "answer_text": "Before we talk about how to make America great again, we have to know what makes America not great anymore.   This video, the beginning scene of the HBO series The Newsroom explains the exactly what the cause is: after the Cold War we think we have no threatening enemies left. We have been so arrogant and we have lost our incentives of competition with the rest of the world.  We are 7th in literacy because our public schools allow our students to drop out a class they feel too hard to learn; We are 49th in life expectancy despite we have the best hospitals because we have a quarter of population that are horribly obese.  These are not the problems, the problem is: we can't blame those stupid teenagers who fail to learn the fundamentals of math, science and literature; we can't even call someone fat even when he or she is 300 pounds and needs to take two seats in a row in the subway.  And they all come from political correctness.  That's what Trump is talking about all the time. We have to be winners, we can't be losers in the world! All races are equal, all genders are equal, people are born with it. Are people born stupid? Are people born fat? Sure some of them are, but only the minorities. Most people fail classes and get obese because of their own problem, not the genes.  Now anyone in our high school who fail to pass a mandatory subject can claim he or she has learning disability, and it has been an excuse for laziness. We have 13% of students receiving special help and it still doesn't make those students performing well in the exams. When international students from eastern Asia feel sad about getting a 2000 on SAT, most American students feel proud when they get a 1600. Obesity doesn't come naturally with high income. Japan has high income but very few Japanese are obese. They know it's important to eat healthy food and exercise to keep themselves slim because if they are obese, they will be laughed at. So many Americans are obese simply because no one stands out in front of them and say \"hey you are overweight!\", and they will just wrongfully think it's normal and natural to be obese, or even worse they might not realize that they are overweight! Now Trump is the only candidate that stands out, yelling to the crowd:\"Hey guys we need to wake up! We are not great anymore! We can't be a country that so many people are losers!\" A soldier who got captured was awarded the national hero and became the Republican nominee. Such thing could never happen in Asia.  Why could Japan quickly rebuild itself from ruins and became the second in the world in gross GDP in less than 30 years from WWII? Why could China do the same thing within a generation after the cultural revolution?  Because they like soldiers that weren't captured.  Let's look at mother nature. A tree produces thousands of seeds every year, and only a few of them can grow into another big tree; A fish produces thousands of eggs at the breeding season, and a few of them can survive to adulthood without being eaten by a predator; Hundreds of millions of sperms compete to get the one single egg, all others die.  We are a great species because millions of years ago, only the smarter ones of us survived from climate change in Africa. Those who are smarter gradually differentiate ourselves from apes and evolved into homo sapiens.  We are a great civilization because we won survived during the plagues and wars hundreds of years ago. Those who failed to do so have been buried underground and became history.  We are a great country because we won the independent war, we won the civil war, and we won both world wars. If we lost, America won't be great ever since.  But after that, we lost everything. We have the most powerful army and navy in the world, but we still lost the Korean war, we lost the Vietnam war, and we can't even beat a group of terrorists! Now how can you call our country to be the greatest in the world?! It's competition that makes any individual great, it's competition that makes only the strongest people survive, and those individuals altogether makes the country great. We are great not because we have good facilities for the handicapped, we are great because we have the smartest scientists in our college labs and NASA.  Caring the disadvantaged groups is a very important and essential moral of modern society, but it's not what makes the country great. If we only focus on sympathy and tolerant, and consider competition as hostile and uncivilized behaviors, we will keep losing this country, until the day we really wake up.   ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is a sound bite for the \u201cTwitter\u201d generation. Really think of any advertisement you see or hear. Usually there is a saying. What Trump did was use his business and advertising skills to tape into a large segment of the US populace. Here are a few examples of memorable tag lines: \"Fly the friendly skies\" \u2014 United Airlines (Leo Burnett)\"Where's the beef?\" \u2014 Wendy's (Cliff Freeman, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample)\"We bring good things to life\" \u2014 GE (Phil Dusenberry, DDBO)\"Don't leave home without it\" \u2014 American Express Card (Bruce Silverman, Ogilvy & Mather)\"Be All You Can Be\" \u2014 U.S. Army (Earl Carter, N.W. Ayer)\"Just do it\" \u2014 Nike (Dan Wieden)\"Must-see TV\" \u2014 NBC (Vince Manze)\"Breakfast of champions\" \u2014 Wheaties (Knox Reeves, Blackett-Sample-Gummert)\"Trust the Midas touch\" \u2014 Midas (Wells, Rich, Greene)It is memorable, appeals to emotions and nostalgia. I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine who is Black. He said that phrase really cannot apply to black Americans. Why? \u201cWell, tell me when America was so \u201cgreat\u201d how was it great for blacks?\u201d He has a point. No matter what era of history I would bring up, he would discuss the challenges of black America\u2026. I do think this saying though hearkens back to post WWII, when soldiers came home. Jobs were plentiful, manufacturing was high, middle class pay was very good even or those without an education, product prices were cheap, land/homes were affordable, college was affordable, we were expanding technology and manufacturing, etc\u2026 highways were being built out so Americans were getting the freedom of mobility. By the time our discussion closed, we decided \u201cMake America Great for ALL\u201d. Would be better. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s just a slogan with great emotional appeal apparently but no real substance. There are several people who think the world they knew is slipping away from them. Partially it\u2019s economics \u2014 flat income \u2014 but that\u2019s not the most important feature. It\u2019s the sense that the Other is taking over \u2014 all those Muslims, Hispanics, homosexuals, and African Americans getting privileges they haven\u2019t earned and who are often violent to boot.. The moral rules they grew up with seem no longer to be sacred, Christianity is threatened, there are too many people who don\u2019t share our values who seem to be in control. If you think about it \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d ought to appeal mostly to young people since they have the most to benefit from alleged improvements. Instead it\u2019s the older folks who bought into the rhetoric, people who wish we could return to the 50s and early 60s when life was a lot more simple and there wasn\u2019t all this questioning of morals and standards. The Other stayed in his place. These feelings have been fairly significant for some time, and had a big role to play in the attempts to portray Obama as the ultimate Other \u2014 not born in the US probably a Muslim, etc. It is no accident that one of the best predictors of Trump support after age and education is negative racial attitudes. This is not racism in the conventional sense. It is not hatred; rather it\u2019s more like wariness or a strong sense of discomfort, even fear. So the dog whistle appeals sell among those who genuinely don\u2019t feel that they hate blacks. Most of them don\u2019t, but hidden in that appeal is the notion hat minorities are eroding conventional moral standards and self-reliance. So like Nixon\u2019s war on crime and Reagan\u2019s war on drugs, both of which were dog whistle slogans targeting race, lyou get to have your cake and eat it too. I don\u2019t hate minorities, but they really don\u2019t follow the rules so I can express negative views without focusing on race as such. It just happens that the people who are out of touch with conventional morality happen to be minorities, or at least that\u2019s the logic. Of course by any identifiable standards America is in pretty good shape. But that \u201csuccess\u201d if you want to call it that is not evenly spread. Trump\u2019s slogan was actually very clever. He didn\u2019t need to deal with facts; instead he just made up a bunch of stuff that \u201cproved\u201d we were decline. The appeal was purely emotional which is why it\u2019s been so frustrating that the Trumpies seem oblivious to the fact that he is selling them out and that most of his claims were easily shown to be fraudulent. But in this case his words speak much louder than his actions \u2014 often the case with emotional appeals. Democrats are now focusing on what they can do to lower income inequality and create better jobs. But that isn\u2019t the real problem. The basic issues are much deeper and are harder to confront. ",

            "answer_text": "Like all good slogans, this one can mean pretty much whatever you want it to mean.  One of Trump's strengths is that he has no real political record, and he's said all sorts of things over the years, and has made it clear that he often doesn't really mean what he says. That means that people who are  inclined to like him can project their own views onto him, broadening his appeal. However, I think that to the core Republican voters this has a pretty specific meaning.  This group deeply believes that President Obama has not only  been bad for America, but he has been purposefully bad for America, weakening the military, filling the country with illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees, giving favorable treatment to African Americans, apologizing all over the world, encouraging Muslim terrorists, oppressing Christians, and generally dissing and hurting  white people, especially white men.  This is seen as an extension of Democratic policies and social change dating back variously to the 1960's, the Civil Rights movement, or FDR's New Deal. To those people \"make America great\" means to undo those things, beginning with undoing President Obama's changes. A brilliant thing about this slogan is that it hits the very powerful nostalgia button, which is an especially good move for  older voters, who vote more than younger ones and are especially well-represented in the Republican Party.  People often look at the past as a time when the world (and the country) was much better, where there was optimism and opportunity and people were better. Funnily enough, if you ever question people about when they thought the world was great, it usually is when they were in the early 20's.  Trump's slogan allows people to imagine he will return the US to the way it was in their youth, forgetting that the thing that made it so great at the time was being young.  ",

            "answer_text": "I believe in the context the president meant it on the campaign trail and what I ascertain by his actions as peesident is a return to the rule of law and to the principles of the Constitution. The Constitution is a pretty straightforward document\u2026.and only occasionally open to interpretation. The last president felt that it was an archaic document that had outlived its usefulness. As a result he would bypass it by circumventing congress entirely and govern by executive actions. He even famously said he knew that DACA was illegal but that sis not stop him from doing it. What makes Trump different is a return to the principles that made us the premiere global superpower. Things like doing the right thing rather than the popular thing. Yes, staying in the Iran deal would have made our european allies happy, but do we really want to pump any more money into Irans economy when they use it to fund terror and test ballistic missiles with it? Obama was clearly not concerned by this but Trump is. Also becoming great again means making trade deals that are fair and equitable rather than some of the one sided deals we have had in the past. Another thing that make this country great is the strongest military on the planet. Trump has made great strides to return our combat readiness to what it used to be. We used to revere our veterans\u2026.we need to do that again. Same goes for first responders. Being great again means respecting free speech rights and not shutting down ideas that we find offensive like they do on college campuses like Cal Berkely. Being great means respecting religious freedom. No one should have to violate their religious beliefs or be put out of business by the state. Being great means taking advantage of our vast natural resources and not hampering our businesses with needless and foolish regulations. It also means making every citizen responsible for the kind of country we have. Punish criminals. Reward good behavior. Strive for excellence. Everyone should not always get a trophy! We need to return to the country we were when we stood up to evil, when we had steel in our spines, where we could go through any hardship, when we would rather die than give up our freedoms. That was a country to be proud of. That was when we were truly great! ",

He wants corporate America to basically bully the country into being allowed to do anything they want. He wants workers to report to their factory jobs everyday, carrying their lunch boxes, packed by their stay at home housewives. He wants the children of these workers to realize they are the next generation of factory workers (or forced to serve in the military), while they watch the children of rich people head off to college. He wants blacks to be put back in their place, at the back of the bus, and in their own subpar neighborhoods. He wants women to be at home, cleaning and cooking for their husbands. He wants bosses to be able to pinch their secretaries bottoms, without fear of negative reprecussions. And of course, there were no immigrants or gays in the '50's, so they need to go away today. A few migrant workers to serve as fruit pickers, gardeners for the wealthy, or to work in Trump hotels, will be fine, but the rest need to go back to wherever they came from. Gays should be forced back in the closet, so they can\u2019t indoctrine more people into their loathsome lifestyle. Oh and let's not forget, women should not have the right to make decisions regarding their bodies. That right belongs to their husband only. Abortions should be illegal, unless you are wealthy and can afford a private physician to perform the dirty deed in private. That's how Trump would make America great again. Great for him, and people that share his wealth or mindset. I personally prefer an America that progresses forward, not moves backward. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is an empty slogan that is specifically designed for people who are disaffected in various ways to project onto it. Many people who voted for Trump did so because they are disaffected in some way or frustrated with the system. The reasons for them being disaffected may come in various guises, and a lot of them are just\u2026 the struggles are real, but their idealized solutions are not realistic or are the equal to shooting the US in the foot. For instance, when Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Accords, my mother was trawling around on Facebook, and reading the comments about it. (I never read the comments, but she does.) There were a lot of people in the comments being like, \u201cGood, now maybe the coal miners\u2019 suffering will be alleviated.\u201d Jesus Christ. The coal miners. It\u2019s not that the suffering of many people in mining and manufacturing isn\u2019t real. (I am from Detroit. Trust me, I am familiar with what happens to people who manufacturing gets outsourced or whatnot.) I also am related to coal miners. However, guys\u2026 the future is not in coal. Yes, it sucks to be a coal miner and be out of work. I am also sure it sucked to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright at the time when those industries went to hell. But the future was not in blacksmithing or wheelwrighting. The solution is not to pull out of trans-national accords in order to protect coal miners. The solution is to help people transition out of coal mining into more viable industries. Get people the education and skills they need to thrive in future-looking industries. Like, for instance, I make my living mostly on the internet in a variety of verticals. I write all different kinds of advertising copy and ebooks and whatever the hell people pay me to write. I teach English both in-person and virtually. I know how to run dropshipping businesses through ebay. I build websites. I do graphic design. Whatever. I make my living through these skills. I am a skilled worker. The trouble with coal mining (and manufacturing) is that many of those jobs are unskilled. The need for unskilled labor is declining sharply. This is not going to be changed by the US pulling out of the Paris Accords. But people think it will. They are looking for a band-aid solution to the problem. They are looking to \u201cgo back\u201d to when America was \u201cgreat\u201d and coal mining was indeed a very stable and good job that could provide a living for a family on a single income. They want that back. Those days are gone, guys. They are gone. They are not coming back. It\u2019s a bunch of fuckery, is what it is. ",

He might know he could not win by popular, but when he pointed on the angers of Americans right then, he had totally stroke down Hillary Clinton. It has a very strong effect on the people. It burned the feeling of Americans, making Americans feeling that the U.S. is in a trouble time and only Trump could save the U.S.. He did. He achieved what was the goal to be.

I do not have the details in front of me, but I heard the story of a European man sent by his leader to find out why America was great. The man reportedly came to America and began his quest for his leader. He searched in America\u2019s schools, and universities. He searched in industry, medicine, science, etc., and could not find the reason for America\u2019s greatness. Then he search in America\u2019s churches; it was in the churches he reportedly found his answer. America was great because America was basically good. And if America ever ceased being good, it would be all over. The U. S. has a history of good points and bad points. We have landed on the moon, had advancements in medicine, science, and, engineering, provided literature, and offered a safe haven to people seeking relief from oppression. America also offerd rights to citizens other countries only offer as privlidges . We have also enslaved people, experimented on human beings without their knowledge, murdered, stolen property under the guise of taxes, ruined people\u2019s lives and starved German POW\u2019s at the end of WW2. These are both good and bad points, but people supposedly generally knew there were lines not to be crossed. Now a person can say what they want, but in 1963, the United States removed organized prayer and Biblical teaching from public schools. Statistics are there that indicate America began a downward spiral at this point. The statistics include exponential increase in crime, illicit drug use, single mother pregnancies, increase in sexually transmitted diseases, previously unacceptable behavior slowly accepted. In addition, we lost the Vietnam War, experienced the Watergate conspiracy, had hostages taken in Iran, and began to be hated in many parts of the world. Again, that is my opinion, but I\u2019ve seen the statistics and they appear to correlate with this event in 1963. There are those of us that wish to bring the pre-1963 morals back. To those against us, I would say that the proposed \u201cwall\u201d along the southern border is not meant to keep people in. Hint, hint. ",

            "answer_text": "To me Make America Great Again means that the current political powers, in particular the American Republican party but not just them, are getting desperate. Their plans and beliefs have fallen apart to such a degree that the only thing many of them can think to do is to start going backwards to what used to work. Many of our leaders are in their twilight with the average age in the legislature having been pushed up to the mid-fifties and early-sixties which leaves many of them struggling to adapt. They did not grow up in the world we live in today where so much has changed in a very short time after all. For the Republicans who coined the phrase after being forced to work with Donald Trump they mean going back to a time when American exceptionalism was the norm, manufacturing jobs were plentiful, and they were free to look down on minority groups without backlash. They are doomed in the endeavor to roll back the clock though. Both because the majority simply doesn\u2019t agree with what they want to do, socially they have a very small but extremely loyal following, and because the conditions that created the time they remember are no longer present. The golden age they hearken back do was not around because people were more bigoted meaning they put pressure on everyone else to be \u201cnormal\u201d or because people \u201cpulled themselves up by their bootstraps\u201d but because most of the world had just had its industrial capacity blown to hell leaving the United States with a monopoly on many products along with automation having not been anywhere near as wide spread. For the Democrats the phrase Make America Great Again is an ultimatum. It\u2019s a statement of the intention to take away everything they worked for decades to accomplish and to forceably turn back the clock on all the progress made while utterly failing to adapt to the situations of today.

            "answer_text": "A picture is worth a thousand words. The impression I get is similar to what I get with Main Street U.S.A. As in the first area of any Walt Disney theme park.  No historical main street has ever looked like this however, as every version in the Disney theme parks is an anachronistic cross-country mishmash. The typical area of Main Street USA will have architecture from between 1850 and 1930. There will be buildings characteristic of historic Rhode Island right next door to something straight from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter. It\u2019s so broadly representative of a historic America it fails to represent anywhere specific. But it\u2019s just narrowly representative enough that those who don\u2019t fully know the story think it does. Unconsciously picking the when and where based on their own perceptions. This is MAGA. Just like how Disney\u2019s Main Street USA presents a fantastical American yesteryear as a historical time gone by, so too is MAGA designed to evoke memories of an idealised America. It particularly capitalises on memories of the Cold War, that time remembered as when America was a lone bastion of free expression and free enterprise in the world. As many of the phrase's targets look back on the Second World War and the following post-war boom with nostalgia as America\u2019s greatest golden age. At its core, MAGA is a Rorschach test and a cold reading in one easily-pronounceable package. It condenses down into four words \u201cwhatever ideal image you\u2019re thinking America used to be, I will give it to you.\u201d Like the current calls for unity however, it also plays people against each other without being innately antagonistic. On the surface it sounds neutral, and opposing it would be insane on paper. After all why would any American not want their country to be amazing? But the intent in this instance is not neutral, the vision being suggested through policy and hostility to minority groups has losers, people will suffer under this new version of America. So you get people who want America great, but not in the way sold to voters through promise and policy. When the intent of the phrase is called into question, the outward neutrality of the phrase itself opens up any critics for ridicule. It doesn\u2019t matter if the in-crowd can\u2019t agree what this great vision looks like, the out-group end up identifying themselves as disagreeing with what the in-group want. Reinforcing ideas the out-group wish nothing but harm to the nation. If you see through or reject MAGA, you become a target by those who bought it because to them your opposition is saying you don't want a great America. ",

            "answer_text": "Greatness is a relative term, isn\u2019t it? We could, for example, say that Rome in the days of Augustus Caesar was a great place\u2026 as was (for example) London in the days when Queen Victoria reigned. But the average citizen living in those times did not live spectacularly well; only the very wealthy did. The ancient Roman, or the resident of London in its days of \u201cgreatness,\u201d could take some pleasure in knowing he or she lived in the supposedly greatest Empire of its era. Yet this was a small consolation at a time when life was still hard for most people, and unless you were in the ruling class, you worked very, very hard for only a small portion of the nation\u2019s largesse. Now, let\u2019s consider America: or rather the USA. Would you say that America post-WW2 was as \u201cgreat\u201d as living in ancient Rome or Victorian England? I would say greater! The USA after WW2 emerged as the leading economy in the entire world\u2026 the greatest producer, the greatest exporter, the greatest economic engine, the greatest educational system, and (for what it\u2019s worth) the greatest military power the world had ever seen. By far. But the real greatness of the USA lay in the fact that with its expanding middle class, the fantastic largesse that came to the country was spread to people far, far outside the top 1%\u2026 that even children of working class could aspire to the highest offices in the land\u2026 far more than had ever been possible in \u201cRepublican\u201d Rome (which was really a plutocracy dominated by the weathliest families) or in London\u2019s Parliament \u2014 which likewise was dominated by the House of Lords, along with wealthy merchants who controlled the House of Commons. America\u2019s greatness continued even into turbulent times, when \u2014 despite the original sin of slavery and racism \u2014 the youth of America rose up to demand civil rights and an end to an unpopular war. For all its problems, America in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, was in many ways the greatest country that ever was\u2026 NOT because it was perfect and unchanging, but precisely because it was so willing to address the problems of a free society: In those days, so many were able to rise from poverty, and so many young people were willing and able to speak truth to power. If I had to choose, I would say a Hillary or Bernie presidency would have had the best chance of preserving this greatness that was America. ",

            "answer_text": "For the vast majority of Americans it was great from President Reagan through Bush 2. It was awful for the last eight years under Obama. Before Obama, work was plentiful, home loan interest was low, the dollar was stable, fewer people were in poverty, crime was steadily dropping, investments and retirement accounts were stable and paying a good return, prices were moderate, and life was better. Trump has already corrected many of the problems Obama created, and the economy and employment are higher than they were anytime in the last eight years. This is supported by data from the Federal Reserve Economic data (Fred) in the charts below. The economic crises that led to the Obama year began with the 2006 election when both houses of Congress was controlled by Democrats for the first time since 1994. The Freddie Mae/Mac oversight committee in the house was under the control of Barney Frank for much of the last Bush term. Chris Dodd was the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. At least five years before the banking collapse, both the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve issued strong warnings the the sub-prime loan problem was serious and if not corrected would lead to a banking collapse. Dodd and Frank disregarded their advice. The collapse happened as many banks failed. The democrat controlled congress began to push for a bailout of the largest banks and the auto industry; and economists were divided on whether that was a good idea or not. Bush and Republican leaders such as McCain sided with Congress and called for appropriations to support the bailout. By this time, Obama was the President-elect, and he met with Bush and both agree that the bailout was necessary. This did two things to Bush\u2019s economic record; it pushed his deficit spending up by magnitudes and started the 2007\u20132010 recession; however, the crisis happened because Democrats refused to take early steps to correct it, and the bailout had the full support of President Obama. Whether the bailout averted total economic collapse, or nearly caused it will never be known, it can only be subject to speculation. The the blame for the sub-prime crisis is clearly on the door of those who wanted to make it easier for the poor to own homes by forcing a ratio of sub-prime loans to people who would otherwise never qualify for a loan. Banks had to make these high risk loans, or face penalties from the government. That was all well-intentioned actions of Democrats.  Not only was the economy worse, but race relations under Obama were the wort of this millennium, and as a result police killings reached a new high.  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if this is the kind of answer that you are looking for. It\u2019s what I got. Trump shares an interesting case of selective awareness with his supporters that identify with him. On top of all of the other issues that he seems to have. I have said in the past that Trump behaves in a way that he thinks a politician should behave. Politicians lie so he lies. Politicians are corrupt so he is corrupt. Politicians use advertising campaigns to sell themselves to the public, so Trump comes up with a advertising campaign that does the same. It\u2019s a weird kind of \u201cAnything you can do, I can do better\u201d fed by ego, mindset. Advertising agencies use slogans, the simpler and the more open ended the better. The simplest and the most open ended slogan of the 21st Century so far has got to be the Nike slogan, \u201cJust Do It\u201d Don\u2019t stop to ask, \u201cJust do what?\u201d Just buy Nike sneakers. \u201cMake America Great\u201d; Trump\u2019s slogan in 2016 is almost as well crafted as \u201cJust Do it\u201d. Trump\u2019s new slogan completely loses the simplicity of the original, but it retains the open-endedness of the first one. \u201cMake America Great\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d can mean any thing to any one. That is their beauty. I am saying that not only are these slogans simple and open ended, they are deliberately designed to be so. \u201cMake America Great\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d should be insulting to any person that is proud of the USA. Both slogans imply that America was great once but is not great any longer. So they imply that we need Trump to \u201cMake America Great\u201d or \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. The idea that the American Empire was going the way of the Ancient Greek and Roman Empires was a common trope among the radical student groups in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s in New York City and Chicago. Since Trump has gotten into office, he has been selling this message of nihilism and despair with himself as a savior. A package that is supposed to have something for everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "Like many slogans, \u201cMake America Great Again\u2019 comes across as simplistic. It supposes that America was once great but is no longer. In all cultures, conservatives use an idealized past as a benchmark for the present and a dreamed-of future. Ergo, the America of their memory was great and the America they experience now isn\u2019t. Encapsulated within the \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 slogan are a series of idealistic visions tailor-made for conservatives. For Trump\u2019s core audience, working class people whose jobs have disappeared, the slogan means \u201cLet\u2019s fix stuff that we don\u2019t like about the country. Let\u2019s create more \u2018good\u2019 jobs, stop corporations from exporting jobs overseas, build a more powerful military, get better trade deals, make NATO countries pay their agreed-upon share, protect our borders to save and cut down on drug flow and crime, reduce taxes and fix our bridges, roads and dams.\u201d It\u2019s easy to be skeptical about such goals being accomplished in four, let alone eight or 16 years. The slogan \u2019Make America great again\u2019 acts as a shorthand that says that all such improvements are possible. The \u2018Make America great again\u2019 slogan would never work with liberals: They believe the past and present are filled with injustice and inequity and the best is still out there to be achieved. Their slogan might read \u2018Make America great,\u2019 but I\u2019m not sure that would work either. Most liberals of my acquaintance would see \u2018Make America great\u2019 as chauvinistic and a violation of their dream of a world without borders. ",

            "answer_text": "As a person of color, I find this slogan very exclusive.  I wonder, when was America \"great\" - I mean sure there were some moments that were ok, I suppose but as a whole when was America great for everyone? I should also add that I'm a black woman who works in IT, as a Software Tester - used to be a Software Developer (once, my business card even said Software Engineer - which I thought was pretty funny - especially since most everyone outside of my team thought I was the secretary, lol) - my husband works in IT as well.  We live in the suburbs....we've owned and sold 2 properties.  We've done pretty well but we also watch the news.  I can remember the Rodney King beating playing endlessly on the TV, the dragging in Jasper Texas, Hurricane Katrina, and don't get me started about Trayvon Martin and how I cringe when my 11 year old wants to wear his hood over his head.   Great. AND I'm a very light black woman - can easily pass if my hair is straight I'm careful with the twitch in my eyebrow that seems to happen when someone says or does something stupid.  And still I ask when...when was it great?  Was I sleeping, did I miss it?  Great. The \"Blacklash\" that Beyonce is getting - anti police?  NO - anti police brutality!  The audacity of being black and not ashamed.  Great. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a slogan Trump used that was also used by Reagan. Reagan had \u201cLet's Make America Great Again\u201d Trump has, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. To me there is a Stark difference and we see it with Trump every day. Reagan was a politician and knew making policy was the job of working with many others to get things done. Maybe many of us don't agree with what policies Reagan got passed, but he worked with people, not against them, to get things done. Trump on the other hand is a one man show. Even his own party hates him, but they pretend not to, and he does nothing but divide America. Trump is not a politician, he is a corrupt business owner (many businesses, most which failed). He thinks he can have the final say without the advice from others. Trump had a chance to change our political environment for the better by doing things differently and working in a neutral stance and in the middle ground. But instead he has alienated his staff, most in his party, all in his opposition party, and almost all of U.S. citizens as well all the rest of the world. He has strunk his base to just a few people who either have too big of an ego to give in or who are just simply dumb enough to actually think he is doing some good. It's a slogan that actually could have worked. But Trump once again has failed and continues to drag this country down like he has done with so many of his businesses. ",

The military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about was not fully entrenched. But you can\u2019t look at only the positive aspects of that era. You also have to consider that there was rampant legal discrimination against black Americans, including lynchings and other forms of domestic terrorism such as mass incarceration and Jim Crow, which was how white racists tried to keep black Americans from entering the middle class and enjoying what the white middle enjoyed. Women were second-class citizens. They were kept out of many sectors of business and government; they were not protected from marital rape or sexual harassment on the job, and they couldn\u2019t get a credit card or sometimes even a bank account in their own names. Gay people lived in fear every day, all the time, having to live a lie to live at all. So how effin\u2019 great was America for them? Did they just not matter? ~*~ I don\u2019t have a problem with a slogan of \u201cMake America Better.\u201d The goal should be to get the good things of the past back without the bad things.

I've lived through Carter, Reagan, bush1, Clinton, bush2, and Obama. He's literally doing what he said he'd do. Past presidents were politicians bankrolled by donations and lobbyists who , once elected, they had to appease. Trump owes nobody, and it appears ( gasp!) he is trying to serve the American people, who elected him. The Dow has topped 20,000, and numerous companies have made plans to build factories in the United States. Despite alot of left-wing people protesting at every move Pres Trump made, most people I know are optimistic about the future. A nation without laws or border's is a magnet for people who are a threat to the United States. From the person who just wants a better life through a higher-paying job, to the drug dealers, the cartels, the terrorist or whatever kind of person you are, if you enter the United States illegally, or refuse to return to your country of origin after your visa expires, you are breaking the laws of my country. If a person wants to come to my country, then you will respect the laws of my country. America may allow people who respect and obey our laws to come here. A prosperous America where terrorism is a distant memory is what I believe President Trump is working on. I hope he continues to succeed. ",

You here old men talking about how great it was in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s 80\u2019s and how now everything is just a jumbled mess up. Yea in the 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s colleges were Academics and not businesses and the trade Unions the baby boomers destroyed and squandered had made life more affordable. College degrees and even a high school diploma weren\u2019t even necessary in those times. That Make America great again is appealing and gravitating the cynical baby boomers in large numbers in combination with ill informed and god awful annoying Alex Jones type conspiracy theorists, and white rage of course, to make things the way they were, meaning for Them.. The entire make America great again is self defeating. If what your going for is self glorification then it\u2019s going to end in failure. No one is Yelling and Shouting that the Sun will Rise tomorrow because it\u2019s a fact. This make America great again is a false promise that is same kind Of falsity made by other members in government that They Are Actually Going to Change things. Ideally this isn\u2019t an realistic objective to promise anything without any guarantee. So the Make America Great Again and all the others \u201cI have a plan\u201d \u201cthis will work\u201d you hear from politicians they definitely have doubts. Because unlike the sun which will rise tomorrow, whatever they speak about is left to the emotions of the masses. Americans panic very easily . They love sensationalism and leap to wag the self righteous finger to anyone they disagree or dislike as if they know any better ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is a bullshit statement made to convince the gullible that America was not great by a conman who saw a way to exploit the unrest that in part was fostered by the GOP to keep unrest alive and well in the US. Obama took the job when America was falling and lifted it back up after the economy was tanked by Bush and Cheney. They saw a war with Iraq as a cash grab and just had to convince America it was a good idea. America was emotional after 9/11 and fell for it hook, line and sinker. Bush loosened up the bank regulations and boom imagine that greedy bankers and investors managed to destroy the economy. Obama came in, cleaned up the mess and then served his term out with a lot of dignity. The only problem with Obama was that he was a black man and god forbid if that was going to be tolerated. So next came Trump, who with the aid of Russia convinced America we were no longer great. The only solution was to drain the swamp by putting one of the greediest, narcissistic individuals in the office as if he was not capable of being bought. He then proceeded to drain the swamp by putting in even more vile alligators into positions of authority. Hell, this dude sold out to Russia after our greedy bankers figured out he was a bad risk. That is why he will not release his tax records. But Trump was right about something, America will be great again once we the people vote his ignorant ass out of office in 2020! That will truly \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d ",

I recently noticed an article talking about Trump that compared him to Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer commonly associated with AIDS. It can kill you. But it\u2019s not the main reason you\u2019re having problems! In other words, getting rid of Trump may not be the main solution to what is wrong with America, in fact it may make things worse! Where Trump differs from previous presidents is in his tone. He is obnoxious and obscene. He lies, often and loudly. Americans like their leaders calm, deliberative and low-key. It isn\u2019t surprising that Trump\u2019s trash-talking is freaking people out. But we shouldn\u2019t conflate rudeness with an existential threat to democracy. Democracy, decency and civility were never real American values in the first place. That, not Trump, is the real problem. The big question is what do we mean by American values? Is it just war and capitalism since that has kept us afloat for so many years? This doesn't match up well with the google search for \u201cAmerican values\u201d, which lists, Independence, Equality Informality and Directness, which included this; Americans believe that conflicts and disagreements are best solved by means of forthright discussion among the people involved. This does not appear to represent our dialog between right and left very well? Do we have common ground to walk on anymore? ",

Whom among us wouldn\u2019t want America to be great? President-Elect Trump has given surprisingly little description of what specifically he means by this slogan in terms of policy recommendations. However, he has given at least one glimpse into how he thinks we, as a nation, would get there. From an interview on Fox News in 2014, he describes what it would take to make America great again. You can watch a clip of the interview here with specific reference to making America great again at about the 2 minute mark :  If we look back to the last time that happened in the United States, it would be in the aftermath of the Great Depression. Indeed, Trump\u2019s Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon has described a desire to return America to the 1930\u2019s in a November 2016 interview: \u201c\u2026It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\"[1] The 1930s gave us president Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal. The New Deal programs included child labor laws, financial regulation, farm subsidies, Social Security, and union protections.[2] Trump\u2019s plans seem to point in the opposite direction according to Newt Gingrich, Vice Chair of the Trump presidential transition team. Gingrich's definition of Trumpism is essentially a third attempt \u2013 after Ronald Reagan in 1980 and himself in 1994 \u2013 by conservatives to break the country cleanly away from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" big-government mindset. [3] While little specific policy has been shared, Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks start to make more sense when viewed through this lens. In many cases, the individuals he has chosen have in their body of work either opposed the stated mission of the Department they are recommended to lead such as Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education[4] and or advocated for outright elimination of it as is the case with Rick Perry for Energy Secretary.[5] Footnotes[1] Ringside With Steve Bannon at Trump Tower as the President-Elect's Strategist Plots \"An Entirely New Political Movement\" (Exclusive) [2] Library of Congress[3] http://www.usnews.com/news/the-run-2016/articles/2016-12-15/newt-gingrichs-new-mission-the-selling-of-trumpism[4] Betsy DeVos and the twilight  of public education[5] Will Rick Perry Promote Science at the Department of Energy?",

Yet this is said by all the Trump loving, face-flag waving, rowdy super patriots who attended his rallies. I find it odd that when Michelle Obama was taken out of context eight years ago in saying she was for the first time proud of her county, the right-wing press crucified her. Her intent was in emphasizing her then focus of how things had changed in America, and its acceptance of her husband as a serious presidential contender. The slogan \u201cmake America great again\u201d can imply many things. But none of them could mean any less than the country defended by American service men and women is no longer \u201cgreat\u201d. What makes America great already is not its soiled history, nor her political leadership. Its her multicultural people who continue to struggle against social injustice and wage disparity. And deep at the root of her is the understanding that the only real minority in America are those who realize that people everywhere are all equal. That minority must grow. ",

The only reason these people think America wasn't great is because people of color are beginning to gain prominence, and the MAGA crowd doesn't like that. It scares the bejesus out of them. They blame these changes for their lost earning potential, which has more to do with an economy changing from manufacturing to technology and their inability to adapt. They don't want to gain the skills to make them relevant in a technology-focused economy, and they see it as beneath them to do the jobs being done by the immigrants trying to come in for a better life. So they blame others for their plight rather than changing their ways. Add a non-white President with a \u201cfunny name\" into the mix, and they lose their everlovin' s*#t. They fear a world where white people don't hold all of the power, because they think it is their birthright to be the \u201ccontrolling\" class, even if they have no control themselves. This is why there are so many white bigots near or below the poverty line. Even in their indigence, they believe they are better than a person of color, and fancy themselves the Master Race. This irrational fear and bigotry will be their undoing, though, because this is a change which will not stop.

If one says that a \u201cwoman is lovely\u201d English speakers know the word \u201clovely\u201d has no specific meaning but the words are nonetheless are meaningful. The word great means an extent, amount, or intensity considerably above the normal or average. When Trump says \u201cmake America great again\u201d he wants America to be an above average country not in a specific mathematical way but in a way that all Americans understand. Populism is a political philosophy that supports the idea that a country should be as nice a place to live as possible. Those who oppose Trump are anti-populists which means they want America to as bad a place to live as possible. Trump does many things to expose the enemies of the American people. It is hard because most people are brainwashed. No matter what Democrats do or how many times they do it a simple denial changes people\u2019s minds instantly. No matter how many times the Democrats vote to open the borders merely saying they oppose open borders makes people forget everything that the Democrats did and they believe what the Democrats said instead. Often one can recognize the hypocrisy in people when they get mad. When politicians got mad at Bill Clinton when he balanced the budget and had full employment it was obvious that politicians from both parties were against balancing the budget and having full employment. Since the second Geroge Bush was president both parties have done everything politically possible to make American a bad place to live as possible. Yet people do not seem to see the obvious. On Quora, we keep getting questions that start with, \u201cWhy don\u2019t both parties join together and fix this or that problem?\u201d when it is obvious that neither party wants to fix any problem. To help people understand Trump said \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d and when some people respond with hate and rage they proved that they hate America want to turn into a third world country.

They fear the imposition of Sharia Law no matter how often they are told it is impossible to impose here. They hate and fear Muslims. Trump channels their rage and voices their grievances. He hates who they hate, liberals included. So what do they mean by MAGA? I translate it to Make America White Again. It is a little more complicated than that. They long for the small town America of old, white picket fences and all. That America, to the extent it existed at all, was not so friendly to minorities and other vulnerable communities. If you were white, Christian, and middle class, it would to be difficult to find a more comfortable place. They want that: a time when everyone knew his or her place and stayed there and they themselves were on top of the world. ",

Essentially, the U.S. was once considered the leading country in the world at new. Electricity, phones, cars, architectural feats. All kinds of things. Someone from another 1st world country steps off a plan in the U.S., now, though and they\u2019re not going to see anything special. However, in Dubai? Top 10 Most Beautiful Places to Visit in Dubai The idea is why, if the U.S. is the greatest country in the world, does it look like a generic shit hole? It\u2019s because of mismanagement of our national finances. The whole premise of the slogan is based on getting the U.S. back to the top of world finances and letting it show. There\u2019s no reason we should have so many homeless people, starving people, jobless people and people who can\u2019t afford healthcare. There\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t be able to fix all of these issues and have enough to spare and make the country amazing.

            "answer_text": "It means that all of President Obama\u2019s improvements , policies , achievements , must be turned over and eliminated , never mind that all were designed to help and protect American citizens - more importantly to the MAGAnians , anything Obama did must be upended and stopped because of the color of Obama\u2019s skin . The color of Obama\u2019s skin caused an unthinkable insult to be leveled at America , in the minds of MAGites - the election of a black person to the presidency . I have a brief story to share with those who reside in MAGAville . I worked with a black man . One day he went to check the level of antifreeze in his car\u2019s radiator , and as he removed the cap , he was sprayed in his face with the boiling hot fluid . This resulted in the man losing the top layers of skin of his face . Lo and behold , underneath those top layers , the color of his skin was identical to the color of the skin of this caucasian - myself - who writes these words . In other words : we are all the same under that outer layer of skin . God , or Mother Nature , gave different shades of skin to humanity for the sole reason that some regions are hotter and sunnier than others , and persons from those hot regions needed different types of skin to protect them from sunburn . The varied shades of the skins of humanity were not intended , by God or by nature , to make people dislike , fear , and mistrust each other . But it is a fact , that many people lump people together based on color . If we all had the same color , would Trump and his MAGites be so obsessed with overturning every last thing that Obama did ? The answer to that question is a resounding no . No past president , other than Obama , be it a conservative , moderate or liberal , has inspired the level of hate and divisiveness that we are witnessing . And one president , who understands the hate within his base of voters , uses that seething prejudice , stirs it in a cauldron of race driven bigotry - Trump throws gasoline on the fire - rather than find ways to douse the flames of hate , he stokes those fires . He will do and say anything to be reelected , regardless of the harm he causes daily to our health , our security , our safety , our well-being as a unified people , and our place in the eyes of the world . He knows his voters , he knows what presses their buttons , he knows what will bring them out to vote - the cost to the nation be damned . ",

There has always been conflicts between one party or another when government has been involed. Slavery, individual rights, racism, supression of minorities, war, and a whole array of injustices. America has never really geen great for all. So, what could trump mean by it? Basically the way I see it based on the majority of his supporters, some of his actions, and those he had surrounded himself with, Trump's MAGA is to elevate the white male. His anti immigrant and racious actions have shown his stance clearly. His tax cuts for rich corporations which are primarily run by white men should show where his priorities are. Surrounding himself with Alt right, white supreamist and neonazi thinking advisors should tell everyone just where trump wants to take a nation built by immigrants. At least he had one smart advisor. That would be the one that wouldn't let him use \u201cMake America White Again\u201d slogan. Truth always hurts trump. ",

Who can oppose this concept and expect to win an election? How can anyone justify taking an adversarial position to this? The devil is in the details. The problem with this applause line is defining what it means. That is why it is meaningless. Trump has no idea what it means and no intention of defining what \u201cgreat again\u201d represents. To do so invites discussion and debate and, immediately, disagreement. To understand what it means requires harder work than clapping and cheering. It requires discerning what policies are being proposed and how these will play out in practice. So, don't listen to Trump \u2014 watch what he DOES. For Trump, making America great means cutting funding to the poor, to education, to arts, to preserving the environment, to veterans. It means indiscriminate boosts to defensive and offensive military capabilities spending. It means making wealthy people wealthier and poor and middle class people poorer. It means cutting the Federal government, which saved the country from the Depression in the 1930s and 2009, and guaranteed civil rights for women, people of color, and people facing discrimination because of their sexuality. It means giving more power to the states, which resisted civil rights guarantees with every power and every effort. It means giving more power to the states, which can do NOTHING for the environment because air, water and soil pollution crosses state lines and doesn't respect these artificial boundaries and because states will bid against one another for jobs and industry, lowering standards to serve powerful oligarchs and industries until there are no more standards. It means unsafe working conditions and unenforced safety regulations. It means a return to all the ills and evils we have worked and sacrificed so long and so hard to eliminate. Because those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. ",

I want to see us again be a positive, strong and wealthy people who are excited about the future and eager to move forward. I want us to watch kids in our neighborhood make good; to see us explore space, and build fabulous structures, and grow spiritually and in our understanding of the universe. And work hard, and achieve great things. I want to see America Made Great Again, just as Trump is saying. ",

And it is getting better all the time. There will always be room for improvement, and there will always be disagreements on how exactly to move forward, but our society is working extraordinarily well. But what has happened is that the science of insult and complaint has, for the time being, become much more powerful and successful than the science of defence against insult and complaint. It is very easy to say thing that resonate with sections of the electorate, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, \u201cIt's the fault of illegal immigrants\u201d, \u201cThat particular politician has broken the law and should be in jail\u201d and hundreds of other such insults and complaints. Countering these insults and complaints requires discussion and debate and in present times, few people are prepared to enter into such time consuming activity. When exactly was the time when America was greater than the present? Was it in the days of polio, smallpox and cholera? Was it the days of McCarthy or Nixon? Perhaps is was the days when members of the community could be excluded from schools and universities, or casually lynched, because of the colour of their skin. Or was it the days of the Great Depression? And if we exclude immigrants, or tax food imports from Mexico, won't food prices go up? All these points require discussion and debate, but such discussion and debate is nowhere near as powerful as the initial insult or complaint. One final point - let's not get into a discussion or debate on what is actually wrong with present society. The point I'm making is that the science of insult and complaint is more powerful than the science of defence against insult and complaint. ",

Ensure that Americans don't have to worry about being the victims of terrorism or other violent acts in their own country (and hopefully, nowhere else in the world). 2. Seal the borders (which means ports and airports and careful monitoring, too), so that 100% of human beings physically present in the United States are either American citizens, legal immigrants, or legal nonimmigrants. 3. Bring down the deficit and the debt toward an eye on eliminating them. 4. Create an abundance of good-paying, rewarding jobs. 5. Create economic conditions so that our quality of life is better than that of our parents, and our children's better than ours. Those are five good starts.

That is the period trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan dependably summons among his steadfast supporters. Would trump prefer that America return to the days of slavery, and labour exploitation in unsafe factories, mines, foundries and plantations? Perhaps trump yearns for the days when there was less soil erosion, fewer toxic chemicals in the environment and more family farms. What is America? The People; a country of foreigners, overall. And trump is stigmatising each and every newcomer who enters the nation. He reflects the complete opposite of the expressions of Ronald Reagan in the last discourse that he made to the nation as President of the United States. In any case, the fact of the matter is that the MAGA cap has come to be an image pervaded with a stigma exacting the order to \"make America great again.\u201d It may offer the wearer an association with the bigot and patriot groups among trump supporters. It may not. At any rate, it demonstrates that the wearer is unaffected by the way that their cap makes individuals feel uncomfortable. But here\u2019s the thing. It doesn't mean an arrival back to the times of days gone by and isolation. It means an equivalent open door for everybody, paying little mind to race, creed, colour, statement of faith or religion. Not that trump lives by the slogan he belts out at every opportunity. ",

Men and women have fought and died since that time to defend the words on that piece of paper. Trump has never been representative in any way of the principals this Country was founded on. He has been failure in business, in relationships, and in just about any endeavor he sought. His lying is beyond belief. Why would anyone think that he could make America great again. Yes, America has had its problems throughout the years. What country hasn\u2019t. But the general principles it was founded on are sound. We must work to make sure that men like Trump do not destroy those important words in our Constitution. There will always be men who try to tear down, what others have built with their sweat and tears. Hitler did not succeed in Germany, and Americans will make sure it does not happen here. It is a frightening time we are going through, but we will get through it, stronger and the freedom for all people based on the principles of our founding fathers will remain intact. America IS Great, because it is made of people from all over the world who wanted the freedoms outlined in our Constitution. Perhaps we have temporarily lost our way, but time will heal, and those who try to tear down these principles will be but just a footnote in the history of this Great Nation. ",

The population was half of what it is now. There were a limited number of TV channels, so many watched the same upbeat shows portraying idealized families, often with the father as wage earner and the loving mother baking cookies, etc. at home. White middle class people tended to be unaware of or indifferent to social problems that existed not far from their neighborhoods 1950s Economics. Technological development had not led to much unemployment by making jobs obsolete. The problem is that Trump et al. call for a an easy and backwards solution by ignoring social issue, resurrecting low-tech, familiar jobs, such as coal mining, and polluting factories such as steel mills, partly by reducing environmental regulations (and increasing illness from pollution) \u2014 appealing to people\u2019s nostalgia for the truly imperfect world of the past rather than find ways for large numbers to benefit from advances in technology and clean energy and move forward by provide job training and harder, more creative solutions.

He doesn\u2019t understand compromise which is something very important to understand when you\u2019re running a country and dealing with other countries.

            "answer_text": "What would you say is the most important word in the MAGA slogan? Here\u2019s a clue - compare it to the campaign slogan for the Brexit \u2018leave\u2019 campaign: Take Back Control (UK \u2018leave\u2019 campaign) Make America Great Again (US Trump campaign) Both phrases exhibit key copywriting (marketing) techniques: Directly address the audience, using the 2nd person imperative.Encourage/empower the audience to take a particular action.Hillary Clinton\u2019s slogan (Stronger Together) doesn\u2019t do these things; the \u2018remain\u2019 campaign in the UK was so anaemic, it didn\u2019t even have a slogan. But the most important word in the MAGA slogan is \u2018again\u2019, just like the most important word in the Brexit \u2018leave\u2019 slogan is \u2018back\u2019. It does three things. It creates a linear time narrative - a before, a now and a future: A story.It addresses the audience as the central protagonist in the \u2018now\u2019 part of that story.In the story, the protagonist lost something precious. Now, the protagonist has a chance to get that thing back.It\u2019s the essential quest narrative: Literally, the oldest trick in the book. When Jason goes in pursuit of the Golden Fleece, we know it\u2019s going to be an action-packed adventure - but that\u2019s not enough to win our sympathy. To make our hearts burn for Jason, the story needs pathos.  That\u2019s why, before Jason sets off on his quest, he is wrongfully deprived of his father\u2019s throne - his birthright - by his nasty usurper uncle. Now, Jason has suffered an injustice. This changes the narrative completely - he has a moral cause AND a material cause motivating his quest. The good is on his side and the good will out. It\u2019s the same plot for Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet and Disney\u2019s Lion King: Evil uncle steals father\u2019s throne, hero is exiled, hero reclaims birthright/has his revenge. It\u2019s the same basic model for Star Wars, Harry Potter, Gladiator, and any action movie that starts with a musclebound hero losing his family and being wrongly imprisoned or exiled. It\u2019s also the reason so many people find Lord of the Rings such an impressive work of fantasy yet somehow, on some basic level, kind of \u2026weak: It\u2019s because Tolkien makes a point of not equipping Frodo with a burning sense of personal injustice. It was apparently important for Tolkien to have a hero motivated by nothing more than simple goodness of heart. Which is laudable \u2026just not great pathos. In fact, Frodo\u2019s \u201cFellowship of the Ring\u201d is an awful lot like Hillary\u2019s \u201cStronger Together\u201d in this way: Laudable, but no match for burning injustice. Reading too much into it? Speechwriters and copywriters do think long and hard about how to distil the most potent messages for their audiences. There are reasons why some slogans work better than others and why writers can be paid so much for crafting a single line. ",

When a fair and just person hears it for the first time they think, \u201cThat must mean back to the post WWII days when America was number 1 in so many areas. A man could support his family, and buy a home while working 40 hours a week as a clerk, or janitor\u201d. The horrible people think \u201cYeah, when the black man knew his place and everybody was Christian\u201d. See how there\u2019s 2 messages? Here\u2019s how I know that it\u2019s the the latter message that trump means. The days when a person could afford a house on a janitors salary could come back, but only if employers were forced to pay their employees a living wage, and corporations paid their fair share of taxes. That is most definitely NOT what trump is about. So trumps version of a \u201cgreat\u201d America is when black people knew their place and \u201cChristianity\u201d was the norm. ",

If you look at the rhetoric of past presidential campaigns you will see that candidates from both parties use the same idea in one way or another. The statement misleads you into thinking there is something wrong and then the candidate uses flimsy examples based on half truths, lies, and good old fear mongering to show you what is wrong. Watch a few commercials on network TV and you will see the same pattern: present a questionable problem and offer the solution. The architects of the Trump enterprise knew this and looked for \u201cproblems\u201d they could exploit. If saving squirrels from extinction had been a problem they would have used that. The forgotten ones, the working class, racists, evangelicals and so on just happened to fall into the crosshairs. Do you think Trump really cares about unemployed coal miners? Think again. ",

They are primarily white lower middle class individuals who resent the idea that people of other skin colors and non-European extractions are increasingly being given the opportunities for advancement into areas from which they were previously excluded, by custom or by laws. Most of the MAGA supporters may never have actually had that much power to begin with, which means they are being deceived by the politicians (I can think of one in particular) whom they support. This analysis comes from a 74-year-old person who is quite pale of skin and whose DNA pegs him as strictly 100% European for perhaps the past 20,000 years. ",

This slogan didn't gain acceleration until the election of President Obama.  Before him, the country was in a decline under a Republican national governor - George Bush. And yet, surprisingly (or unsurprisingly), we never heard the same sort of shameful talk.  There are many white people that cringe at the notion and the sight that America is becoming less white. It's understandable to a degree, when you are used to seeing people that look like you suddenly dropping off, being replaced by others  that can be more than many whites can handle.  At the heart of protest and anger is always going to be fear. Fear of change. Fear of someone. Fear of something. Fear of loss. And that's what's driving this \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. ",

            "answer_text": "There was a time where most of the world lived in poverty or were slaves there was no middle class. People the world over clamored to be in America. There was a time that you were judged not by your abilities or by the color of your skin but what family you were born to. Relatively prosperous England you had to contend woth the fact that if you werent born to the right people your destiny was written for you and it was poverty. The US developed a middle class unlike anythong anywhere in the world. Though thete are never gusrantees the chances are that if you worked hard you got to be in the middle class no matter who your family is. Just this fact made you richer than almost any other place in the world. By stating that we are no longer richer than anybody else in the world you get the wrong inference. Did we decline that much? Yhe answer is no. The world followed in industrializing and they became richer. So rich that the US no longer stands above everyone else in terms of wealth. The US is still the biggest manufacturer in the world. However we manufacture just as much as we always have with fewer people. There are other peoples answers who tackle this question better about China or Japan or Mexico cheating but even without cheating the world is a different place and just how much can the government do to break down the many barriers that prevent manufacturing is a question thats difficult to answer. So there was a time when the US was unwavering the answer to what is a GREAT country to make a living. Now its not unwavering because theres many great countries. ",

They also don\u2019t realize that taking good care of minorities is good for them, but I\u2019m not going to try and educate the racism and sexism out of anyone. We really can\u2019t reverse the changes to our economy and society.

            "answer_text": "Immigration has been a major focus of the Trump Administration. During his campaign, he repeatedly said that he'd like to see America return to pre-1965 immigration policies. That's been a key desire for White Nationalists for a long time. 1965 was when the US stopped putting racial quotas on immigration. Another slogan of the Trump Campaign and Administration has been \u201cAmerica First.\u201d That is another concept that has history with White Nationalists. In 1940, the America First Committee was founded to try and keep America out of WWII. One of their themes was that the world\u2019s Jews were trying to manipulate the U.S. into entering the war. But the America First Committee was determined that America would act only in its own interests, not that of the Jews. While Trump is not a dedicated student of history, the phrase \u201cAmerica First\u201d was used in 2000 by Pay Buchanan, who was then running for President. Donald Trump himself called Buchanan a Hitler-lover. So it can hardly be argued that Trump didn't know the phrase was anti-Semitic. And the first time Trump used the phrase himself was in a speech written by Steve Banning and Stephen Miller, both of them with proven sympathies for White Nationalists. Donald Trump praised the NeoNazis at Charlottesville as \u201cvery fine people\u201d and he has organized a secret police force to arrest the Portland Protesters from the BLM movement. And Trump has been very vocally defensive of the statues of the Confederates. I think it's fairly clear what Trump and his followers think a Great America should look like. ",

Archie and Edith Bunker sang, \u201cThose were the days \u2026 when we didn't need no welfare state. Everybody pulled his weight\u2026\u201d Granted, the US was booming having exited WWII as top dog, and of course blacks might not agree that America was all that great back then. But I think Trump in his TV-referenced brain is harkening back to The Fonz and Richie Cunningham and John Travolta dancing with Olivia Newton John at Rydell High School. He is kind of sitcomish. ",

Nothing has been made great from 2016\u20132020 and the only thing being made great is the insurmountable power of the privately owned central banks. These investment banks that control the media(both entertainment and news), politics, and the rest of the banking system with their money power. It is no coincidence at all that these investment banks: JP Morgan/Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman-Sachs, and Bank of \u201cAmerica\u201d are all domineered by Jews and their Shabbos Goy gentile fronts.

A lot of what Trump spoke against in 2016 was the political correctness that the far left was pushing - mainly the ideas that their beliefs had to be known and all opposition had to be silenced. I\u2019m being hyperbolic, of course, but we are seeing much of that today. And with the political correctness, those who disagree with the alt-left are often silenced, physically attacked, or shamed. People of faith are shunned for striving to obey their religious convictions. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d represents going back to a time where people could respectfully agree to disagree, instead of disowning friends, family members, etc for having different views than them.

Instead of being fearful of retribution, North Korea continues a policy of arming itself and defying a \u201clet\u2019s all try to get along\u201d attitude. Iran continues to refer to us as the Great Satan. Russia annexes a section of the Ukraine and funds a group who likely shot down a civilian passenger plane In a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d world, everyone would want to negotiate with us and would give us more favorable terms because they are negotiating from weakness. If a country took an action we didn\u2019t like, we would simply intimidate them into backing down. Personally I tend to a view in which cooperation and consensus are more effective than unilateral action. But the world is complex and sometimes requires exceptional actions. We can debate the merits of such a world but I don\u2019t know that we would accomplish more than offering our opinions and being unable to sway the other. ",

None of the above are happening. Actually it is quite the reverse. No, they are hoping that their individual circumstance to be improved. It is a desire to turn back time to 60 or 70 years ago when the middle class was strong and blue collar workers could earn a living wage. It is an understandable desire but they are the ones who have supported the party that sold them out and will continue to sell them out because they lack the intellectual ability to change their beliefs and to learn to question their mindsets.

We can easily see that in his willful insistence on a border wall to keep Mexicans out. He also believes white people are better, and those with wealth are better still. His form of thinking is very anti-American since this country was created by immigrants. Trump is mostly a negative thinker who attracts other negative thinkers. They believe their way of thinking is the right way. But is it? Our best presidents have leaned toward positive thinking that resulted in constructive actions to solve problems.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m under no illusion that there was some golden age in the US when there were no problems. I\u2019m also not so pessimistic as to think things are impossibly terrible now, in spite of concerns that could probably be addressed. With those two things being said, I think the things that have made the US great are the following: We have always respected the rule of law and we have always tried to have reliable laws. This has allowed people to be able to count on certain things happening or not happening.We have always tried to have functional institutions. Sometimes we have swung more in favor of government institutions, and sometimes we have favored less, but we always have had some. This has allowed people to be able to expect to get things done when they go down to an office or apply for something. They may not be as efficient as people would hope, but they have rarely degenerated into a situation of corruption and cronyism where the only hope of getting anything is by knowing someone or paying someone off.We have a decentralized system of education that has allowed for a lot of dynamic adaptation to needs without falling prey to an overwhelming slate of top-down mandates. Over the years we have greatly increased access to education, to the point that almost everyone has a decent chance to be able to learn to read and write and much more.We have had a vibrant free-market economic system that has allowed people to pursue their creative interests and that has added some incentive to do better or improve ones life. Sometimes we allow some gaming of the system to create monopolies or leave people behind, and other times we have clamped down, perhaps to the point of stifling some economic opportunities, but overall, we have managed to have decent balance.The last two points depend on the first two points to work. Together, all of these things have allowed the US to be innovative, progressive, successful, and prosperous, and we have been able to not only attract others who seek this to come here, but also to serve as a model for other countries who would like to live the same way. To me this is what American greatness is all about. We still have very strong aspects of all of these things and so I think we are a great country. However, there is always room for improvements or for getting back to the basics in some of these areas. So for me, any attempt to \u201cmake America great again\u201d or perhaps better said, to \u201cfocus on what makes America great\u201d, we should never lose sight of what it is that actually makes us great and to always be on the lookout to protect those things and allow them to continue as time may require adaptations in the way we apply them.

            "answer_text": "You\u2019d have to ask him. As others have said, he may not even have anything specific in mind when he says that. After all, his idea of \u201cMake America great again\u201d may not be the same as your idea, but by not defining it, he was letting you assume that he meant the same thing you thought of as making America great again. I think if you tried to nail him down on it, he\u2019d probably go with the economic titan that was the USA in either the 50\u2019s/60\u2019s, or the 80\u2019s. The 80\u2019s would be debateable, as the \u201cgreed is good\u201d culture doesn\u2019t have as much respect now as it did then. Now, let\u2019s further assume that he\u2019s referring strictly to the economy and not the social situation. I can\u2019t rule out that he\u2019s thinking of a time when men were the providers and women were in the kitchen as being a good thing, but I\u2019m not going to assume that he is. Even with that assumption, regaining that position isn\u2019t as feasible as some would like to think. Others have said that the jobs that have gone overseas won\u2019t come back very easily, but I\u2019ll go even farther than that. Even if you get those jobs back, we won\u2019t be the same powerhouse. You see, the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s rode on the industrial buildup of WWII. During WWII, the US did an amazing job of focusing on industry, waking the sleeping giant that some say Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto referred to. Do you really think we can achieve that level of focus without something like another world war? On top of that, the reason we were an industrial giant at that time was because we took no damage to our infrastructure during the war. At the end of the war, US industry (at least partially) turned from the \u201cwar machine\u201d to non-war markets. The industry of other countries, on the other hand, turned to rebuilding their country, giving the US a head start. Furthermore, even what economy we have now isn\u2019t the same focus as it was then. Back then, we were an industrial nation first and foremost. We had no trade deficit. The trade deficit really wasn\u2019t a thing until the 70\u2019s, peaking under Bush(43), and bouncing back a little over a year into Obama\u2019s administration. However, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. You see, the trade deficit only considers hard goods. Services and such don\u2019t get counted as part of it, and as soon as you do, the US is back to positive numbers (or was last time I researched it). If you want an example of non-hard goods, think movies. I\u2019m talking actual theater movies that typically take in much more world wide than they do in the US. The US has been turning away from manufacturing hard goods since the trade deficit was a thing. Ever since I was in high school, (late 70\u2019s to early 80\u2019s), I\u2019ve been saying that trying to keep the manufacturing jobs here is the wrong thing for government to try to do, we need to do better at transitioning people out of manufacturing jobs and supporting them through that transition. I didn\u2019t know when robotics would take over so much of manufacturing, but I knew the time was coming. Assembly line work has been more robot than human for a while, but it won\u2019t stop there. I don\u2019t know if they followed through on it, but McDonald's was going to open it\u2019s first fully automated restaurant over a year ago. AI is slowly threatening jobs that aren\u2019t even manufacturing or food service. Seriously, trying to relive the good old days in modern times is going to result in the modern times curb stomping us. If we pressure businesses to not automate, then they\u2019ll get undercut by those that do. And no, I don\u2019t have the answer on how to best adapt to the changing work environment. If anyone has an even semirealistic idea, I\u2019m all ears. And yes, I\u2019d love to be proven wrong on this and have and economy where people aren\u2019t worried about losing their jobs to outsourcing or automation or just plain cheaper entry level labor. I\u2019m not an economist, so I could be wrong. The thing is, neither is Donald Trump. He\u2019s a business man, and granted a better one than I would be. He\u2019s shown that even if it doesn\u2019t come naturally to him, he can take advice, and this is something he needs to take advice on. Sorry, I honestly didn\u2019t mean to carry on this long. TLDR: We had advantages in the good old days that we don\u2019t have now, and even if we could overcome the lack thereof, going back to the good old days would handicap us. ",

Americans who have experience of affairs outside the USA know of these deficiencies, but reform is always thwarted by an alliance between the corrupt and the stupid. The USA has been helped in the past by being so close to raw materials and far from military enemies, this is no longer the case in c.21 and the USA will suffer a rapid decade in the next century. Remember to wave to Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela as you slide down past them in world ratings - let\u2019s hope they have forgiven the insults you gave them when you were nearer the top of the tree.

I might suggest that the answer to your question is the removal of your present President. The entire world, except for about one million Americans, see him as a buffoon, which is amusing and forgivable, the world needs clowns now-and-again, but he is also frighteningly unqualified to hold the position he now holds. We really don\u2019t want the clowns running the circus.
