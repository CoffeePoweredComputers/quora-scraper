            "answer_text": "Plasma membrane or cell membrane is a biological membrane surrounding the cell and composed of the lipid bilayer. It separates the cytosol of the cell from the extracellular space.  Image source[1] What is the plasma membrane? The plasma membrane and associated proteins have many functions- The most basic function of the plasma membrane is to provide a barrier between the intracellular components and extracellular matrix.It has several proteins associated with it which help in signalling.The plasma membrane also has certain transmembrane proteins which act as channels and carrier. These facilitate the movement of ions and molecules across the cell membrane.The plasma membrane is selectively permeable which helps in balancing the concentration of ions (Na[math]^+[/math], K[math]^+[/math]) inside the cytosol. They also help in maintaining the potential difference of the membrane by transporting them inside or outside the cell. Thus, helps in polarization and depolarization of the membrane.Plasma membrane also has certain proteins which link with the cytoskeleton and hence help in maintaining the cell shape and cell integrity. For example, spectrin protein in RBC.The plasma membrane also helps in cell-cell Interaction and help in the formation of junctions such as the tight junction, gap junctions, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, plasmodesmata etc. The proteins associated with the plasma membrane will facilitate the formation of Junctions.

            "answer_text": "The main functions of plasma/cell membrane are- Cell membrane gives definite shape to the cell and provides mechanical support.Cell membrane is selectively permeable in nature and maintains unequal distribution of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- ions across the cell membrane, which plays crucial role in generation of potential difference across the plasma membrane. The inside of cell is negative as compared to out side the cell and , potential difference across the plasma membrane is known as resting membrane potential (RMP), when the cell is in resting state. RMP varies from -70 mV to -90 mV.Membrane bound voltage-gated and receptor-operated ionic channels(Na+, K+ & Ca2+- channels), ionic pumps (Na+, K+-ATPase & Ca2+-ATPase) and ion-exchange systems(e.g. Na+-Ca++ antiport) take part in ion-transport across cell membrane, which plays pivotal role in generation of AP & pacemaker potential, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, excitation-secretion coupling, neurotransmitter release, etc.Cell membrane possesses various plasma membrane bound receptors for the physiological actions of various hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs.Plasma membrane bound G-protein takes part in signal transduction. The cell membrane bound enzymes adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase catalyze the production of cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP which serve as \u2018second messenger\u2019 and take part in signal transduction.Microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells increase the cellular surface area many folds and take part in absorption of digested food like glucose, amino acids, etc.Different muco/glyco-proteins of membranes of RBCs constitute the blood groups.Active transport of proton (H+) by the cell membrane bound H+-pump (K+-H+-ATPase) of gastric patrietal cells is responsible for production of acid (HCl) in stomach.Membrane bound phospholipase C takes part in calcium-phosphatidyl-inositol system.ENDOCYTOSIS (Phagocytosis & Pinocytosis) is an important function of plasma membrane. Phagocytosis (Greek: cell eating) is a mechanism that enables the cells to engulf the solid particles like bacteria. It is shown by cells of immune system- neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. Pinocytosis (Greek: cell drinking) is, however, intake of droplets of liquid.EXOCYTOSIS: Cell membrane takes part in secretion of secretory materials like digestive enzymes, hormones, plasma proteins, immunoglobulins, etc. and excretion of waste products out side the cell.Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry with Biomedical Significance by Prem Prakash Gupta, CBS Publishers New Delhi, second edition ",

            "answer_text": "Plasma membrane- It is a network of lipids and proteins that forms the boundary between a cell's content and outside of the cell. It is simply know as cell membrane. Now coming to the functions of the plasma membrane: One of the important function of plasma membrane is 1. Physical barrier: the plasma membrane surrounds the cell and separates the cytoplasm, from the extracellular fluid outside the cell. Thus protecting the components of the cell from the outside environment. 2. Selective permeability: plasma membranes are selectively permeable. Meaning that only certain molecules can pass through them. Like water, oxygen, carbon dioxide. 3. Endocytosis and exocytosis: Endocytosis is when a cell ingests relatively larger contents than the single ions or molecules that pass through channels. Through endocytosis, a cell can take in large quantities of molecules. Exocytosis is when the cell releases these materials. The cell membrane plays an important role in both of these processes. The shape of the membrane itself changes to allow molecules to enter or exit the cell. 4. Cell signalling: another important function of plasma membrane is communication and signalling it does so by the use of various proteins and carbohydrates. ",

            "answer_text": "It provides a selective membrane which acts as a barrier to the environment. The membrane prevents potentially harmful ions from freely diffusing into the cell while still allowing the permeation of nutrients and other essential molecules. It provides structure to the cell by virtue of its phospholipid bilayer structure which is hydrophobic therefore it keeps the internal environment of the cell intact because the cytoplasm is polar and will not leak through the membrane. It is important in motility as the cell can move by attaching microtubules to the membrane and then geometrically transform itself to move in different directions. The fact that receptor proteins can be embedded in the membrane such as ion gated channel proteins make the plasma membrane absolutely essential for cell signalling. In addition, it allows cells to receive chemical signals in the form of steroids as these are lipids which can pass through the phospholipid bilayer since they are nonpolar. ",

In particular, proteins such as cytokines, secreted by certain cells, may bind to receptor proteins held in membranes of certain other cells.  That binding may cause the receptor protein to change its shape, initiating a cascade of phosphorylations along a chain of intracellular molecules  that leads into its nucleus, and causes its DNA to react. That's one of the most important functions in biology.  Just one fine example is that it can activate stem cells to replenish your blood.  We couldn't live and grow without that function, and the others, of the cell's membrane. It's things like that that make biology a study of awesomeness. ",

The cell uses energy to generate a gradient of sodium and potassium that the cell can later use to transport other molecules (this is called secondary active transport). ",

You must be 18 by the time early voting opens, a citizen of the US (not just a legal, Green Card resident) and have a photo ID with your address listed. Did you know when I was in school we could legally drink in a public bar at the age of 18? This is still true in Europe. In the US, eighteen year olds are now in a situation where they can fight for our country, get married, vote, drive a car at night, control their own medical care and yet still not buy a beer. So if you\u2019re not qualified to vote, perhaps you have a sibling, cousin or friend who is. Currently today\u2019s youth is getting screwed by the high cost of education and will get taken down the road with the looming national debt, assuming you all live long enough if you can\u2019t get health insurance. About your homework: Read Hemil Shah\u2019s answer. It\u2019s perfect in length and depth for this purpose. ",

Once opened the GLUT will admit glucose into the cells but once glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6 phosphate (first reaction of glycolysis) it cannot leave the cell. ",
