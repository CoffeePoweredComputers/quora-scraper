            "answer_text": "If you used 100% of your brain, you may as well be put to sleep. No, I don\u2019t say that because I\u2019m a morbid pessimist, but because you would live a very difficult and stressful life. For the most part, your brain stem regulates your heartbeat and blood pressure, as well as other vitalities. However, if you used 100% of your brain, you would have to constantly and consciously do that on your own. You\u2019d have to regulate your breathing, as well as involuntary muscles such as your eyelids. You may even have to sacrifice some things such as blinking, entirely, in order to make room for more important things in your life. This would cause you to go blind. It would make your life significantly more difficult if you couldn\u2019t function at school or work, if you ever do at all, when you could barley concentrate on anything else other than \u201cBreathe, Beat, Shut, Beat, Breathe\u201d. Frankly, I\u2019m not even sure living that long would be possible. Eventually, you\u2019d need to sleep. Not only that, but you\u2019d need to enter the state of REM to get a sufficient amount. That you would also have to do manually. Once you\u2019ve figured out how to enter REM, you need to paralyze yourself to ensure you don\u2019t act out any movements in your sleep. Speaking of movements, when you sleep, your brain releases a natural hallucinogenic drug. This is what causes dreams, and it is theorized that this drug is also released before you pass away. However, that is not proven and the purpose of this would be unknown. Good luck consciously drugging yourself to sleep with hallucinogenics. Not exactly an ideal time to utter internal processes on top of all that. Don\u2019t even get me started on eating or restroom breaks. Someone would have to constantly be there for you to make sure you\u2019re okay. You\u2019d need help and would most likely fall under the handicap category. There is just too much to look after, and you\u2019d barely have any time to live life to your fullest potential. You\u2019d also be likely to develop depression, if not severe, as that life is far from pretty or practical. You may even become suicidal. With that comes morals and debates, which would be just as controversial as the Death with Dignity Act. Some people would argue that it would be better you go out in peace. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if you could just relax than to constantly force yourself to life? You\u2019re a living life support machine. All you\u2019d do is keep a sack of blood alive. A mutation of nature\u2019s kind. On the other hand, others may argue that at the end of the day, life is precious and while you\u2019d have to constantly maintain your health and keep your body up to date, you may still be able to hear, feel, and smell the savors and aspects of life\u2026or you may not. Perhaps, you\u2019d so busy keeping yourself alive that you don\u2019t have time to process every sound, sense, and smell you come across. All that is done by your brain as well. In this case, you\u2019d have to do all that. Therefore, you may not be experiencing anything. If so, very little of it. Speaking of health, you\u2019d have to regulate you\u2019re immune system. You\u2019d be in charge of your internal \u201carmy\u201d persay. Whenever you experience symptoms of an illness, the symptoms are not due to the illness itself. The symptoms exist because your body is at war. Congratulations, you have contracted the common cold. Not only do you have to worry about you taking your body out by not regulating and maintaining it enough, but now you also have to worry about the illness taking you out as well. Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? Now come the philosophical questions, because this almost creates a paradox. If you have to do EVERYTHING for your body, do you even need a brain? If you regulate your vitalities, you don\u2019t need a brain stem. If you maintain your judgment on top of using it, you most likely don\u2019t need a frontal lobe. If you regulate your balance, do you even need a cerebellum? If you don\u2019t have brain, what is keeping you alive? Yourself. But what\u2019s keeping yourself alive? Your brain? But your brain doesn\u2019t exist. What is keeping YOU, the regulator alive? Your soul? What if spirits don\u2019t exist? What if we\u2019re all damned on this floating piece of rock that we call \u201cEarth\u201d? If you don\u2019t have a brain though, doesn\u2019t that contradict the question? Well, you see, you are the brain. You have gained control, and with that, you fade. You are one with nature, and nature is one with you. ",

            "answer_text": " You are in a way always using 100% and never using it. All of your brain is important but you cannot use it all at once. It is a common misconception that 100% of your brain can be used at the same time. Your body could not handle the functionality of this supercomputer at such levels. Think about the fact that currently your brain is using 20% of all the resources you put into it. That being said, you are not even using only a minute amount at any given time. That means, to use 100% of your brain you might have to expend many times the amount of energy you are using now. And, in terms of sheer calorie consumption, that is almost impossible. But let\u2019s say it were possible from an energy perspective. Then you still have all the input coming in all at once. Since certain parts of your brain are responsible for different things, using 100% of your brain at once would lead to utter chaos! Let\u2019s see what would happen if we were to use 100% of our brain: You would produce every hormone in your body. Making you feel aroused, afraid, angry, sad, happy, good, bad, excited, in love, and all other emotions all at once.You would become aware of everything you smell, hear, see, taste and feel all at once. Think about noticing your clothes 24/7, or how your tongue is moving in your mouth\u2026Your memory would get activated, meaning all past experiences would be shown to you, sort of like when you die your life might flash in front of your eyes non-stop.All your muscles would get activated at the same time and in all directions, causing you to have continuous spasms all over your body.These things may not happen exactly as described, but just getting close to that is enough for you to not being able to make any conscious action at all anymore. You would be trapped by your mind with your body going completely haywire. Your mind is responsible for more than just what you experience and sense. Now, all of that being said, there is still a way to increase the amount of brain activity we have. And the basis of that is: Awareness of your surroundings. I am assuming you want to know how to be like Bradley Cooper during \u201cLimitless\u201d, where he supposedly uses more of his brain. So let\u2019s look at what he did and did not do. During the movie he started paying attention to all the details of everything that was going on around him. Not only that, but he started to take action instead of sitting at the bar getting drunk. He cleaned himself up and he started taking care of himself. Learning more languages, going outside to jog, even writing more and spending more time analyzing. He even cleaned his apartment! All of these things are small details you might think are completely useless, but these are the small ways your brain will push you to doing more when you become aware of what is happening around you. Practice this right now. Look around you and just become aware of where things are: What does your desk look like? What does the book on your shelf say? What do you feel right now? What emotions are going through you? Where do you have tension in your body? Why? Becoming aware of more things allows you to use your brain more for what is actually happening instead of thinking so much about events you cannot control. When you look at how you normally spend your thoughts you will realize that a lot of them are focused on past or future events, or fantasy dreams that do not matter. This is how you spend the brainpower that you can use instead of spending it on the things that Bradley Cooper did. You will not really get to use more of your brain at once, but you will get to spend it how you want it, which gives you the feeling of using up to 100% of your brain! ",

            "answer_text": "As should be evident by now, \u201cusing\u201d 100% of our brain isn\u2019t some hypothetical, all of our brain is already being used. If it wasn\u2019t then it would quickly disappear, since brains strive for efficiency and unused parts would get in the way. All that is between your ears, all of that white and gray matter is being used, just not all at once, that would be a grand mal seizure and you would most likely die after a short while.  These pictures aren\u2019t what you think you are. The areas lit up aren\u2019t the only active areas, the dark parts aren\u2019t \u201cinactive\u201d in any way. These images show you the difference between condition A and condition B. In both condition the whole brain is showing some kind of activity, comparing them will cancel out any activity that it the same and only leave the activity that has changed together with whatever changed between condition A and B. As for regulation of that 100% of the brain, that different. That\u2019s basically saying, what if we could consciously control all the functions and activity in our brain. Which sounds amazing, wonderful, super-powerful, and completely and utterly\u2026..fatal. You don\u2019t want to be aware and in control of all that goes on and you can\u2019t handle being in control of everything. Quick example, we breath automatically but we also evolved the ability to consciously control our breathing. It comes in handy in situation where breathing might be dangerous or not possible, also helps us swim. As humans we are also rather OK with not breathing for a limited time, we have some reserves to keep the body going. Now change that to your heartbeat. You are now in control of your heart, go on give it a try. Heart goes haywire, heart stops, organisms dies. What about more complicated things, vision or hearing? You really want to regulate the entire visual process from photon all the way to a scenery. Decomposing and recomposing your vision into it\u2019s base elements, analyzing those elements via two pathways to extract all the information? You\u2019d be exhausted 1 minute after opening up your eyes. Same goes for hearing, or any of the other senses. What about the circadian rhythm? That\u2019ll kill you too if you mess it up, gotta keep that sine wave going. Fight or flight responses? reflexes? Motor control and planning? Facial recognition? Speech comprehension and production? Our brains do and regulate so much in our bodies, the sheer amount would overwhelm you, and the addition of decision making that comes with conscious regulation would inevitably lead to death, sooner rather than later.

            "answer_text": "Large number of academics, citizen scientists and entrepreneurs are interested in cognitive enhancement and finding methods for cognitive enhancement which are safe, robust and reliable. There are many lines of inquiry in the study of cognitive enhancement including studying the effects of diet, sleep, meditation, education, genetic modifications, exercise, mental training, social interactions, brain-computer interfaces, and pharmacological agents [1]. Many discoveries can already guide our decisions, but we know very little compared to what remains to be known. One thing we do know is that the implicit assumption that we utilize very little (10% is often quoted) of our brain is meaningless and trying to understand cognitive improvements only in terms of increased brain activity is not the correct lens to understand cognitive enhancement.  The question needs an overhaul. For example: 1. It is not clear what using 100% means. 100% of computational capacity? 100% of possible energy consumption?  2. The question implies that we do not use 100% of something undefined. To add to the confusion, it is often incorrectly assumed that usage is around 3% or 10%. 3. It plays a part in propagating the vague notion that using \"more\" of the brain is categorically a good thing. We are in the very early stages in our explorations to understand the types of computations that are carried out in the brain and how these computations are carried out. Also, establishing bounds on different measures of brain activity and connecting them meaningfully to cognitive performance has proven to be non-trivial. Despite the current limitations, we do know enough to displace filler hypotheses such as the 10% brain usage hypothesis and the hypothesis that increased brain activity categorically results in increased cognitive performance.  Early explorations revealed that the human brain consumes approx. 20% of the body's energy budget yet accounts for approx. 2% of body mass [2]. This piece of information becomes a bit more interesting when one considers that task related cerebral metabolic changes are usually small when compared to the rather large total energy consumption [3]. The above pieces of evidence suggest that during non-task states the brain may be active. One might assume that only \"housekeeping\" operations are being carried out but this hypothesis can be challenged. Additionally, one might assume that most of the activity is noise, but this hypothesis can also be challenged. What has been discovered, contrary to intuition, is that brain activity in the absence of any explicit information processing instructions (called non-task activity from here onward) is highly structured both spatially and temporally across the whole brain.  Using fMRI, it was discovered that activity in regions that are assumed to comprise the motor system are highly correlated with each other in the absence of any motor processing task [4]. Since then similar  correlations have been found in other systems such as the visual system, language system, default mode system, dorsal and ventral attention systems, salience system and control system [5]. Furthermore, temporally the non-task BOLD fMRI signal displays a 1/f distribution, similar to the 1/f distributions observed in non-task EEG and MEG recordings [6]. Not only are these patterns of non-task state activity observed in multiple systems at the same time, but qualitatively similar patterns are also observed under conditions of sleep [7] and light anesthesia [8]. Similar structure in non-task activity has also been observed in other species [9]. There is now an increasing body of work that suggests that these non-task BOLD signal correlations are functionally relevant. For example, it has been shown that the non-task BOLD fMRI signal can account for variability in task related BOLD fMRI signal (button pressing task) [10].  Much work remains to understand the neurophysiological basis of the non-task fMRI BOLD signal, but one thing we can say is that the brain at \"rest\" is far from idle, and brain activity during non-task states seems to be critical for information processing. The other idea that using \"more\" of the brain is always desirable can also be challenged. Behavior would point towards efficiency in neural processing being more desirable than increased activity since we know that experts often exert far less cognitive effort than novices. Neural data makes similar suggestions. For example, repeatedly presenting visual stimuli leads to repetition suppression of neural responses [11]. We also have evidence that sparse coding strategies in the brain allow for increase in representational power while reducing metabolic costs [12].

            "answer_text": "If we force to use 100% of our brain, It would look like this:  Seriously, the only situation that I know in which a person can \u201cuse\u201d 100% brain utility (using every neuron connection at the same time) is during seizures. If someone know any other scenario, please tell me in the comments. It comes down to how our brain proccesses information. Our brain doesn\u2019t work like most computer CPUs. Most current generation CPUs have cores that can do almost any task at a fix clock speed, basically every CPU cores is the same. Because of this universal versatility, you can utilize it to 100% CPU time utilization, in which every core is doing everything as fast as it can, to do the set of tasks you give to it. Because the RAM channel bandwidth is very high, you have relatively little problem in task scheduling. For the brain, you can replace \u201ccores\u201d with a \u201cnuclei\u201d which is a cluster of neurons that does a specific task. Our brain processes different kind of task/information in different part of the brain (cores), and there\u2019s so many of them. Even every muscle that controls your fingers has its own \u201cmotor core\u201d (a network of neuron dedicated to control that finger). If a core is not receiving enough information, it will not utilize every neuron on that core. But if it receives more information than it can handle, it will run at 100% utility, and ignore what it can\u2019t process at the time (the data is lost). Now, there's a special bundle of cores, called the prefrontal cortex. That's where you make conscious decisions based on the information coming from other brain area, although this part is physically relatively big compared to other cores, this core is easily overloaded because the task is so complex. Your standard IQ test mostly measures this core's performance. Edit: Some say that this brain region is where your consciousness resides, but it hasn\u2019t been proven to be true or not. It is still an interesting controversial topic (thanks to Kai Voges for the edit). For example, if you\u2019re playing basketball and you have the ball while dribling towards your opponents ring. This is what happens in your brain: Your balance cores are busy determining where your center of mass is, your speed, your orientation, angle of attack while running, accelerations, tracking where your legs are (this information is fetched from \u201cproprioception cores\u201d), knowing the ground textures (fetched from the visual cores), and a bunch of other stuff.Your visual cores are busy tracking the movements of the ball, separating the player from the background, judging distances, recognizing your team mates, knowing where the line is, judging the speed/acceleration of other players, and much more.Your motor cores are busy determining which muscle strands to contract at what time to move a limb, how much power that goes in a movement, etc. This core\u2019s relationship with the proprioception cores is vital.Proprioception cores \u201cremember\u201d where your limbs are so you don\u2019t get trampled by your own legs. (Yes, stumbling for no reason is your proprioception failing to do its job)Your thalamus filters out unnecesary information that will otherwise make your brain utterly ineficient and slow because of overloading (I have experienced it, its not very pleasant, theres a wikipedia page about it: \u201csensory overload\u201d)Your audio cores are not so busy, they are waiting for a command or audio communications from other players. By constantly analyzing every vibration in the air that sounds like a human voice, and half-ass processing other sounds. If it finds a human voice, it will conveniently articulate it back into words for you.Your olfactory (chemical sensor) cores aren\u2019t doing much. There\u2019s not enough relevant information from the environment. It's beneficial to actually do this, since your thalamus and your prefrontal cortex bandwidth are easily overloaded.Your somatosensory cores (skin sensors) are mainly analyzing pressure points all over your body, and relaying this information to the prefrontal cortex and the others.The prefrontal cortex (your consciousness) is very busy doing a lot of analyzing, strategy, predictions, risk managing, decision making, etc. by processing the information from all of the cores above. And then it tells the motor cores what to do.All of the cores above are intricately interconnected, and constantly interchanging information, which results in massively pararel processing.So, because not all information is relevant to the situation, there\u2019re always some cores that have nothing to do, for there is simply not enough useful information to process. But there\u2019s more\u2026 The brain stores information in its structure of neural connections. If you fire a random neuron without a relevant stimulus, it will trigger memories/muscle memories that aren\u2019t even related to the situation. Imagine you fire a neuron that triggers your bladder/urethra muscle memory to pee. Or your muscle memory to play a piano while you\u2019re holding a guitar. Your finger will press the guitar strings like a piano key. Or some random sensation memory, like smelling an apple juice, or something. And then, imagine all\u2026 every muscle memory and mental/sensation memory that you have up until now being triggered. Now you are remembering and doing everything you know how to do. At the same time. Can you guess what would be the result? Yes, a realy bad total seizure\u2026 And no, you will not even be conscious if that happens. So, the reason the brain cannot functionally operate at 100% utility is: not every piece of information is relevant to the situation, and there\u2019s simply not enough useful information to process. (Non-useful information will only cloud your judgment, you don\u2019t want that)There\u2019re always some specialized cores that have nothing to do, because there\u2019s not enough specialized kind of information for it to process.bottlenecks in some part of the brain.and it will make you do and feel everything you know at once. In other word, a very bad seizure.Sensory overload sucksP.S: I\u2019m a new writer here. Please have some mercy, and suggest edits if you can, English is not my first language. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone already does. All animals, humans included, use 100% of their brains. Variations of this zombie question on Quora refuse to die despite double-tap attempts to answer them. So here\u2019s another go at it. The concept that we use less than 100% of our brain has 19th Century origins (Ten percent of the brain myth - Wikipedia), but has become a science(?) fiction trope that is without any actual scientific credibility. It deserves to die, but idiotic books, movies like Lucy, and TV shows like Limitless keep resurrecting it because their writers seem unable to come up with better, original plot devices. Despite appearances, everyone always uses 100% of their brains all the time. No part of your brain is loafing. No spare, residual, unused capacity is built-in. It's too expensive (energetically, evolutionarily, personally) to have unused brain capacity just sitting around, doing nothing. The appearance of fMRI images is especially misleading. The images are produced by heavy statistical data manipulation to emphasize minute differences in activity. The differences are minuscule and dark areas are not \u201cinactive.\u201d Recreating You and Your Universe inside your skull takes a lot of constant processing and energy (http://qr.ae/Rg7gFW; Appraising the brain's energy budget). This is known because we can measure brain metabolic activity. Besides... Neurons do not have \"off\" switches. They never goof off; they're \"on,\" alert, armed and ready for action (potentials). They maintain electrical potential gradients across their membranes that are truly \u201cshocking\u201d (yeah, I know it's just mV, but those membranes are thin). They store up synaptic ammo, they keep their powder dry and their barrels clean and their tasers charged...and all the while they're evaluating myriad inputs and assessing whether they need to pull the trigger, or grow a synaptic bouton here, or a dendritic spine there, or ooze peptides elsewhere, or secrete neurotropic factors somewhere, or neurotrophic factors wherever..... Many people asking and answering these types of questions seem to think that soma and axon action potentials are a profound measure of brain activity. Not true. Dendrites, for instance spike much more often than somas (Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats). In any event, action potentials utilize a minuscule amount of the energy maintained across a neuron's cell membrane and they manifest only one aspect of an extremely active cell. Neuron axons aren't firing most of the time (Neuron firing rates in humans), but even when no spiking occurs, neurons are busy, busy, busy, everyone of them, all the time. For instance, dendrite filopodia writhe, snake-like, as they restlessly make and break synaptic connections*. Besides, sometimes just waiting at attention and being ready is the most important job of all. Dave Brodbeck explains it thusly, \u201cWhen I teach intro neuroscience I tell students to think of neurons that aren\u2019t firing as being like drawn bows. They aren\u2019t shooting arrows, but it takes a lot of energy to keep a bow drawn.\u201d Addendum: a related meme occurring in many answers to this question is that the result of using 100% of our brains would be a \u201cseizure.\u201d This curious meme is nonsense. It results from a bizarre concept of neuronal \u201cusage\u201d and an unwarranted focus on tetanic excitatory action potentials as the only metric of neuron activity. Neurons do so much more than just fire off action potentials. A lot of what they\u2019re about occurs in dendrites and synapses and then there\u2019s all that cellular activity because they\u2019re very active, living cells. This meme results from unsophisticated concepts of what occurs during seizures. Let me clue you in, folks. It doesn\u2019t involve 100% of brain cells firing. Most people think of tonic-clonic convulsions when they think about the semiology of seizures at all. However, the effect of all neurons firing at once most likely would be a jerk followed by an akinetic seizure (drop attack) and death as inhibitory neurons shut everything down. Be that as it may, answering a credulous question with made-up nonsense is discouraged.

            "answer_text": "Obviously, we use 100% of our neurons, and obviously this is not the number of involved neurons which makes the effectiveness of our different intelligences. The brain of the elephant has 267 billion (86 billion humans); if the counting concerns only the neocortex, the most recent part of the brain, we are still behind the pilot whale: 37 billion compared with 19 to 23 billion in the adult human brain. We should also mention the case of a person in which a systematic scanner discovered a box cranial essentially filled with water (hydrocephalus), lined with a layer of neurons representing 10% of the number usually present in a brain, and living normally in the society with an IQ in the average. If the planet hosts a human rather than elephantine or whaline civilization, it is a matter of organization. Brain organization, and social organization which is a set of rules hosted by this cerebral organization. It is not a specific structure of the nerve centers. The neocortex is certainly larger in humans, but the general organization of the brain is the same, since the lamprey marine to primates through the mouse. The most singular characteristic of man is that his brain continues its maturation several years after birth, while it is intrauterine in other species. Within our own species we know that the effectiveness of the brain is extremely variable. This isn't in dissecting it that we can know whether it belongs to Einstein or a mentally deficient. Everything depends on the quality of the self-organization of neurons, allowing progressive tiering of elementary concepts in sophisticated concepts, a pyramid leading to increasing elevation of consciousness attached to certain areas. Because it is not possible to compare the experienced consciences. Only their contents. One can know solve a mathematical puzzle and not succeeding to tie his shoelace, while another can you repair a car with closed eyes and give you a fanciful bill because he does not know to count. How to improve the self-organization of these neurons, since it is ultimately the true meaning of the question? Long subject that we can address only by small keys[1] [2] , using the theory of operation of the mind described here[3].

            "answer_text": "Let me ask you this: How would the world change if humans could use 100% of a\u2026 chair?  If we could use 100% of that chair, do you think our civilization would ascend to the next level? Would we unlock the chair\u2019s secret potential or something? Some things that probably crossed your mind: What a hell is he even talking about?What 100% of the chair?What does it even mean: is it like\u2026 sitting on a chair in a way when 100% of its surface is in contact with someone\u2019s ass, or what?What does hidden potential even have to do with it?How could someone even measure the use of a chairs in percentage? It\u2019s not gasoline that you can pour in a car and say: \u201cHere, I\u2019ve used all we had, which makes it 100%!\u201dBelieve it or not, but I\u2019m wondering the same things while looking at your question. I have no idea what you mean. I have no idea how could someone use a percentage of a brain. I have no idea what does percentage of the brain has to do with anything: be it the world, potential, or whatever. I have no idea how to measure it in percentage in the first place. But I understand. I mean, there are functions in our body that can be approximated by a percentage. Muscle contractions, for example: when half of muscle fibers are activated, we could say that the person is using 50% of her muscle\u2019s potential. It\u2019s only logical: the more fibers are activated at the same time, the stronger the muscle pulls; if all fibers are activated, then it\u2019s 100%. Muscle strength is a linear property that correlates with the quantity of activated fibers \u2014 hence percentage makes sense. But neither brain nor intelligence work like that. It\u2019s not a muscle, when the harder you flex it, the stronger you think \u2014 doesn\u2019t work like that. If you think it does, then you\u2019ve been misled by low-quality education, unfortunately. It doesn\u2019t function on \u201cthe more \u2014 the better\u201d basis. It\u2019s more like a computer: an intricate structure made from many different parts with different functions that work together in coordinated manner to deliver the result. You might not be using every part of it at any given time, but that\u2019s the whole point. If you magically remove some fibers from a muscle, the muscle becomes weaker. But if you magically remove parts of a brain, then either the brain will stop working completely, or it will lose some of its functionality. Last but not the least, brain is just an organ. It\u2019s a cluster of conductive tissue that allows us processing information in very physical and straightforward manner. There\u2019s no magic or mystery about it \u2014 it works exactly as expected. There\u2019s no more \u201chidden potential\u201d to it than there is to the heart or to the kidney.  P.S. Of course you could eat someone\u2019s brain and claim that you\u2019ve used 100% of available calories. Or perhaps annihilate every atom of someone\u2019s brain with antimatter \u2014 definitely doesn\u2019t get more 100% than this. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of amazing, terrible, and mundane things--in fact, just step outside: that's what the world looks like when we use 100% of our brains. The trope evolved from misunderstandings and marketing jargon, but we can use this as a teachable moment to discuss interesting ideas.  In some sense \"using more of your brain\" could describe an epileptic seizure, where too many of your neurons activate at once for any useful patterns to happen.  That's educationally convenient because seizures also demonstrate that visually, since having more of your *muscles* activate at high levels simultaneously leaves you physically helpless in a viscerally disturbing way. On the other hand, most of your neurons are never really \"off\": they are tonic, firing at some typical frequency when left alone.  Why?  That could be healthier for them, or it could be computationally convenient since you can turn the dial down as well as up, or it could be critical for making sure your body does essential things whether or not there is outside stimulation etc.  Interesting topic. On the other other hand, it is fascinating that people are ready to believe that evolution gave us wondrous abilities that we rarely or never use.  \"Never\" would be ridiculous, if the ability never comes up there can be no selective pressure encouraging it.  But \"rarely\" is interesting, you can see how hysterical strength or slowing your metabolism while drowning might be incredible advantages when they do come up.  And actually \"never\" can be misleading--our ancestors never played football or drove cars or typed Quora answers yet somehow we evolved the ability to do these things.  So \"releasing untapped human potential\" is real, and we do it by playing video games.  Even the idea of tropes evolving is interesting.  What makes some myths (urban or...suburban?) catch on and spread?  Can thoughts evolve in a way that parallels the much-studied evolution of the organisms that can have thoughts?  A whole field studying \"memes\" was born, blossomed, and has probably started declining, just in my lifetime. Anyway, it can be fun to take even silly ideas as starting points for exploration. ",

            "answer_text": "If it happens, your body will get so deprived of the fuel that run it, that it would lead to survival crisis!! Let me clarify you, it's a fact that you certainly uses entire brain over a period of time, but not at once. It's the survival instinct of our body which shuts down the part of the brain which is not related to received stimuli from the external environment to curb down the metabolism rate of the body. So, if one day you get any drug (like CPH4 in the movie Lucy) and your 100 percent brain functions activates at a same period, your brain will require so much blood circulation that will deprive all other organs of the body. It would certainly require so much of energy to run at this phenomenal capacity, that your body require food all the time,and you will feel munchies . Isn't it? So, it would be impossible for your body to handle that brain. That's why, the evolution process of our body reaches to a certain point,we are living today, where you can use use any function of the brain but can't at same time. Now it's time see if it happens(but that could be reality also,may one day) - You can see every action of your life as a holographic event out of many possibilities that could happen on first place. You will calculate the minor perturbarions and their possible result with accuracy. Causal events prediction can help you to see in future. You can act upon situation before it actually happen.You can see both the good and bad in the event at same time. So, you will become less judgemental.Negative emotions vanishes-because every misunderstanding leads to anger,hate, jealousy\u2026.but if you can sense the point of view of another person and you can see the situation as a third person,then you would not be angry on another person.It means you get a level of mind reading.Caution: The article you are going to read can bend your brain As you all know that what we perceive as reality of outside world invokes the neural connections in the brain , but in limited ways. If you can use 100 percent brain , it means any neuron can intact with any neuron at a distinct part of the brain. It means every neuron is free to make random neural connection. So, you eat food with creativity, hammer the nail on the wall with a pleasure of sexuality, read the book loosing yourself to the fantasy world, walking on the road with countless emotions and endless possibilities that could happen, which will change your outlook for the world forever!! You will never feel depression as everything feels amazing\u2026.phenomenal thinking capacity can breaks the preprogrammed notions that you had acquired since childhood\u2026. Any neuron can latch with any other distinct neuron. So, in that case, you would feel the sense of complete knowing. In simple world your subjective world would never be the same. World is not what you perceive from external stimulus, it is what you subjectively perceive from your limited brain capacity. And there are two possible scenarios then, CASE 1-You could be labelled as \u201c Mad\u201d because you are incomprehensible to the normal person\u2026. CASE 2- You could be labelled as \u201cGod\u201d because you are talking about something incomprehensible\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever thought if you could solve that 3-page lengthy problem of that boring maths class in a matter of a second. Or why a computer can multitask so better but we humans, who created it, couldn\u2019t. If you could devise your own time machine had you got enough brains. Ever thought what would happen if you could use 100 of your brain? Well, if all these tasks were done in the blink of an eye then it would turn very comfortable for the human race. Percentage of the brain used by Einstein  Scientists have been researching for decades to vouch for the percentage of brains, we humans are really able to use. The origin of this myth that humans are only able to use 10% of their brain took from some prevalent theories from the 19th century. And since then it has become a hot topic for some of the science fictions without any scientific credibility. This myth took speed with a common belief that percentage of the brain used by the great scientist Albert Einstein was 13% which is just 3% more utilization than the normal human. He did many amazing scientific discoveries and people thought that if we were able to use 100% of our brains than that would bring wonders to this world. 10% brain usages myth The belief that we are only able to use 10% of our brains is half truth and half a lie. The only truth to this 10% myth is that our brain consists of 10% neurons which help us in processing and transmittinginformation while the remaining 90% is made of glial cells which act as a support system for the neurons and provides insulation to them. Do you know how heavy the human head is? Well, it comprises 3% of the total body weight but still, it utilises 20%of the total energy of the body. If it had to work actively for a single problem then it will require so much blood circulation that the other organs would be deprived of it making it impossible for the body to control the brain leading to a survival crisis. The most part of the brain is busy controlling all the different kind of processes in the body. Let us understand this with the help of a simple analogy. Consider your brain as the CPU of the computer and you are busy seeing a video. CPU is not using all its power of process in playing a video, however, in the background, it has to manage many other functions such as running the antivirus programmes, keeping the USB ports functioning or for that matter even rotating the hard drive. Now similarly at the time of you watching a video your brain performs many other functions for the body such as keeping your lungs breathing, maintaining your heartbeat, helping your eyes to see the video or helping your food to digest your food, so scientific studies have concluded that maybe only 10% of your brain would be focusing on seeing that video while the remaining 90% will be busy in performing other basic processes of your body. So the answer to the question that how much of our brains are we able to use is a 100% and the theories that we use only 10% of our brains is just a myth. ",

            "answer_text": "Lucy is not a romanticized pseudoscientific Hollywood Film, but is actually reality. So, is it really pseudoscience that we use 10 percent of the brain? No actually not. I know we use all parts of the brain, but we use specific parts for specific functions. And this is also not entirely true! More specifically, we use certain circuits that work together for specific functions. Yet! We do not use the functions that are not necessary for a specific task. Why should it be? To become tremendously impressive geniuses with endlessly cognitive abilities. What i actually mean, is... Synesthesia. It is not yet completely clear how this phenomenon arises, but Some scientists believe that synesthesia results from \"crossed-wiring\" in the brain. Years ago I saw a documentary about an Autistic Savant named Daniel Tammet with this condition. He sees colors and visuals when he thinks of numbers. He has memorized Pi to more than 22,500 digits, and he speaks 11 languages \u200b\u200b- one of which he learned in a week for a TV special. He can multiply enormous sums in his head in a matter of seconds.  So suppose we had more access to this cross-wiring phenomenon, what would we all be capable of? Physically feeling numbers and letters, connecting auditary memories to bodily sensations, seeing our intuition in visuals, Audio memorizing when seeing numbers. Or even feeling like kissing while on the phone, without doing the physical deed.. Maybe even more impressive things, or maybe nothing spectecular would happen. And perhaps synesthesia is not due to cross-wiring, but the suspicion is strong. But, if science can figure this phenomenon out and confirm the cross-wiring, we may be able to do more with our brain in the future through this phenomenon. Then maybe we can go from 10 percent to 100 percent, and become like Lucy!  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s kind of a ridiculous question, because your brain cells are always doing something. Most of it is trivial stuff like regulating bodily functions, generating neurotransmitters, coordinating muscles, and interpreting your senses. Other stuff is higher-level but mundane, like forming memories, discarding irrelevant sensory information, observing your mental and bodily state, and converting thoughts to and from language. It\u2019s more interesting to consider individual cases of \u201cmaxing out\u201d a function. Here are some common ones. You are aware of 100% of your senses. You simultaneously feel every touch on your entire body, get an unfiltered visual field, and are attentive to every sound, smell, and taste. You can feel every point your clothing touches your skin and every breeze on every hair. You can taste your own bad breath and the plaque on your teeth. Humming electrical wires and distant cars constantly interrupt you. Since you\u2019re getting an unfiltered visual field, you can no longer recognize people or track moving objects; because your brain no longer reorients your view, everything flips upside-down. Bright colors are almost painful, and looking around causes a disorienting visual smear. Your inner ear constantly tells you that you\u2019re off-balance. It\u2019s impossible to tell what\u2019s going on. You could be hit by a car while distracted by the feeling of air going into your nose. You can\u2019t walk because of the huge amount of information produced as your body shifts. You\u2019re probably experiencing something similar to severe autism, with even the tiniest touch or smell totally consuming your thoughts. Your brain needs to discard most of what you sense because most of the information is irrelevant or distracting. You can access 100% of your memories. With a thought, you can access every experience relating to it. You can immediately summon every memory of any object and replay your life in chronological order. Except you can\u2019t. You think about that time you tried coffee for the first time, and all you can recall is that it hurt. You remember your best friend\u2019s face perfectly, but his body is an amorphous blob, and there\u2019s no way he had acne when he was five. Reminiscing about college is physically painful because every memory is overlaid with oppressive, unceasing stress. You try to re-read a book and nearly all the pages are blank. On top of this, you find that your memory has gaps. Entire months are simply gone, with nothing at all. Your own wedding is a cloud of disjointed facts. Most of the memories are damaged, hastily redrawn with obvious inconsistencies. Earlier memories are more corruption than fact. Worst of all, every time you check back on a memory, it warps and decays, moving further from the truth. The issue is that you don\u2019t memorize very much. Your brain memorizes some important or interesting details, and when you recall it, your brain backfills the rest with general details that are probably correct. Most events don\u2019t get memorized at all - you keep them in memory for a short period, but they\u2019re never archived for long-term recall. On top of this, recalling a memory destroys it, and your brain does a poor job of rewriting it afterwards. You have 100% control over your attention and behavior. You declare a plan and your body springs into action, working ceaselessly until the job is done. Every distraction is banished, and your entire thought process and working memory are devoted to the task at hand. You sequence your to-do list and completely empty the easy items in a couple of days. You launch into your work project, making massive progress until you abruptly faint because you forgot to eat for the last 18 hours. So you start adding regular checks to eat and sleep, and you mix some workouts in there. It\u2019s trivial to stay healthy, because you have infinite willpower to eat and exercise. You tear through your work, devoting eight hours a day to uninterrupted focus with your full mental resources. Simple tasks are done almost as quickly as you can type, and you rarely forget things and never get lazy. Except you start making mistakes. There are factors you didn\u2019t consider, but by the time you realize, you\u2019ve already sunk another eight hours into it. You repeat bad habits because you didn\u2019t take a gut-check. You plunge into dead-ends, deciding that your work was wasted as soon as you finish. You make strategic and political missteps, failing to factor them into your plans before you execute them. You start taking planning more seriously, and realize that there\u2019s never enough information to be fully confident. You\u2019ve wasted weeks and your confidence is broken. You adopt a lockstep strategy of making a short plan, executing it, evaluating it, and repeating. Now, your performance is consistent and well-informed, but your raw output is slower than before. You struggle to explain that you spent an hour researching and two hours working to determine the probability of a longer-term plan succeeding. Even though your work is of exceptional quality, you fall behind your coworkers on all of your boss\u2019 metrics. When you discuss this with your boss, he fears that you\u2019re after his job. You use 100% of your brain for sentient thought. You gain the ability to reassign any neuron to work towards your self-awareness and thoughts. The ability is supernatural, since you can even reassign memory-forming white matter into action-taking gray matter. You immediately realize that if you accidentally overwrite your autonomous nervous system, you\u2019ll die. You\u2019ll have only seconds to learn how to pump your heart before you asphyxiate, minutes to determine how to breathe, and days to control your endocrine system before hormonal problems destroy your organs. After some experimentation, you realize that this power causes significant trade-offs. Converting memories into mind destroys them, so if you grow smarter, you become more ignorant. You could overwrite some language or sensory processing, but you don\u2019t know what point it will cause brain damage. Worst of all, you\u2019ll soon be able to make yourself happy on demand. The constant struggle between bliss and reality tears you apart. You\u2019re always aware of the fact that you\u2019re less than you could be, but if you became fully sentient, it would mean trapping yourself in a dying body with no senses or memories. Basically, evolution has done a pretty decent job at optimizing the average person\u2019s brain. There is some tuning to do, but on the whole, you\u2019re already using 100% of your brain in a pretty practical configuration. ",

You could speculate that you\u2019d be remembering everything that you\u2019ve remembered, not a guarantee because we don\u2019t exactly now how memories work, we believe it works on Neurons that fired in that moment get refired thus invoking how you felt and what happened in that moment, that would explain why you can get literal emotional pain from memories, but this likely wouldn\u2019t happen because the Neurons are all firing, not distinguishing how you felt and what happened in that moment, imagine you had this complex puzzle picture, throwing every single puzzle piece at a desk wouldn\u2019t make that picture come out. But even if somehow memories were invoked, you wouldn\u2019t recognize the memories or even process what\u2019s happening in them.

            "answer_text": "As previous answers put it, the fact that we only use some % of our brain's capacity is indeed a myth. I would like to add though that it seems that our brain capacity is much more than what we use it for, and that is true. Our brains are proven to be plastic and can change. So for example if you used a large part of the brain to enforce bad habits and negative emotions, that part can be re-wired so you could use it for positive habits and cultivating other useful skills. It now \"seems\" that you're using more of your brain, because you were probably only counting the positive, the good behaviors, not the negative ones. It is dangerous because our brain can easily learn a negative behavior just as easily as it can learn a positive one, but that doesn't mean our brain isn't used at full capacity. Take a drug lord for example, he may have a brain that is teeming with activity, because he is using it to build his network, stay away from law enforcers, figure out who's to be punished and stay ahead of the game by conquering territory with as little expense as possible. That seems like a lot of things his brain should do, and do them well, otherwise he'll end up dead or in prison. But no one is recognizing the fact that he's using his brain to its full potential. Even a couch potato can use his brain to full potential, while he is lying there, not thinking about anything else, his brain absorbs the information he's seeing on TV unconsciously, so he can develop a high skill of recognizing characters, discerning complicated plots, analysing visual scenes, etc. Of course, he will lack skills in any other domain of life, but his brain is used up by the kind of lifestyle he is living. It is therefore not a question of simply how much of the brain we use, but how much of the brain can we use for positive things. That is a question that I think remains open and because each person's learning ability and motivation is different, will not have a general answer. ",

Consciously in a self aware state of mind? No, that\u2019s literally impossible. But a huge chunk of the brain IS reserved for conscious self-aware daily activities. Your brain, fuck, YOUR LITERAL ENTIRE BODY, is constantly in the \u201con\u201d position literally every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year in your entire life up to the point until you die, assuming you don\u2019t have any disabilies or paralysis, and ignoring the given dead skin cells and other cells on your body constantly being shed every moment. But let\u2019s focus on the brain, since that is what you asked. Your brain is ALWAYS 100% active 100% of the time. Sure, some regions may be LESS active during certain times of the day, such as when you sleep, but it is still 100% active 100% of your time alive on earth nonetheless. Whether you\u2019re passively breathing, reading a boring textbook, or fully engaged in an engrossing video game, all parts of your brain will always be active till the moment you die, and it doesn\u2019t take a medical genius to know that. In fact, it\u2019s common sense if you ever finished high school with any decent grades. If you are thinking to yourself that \u201cif humans could \u2018consciously\u2019 use 100% of their brains, they would gain literal superpowers and be able to fly and levitate things with their mind! \u201c, then you are DEAD wrong (pun INTENDED! XDD) ! such comic book phenomena literally never did, and literally never will exist, because they break the laws of physics. Those phenomena literally cannot exist. The real queestion is: what are you trying to acheive, when asking this question? Are you hoping that any of us can give you a comical, slightly feasible and believable scientific answer, that it may give you hope of becoming a modern day superhero? You don\u2019t need to be a supergenius to succeed in life (although admittedly it is a MASSIVE perk which makes learning things SUPER EASY). If that was your hope, then sorry my friend, you will never find that pot of gold over the rainbow. I guess, to answer your question, if we COULD \u201cuse\u201d 100% of our brain, nothing would happen. You literally wouldn\u2019t feel any different, your brain wouldn\u2019t magically swell into the size of a soccer ball, and you wouldn\u2019t become an evil genius madman like stewie griffin xDDD. At most, you would be much more intelligent, be way more efficient in the way you do things, and be overall happier in life. I hope that answer sufficed. :3 ",

            "answer_text": "There are many angles of approaching this one depending on your interpretation of the background context for the question. One point I didn\u2019t see mentioned in the long list of very good previous answers is: We primarily learn by example, even when it comes to learning how to use our own brain. Consider feral children for example, or the fact that a person who is born blind will never walk on two legs unless taught to do so. Many animals with all the same parts in their brains (or fewer) are able to perceive things and communicate in ways that we humans are generally ignorant to. There are a lot of documented proofs of things like significantly superior intelligence, telekinesis, psychic abilities, astral projection, premonition, self-healing beyond the ability of modern medicine, ext\u2026 In most cases we don\u2019t need to use these abilities to survive and so they remain undeveloped and \u201cforgotten.\u201d Also, from birth, our parents and peers have not shown us how its done or that it is even possible; if any thing we are taught that it is not. (Note: people who do develop and utilize uncommon or above average mental abilities often suffer from brain related ailments like seizure, migraine, dementia\u2026) It would be absolutely morally unacceptable and impossible to conduct a sterile experiment with all unknown variables removed (though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been tried), but, theoretically: If a child were raised from test tube conception, and somehow remained isolated for life from contact of any kind with other living beings (from whose bad habit of going through life brain-dead could be learned), then was somehow taught from the beginning (maybe by use of computer generated virtual reality) that all these sorts of things were not only possible but normal: the subject would very likely develop a much greater brain utilization as well as so called \u201cimpossible\u201d abilities. That is, if it didn\u2019t die from loneliness first. ",

            "answer_text": "I am an amateur scientist (BS Physics) without official credentials in neuroscience. Yet I spent my entire grammar school through high school years apprenticing in a well-known wet neuroscience lab, so review the literature I reference if you do not believe what I say here. The views expressed here are entirely my own except where I make reference. Let's say that we take 100% brain use seriously. All synapses of all neurons are activated at the same time. On the face of it, an undifferentiated global pulse in the brain has no value at all, informationally similar to no activity at all. So 100% must mean something else. There must be patterns of activity. A pattern means a volume of activity next to a volume of inactivity. A naive view would choose 50%/50% active/inactive as 100% use of the brain. However, this fails horribly. Consider that an image filled with white noise is essentially as useful as no activity at all. Then, what makes activity informationally rich? I propose that one should expect something like a volume diffraction pattern expressing activity identifying sharp boundaries between adjacent fields of undifferentiated inactivity. The ability for these boundaries to migrate as activity surfaces through a field of inactivity seems like a viable starting hypothesis for making best use of neural organs. So, if this hypothesis were reasonable, and we wanted to be able to move an activity surface over 10 times its surface depth as wiggle-room, that would already cut down useful activity to no more than 1/10th of the cells in the brain. But this presupposes that one has a laminated layer-cake of activity as best use. This makes no sense either since there is little informational richness in moving layers up and down relative to each other. So, a more informationally appropriate use would be bubbles of activity where the surface of activity surrounds a volume of inactivity and which bubble is sufficiently distant from other bubbles. Still using the factor of 10 suggested before, and a volume containing bubbles of radius 10 and kept a distance 10 away from nearest neighbors, the unit activity surface is 4*pi*r*r and the volume is 2*4*pi*r*r*r/3 for a active/total population ratio of 1/60th of the cells in the brain. So, for any more than 1 out of every 60 cells to be active would support this second approximation of informationally useful activity. But this, also, is inappropriate because a box full of same size bubbles is still informationally poor. This is where we come back to the idea of \"3D diffraction patterns\". The original holograms had a peculiar zebra-stripe appearance where shining a reference laser at an angle caused a 3D image of a scene to be visible. These holograms were 2D diffraction patterns capable of storing 3D information. My third hypothesis is that 3D diffraction patterns supported by neural organs are capable of reproducing 3D images with acceptable time-transitions. Such a scheme would require the wiggle-room to be larger in places, such that the likely population of active neurons could be cut possible by an order of magnitude. So, now we are down to 1 in every 600-1000 brain cells active at any given time. My guess is that more \"intelligent\" people are the ones capable of performing more transforms on these activity surfaces to achieve a more varied outcome while less \"intelligent\" people use a more limited set of transforms. But this is rank speculation with no foundation in existing literature. I am conducting experiments to collect anecdotal evidence that the hypothesis is plausible. The experiments involve rote training to install alternative dissimilar reflex pathways for people presented with situations in which their prior reflexes were monotonous. Sherrington, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in neuroscience proposed that there is no single neuron unaffected by every other neuron in the nervous system. All activity is as a contributing member of a community and all neurons contribute. Since all cells are autonomous cells, they perform normal cellular functions as well as providing signals to distant cells when necessary and sufficient conditions are met. The notion of using only 10% is difficult to understand. \"They also serve who only stand and wait\" (Churchill). The vast majority (perhaps 97% or more) of axons are fully insulated without nodes of Ranvier (no access to external ions needed for Hodgkin&Huxley membrane pulse propagation) and therefore not carriers of membrane pulses. To see how the ubiquitous \"unmyelinated\" axons are insulated, review the image in Grays Anatomy 35th British Edition, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1973, pg 782. To justify the 97%, see \"Functional properties of regenerated optic axons terminating in the primary olfactory cortex\", Scalia, Brain Research, 685 (1995) 187-197 (speculation: Lissauer's tract in the spinal cord is vanishingly small yet may contain more axons than the entire rest of the spinal cord). The reason investigators prefer experiments on myelinated axons is that they are larger and easier to investigate; which means only 3% of axons generate the \"pulses\" used for the modern practice of brain mapping. Measuring gross signals in the smaller axons is published in the Gasser and Erlanger 1944 Nobel lectures. Measuring them individually is published in \"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain\", Lettvin, Proceedings of the IRE, November 1959, pg 1940-1951. From what I have been able to interpret, a lot of the activity of the brain is the attempt to inhibit activity (bulbo-reticular inhibitory system). The inhibitory system is extraordinarily powerful with much global general inhibition preventing excitations and more focal inhibitions constraining excitations in more specific ways. Strychnine, apparently, increases activity in the central nervous system. An animal with strychnine poisoning was relieved of seizures by stimulating the bulbo-reticular inhibitory system (private communication with J. Y. Lettvin). All this is purely my own personal interpretation of informational necessities in nervous systems. It may be wholly unsupportable when reviewed by a professional, but then again, it may not. Errors in factual material are my own and I invite clear non-ad-hominem corrections. I welcome feedback and discussion on this material. ",

            "answer_text": " Human brain is one of the most complex things in the world to understand. It control many voluntary and involuntary activities with the help of millions and millions of neurons. Many people believe that we use only 10% of our brain ability. There are assumptions that if we somehow become able to use 100% of brain potential we can solve the mysteries of universe, we will have telekinetic power, we can travel across the time and what not,. There is also a movie exploring the possiblities (Lucy). But, it\u2019s a myth. It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time. Brain is just 3% of body weight and use almost 20% of body energy. Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain. Thermal scans and MRI has shown 100% activity in brain. Scans has shown that while doing any voulntary or involuntary action different parts of brain function simultaneously. for example - Take the simple act of pouring coffee in the morning: In walking toward the coffeepot, reaching for it, pouring the brew into the mug, even leaving extra room for cream, the occipital and parietal lobes, motor sensory and sensory motor cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and frontal lobes all activate. A lightning storm of neuronal activity occurs almost across the entire brain in the time span of a few seconds. This isn't to say that if the brain were damaged that you wouldn't be able to perform daily duties, There are people who have injured their brains or had parts of it removed who still live fairly normal lives, but that is because the brain has a way of compensating and making sure that what's left takes over the activity. Our brain is a complex thing and we still don\u2019t know much about it. We have seen people doing impossbile stuffs. Like kids learning calculus at age of 12, people memorizing the whole deck of card, people holding their breath for 15 minutes and what not. It\u2019s all about training the brain, it is scientificaly proven that anyone can do these things by training the brain and constantly pushing the limits. Its not about how much percent brain can we use its about how much can we train it. Thank you References: Do People Only Use 10 Percent of Their Brains?

            "answer_text": "While plenty of answers have addressed the 10% of your brain myth (see also What happen if human use 100% of its brain?, Is it true that humans only use 10% of their brain?, etc.) I believe you phrased your question carefully enough that it's worth addressing the deeper issue people are touching on when they ask these questions. There is a sense people have that they aren't reaching their full potential. Whether it is laziness or constantly facing limitations in what we can do versus what we can imagine, we cling to this belief that there is some secret way to unleash the untapped capacity of our mind. Pretty much everyone I know - from workaholic professors to rich entrepreneurs - feels like they don't perform to their peak capacity. That should tell you that the notion of underusing our (brain) potential is primarily a matter of perception and not reality. Indeed, as we begin to better understand the science of learning and memory, we now understand that sleep (Sleep and learning), leisure (More time for leisure increases employee productivity), play (Let the Children Play, It's Good for Them!) and day dreaming (Resting state fMRI) are all important components of cognitive development and cognitive performance. That is, while you think you may be wasting your potential by vegging out, letting you mind wander or even sleeping a few extra hours, you probably are not. In fact, if you weren't doing this stuff, you could very well be functioning more poorly. We still don't know the optimal balance of all these cognitive processes, but it's likely that we aren't too far off. Having said that there are certainly ways to improve your productivity and to work smarter and not harder. There are proven ways of improving learning and memory and getting better at problem solving. Similarly, there are clear ways in which you can waste potential by not treating your body and mind well (What are the most stimulating activities for your brain?) What would happen if we put all of these methods, knowledge and techniques to maximal use? What history has shown us is that there is apparently no upper bound to humans' potential. Human technology, language and accomplishment are not genetically endowed phenotypes. Rather, they are self-reinforcing cultural scaffolding, allowing us to attain ever higher goals.  For example, imagine if you told Aristotle that in 2000 years, every (educated) 12 year old would be doing mathematics far more complicated than he could comprehend. He would probably surmise that humans' brain capacity had somehow increased or evolved, though that certainly hasn't happened at all. Or consider the Flynn effect, the constantly rising IQ observed in the Western World. The time span where we've observed this is way too short for any biological explanation. Instead, it's all cultural, the way one generation of humanity builds on the next. So, in terms of what our full capacity is, it's better to think of human intelligence and brain function not on a scale, from 0-100, but rather bounded only at the origin, from 0 to infinity. That is, more like the height of a building or population of earth.* There is no 100%. Our capacity for art, knowledge and creativity is forever increasing, generation after generation.   * - I realize that in  both cases there actually are practical upper bounds to these things, but the supposed upper bounds keep being passed (Thomas Robert Malthus) and any true upper bound is so far away from where we currently are so as to be immaterial.

            "answer_text": "Well 10% brain use is a myth as Neurologist Barry Gordon said the myth is false and \"we use virtually every part of the brain, and that (most of) the brain is active almost all the time. He also gave evidences for this: 1. If we used only 10% of our brains we'd have evolved with brains with much smaller in size as the brain is the most costly organ in terms of nutrients and oxygen. So if we had small brains it would have been more beneficial as our bodies would have to provide for a much smaller brain. ( 20% of the body's energy is used by brain). Hence, 10% theory have both survival and evolutionary disadvantage.2.  Now, if 90% of brain area is unused then any brain damage should not have any effect on the body but that doesn't happen.Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects.3. Brain scans have shown that no matter what one is doing, all brain areas are always active.4.Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.5. PET scan and MRI scans have revealed that our brain is active even when we are sleeping.6.Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90 percent of the brain were inactive, autopsy of normal adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration. But why this myth continues is somehow, somewhere, someone started this myth and the popular media keep on repaeating this myth and then everyone believes the statement regardless of the evidence. So for the question that what will happen one used their 100% of the brain: it will be normal, and if a person is not able to use their 100% of the brain, it can be a sign of brain damage and can be fatal.

            "answer_text": "What could a person using 100% of their brain do? Fly? Infiltrate computers systems? Uncover the deep truths of the universe? No, they could seize, and that\u2019s about it. A person with a 100% activated brain would shake uncontrollably and become unable to maintain consciousness. This is a recurrent question on the internet because, from a surface level perspective, it seems weird that the brain is normally not being \u201cfully utilized.\u201d However, the idea that more activation equals more brain power is ultimately a misunderstanding of how biological and information processing systems work. One thing to keep in mind is that the brain synapses are actually firing at all different locations of the brain at every second. No spot ceases activity unless there is severe damage. Neuroimaging techniques (such as MRI, PET, etc.) do not give this impression because they generate a picture based on different criteria stemming from complex statistical methods. The colored areas in a picture represent, depending on the method, blood-oxygen levels, radioactive sugar concentration, and many other things\u2014none of them being simple \u201cactivation.\u201d But, in general, blank areas on a computer-generated image are not inert in real life. Moreover, the brain is heavily specialized: each different part of it serves some specific functions. This means that it simply would not make sense for the brain to fire rapidly all over when no situation would ever require all of its functions at once. For example, if you focus your attention on a motor-task (e.g. playing videogames), the areas of your brain that specialize in this function (in this case, the motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia) will become more excited than the rest. Diverting your brain\u2019s precious resources to your social cognition areas would simply be a waste when you are trying to make those difficult jumps in the new Mario game. I think it helps to think about this problem by comparing the brain to a computer. Your computer stores files with binary codes\u2014sequences of 1s and 0s. If you considered the 1 state as \u201cactivation\u201d, this would lead you to consider more 1s as \u201cmore activation\u201d, and thus more 1s would be better\u2026 right? Wrong. If you altered all the 0s in your computer\u2019s code to 1s, it would simply crash and be ruined beyond repair. Both the 1s and the 0s are required for information to be stored, for the programs to work, and for your computer to function. Likewise, pure excitation in the brain is absolute chaos. The organ creates order by carefully balancing activation and inhibition. Hope this helps. ",

We may have the ability to interpret more impulses once we teach our brain to take action, therefore increasing our ability to collectively integrate more thoughts, invoking reason, and finalizing the full total ends in a faster plus more correct manner.  It is proved that Steve Hawking is using 100% of the brian. You can find details information Go Here    Evidently we use different parts of our brain to process different alerts. Your innate a reaction to things such as getting burned up is processed in a single area. Memory are stored in another certain area. Likewise, vision is also computed by another portion of your brain. However, some social people have the ability to understand things faster than others, a lot of people have considerably faster reactions (like certain CS:GO players I understand), just as a lot of people are more creative or intuitive than others. We've math geeks, computer wizards, programming geniuses, scientists, artists, etc. Most of them have a certain center and greater handling power because of their respective areas.  The idea is thought by me to the is based on the accelerate, the accuracy, and the depth of the control of impulses from each certain section of the brain.      The frontal lobe manages recognizing future results caused by current actions, choosing between good and bad activities, suppressing and overriding undesirable cultural replies, and deciding similarities and distinctions between things or events.  Now, for example, when you read a booklet and do not understand a expression, often you miss it. You may listen to it several times in videos then. There could come a period when you ask someone what this means, or you hear or browse the definition for this somewhere. You then start realizing it a lot more commonly, in places where it might have been but you were unaware of its occurrence always.  Practice makes perfect  With enough research and practice you might find the same skills (so long as you don't possess a physical impediment), and could some day exceed his level. The key to the, obviously, is perseverance and being available to try new things. In the event that you always criticise or blame yourself, or you are terrified of seeking something new, then you may never advance.  ",

The 10% is a myth for several reasons, the two most common reasons are; Our brain has been shaped by natural selection. The brain is a very expensive organ to have and run. It needs a lot of energy, oxygen and water to function. It strains our ability in many ways.Losing less than 90% f the brain have severe consequences. Any small injury can impair a lot of functions, how would that be a problem if we only used 10?We, of course, don\u2019t use 100% of our brain all the time either. Because then the hyperactivity of neurons will cause several issues such as epilepsy and other neurological disorders. No one wants seizures. The function of our brain has to do with the quality of activity than quantity. Some groups of neurons are active when you\u2019re doing a certain task, while others become inactive. Let\u2019s take a simple example, listening to music: Your auditory cortex is activated. This is where you take in the music and analyse its components.Your auditory cortex works with the cerebellum, and they break the music to even further to more elementary components.The cerebellum is connected with the amygdala, and since it\u2019s responsible for emotions, survival instincts, and memory, we get emotional to a song or get the chills.Our visual cortex is also activated whether we\u2019re watching a music video or similar things.The rhythm of music activates areas of Prefrontal lobe that\u2019s responsible complex behaviorsCingulate for emotion and behaviourParietal lobe sensation, perception and integrating sensory inputTemporal cortex high-level auditory processingAnd the somatosensory system, the part of the sensory system concerned with the conscious perception of touch, pressure, pain, temperature, position, movement, and vibration, which arise from the muscles, joints, skin, and fascia.See? Quite many areas. ",

Sometimes we make use of drawing room ,at times we are in kitchen and at night we use our bedroom. At the end of the day we should have used all the rooms of our home. Similarly, our brain has different areas that are dedicated to perform various functions. Each area of brain is active when we perform different functions. For example, the process of vision is subserved by the occipital lobe and memory is processed in the temporal lobes and frontal lobe takes up the executive functions. Our brain is remarkable structure with lots of interconnected neurons. Different parts light up during different activities. Hence by the end of day we should have utilized 100% of the brain for sure. Now there is a general notion that we utilize only 10% of brain and that the other part is lying un-utilized and that if we could somehow utilize the whole brain , we could have super-natural powers. This scenario has been depicted in certain cult classic movies like Lucy and Limitless. This is basically a myth. Yes, in certain abnormal conditions like generalised epilepsy, the whole brain can get activated all at once - but this comes with a price - the result is what's known as a seizure. ",

Good luck trying to fire the exact number of neurons needed to move all of the muscles in your body, the the exact amount needed, simultaneously. You'd need to think about twitching your left eyeball's left muscle (I don't know what it's called off the top of my head), and then the right side, to stop it from moving too far, and then again for the right one, slightly offset, so they focus at the same spot, all while flexing or relaxing both lenses the right amount, all while keeping your neck straight, while breathing in and out at the right rate, while making sure all the other muscles in your body are flexing just the right way, so you don't just tip over and fall. This list doesn't include constantly scanning what you see and hear for threats, your name, etc\u2026 or keeping different hormones in balance, or digestion\u2026 I could go on and on\u2026 but even so, you'd have to think about all that, while thinking about whatever else you probably wanted to think about, like a maths problem, or other smart thing. I think it's a good thing we can't access all of that all the time. Too much to worry about. It would be nice to access certain parts temporarily, though, like controlling your body temperature, digestion, etc\u2026 that can be done if you learn how, like certain monks have done. TL;DR You would not want 100% access to your brain. You already use 100% of it, it's just that your subconscious accesses 90% of it for you. DISCLAIMER: This is just what I've thought about the saying that we only use 10% of our brains. I don't know if what I've said about our consciousness or subconsciousness has been verified by science (yeah, sorry, I just lumped all of science into one word), but it seems reasonable, and in accordance to all the science I currently know about.

Do you still believe that coal and steam are the most important technologies in your life? Time to update this one too. The the mythiness of this idea is easily discovered. A quick Google search turns up Scientific American Do People Only Use 10 Percent of Their Brains? and Ten percent of the brain myth - Wikipedia for good, factual explanations. To answer the question relatively directly, if you wanted to feel what it would be like to use nearly 100% of your brain, wait until you are hungry and have to go to the bathroom, put some favourite food nearby that smells great, get on a treadmill (going at a safe speed) and play a first-person video game. This would occupy your sensory systems, your motor systems, your thinking capacity and many of your internal sensors. Your mind would be full of thoughts. In other words, you would be using nearly every part of your brain. Of course, as you are sitting there reading this, you are probably using at least 95% of it anyway. So, I am not recommending you try the described activity, lest you fall off the treadmill and hurt yourself. Much better to read at least one of the two articles I cited. ",

Certainly there is no truth to the idea that we only use 10 percent of our neural matter. Modern brain scans show activity coursing through the entire organ, even when we're resting. Although it's true that at any given moment all of the brain's regions are not concurrently firing, brain researchers using imaging technology have shown that, like the body's muscles, most brains are continually active over a 24-hour period. \\\"Evidence would show over every day you employ 100 percent of mind,\\\" claims John Henley, a neurologist within Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. make the act of pouring coffee each day: You go toward the coffeepot, reaching the pot, pour the brew into a mug, maybe even leaving room for cream, the occipital and parietal lobes, motor sensory and sensory motor cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and frontal lobes all activate. A storm of neuronal activity occurs almost across the entire brain in the time span of a few seconds. An interesting side note, of the many mind's cells, only ten percent tend to be neurons; one other 90 percent tend to be glial cells, which encapsulate and help neurons, but whose possible various other functions continues to be mainly unidentified. The four primary functions of glial cells tend to be: to encircle neurons and hold all of them set up, to provide nutritional elements and oxygen to neurons, to protect one neuron from another, and to destroy and take away the carcasses of lifeless neurons (tidy up). Researchers also have found that glial cells known as astrocytes communicate to on their own when you look at the cortex and are in addition effective at delivering information to neurons. Therefore even glial cells are probably used 100% at the end of the afternoon. ",

There\u2019s so many variables that it\u2019s really hard to measure. Dendrite density, is one big one. Diet, oxygen/breathing, overall health as the body and brain are linked including the gut-brain axis, adult neurogenesis, physical activity, leg health/leg muscle, many, many things to consider. Ultimately there appears to be no real limit to what the mind can do. Previous estimates that were accepted as facts (learn a new fact, forget something else like Kelly Bundy on Married With Children) have been revised time and again and they\u2019re now saying our brains have the equivalent capacity of the entire Internet, which is astonishing. Neuroplasticity is another concept that was virtually unknown just decades ago when it was believed the brain you were born with was set, fixed and unchangeable and we now know that\u2019s not true. A soldier with metal (shrapnel) lodged in his brain was able to forge new neural pathways around that problem and regain many lost brain functions, just as one example (Luria, Rozenzweig, Arrowsmith, Google those). Imagine what the future will bring with nanobots/nanomedicine going into your brain and and repairing and enhancing its function. Three movies explore this concept and though they may not get everything right and may even seem a bit far fetched, it\u2019s a great place to start if you\u2019re curious about mental potential: The Lawnmower Man, Limitless and Lucy. The idea in The Lawnmower Man that I like the most is that we\u2019re not discovering new brain functions but only rediscovering ancient, dorman ones. 509 Best Recipe for Grandeur images in 2020 | Martial arts quotes, Samurai quotes, Warren buffet quotes 117 Best Legs images in 2020 | Legs, Kate middleton legs, Kate, pippa 96 Best Voice images in 2020 | The voice, Ayelet shaked, Brooke shields blue lagoon 62 Best Teeth images in 2020 | Teeth, Best face products, Jessica ennis 72 Best Eye Colour & Behaviour images in 2020 | Eye color, People with blue eyes, Beautiful eyes color ",

            "answer_text": "Using 100% of you brain at once is called a Grand Mal Seizure, if that were to happen to you then you would lose consciousness and start experiencing violent muscle contractions. A few other things may also occur during this like defecating and urinating on yourself as you lose muscle control, unresponsiveness when the contractions stop, and a serious headache owing to the uncontrolled bioelectric activity in your nervous system that provoked the seizure. This can be caused by epilepsy, extreme low blood sugar, a stroke, or a sufficiently high fever. I suspect you\u2019re referring to the old 10% myth that became common in the United States after some sensationalist articles mentioned it. The truth is that the actual percentage of your brain that you use, in terms of parts that relate to thought and activities, is a lot higher and varies based on what you\u2019re doing. After all you don\u2019t want to be using every single neuron at once as doing so would again cause a seizure, you instead want to be using the section that has the learn muscle memory for walking while you\u2019re walking, the bit that remembers the taste of coca cola when you\u2019re drinking coca cola, and the part that differentiates colors when trying to observe objects in your surroundings. In point of fact the old 10% myth is based off an intentional misrepresentation of an article that estimated neurons, the cells which do the thinking, only make up about 10% of the brains total mass with the rest being support and other types of cells.

            "answer_text": "Ahem. Burn-out? What you are suggesting is that the brain working at its maximum capability is anywhere in the realms of either desirable or efficent. Both are great to have and both come at a cost. If you want the brain to be desirable, then you must allow the brain to operate at peak efficiency with the ability to cross-synapse with minimal energy use. That\u2019s why a human brain looks like this.  Note all the squiggly bits (scientific term there) that make up the brain. The squiggly bits have a better name .. its referred to as folds. The ridges are referred to as gyri and the folds are called sulci As you might guess the more folds you have the more surface area you can compact into the brain and the more brain space you can employ and connect with quickly. Other animals have much smoother brains with nowhere near as many folds, so cramming that much in works to an efficiency ratio.  As you can see without too much squinting, the rat or mouse has a largely smooth brain, the wallaby still has a lot of smoothness, the macaque and mandrill may be monkeys but they dont have a full set of folds to make high efficiency critical thinking decisions when required, whereas the bear and giraffe seem to have what it takes. The one to take notice of in these brain pictures is the cat and the cheetah followed by the lion. Both the cat and the lion have a series of distinct folds where the cheetah doesnt have that explicit need, because the requirement for the cheetah is specialist high speed capture. Whereas the lion and cat are stalking predators. Each is guided to provide for the needs of the animal to maximum efficiency for the task. If the cheetah had a greater series of folds upstairs he might also be suffering from burnout on the savannah as high folds also produces greater internal heat. If you had 100% usage of the brain, it would be the same as pumping steroids, you\u2019d look great for a limited period but suffer long term with design stress, as the muscles of the body end up being overworked, so too do the neurons and nerves of the brain. So you could take your magic pill as seen in recent cinema and do things far beyond the capabilities of \u2018mere mortals\u2019.  But it would come at a cost, the longer term performance of the body and the lifespan and sanity of the person concerned. There are tricks around this and that has to do with implants and compensation, but that\u2019s cyborg implementation vs natural expansion .. and another topic for another day. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, someone actually advocated violence with regard to anyone coming up with the trope about only using 10% of our brain, and if we could use it all, telepathic powers, etc., would appear. The brain is an extraordinarily complex association engine, a pile of neutrons firing as stimulated by the senses but also its own activity. When we talk about \"using all our brain,\" we often are thinking about conscious use. However, the brain functions all the time, on a scale that is vast compared to what we are conscious of. So, in a question like this, we have an ego, the creation of a small part of the brain, asking what \"it\" can do if \"it\" can \"use all my brain at once.\" There is a whole concept of reality there, a common one, to be sure, but divorced from real possibility. Let me ask the question differently. What can the brain do? There is no fixed limit, under some conditions. One of those conditions is that not just one brain is involved. When people communicate, by which I mean much more than words, the operating entity is not limited by the individual self and its petty ideas. Since the activity of humanity is mediated through intelligence, an individual brain is part of a vast network, and separating it from that network is not understanding its native function. I have seen what seemed to be miracles, but once I accept that human brain activity is not limited to what is conscious, the miracles are merely unexpected, incredibly unlikely according to ordinary thinking, but ... not involving, say, violation of conservation of energy or physical laws. Part of what the brain does is to interpret reality as good or bad, but that is largely the back brain, operating instinctively and without high intelligence. When we have not distinguished the operation of the back brain, of how it  creates fear and upset, for example, our function can be quite limited. The release of fear is behind much of the idea of high function when \"using the full brain.\" Any personal attachment, including attachment to looking good, being right, even attachment to personal survival, can create a domination of the full-brain activity, making it *relatively dumb.* It's still pretty smart, in some ways, or clever might be a better word. Some of the answers here are based on another version of the question that asked about telepathy or telekinesis. They are not well defined, usually. I can move matter by thinking about it. I just happen to do that through my body! That is, my thinking is part of my body, it is not separable from it. And my body is part of the universe. But I have never seen any substantial effect that I could reasonably call \"telekinesis.\" There are some skilled magicians, though, who know how to create appearances, and I'm not excluding the possibility of extremely subtle effects with microbalances. Which are on the edge of detection and thus suspect of being non-existent, artifacts of unknown experimental conditions. But telepathy is something else. What I have seen, however, all can be explained without some new physical process, simply by unexpected brain function. Example: there is a story that Milton Erikson, the hypnotist, visited a psychic, who told him about his uncle by name. As I recall the story, when he left with his friend, the friend said, \"But you don't have an uncle [by that name.] Erikson said, \"Right. I was subvocalizing the name, and this psychic had learned to read subvocalization.\" Now, when I first read this story, I thought that this was evidence that the psychic was a \"fake.\" Maybe. Maybe the psychic did not know where what was arising in his consciousness was coming from. He was \"reading\" the person. Including subvocalization, but the bandwidth of human presence is far, far higher than the stream of verbal speech. We read people, and, I found, under some circumstances, we know what they are thinking, because we are thinking the same. At least that's how it seems. That is, it is possible to \"think together.\" I've seen an amazing exercise on this, in Landmark seminars, it is called the Colors exercise. Let's say that it is an utterly astonishing demonstration of tight coherence of the mental activity of two people, I don't want to spoil it, because it really is fun! It very much looks like telepathy. So what is it? Is \"mind reading\" parapsychological if the people are face-to face? What if they are highly connected in some way, such that, even when not directly present with each other, they still are \"entrained\"? So what is this question about? This is the bottom line: it is possible, particularly with training, to develop what is called \"intuition.\" This is far larger than conscious thought and analysis, but it includes that. Some people think of intuition as if it means that every thought that comes to their mind is intuition. The kind of intuition that means something to me is that we do things that, in hindsight, were more than we knew we could do. It is not about \"thinking,\" i.e., mental chatter, which is part of what limits intuition. It is, when it is in operation, effortless, but it can take effort to turn off what inhibits it! That chatter! ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: What would be possible if we had full control over 100% of our brain? Short answer: There is no way for you to control your brain because consciousness is not devoted to control but to keep things balanced (homeostasis) between the different subsystems of the brain. The simple reasons, based on cybernetic theory, are: You would need an external controller (actually, several of them) to control the brainThe controller(s) would be bigger and more complicated than your brainThe data rate for a single controller would be hugeYou would need to simplify the controller algorithms to cope with data rate (bandwidth) and system oscillationsLong answer: Well, the problem with self-consciousness is simple: What are you going to be conscious of your brain with? To be able to have control of your brain you would need another, external brain, that controls your brain, a secondary brain of sorts. This is what, more or less, happens inside your brain: your cortex sort of \u201ccontrols\u201d the limbic brain and the limbic brain \u201ccontrols\u201d the brain stem. The brain stem is typical of reptilians, the limbic brain of mammals and the neocortex of primates.  Same goes for computer systems: to control something, a disk array, a chip or whatever, you need an external computer. As you can imagine, the relations between the component of such a, comparatively, simple system are not of \u201ccontrol\u201d: every subsystem plays its part. So, firstly, it is not possible to control 100 percent of your brain: what you think is \u201cyou\u201d, is only a part of your brain. To be conscious of your brain you would need a \u201clocus\u201d (site) for that consciousness to reside: an external controller  Secondly, that consciousness or \u201cbrain controller\u201d has to be much more complicated than your own \u201cprimary brain\u201d. The first person (that I know) that noticed that any system needs a complicated controller sub-system to be viable was Stafford Beer, the Manchester Zen Master of cybernetics. Stafford Beer on viable cybernetic systems, 1971  If you listen to the first 2 or 3 minutes of that video, you would notice that Beer postulates that any system has a complicated control system. Those systems described by Beer can be anything, not only \u201cyou\u201d, but many things that behave like a cybernetic system. For example: your brain (your brain is, definitely, a cybernetic system)the social and cultural system in which you livethe corporation you work forthe country you live inThey have, at least, several subsystems: The subsystem that deals directly with the external world (muscles, senses, nerves) or System 1The subsystem that deals with dampening the reactions of System 1, or System 2 (brain stem) to minimize uncontrolled oscillationsThe subsystem that administers or manages the \u201chere and now\u201d of Systems 1 and 2, or System 3 (cerebellum) to make efficient reactions adapted to the restrictions of the external worldThe subsystem that deals with management of future consequences, or System 4 (midbrain) to make predictions that increment your viabilityThe subsystem that balances the here and now and the future that serves as a homeostat of Systems 3 and 4 (cortex) to learn to have long term gains as opposed to short term gains in this \u201ccontrol\u201dAs you can understand, your System 5 cannot deal with everything. That is, for example, the reason why you are unable to control even your own body: what controls your body is the cerebellum, not the brain, and you have to \u201cdomesticate\u201d your cerebellum for anything. That is also the reason why it can take a couple of years for your cerebellum to play football: your brain cannot control the muscles by itself, it has not the bandwidth. Imagine you having to control every muscle you use to walk: it is an impossible task. You simply, using your consciousness (prospective system) think \u201cI am going to walk\u201d. Your cortex says \u201cYes, it is a nice afternoon, better take some fresh air\u201d (balancing the needs of your body, that wants to stay at home and do nothing and your prospective system that knows you are growing an underbelly). Now, to be able to actually walk by moving every muscle like a puppet, that\u2019s outside your capacities, as it should be. This would be like a President in a company trying to control every aspect of it, from what every worker do at every workstation to controlling what the lawyers and accountants are doing for mid term control: it is not going to happen in a cybernetic, well balanced, evolved system.

            "answer_text": "The most common misconception mankind is familiar with is the fact that humans cannot use 100% of their brain. This is not true at all, as it was proven to be possible.  Technically, it is not possible to use 100% of your brain for a single activity. This fact right here proves that if you increase your brain training, it can result with a higher percentage of usage of your brain. The capabilities of your brain can indeed be expanded. How? By challenging yourself to new things. For some, it may sound confusing, for others it may make a perfect sense - The more we learn, discover and analyze new things, the more we challenge our brain to use its bigger capacity. Unlocking larger parts of our brains certainly is not the easiest thing to do, but we all are able to do it - if we try hard enough. Here's what can help: 1. Develop a healthy routine - a healthy and well-balanced life is very important for your brain. Avoiding sleepless nights and huge doses of stress will help you increase the power of your brain. 2. Try / Learn new things - Engaging your brain in new things and experiences will provide you with a more efficient thinking process as well as decision making. Try some new mind games, read harder books, learn a new language or learn some new words. All these activities will help you improve your fluid intelligence. 3. Meditate - Meditation is an amazing thing - for those who have mastered it. For the others, it can be truly impossible. However, at least give it a chance. Meditation is an amazing cure and stimulant for your brain. If this becomes something all of us can do, and if we reach a point where we use 100% of our brains - wonders can happen. We may finally have answers about science, and the universe, the stars, and the black hole. We may finally give an explanation about the greater powers and belief systems. We may finally put an end to pointless wars, and rat races. We may finally defeat supercomputers and be more in control of the world. We may finally realize where are we, who we are, what we are made of. We may finally start making changes instead of encouraging them We may finally make the world a better and safer place for all of us. We may finally understand the point of life and its magical circle. We may finally have answers for some long lasted questions. We may. Who knows... ",

            "answer_text": "Brain power isn't really something that can meaningfully be quantified in this way, but arguably we already do use 100%, just not all at the same time. (It wouldn't exactly make sense to be making maximum use of the parts of our brain that move our arms when we don't want our arms to move, for example.) See Snopes' Ten Percent of our Brains for a thorough debunking of the claim that we use only a small percent of our brains on a regular basis. It also bears mention that when you see fMRI diagrams like this:   that have only a portion of the brain highlighted, they are showing *relative*  activity: electrical activity is taking place over the entire brain, but different regions are just more active than others when we perform particular tasks. You wouldn't expect to see extremely high activity in olfactory regions when you're not smelling anything particularly strong, for example, but that doesn't mean they're not active to a certain degree. That said, what this question may be getting at is: Is there incredible untapped mental potential that could theoretically be unlocked, if we somehow could discover how? It's certainly possible. For example, Psychology Today has a nice discussion on whether extraordinary autobiographical memory could be the result of \"unique experiences that occur during development\" ( Page on Psychologytoday ). Psychologists differ widely on whether they believe such abilities are primarily due to genetics, the environment or a unique combination of the two. ",

To be specific we do use our 100% brain but 95% use is beyond our conscious activity.Now if the question is if we could use 100% of our brain consciously.So my friend, there are postive effects but also negative effects as well.Positive Effects You can control each and every function in your body.Your ability to think and remember and imagine increases.The mind gets powerful enough to do many magical things.All the thing one use to sense like feeling hot or feeling cold or pain can be controlled.Negative Effects. You have to keep on doing your body processes continuously on your own right from breathing to digestion.Emotions will have no existence because the part of brain doing this would be used for thought process.There will be no dreams.Due to being able to control the senstiona right from normal feel of cold air to sex all will cutt one off from the natureThe human would become non affected toward beauty and music.Etc etc etc etc....... These are only the effects i could think about right now, and just these points demolish the difference between a human and a robot.Whatever the nature has given us its always best for is to be just in those limits.Thats why we call it Mata Prakriti....

            "answer_text": "You usually use all of your brain, one hundred percent, to live - so, sorry to break this to you : We are not superhuman, with a lack of means to tap into our inner powers. We are just what we are. Nothing more, nothing less. Even during sleep, parts of the brain constantly work. \u201cLUCY\u201d is just a movie, by the way. It is fiction, not fact. It would be best to leave it at that. (If you know what I\u2019m talking about.) Proof? Here (taken from Wikipedia) - Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as false, adding, \"we use virtually every part of the brain, and that (most of) the brain is active almost all the time.\" Neuroscientist Barry Beyerstein sets out seven kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth : Studies of brain damage: If 10 percent of the brain is normally used, then damage to other areas should not impair performance. Instead, there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss of abilities. Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects.Brain scans have shown that no matter what one is doing, all brain areas are always active. Some areas are more active at any one time than others, but barring brain damage, there is no part of the brain that is absolutely not functioning. Technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during sleep, all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have \"silent\" areas.The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of oxygen and nutrient consumption. It can require up to 20 percent of the body's energy\u2014more than any other organ\u2014despite making up only 2 percent of the human body by weight. If 90 percent of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. If this were true, the process of natural selection would have eliminated the inefficient brains. It is also highly unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved in the first place; given the historical risk of death in childbirth associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of humans, there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10 percent was actually in use.Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has distinct regions for different kinds of information processing. Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.Microstructural analysis: In the single-unit recording technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90 percent of cells were unused, then this technique would have revealed that.Synaptic pruning: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90 percent of the brain were inactive, autopsy of normal adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration.Well, isn\u2019t that just interesting?  ",

            "answer_text": "If we use 100 percent of our cerebral capacity, then we will be called as Superman, or Super intellectuals because at these moment, we will be possessing that supernatural supraconscious power of brain, which can work miracles in our real world. Uptil now , only ones in millions, have shown this capability. So the question before us is? Are such superhumans born by birth or can be developed, after birth by conjoint and united efforts by individuals themselves. The most appropriate and suitable answer to this question is that it can be possible because there is a proverb Try,try and you will succeed. In case , if we avoid distractions of our mind and do not allow it to fluctuate from its destined target , then our cerebral capacity begins to aggregate and integrate and thus develop a potential power, to face all such odds and difficulties, and it becomes so much strongest in innovation, creativeness, absoluteness and reach a highest perfection mark. So a final conclusion , which we can draw from above instances and illustrations is that if an ordinary person also makes an iron willed determinant power and give complete dedication towards becoming a superhuman , then he will have to wipe out all negativeness, narrowness and diffidance from his mind and intellect , switching on , gradually step by step, fully cautiously , without committing mistake. Summarisingly we can say that to become a superhuman is not impossible , but it wants a collective , integral , focussed and high ambitious struggle. ",

            "answer_text": "Because every single neuron is accessible and interconnect in the human body in some fashion, the use of 100% of our brain power could go a few ways. First, it is important to not confuse 100% use or loading with 100% access. As 100% use or loading would just cause a Grand Mal / Tonic Seizure that everyone is describing below. I\u2019m going to assume that you want to know what would happen with 100% access of the brain, as 100% load or use would just give you a boring old seizure (please don\u2019t be triggered by that. I know seizure are serious and can cause extreme pain especially in a circumstance such as a Grand Mal / Tonic Seizure). With that in mind, like I stated previous, the ability to have 100% access to your brain would be different than 100% use or load, as 100% access would vary for every person (everyone wouldn\u2019t just be getting seizure). For example, in my case, as I am not that smart, 100% access to my brain would probably be the equivalent of to a chipmunk having the nuclear football (nothing would happen). However, for a genius like Albert Einstein, one hundred percent access to his brain would allow him to solve / think up any theory that he wanted with his extremely vast knowledge of physics. There would be no limit to it. If you have Albert Einstein one day with 100% access to his brain. He could have done a lifetime of work. That\u2019s how power 100% access to a brain is for someone of vast intelligence or even someone of average intelligence. However, this all assumes that the interconnection between neurons, that I mentioned in the first paragraph, is interconnected in the most efficient way. As we can\u2019t always assume this, because each brain is different and no brain is perfect. For example, my brain being super inefficient may lead to autism if there is 100% access to the brain. This is because of the faulty wiring that my brain can usually avoid when not using 100% of itself, but would not be able to avoid if one hundred percent of the brain was being used. So, the result would be like an artist chipmunk having the nuclear football (he might accidentally press something because he is autistic. Also, just kidding like before with the seizure joke.). If you have any questions, or are just plain mad because I stupid and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to post answers on Quora, you can comment on the answer below. Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": "Hold on. We already use 100% of our celebral capacity. We wouldn\u2019t have a brain this big otherwise. A brain with over 86 billion neurons, and we can use only 86 million of them at any given time? Come on, that\u2019s just plain bad evolution. How did this myth arise? You see, just 3% of your brain volume is composed of neurons. The rest is made up of tendrils that attach neurons to other neurons. There are, at an average, thousands of such tendrils branching from each neuron. These are called synapses. And, in a way, they are far more important than the neurons themselves. Without them, your brain would never form patterns - it could never connect two ideas. There would be no logical thinking possible. No creativity. Just brute, disjointed memory. Thank your synapses. Your brain is a costly organ. It consumes over 20 per cent of your body\u2019s energy. To support the massive brain, your body had to develop a custom-made vertebral column and a solid neck. If your brain functioned at 1% or even 10% efficiency, it would be horrible return on investment. Can you imagine how quickly natural selection would weed you out? Don\u2019t believe anything they say in those movies.   References: You do not use just 10 percent of your brain - Slate.comWhy does the brain need so much energy? - Scientific American ",

            "answer_text": "Can we use 100% of our brains? I hope you are not referring to the myth that we only use 10% of our brain. I for one, have always felt that we use 100% of our brains. Certainly there is no truth to the idea that we only use 10 percent of our neural matter. Modern brain scans show activity coursing through the entire organ, even when we're resting. Although it's true that at any given moment all of the brain's regions are not concurrently firing, brain researchers using imaging technology have shown that, like the body's muscles, most brains are continually active over a 24-hour period. \"Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain,\" says John Henley, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Take the act of pouring coffee in the morning: You walk toward the coffeepot, reaching for the pot, pour the brew into a mug, maybe even leaving room for cream, the occipital and parietal lobes, motor sensory and sensory motor cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and frontal lobes all activate. A storm of neuronal activity occurs almost across the entire brain in the time span of a few seconds. An interesting side note, out of all the brain's cells, only 10 percent are neurons; the other 90 percent are glial cells, which encapsulate and support neurons, but whose possible other functions remains largely unknown. The four main functions of glial cells are: to surround neurons and hold them in place, to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons, to insulate one neuron from another, and to destroy and remove the carcasses of dead neurons (clean up). Scientists have also discovered that glial cells called astrocytes communicate to themselves in the cortex and are also capable of sending information to neurons. So even glial cells are probably in use 100% at the end of the day. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe this answer will be a little disappointing but we are using already the full capacity of our brains . Brain imaging techniques in neurology shows that the vast majority of the brain does not lie fallow. Indeed, although certain minor functions may use only a small part of the brain at one time, any sufficiently complex set of activities or thought patterns will indeed use many parts of the brain. Just as people don\u2019t use all of their muscle groups at one time, they also don\u2019t use all of their brain at once. For any given activity, such as eating, watching television, making love, or reading, you may use a few specific parts of your brain. Over the course of a whole day, however, just about all of the brain is used at one time or another. But if all those parts of the brain are unused, removal or damage to the \u201cunused\u201d part of the brain should be minor or unnoticed. Yet people who have suffered head trauma, a stroke, or other brain injury are frequently severely impaired even a small degree of damage to any region of your grey matter can result in catastrophic neurological declines. According to Washington University \u201cIf the average human brain weighs 1,400 grams (about 3 lb) and 90% of it was removed, that would leave 140 grams (about 0.3 lb) of brain tissue. That's about the size of a sheep's brain. It is well known that damage to a relatively small area of the brain, such as that caused by a stroke, may cause devastating disabilities. Certain neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease, also affect only specific areas of the brain. The damage caused by these conditions is far less than damage to 90% of the brain\u201d. Finally....let\u2019s don\u2019t forget the popular quote about atrophy in medicine that says \u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you lose it \u201c. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a mechanism called latent inhibition that is there to prevent you from using aeras of your brain that are not needed for the current task. Because, you know, sending signal to the area of your childhood memories with your mother may not be the best idea that your brain could have when having sex with your boyfriend. Among other things\u2026 We don't use 100% of our brain because the aeras that are shut down by our brain are not relevant for the current task. With a bit lower latent inhibition than the normal you can gain some creativity because it helps to gather our of the box ideas. People with with a very low latent inhibition are at risk to be unable to sort out the very high amount of unrelevant information that them brain generate. This is one of the mechanism that can lead to autism. When your brain percieve so many external signals that you cannot sort the one that are relevant and ends up blind to big parts of the outer world. When your brain open ups to many signal pathways into your brain and when it try to structure it but does not manage to stick to the reality this can also lead to schizophrenia. There is one case, and only one case when this can give you something really interesting. You need to have a brain that is able to deal with a very high amount of information. This happen when you have a very high speed of neural connection. This will already give you a high IQ by itself. If you lower latent inhibition can be balanced with your ability to use the information it generate, you will be able to develop an unconscious intuition where signals send to secondary ways may discover patterns that have similarities with the problem that you are actually trying to solve. This will raise your IQ again but this will make you think in a way that is different to most people. Instead of blocking the path of the signal in a linear way, the brain send many signal and unconsciously generate ideas. You can't even explain how you generated this. This also other consequences. Your mirror neurons network is more easily activated. This raise your empathy. There is also a great chance that you get a high sensitivity. Ok, this will not give you superpowers. This will even make you more vulnerable and doubtful of yourself. More than half of people with these specificities will never discover this and have scholar difficulties. But this can prove to be useful when you learn that it is a specificity that can create problems but can also open opportunities. Now that\u2026 We could imagine someone that have both a very high speed of thinking and a very low latent inhibition. The most well known man of this sort is Einstein. Probably a good example of the highest peak of capacities that we can achieve using more of our brain. Nothing supernatural but still good. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has been asked and answered many times on Quora. The short answer is that we DO use 100% of our brain. The rule in physiology is use it or lose it. Brain cells are extremely costly in terms of metabolic needs. If you;re asking about using all our cells at the same time (because you somehow believe this is a good thing), let's use the analogy of a car. After you turn on the engine, do you think it's a good idea to step on the gas pedal AND  the brake at the same time? To run the heaterAND  the air conditioner simultaneously?  For your blinkers to   signal both left and right turns at every moment. To always have the radio , defroster and  windshield wipers going incessantly? And while you and your passengers are conversing, to have all the windows  automatically  rolling up  and down throughout your drive- just so you can use 100% of your car.  OR   ....  do you think it makes more sense to design a car with a control panel which allows you options to select the appropriate action when it is needed? If you understand this analogy, then you can answer the question yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "The myth that you don't use 100% of your brain has been debunked many times.  Not using parts of your brain does not make evolutionary sense. If an area wasn't used for survival, it would disappear over time.  We use nearly 100% of our brains throughout the day, but not all at once. The myth largely came from PET scans that showed low activity in some areas, and high activity in others. Unfortunately people saw these and came to the misguided conclusion that the non-coloured areas on the scans aren't being used (this is completely false). Everything firing in the brain at once would pose serious problems for communications between neurons (as in epileptic seizures). Inhibition of signals is just as important as the actual signals themselves. You need low activity in some areas for the brain to work efficiently in the high activity areas; you can't have everything firing with the same level of activity at the same time. But those areas with low activity will undoubtedly have high activity at some point throughout the day and are therefore not useless.  Unfortunately movies such as \"Limitless\" have spread the myth that there is some untapped reservoir in our brains. It's funny how if you repeat a myth over and over the population starts to believe it despite your best efforts to correct them. ",

They, knowing all humanities incredible insignificance, they would mourn. They have the greatest of human sympathy, empathy and the ability to feel others emotions. They would have an insatiable appetite for knowledge and would invent or theorize about inventions that would be incredible gains for humanity yet won't invent them because of their total lack of faith in humanity. They will most likely have several intense intimate affairs, yet they will be short relations due to nothing on earth ever being interesting for long. If they had an aptitude towards evil then they would control and manipulate them just for fun (narcissistic), also they would live intimately freely understanding that relationships and all they entail is nothing more than a cocktail of chemicals telling your brain that you are in love. Likewise they would have no use for emotional responses and would be very straightforward, rude and just generally mean and socially awkward. If they had an aptitude for gentleness, they would probably become overwhelmed with every emotional response to every social condition, and not being able to do anything about it would be physically and emotionally disabling for them. Knowing again themselves that humanity is nothing important to the Universe and that our insignificance is profoundly acute to them. I could go on, yet I have to claim that this is only conjecture since I really have no idea on this since I'm pretty sure I'm not using 100% of mine, so how the hell would I know? In honesty, if a person was able to use all of its mind, it would most likely realize it was a God in an inferior plane of existence. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has bothered me for some time. Understand that the human body, and brain, are machines that require energy to function. We have only so much energy, and often it is from lousy food and drink. Nonetheless we have glucose for the Krebs cycle and fat as back up fuel. We are designed to survive. That means to \"not die.\" In order to not die our bodies have to be very energy efficient. When we do energy well we are in homeostasis. Right? Now. Every second of every day physiological events are happening. Our heart muscle beats 60 times a second. We breathe 15 times a second. We drink and pee and eat and poop and feed \"the machine.\" We rest the machine, right? OK. Now the brain is just an organ in the machine. It is busy and has a never ending job running the machine. Arms go here and hands do this, legs go here. Eyes over here. What's that sound? Something smells good... I think I'll... OK. That is what your brain is doing all the time. It has to pay attention so you don't die. Your question is about \"cerebral capacity.\" By which I presume you mean supratentorial cortical tissue, Including the deep reptilian brain, sex, hunger, thirst, lust, hate, anger, love. Most every part of the cerebral cortex is tied to the body, except up frontal where we have some other things going on. All of these cerebral cells consume energy. They are physiologically efficient. For survival. The machine has to conserve energy, not waste it. If you were able to turn up the juice of every cerebral neuron to 100% I imagine you would die.  Similar to an electric chair. ZZZZTTTT dead. Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "The good news is that, for practical purposes, we do use 100% of our brain. Let me explain. For decades science claimed man only uses 10% of our brain. This referred to the approximately 10% of the brain\u2019s volume comprised of gray matter. These are the familiar neuronal networks consisting of axons, synapses, and dendrites that carry electrical signals through complex pathways to store and retrieve memories, activate our muscles, and release various chemicals. We measure brain activity by measuring the electron flow or voltage. The white matter, making up the remaining 85% \u2013 90% of the brain, transmitted no electrical signal, hence, scientists assumed, had no ability to communicate. Therefore, this larger portion of the brain has historically been considered structural. That is, its role was to act as a support or \u2018glue\u2019 to hold the more critical neural components in place. In fact, the white matter was named glia, a derivative of the Greek word for glue. Recent research has changed that 10% viewpoint. Studies of the glial cells go back to the 1800\u2019s, but through the mid-twentieth century the conclusions from electrical and cellular studies held that neural cells were responsible for all of the brain\u2019s activity. In the 1950\u2019s it was uncovered that glial cells actually communicate through calcium waves rather than electric signals, opening new avenues of chemical research. Today we know that, far from being merely structural, glial cells perform vital functions in our brains. They send signals and communicate. Astrocytes, one of many cells in the glia, can control the firing of neurons at the synapses. Another glial cell, microglia, acts like the brain\u2019s own Red Cross. This tiny cell responds to injuries and clears infections. As humans age, we build dangerous plaque in our synapses. One, beta-amyloid, is considered the main cause for degenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. When you fall into a deep sleep, microglia sweep away this plaque. The oligodendrocyte, curls its tendrils around neurons wrapping them in a multi-coated myelin sheath. The myelin prevents leakage as signals pass through the neurons and enables them to distribute information faster. Today, scientists agree our brains are capable of utilizing all of its resources. (Though not all at the same time.) An excellent book for more information is: The Other Brain by R. Douglas Fields, Ph.D. ",

I\u2019ve watched the movie several times because it is tremendously entertaining and a pleasant but totally false fantasy. The facts are that each of us are using 100% of our brains already. I would encourage you to look in a slightly different direction. You can certainly be much more than you are now although you will never gain the physical attributes that Lucy had in the movie. Challenge yourself to be more than you are now. Amplify yourself, look for and find ways to do that. Avoid doing it for your benefit but do it for others. (This is a very important difference otherwise you become another narcissistic twit like our current president.) This is how you become more than the limited person you feel you are now.

These things that you use only a fraction of your brain for things is totally crap. People are often mislead to believe that they use something like 5-10% of their brain's actual potential. And that, my dear friend, is a lie.  We use 100% of our brains, just that all brains are not created equal. If you think I may be wrong, just simply reason with yourself with why would that 90%or 89% of the brain even exist? That can be deprecated safely if we don't need/use them. Most brain injuries would just not be anything serious or develop cognitive disabilities.We may use only about 15-20% of our brain for real \"processing\" tasks. Large parts of the brain are used for storing memories and information, managing body posture, controlling our body and receiving/transmitting nerve impulses and senses. Here's a rough distribution of human brain's jobs by the volume:Cerebrum (functioning of the body, sense, language and memory): 75%Cerebellum (controls voluntary motor movements): 15%Brain stem (controls involuntary and reflex actions, connects brain to spinal cord): 5% ",

Driving it only when it is the safest to drive? Driving it only when there's absolutely no other way to reach your destination so it will last longest? What counts as using 100% capacity of your computer? Running it so that your CPU is always nearly 100% loaded? Or your RAM is full all the time? Running it so there's no space left to use of the hard disk? All three at the same time? Keeping it clean with lots of headroom? I believe that trying to answer these questions above will bring us closer to the answer about the brain.  The second response is about how misguided the entire \"using our brain\" idea is. The act of using something requires minimally that user and tool must be separated somehow. In the case of brain use, user, tool and usage is hopelessly intertwined. Where am I when I use my brain? Am I the user the tool or the product? \"Using our brain\" is only a figure of speech impossible to translate into capacity measures. ",

As you may have heard people speaking that we can only use 2-3% of our brain and Sir Einstein used 6-7% of his brain so he was great. False. 100% of your brain is completely functional, the percentage of your brain which you use at a particular time differs because only certain parts of your brain are required at a particular time to perform specific functions. So when you write with one of your hand only some parts of the brain are helping you write. Now multitasking or writing with both hands is a completely different thing and can be achieved by anyone through practice. So if 100% of your brain was working at the same time, you probably won't be able to do anything.Imagine you have poop, and as soon as you sit on the toilet, simultaneously your brain is thing that you are having food and salivating. Gross right? So, have fun that you only use parts of your brain and not the whole brain at a time. ",

If you use only a fraction of your brain-power, just imagine what you could do if you tapped into all that unused potential.  Crush cans with mind, remember everything, be a kungfu master and levitate.  But as disappointing as it may sound: WE SIMPLY CANNOT.We already use all our brain power.How do I know you say ? Well, I have done my homework. 1. Neuro-imaging techniques and PET scans make you see the brain in            action.  And thanks to these techie machines we know that almost all our      brain lights up even during simple tasks like sipping coffee, walking      around or reading a book. 2. If this be the case then brain damage and mental diseases won't be such       dreaded terms as they are today.  If we only use little parts of our brain         then we can happily chop off major portions of it and still be the same.    But in reality, not even a single small part of the brain can be damaged         without and physical or mental consequences. 3. And finally we know that the brain is working all the time because we             have to constantly feed them.  Believe me, that wet wrinkled chunk eats         up about 20% of all our calorie input.  If the case were true, we wouldn't       have evolved to waste so much of our energy feeding neurons that aren't       firing for any use. So, in the end, while teleportation would be pretty awesome, our brain is already capable of quiet incredible things.  Instead of questioning its capabilities, be thankful for all that your brain does.In reality, its not that the brain uses a fraction of itself, but it is that we only understand a fraction of it. Happy understanding yourself. ",

Everything about our evolution is that we have developed for purpose, meaning that what we posses is there for a reason - the brain included. The reason is our continued evolution - we don't have any 'it-might-be-useful-one-day' bits, what we have is what we need, and use. The simple truth is that all brain regions do not need to be activated at one and the same time. Whilst I'm typing this that part of my brain that would be active if, say I went for a run, isn't needed so it can just lie inactive, but the moment I get up and walk away it will become 'live'. It is probably true to say that we don't make best use of our brains at times but I guess that's what it is to be human. But think about how far we have travelled since those days when we lived in caves and the journey isn't over. There is a theory that we evolve at a rate that we can live with - not too fast, not too slow. There's circa 100 billion brain cells at our disposal, all capable of inter-connecting. The human potential is awesome.   An oblique answer to the question would be - there is no 100% for the brain - it's seemingly limitless. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question won't have the effect you're looking for in an answer. Evolution of mind-power has nothing to do with quantity, but rather quality. By comparison, lets say you have 1g of carbon atoms, scattered in a \u201cpile\u201d, it would be just that: A useless pile of carbon atoms. Now structure those atoms into a hexagon pattern and you have grafite or diamond. Depending on use, a diamond will more likely come to better use than the pile of atoms, but the amount of atoms in both scenarios are the same, its quality that matters, not quantity. Every brain is used 100% at all times, but there's different degrees of \u201cuse\u201d. Most neurons are in a waitstate, they're in \u201cuse\u201d, and constantly processing information. Most of the time they process waste information, basically sorting out unsignificant sensory input from the body, the brain itself and the outside world via five senses. What's interesting though is any information processing that is significant, which triggers structuring of new neuron pathways throughout the brain to store, analyze and structure that information as memory \u201cformulas\u201d or modules. The more infomation and knowledge stored, the more structure and the more neurons are occupied to structure leaving less neurons free to do dynamic generic tasks. So - back to quality: if 100% structure would result in 100% quality then 100% quality would result in no free cells left to process new input. Your brain would basically just be a 100% storage unit, it wold be \u201cdumb\u201d / passive and static, no neurons would be free to even complete simple tasks like accessing that memory/formula structure, your brain would be unable to make use of the information there as it would have no free hands. So, 100% use (quantity) is the current state of all brains, and 100% structure would result in a static unusable passive braindeath, you would die from 100% structure, you wouldn't be able to move, blink or eveb breath. So how can we reach the goal your question is really looking for: A superbrain with unimaginable powers, perhaps even mind over matter - or mind over reality itself. The answer to that lies within the formulas. All significant information is stored as knowledge/memory like mentioned earlier, but not all information is the same, so \u201cstructure\u201d isnt just structure, there's and infinite amount of formulas that could be stored in our brain, so content and context, the shape/form of the structure/neuron pathways actually matters, and thats what separates a dismond from a pile of atoms, you need the right structure, the exact right formula to develop such a superbrain. Lets reshape your question: \u201cWhat formula/knowledge/structure would result in a timespace-bending superbrain with unimaginable powers?\u201d The answer to that is: We don't know yet. There are clues to what makes a brain more powerfull within a given scenario/context, a savant doesnt have more use of his/her brain, it doesnt have more structure, it just have different structure, different formulas, most of those extraordinary structures are a result of trauma or injury, either by accident or at prebirth, what we do knownid this: synestesia plays a huge part, stronger connections between sensory neuron clusters or \u201dcenters\u201d that should'nt be there, resulting in leakage from one sensory center to another, blending of sensed becomes a symptom, which is the very definition of synestesia. People with that special structure leading to a high degree of synestesia have proven to produce some extraordinary skills. A person can \u201ctaste\u201d numbers, and then perform inhumanly complex calculations by simply tasting since the brain for some reason has a lot easier access to taste-memory than numeric memory, and can distinct a single taste between tens or even hundreds of tastes mixed together in a dish. Numbers are just that; numbers, and numbers makes no use of any sensory stimuli/input, this makes it hard for the brain to work with. The brain works alot faster with sensory input due to the survival urgency needed to analyze your surroundings. The brain was made for survival within its enviroment and at such it proccesses input from its surroundings with urgency, haste, full priority. Numbers and purely \u201cthought\u201d / internal input is processed on powersaving mode so to speak. Calculating what 2+2 is isnt a life or death scenario, tasting or smelling that meat is rotten however is. In short, to sum it up: Forcing/tricking the brain to proccess internal input/thoughts/ideas/math by as if it was a sensory input from the external enviroment is the key, the exact right formula. Some savants have that formula already structured in their brain by chance/accident, but there are things any person can do to perform neuroplasticity on their own brain, creating the exact right formula structure in the brain physically: Start making music, play with music-creation even if you suck at it, as trying to structure and make sense of none-linguistic sound without urgency is a very abstract sensory input task it actually forces all other senses to proccess it simultaniously, as a result it creates new neuron pathways between all the sensory neuron centers, and since music creation is none-urgent / a long proccess it also forces creation of neuron pathways between none-sensory neuron centers and sensory neuron centers resulting in a higher amount of synestesia in the brain. You basically confuse your brain and trick into look everywhere inside all its centers for where to best proccess your music creation nonsense and to do that it needs to establish permanent connections between all the centers/clusters - this is the closest you get to the term \u201cusing ALL of your brain proactive aka 100% simultaniously\u201d. The brain simply doesn't know what to do with the information, it doesnt know if it's urgent or not, a danger or not, if it has a pattern or not, if its just a new number or some form of audiable language. Making music in short makes you alot smarter and faster in math, language, memorizing etc. ",

Each operation is voted on before being executed. A disagree results in the questionable controller being disabled while the system continues running smoothly under control of the remaining controllers. It's a network of watchers watching watchers, and it works! If our breathing were conducted along one single path of neurons, then the moment one of those neuron died, we would stop breathing. Thank heaven we've been provided with billions of redundantly configured neurons, voting away constantly. I'm sorry, a quick re-read informs me that I didn't carefully read the question. It asked what if we have 100% \u201cControl\u201d over our brain. I apologize. Upon review, I think my notes remain relevant. I'll let them stand, with qualification. I think that having full control would be just as scary. Assuming 100% control is present, I'd ask to what degree is the \u201ccontroller\u201d informed on the consequences of a single change? Would we know which, exactly, change should be made in order to achieve the single, desired result? I wouldn't be too surprised to find there are millions of connecting, overlapping points between desire and result. A simple example: acting on the desire for ME to be happy, then behaving in selfish ways which minutes or years later, lead to misery. Significant consequences likely would be appearing constantly. We might never be sure of who we're talking to. Well, less sure than now. ",

Doctors surmised because of this that parts of the brain sat unused. In actuality, you do use your whole brain as Dan Holliday mentioned.  But when you are injured, your brain has the ability to \"re-route\" around damaged areas and rebuild neural pathways.  Some damage can't be repaired or routed around, but much can.  There are a certain number of \"reserve\" stem cells available for rebuilding brain cells, but by adolescence, your full complement of adult brain cells has been formed, along with a reserve of cells not in use.  This reserve can be used to rebuild damaged areas and re-route around damage if needed.  Using 100% of your neural capacity (active and reserve) would mean that you have no more reserve available for when brain cells die off or are damaged.  This would mean that you would lose brain capacity daily for the rest of your life from the moment that you used 100% of your neural load. ",

Why can\u2019t I sing a song without a look at the lyrics, or knowing a question without using a book or searching the internet of answers? You see us human more stupid than any other species in this universe we need assistance to help our brain to function a proper way. We are using 10% of the brain to educate, eat, drink, walk, blink, speak, read, and sleep also use the bathroom, most scientists believe that we an extra 5% of the brain if we in fear of a supernatural encounter or a hunting encounter you begin to see quick movement or hear a tiny little sound or feel something is near you. I do believe in all this afterlife and supernatural urban legend stuff if we do get 100% of the brain we gonna be superhuman, in my beliefs, I think the rest of the 90% of the brain is a gateway to our soul. / Feel free to leave a comment to remember don\u2019t hate this my belief everybody got their own beliefs we all, not perfect\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "100% of brain capacity? Capacity is a broad term. I will interpret it in a way so that I can make a different answer than the ones already given. I believe there is a better way to use our mind, just like using something based on how it was designed. The best way to use our brain would be the 100%. So, defining that the 100% would be a faster, more precise, creative and intricate thinking, what are the factors that affect thinking speed, precision of thought, creativity, clarity of thought and intricate thinking? Below is the results of my reflections. There is a model behind it, but to simplify I will put the the facets above into perspective. Creativity Please, read F\u00e1bio E. Arruda's answer to Where does a thought originate/come to us from? And where does it go back to? so that you understand what I\u2019m talking about. Creativity is the capacity to think outside the box. Creativity increases when you use your pattern recognition without restriction of context. In other words, when you look for similarities between two things without constraining how far those two things seem to be apart. That results in creativity by luck, the ones common children use. (I don\u2019t see how to explain non-luck creativity, which is much more of use, without explaining the whole model by now. Maybe in the future, when that model get more mature\u2026) Clarity of Thought Clarity of thought is how vivid a thought is. Clarity will increase when we increase the intensity of sensations (\u201cemotions\u201d) involved in that thought. Precision of Thought Precision of thought is the specificity of meaning. Precision will increase when we have specific meaning in thought. In other words, unambiguous clarity of thought. Intricate Thinking Intricate thinking is the complexity of thought someone can attain. In other words, working memory. Intricate thinking will increase when clarity and precision are co-existent. Thinking Speed Thinking speed is the distance someone can travel in thought given a time. Thinking speed will increase once you increase precision, as you will not have to correct thoughts on the go; creativity, as it can yield big jumps; the ability to hold complex thoughts, as you won\u2019t have to go back to re-remember the related elements. Those are some facets of what some call intelligence. This is not low-level explanation (no pattern recognition, as in the linked answer), and also not high-level (non-luck creativity). Maybe it is incomprehensive, as it is incomplete, so that I will recommend you to follow F\u00e1bio E. Arruda's answer to What is a genius, and who can become one? as I will be update it when I have a mature model. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows what a brain with the full capacity to utilize every possibility ever been observed in human brains could do. The amazing abilities of geniuses, savants and people with synesthesia let us know that the brain is capable of much more than most people ever develop, or are capable of developing. Brain capacity and brain function are two different things. All normally functioning brains are functioning at 100%. That is, doing what a brain is designed to do. Although there are many factors that cause the brain to shift emphasis from one region to another, as long as the shifts are taking place in the right way and at the right time, the brain is functioning properly and at 100%. One example of a shift of emphasis that often makes it appear that the brain isn\u2019t functioning at full capacity is the shift that occurs as a result of stress. Studies show that stress shifts energy from the prefrontal cortex to the hippocampus, the region the regulates emotions. The result is that the functions of the prefrontal cortex (executive functions like clear thinking, decision making, planning and strategizing) are reduced. In such an instance, although the brains is working at 100% capacity and doing exactly what it must to balance and conserve energy, the effect is that the functions that help us be most effective at thinking, planning, strategizing, and decision-making are diminished. This in no way diminishes the effectiveness of the brain, only the effectiveness of the executive functions. At the same time, the effectiveness of the fight or flight survival function is enhanced. The problem comes in when we need to be thinking clearly and making good decisions, but stress levels have prepared us to fight or flee rather than think. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be possible to get distracted and accidentally forget to breathe - or maybe the need to continually control the micro-muscular changes to keep our balance when standing would quietly drive us crazy! The subconscious parts of our brain do what they do very well - I doubt that there would be anything to gain by putting all of that automation under conscious control. Imagine that we did that with a car\u2026took out all of the automation and made you do everything manually. You\u2019d have to continually be twiddling knobs to control the fuel flow and the oxygen intake - be opening and closing vent flaps to keep the A/C temperature comfortable - be ready at any instant to see that the car is in the process of crashing so that the airbags need to be set off. You\u2019d have to manually flip the turn signal off and on again to make it flash. A car like that would be impossible to drive! To the contrary, we strive to automate as much of our lives as we can - to REMOVE mundane tasks and hand them off to semi-autonomous subsystems and only control the \u201chigh level\u201d stuff. So it is with our brains. Humans are highly evolved to have all of this intelligence - and the more of it we have the better we survive. So if we COULD usefully transfer autonomous systems into conscious control - then evolution would already have done that. Honestly, I think doing what you suggest would be a VERY bad idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t be silly. This stuff about only using part of our brains is ill-informed and not supported by any neuroscientist. For starters consider this. The brain uses about 20% of the energy consumption of the human body. That energy is hard come by and 200,000 years ago or so, it was very hard come by. If we only used 10% (or whatever) of our brains at enormous cost in forging and hunting, we would not have evolved. Put another way, any critter whose brain was to big and had useless bits requiring lots of food for energy would never have survived at least long enough to fuel the evolution engine. In fact the brain is remarkably efficient and of course not always up to the complex tasks required of modern humans. That does not mean, of course, that all parts of the brain are used all the time. Different brain bits come into play as needed. There are lots of on-off switches. It also does not mean that we can\u2019t learn new tricks or acquire new skills. If I learn to juggle or play Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, that does not mean that some hidden, previously unused part of the brain suddenly springs into action to control these behaviors. The brain multi-tasks and reuses bits or combines old structures to create new skills. If 100% of our brain came into play at once, at the same time, we\u2019d likely die. ",

My personal belief is that although we can and may use 100% of our brain, we are not currently experiencing 100% of what our brain can actually do. We have many \u201cun-expressed\u201d genes to which neuroscience has no idea of what they would afford us. As far as genes go; Time giveth, and time taketh away! So maybe those genes were \u201cde-activated\u201d, so to speak, due to millennia of non-use. Look at it like this: You buy a new car that has a 350 cubic inch motor, that, with all of the parts working at 100%, will produce 300 horsepower. You take that very same motor, with all the same parts, and with a little tuning of the software you can get an additional 100 horsepower out of it. If we apply that to the human brain; We use 100% of it, but similar to the car motor, with a little \u201cgenetic\u201d tuning, we can access the hidden power within. It sounds a little Sci-fi\u2019ish now, but I have no doubts that neuroscience will acheive just that sometime in the not-to-distant future. Gene expression is an amazing thing. ",

I had heard that the comment about only using 10% of or brain had come from a radio program which was being acted out over the airwaves as a piece of entertainment. Like a movie except you hear the actors instead of seeing them. Someone picked up on this little piece of info and spread the news that we only use 10% of our brain. This really spread fast. You can probably google this on the internet to find the origin of this false statement and normally I would do that before making this statement but since I do remember doing this once before and I think I have the facts correct about the origin but double check me on this. If I had more time I would do it again but I must run to take care of some important business. Hope this helped and cleared up that misconception\u2026peace! namaste ",

Brain tissue is metabolically expensive both to grow and to run, and it strains credulity to think that evolution would have permitted squandering of resources on a scale necessary to build and maintain such a massively underutilized organ. Moreover, doubts are fueled by ample evidence from clinical neurology. Losing far less than 90 percent of the brain to accident or disease has catastrophic consequences. What is more, observing the effects of head injury reveals that there does not seem to be any area of the brain that can be destroyed by strokes, head trauma, or other manner, without leaving the patient with some kind of functional deficit. Likewise, electrical stimulation of points in the brain during neurosurgery has failed so far to uncover any dormant areas where no percept, emotion or movement is elicited by applying these tiny currents\u2026.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Like everybody, i concur that 100% of the brain is used. The reason is that unused neurons feel suicidal and attract the attention of the immune system as useless invader. The neurons survivors found a place in one of the few millions networks that encode specific concepts. They fire often enough to get impregnated of neuro-sweat providing a protection layer against the immune system. You may wander what Einstein or Feynman were doing different? Did they have a superior brain? The answer is yes, but the superiority margin is not as great as we would think based on the exceptional results from their work. Compared to any educated human from the same culture, they may exceed the performance by a few percent. In other words, instead of the usual 8 hours of intensive work every day, they probably work 8.5 or 9 hours per day. As manager and mentor of a small group, i needed about 30 minutes extra effort to read the notes one chapter ahead to appear to know much more than everybody in the group. The sad truth is that if you invest a lot more time than most people to learn a specialized subject, you will realize one day that nobody understand the subject better than you. You will not find anyone to help progress further and your social life will be so poor that you are at risk to not find any work. Even if a good resume looks good, only friends hire friends, so invest in social life too. The quora algorithm does a better job at not eliminating answers from merging. But it keep one answer as collapsed and associated with a question already merged. Keep your good work, you will get that working eventually. ",

            "answer_text": "Their is very little data on consciousness so I am going to have to heavily speculate on this one. Their are thousands of cases where people have reported having an out-of-body experience. This happens especially often when people undergo life-threatening or risky surgeries. Based off this evidence, it is plausible to assume that with complete control you could cause an out of body experience on command. This would allow you to observe the world in a non-physical and non-observable form. It would be great for being able to spy on people or experience a dangerous situation in complete safety. In Buddhism, their is a practice called Tibetan Dream yoga or simply dream yoga. This is a type of yoga which allows the monks to create lucid dreams on command. Based off this practice, we can assume that somebody with complete consciousness control would be able to do the same thing. This would enable us to make productive use of our time in our dreams such as self-teaching and practicing, or allow us to have fun. This would also philosophically give us new-insights and realizations about the nature of god or the fluidity of reality which in turn would make us more subjective in our belief, flexible in our behavior, and more aware in our observations of the world. According to this article I read 10 Amazing Examples of Mind Over Matter - Listverse, its been shown that a well disciplined mind has the ability to create an interesting array of physiological outcomes. This means that a person with complete control of their consciousness could heat their skin to the point of drying cold wet sheets, change personality traits on command, increase or decrease the efficiency of their senses, (smell, taste, sight, etc.) reduce the effects of or cure completely certain diseases, slow their heart rates down to levels only an EKG could detect, assume a mastery of skills through mental visualization, turn off pain receptors, regulate blood flow, an ability to see auroras, (And hence peoples physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional states) and increase the rate at which your metabolism burns calories on command. Complete control of your consciousness would also bring you complete clarity when it came to yourself. That would mean knowing without a doubt what makes you happy or sad. This would also include knowledge of things such as your greatest desires, fears, and why you feel the way you do about whatever life has to throw your way. This knowledge of yourself would also enable you to optimize whatever task you put your mind to. This would include the best way to study, the appropriate social vs. work balance, the right person for you, etc. For most people, they believe the boundaries of consciousness end at the boundaries of your very being. In other words, consciousness cannot control anything outside of the physical body in which it inhabits. Hinduism and a philosophical school of thought called Idealism believes that consciousness (instead of matter) are the building blocks of reality. This is something I also believe. If it turns out that Hinduism and Idealism are correct, then complete control of consciousness would allow you to manipulate, control, and create anything around you. In essence, you would become a god. ",

Our body is the perfect engineer, it doesn't make anything that is not necessary. Throughout evolution, if we have had used only 10% of our brain, our brain would have 10% of it's current size. Since it's not, so pretty much everyone is using 100% of their brain, even you. Now the catch is that if everyone are using their brain equally, why people have different abilities/skills. That is because the part of the brain you are using frequently. Suppose you see person A pianist who plays great piano and Person B who doesn't play it. What is the difference in their brain? Person A has developed a lot of synaptic connections in the parts of the brain responsible for voluntary movement of the fingers and other attributes necessary to a piano play. Now Person B may not play piano, but he may good at playing football and he have all the synaptic connections that are necessary to control the movement of the ball during a cheerful football play.

What does \u2018using\u2019 the brain mean? First, in living cells, processes are constantly ongoing, obviously. But that\u2019s probably not what \u2018use\u2019 means. So the second implication in the question is probably that there is a good way to define activity in the brain. Luckily, there is such a way (in a sense). While neuroscience is still relatively young, with many unexplored frontiers, one of its major breakthroughs was the century-old \u2018Neuronal Doctrine\u2019, and subsequent theories. From these, neuroscientists now agree that the brain is comprised of individual cells called neurons, that these are anatomically connect in complex architectures, and that the connection allow communication. Most importantly \u2013 we know communication between neurons is most clearly evident in the form of an \u2018action potential\u2019 a flux of chemical changes occurring in a given neuron, which leads to rapid changes in voltage, leading to the release of neurotransmitters in the synapse with other neurons. This process can then occur in the next neuron. This is generally viewed as the gist of how information is processed in the brain. So \u2013 easy, right? Stick electrodes in the brain, measure action potentials, see their frequency, of occurrence and then we can characterize \u2018usage\u2019 of the brain. Not really though\u2026 First of all \u2013 what would 100% be \u2013 constant \u2018firing\u2019 (another term for action potentials)? That\u2019s no good; it will not relay any information. Actually, when activity is allowed to run wild in a positive feedback loop, what one gets is an epileptic seizure. That\u2019s definitely not what we\u2019re looking for then. So sometimes it\u2019s exactly when a cell is not firing that it is being used. The balance between excitation and inhibition is unimaginably important in complex brain structures. What I\u2019m getting at here is this \u2013 it\u2019s to define the brain\u2019s activity, and it\u2019s even harder to find clear cut correspondences to emergent phenomena such cognition. By comparison, when you have individual taps for cold and hot water in the shower, and you settle on mixture comprising more cold water and less cold water, that doesn\u2019t really mean you\u2019re not \u2018using 100% of your shower\u2019 \u2013 it just means that the objective of your shower-taking is to obtain a comfortable temperature, and not to maximize water flow. And the brain would be better compared to the water regulating system of an entire country, with billions of valves (and that still does not begin to capture it\u2019s true complexity). This is really the interesting point here \u2013 the \u2018usage percentage\u2019 question implies a well-known, meaningful, consensual way to relate the brain\u2019s activity to its output (mostly cognitive operations). As of now, neuroscience cannot relate whole brain activity to a single operation in a clear-cut way (and definitely not for all possible functions). By this I mean, we have not obtained an insight such as \u2018to produce a memory you need these components and can throw out the rest\u2019. I doubt that we ever will. It may be that the brain\u2019s uniqueness lies exactly in its vast monolithic connectivity. Even more dramatically, it\u2019s possible that a brain must be situated in a body to produce cognition. Anyway \u2013 this is the crux of the issue to me. The term \u2018use\u2019 assumes we know the relation between neural activity and any or all mental operations. As of now \u2013 we don\u2019t. A similar misconception is that each operation corresponds to the activity of a location in the brain \u2013 but I guess I\u2019ll get around to answering one of those questions some other time. ",

I have experienced this firsthand. In all honesty. I am more intuitive, i have a razor sharp memory, more observant, faster reflexes and better and more controlled responses; very unlike how i was before given that i was on antidepressants. And i had to calm my mind down for that. Which means i had to change the brain activity (the EEG waves), quiten areas of my brain and enhance strength of synaptic associations; all of which is possible. So yes you can use more of your brain than you are right now. I can't assign a percentage to it. ",

You'd be better off saying that our brains could eventually evolve to fit our environment in a more efficient way (which it has already). Brain organization is key, not necessarily space, or how big it is. The more convolutions/surface area (sulci and gyri) the better. Brain size to body size ratio is also important, but probably not as much as organization. ",

It\u2019s all about the capability of our brain when you utilize it completely. According to Lucy, here are 7 things that happened when she increased her brains potential: 1. Obstacles start dissolving.\u2013 Obstacles are those circumstances where we feel stuck, trapped, impaired and can\u2019t flow forward in life. As we increase our brains potential, we don\u2019t have problems, we just have creative solutions. You spontaneously attract things like abundance, car parks, and harmonious relationships and effortlessly find solutions to all your problems. 2. Desire begins to fade.\u2013 Desire is what drives us to seek fulfilment. It\u2019s the base motive for most of our actions. It\u2019s the idea that I\u2019m separate to that thing or experience and if I get it, I\u2019ll be more fulfilled. As our brain usage increases the experience of the separation between you (subject) and the experience (object) fades, and an internal fulfilment flourishes, dissolving desire. 3. Fear starts to fade.\u2013 Like desire, fear is the experience of subject (you) and object (something other than you) and the separation between the two. It\u2019s the experience that the object could threaten you the subject and that your survival is finite. With increased brain usage, one acquires awareness that they are more than physical limitations, in fact, there are NO limitations. I.e. they had no beginning, and no end, just as the wave regardless of its time frame, is always the ocean. As Lucy says in the film, \u201cYou don\u2019t actually die.\u201d 4. Control over your body.\u2013 No longer at the mercy of the responses in the body, living as a slave to it, one now is aware of the powerful intelligence within body and is now the conductor orchestrating how it functions. This ranges from not only healing oneself but also having mastery over the seeming physical limitations and controlling the cells. 5. Reduced emotions.\u2013 Emotions are responses to circumstance indicating a binding affect that person or event had on our experience of life. We feel happy, sad, and angry in response to situations. The Sanskrit word \u2018moksha\u2019 is liberation from the effect those events have on us. We are now free from the ups and downs of the emotional state responding to life around you. Some would say it\u2019s a blissful fascination that one retains throughout. 6. Empathy.\u2013 Lucy said: \u201cI\u2019ve access to 28% of my cerebral capacity. I can feel every living thing.\u201d Admittedly this wasn\u2019t conveyed very well in the film as she shot dead a number of people (ok, I didn\u2019t say the film was perfect!), however as we do open up regions of the brain and dissolve the experience of separation with other entities, one actually feels how they would feel, because they are connected through the field of Oneness. So just as you have a finger, a hand, an ear, a toe, and they all look different and have different functions, if you hit your toe, your entire body feels it. 7. Oneness\u2013 Professor: \u201cLucy, where are you? Lucy: \u201cI\u2019m everywhere.\u201d At 100% brain capacity separation dissolves, one merges with the Unified Field. (Okay, I\u2019m not saying much more on this one\u2026it\u2019s up to you to decipher :)) source: 7 Things That Happen When You Increase Your Brain Usage - The Stillness Project If you want to increase your brain\u2019s potential, meditate. Meditation is an easy simple process and anyone can do it. Simply google EEG-brain-meditation and you\u2019ll find numerous studies and images that validate this. Cheers!! ",

Think of it from an evolutionary perspective, if you only needed 10% of your brain to function, what would be the point of evolution adding another 90%. We supposedly are born with a bigger head as a baby thanks to this large brain, which causes a problem in childbirth and human females have had to evolve wider pelvises to accommodate. Unless  the other 90% was actually useful, there would be no point in adding that much brain mass. If it was true that this extra 90% was not being used, then evolution would have the same reason to add this 90% as it would to make one of your legs 90% bigger . Don't forget that keeping the brain going is very expensive energy-wise, 20% of the body's energy and oxygen goes to the brain. From an evolutionary standpoint, it would be very redundant to have such a large brain if we were not using it.  Thus it is a myth that there is a part of your brain that you don't use. See:Is it possible to use 100% of our brains at all times? If we have the technology, why are we not?Is it true that humans only use 10% of their brain? ",

The brain houses an EM circuit and helps regulate the strong field from the heart. As such, it's very conservative. It only allows roughly 10-20% of glucose to be used by the body at any given time, for instance, which is why serious injury, chemicals an drugs, intense fear and childbirth take such a toll on us. These events exceed the allotment that the brain has set for energy consumption. Evidently, this is also why we have to sleep or else face systemic failure. What you are asking is, what would happen if we were to use the entire brain's reserves at the same time. It's simple: we'd suffer total cataclysmic overload and drop dead. ",

Do People Only Use 10 Percent of Their Brains? Although it's true that at any given moment all of the brain's regions are not concurrently firing, brain researchers using imaging technology have shown that, like the body's muscles, most are continually active over a 24-hour period. \"Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain,\" says John Henley, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Even in sleep, areas such as the frontal cortex, which controls things like higher level thinking and self-awareness, or the somatosensory areas, which help people sense their surroundings, are active, Henley explains. Take the simple act of pouring coffee in the morning: In walking toward the coffee pot, reaching for it, pouring the brew into the mug, even leaving extra room for cream, the occipital and parietal lobes, motor sensory and sensory motor cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and frontal lobes all activate. A lightning storm of neuronal activity occurs almost across the entire brain in the time span of a few seconds. ",

There is also a simple natural law that governs all life forms. The law of conservation. In short, if your not using it, your losing it to conserve energy. The real question is how do we increase specific brain functions, glands, lobes and hemispheric synchronization, similar to muscle development.

Do do this you need some kind of simple tools. Take the processor, and a car battery. Connect the processor in the middle, and as the electricity flows through the processor, every transistor inside will have power going through it, thus using every transistor at the same time. Of course this will make using the computer impossible at the time, and also in the future. The same technique can be applied to your brain, using the same car battery, as the neurons in your brain work with electric impulses too. But you will need a friend to cut open your skull and extract your brain before frying it with electricity, so you cant do it alone. Also it will ruin your brain and make your body unable to survive.

            "answer_text": "A2A: \u201cHow much smarter would we be if we use 100% of our brain? What can we do with that?\u201d I\u2019m an advocate for increasing one\u2019s ability to work by 16X. This comes from the 80:20 Rule idea, where it is thought that 80% of the work in any company is actually done by only 20% of the employees. If one could harness the power of this idea - what could one do with that? I estimated that to mean, as a manager, one increases a person\u2019s ability to work by 16X. I was once hired by someone that trained me on the 80:20 Rule and he wanted me to use this concept to increase the productivity of an Engineering Department. In three months I increased their productivity by 4X. He has said, he only hires 80:20 Rule people, so I was not starting from scratch. This company\u2019s backlog was dwindling fast. In 6 months the owner began laying people off - laying off the people I had trained. As a substitute teacher I tried to apply such ideas to 300 classrooms of students over a period of 5 years, where the classes were only 50 minutes long. I found that if one increases the emotional level of students, by 2X, this will increase their ability to work by 2X. I was able to do this with half of these classes. They completed their Lesson Plans in about 20 minutes. About 2X as fast. So, just increasing your emotional level, being happier, or being enthusiastic, will increase your ability significantly. 2 of these classroom I estimated 4X\u2019d their emotional level to exhilaration. Students in each of those classrooms said they had learned more that day, than from their regular teacher, all year. I estimate that if you increase your emotional level by 4X you may increase your learning ability, your ability to work, at least 4X, what it is now. I found something, for myself, accidentally one day. A clarified a word and a girl that had been failing in math for 7 years now was brilliant in math. She had been doing well in school and then had not been for some reason, unknown to her. When I clarified the word in that area just after she had been doing well, she was doing well again. Now, truthfully, I knew this was possible, I had been told this. But this was the first time I had ever seen this happen right before my eyes. One day I did this, again accidentally, with an entire classroom. The regular teacher had assigned a math puzzle that required a knowldge of all the hard words that she could think of that the students might be having trouble with. It was sort of quiz for me to give. I immediately found that even the best students would not be able to compete this puzzle, unless I did something. So I did something. Each time a student asked a question, I located the word the did not know and helped them define it. I answered them loud enough that all could hear. A bright student had been nudged by a friend needing help. She told him, loud enough for all to hear, \u201cHe is telling you all the answers - just listen!\u201d So, one by one, I answered questions and ALL the students completed the quiz. But an amazing thing had happened, now they ALL were doing well. Three students told me that they had learned more in the one class than with their regular teacher all year. So, you could do this one thing to increase your ability to work, or your ability to learn math, or any subject, one-by-one. You might have another student help you as a tutor when you do this. Locate the time you were last doing well in one subject, one subject at a time, say reading. Locate it as closely as you can, right down to the sentence if possible. Then find a word, that when clarified properly, returns you to doing well. This should return you to an emotional level between enthusiasm and exhilaration, and recover any inability to learn that subject, and your willingness to learn that subject, and ALL your understanding of that subject. (Even if you have been failing for 7 years, or more.) I am not saying these three ideas will get you to the \u201c100%\u201d you are talking about, but maybe until then, this will do. Oh, by the way with the 4X in the Engineering Department, I had each Engineer, do the routine tasks they would be doing and repeat them 5X. The first time I did this an Engineer took 3 days to do a task. I arranged for him to do this exact task from another project, it took 2 days or 16 hours. Then 1 day or 8 hours. Then 4 hours. Then 3 hours. He had 8X\u2019d his productivity when doing that one task. But he also learned what it felt like, to work like a 16X person. For students, when they define words or do demonstrations or draw graphs, I have them use this principle, but slightly different. I don\u2019t ask them to do it 5 times. I have them do it till they can do it quickly and easily. This is usually 2 or 3 times. Good luck to you, Leon ",

Think of the problem this way: that ~3 pounds of tissue between your ears uses 20-30% of your whole body's energy metabolism. It would not be very efficient or conducive to survival for the body to build and maintain such expensive tissue and then not use it. So all the parts are there and working, in a normal brain, ready to be used as needed for whatever task is at hand.Now the brain's capacity to do information processing work may be expanded by a process called 'learning'. You learn and retain new information or skills because new dendrites bud out and new synapses form in your brain. Lots of work on early environmental enrichment in rodents indicates that early experiences can have a dramatic effect in improving a person's cognitive capacity throughout life. The upper limit on how much learning a brain can accomodate is not known, but is probably constrained by genetics. ",

For example breathing, blinking, heart beating, and so on. Imagine if we had to constantly keep track of all that. Honestly humans would die. Now things like reading and typing and what not, take some energy from other brain areas that don\u2019t need it like for example recollection. Remember it doesn\u2019t take all but sum and put it in the areas that you need for the task at hand. About learning things on the fly. Every persons brain is wired differently. How you learn things are all down to synapses that are formed in your brain. Some people have more and some people have less. And even you have more the way these are formed will determine how you learn.So in all honesty just be you and learn at your own pace. I would recommend watching the Reboot episode Enzo the Smart. ",

Usually this comes up in lawsuits, criminal cases, or when people are applying for insurance or disability benefits. For example, the Social Security Administration may determine that someone is 50% disabled. The same principle applies to your heart, liver, and other organs.

In most circumstances, you will not hear things that are \u201cconstant\u201d after a short period of time, say an air conditioner being on, but your brain is still processing the event. Most people don\u2019t know what they had for lunch yesterday, but your brain is processing the digestive system and ensuring that what is needed where is getting there. Every breath you take is regulated by the brain, but you generally are not conscious of each breath unless you are under duress or specifically think about it. Each time you get up and walk, many aspects of your brain are working very quickly, even if you are just walking to the water cooler. Using 100% of your brain at this stage of human evolution would probably short circuit all of the synapses that are dealing with every day, mundane aspects of life. Just listening to music takes a lot of brain power. On edit: I should have stated your \u201cconscious\u201d part of the brain. You are using 100% of your brain, just in different aspects, much of it as storage space. ",

            "answer_text": "If the question derives from the old myth that we only use 10% of our brain then the first response it that the idea was a convenient myth. It was convenient because we all hope there is a route to superpowers, such as unlocking hidden brain power. The myth derived from two perspectives: 1) early brain stimulation experiments where obvious responses to stimulation were not observed for a lot of the brain; and 2) the observation that neurons contributed to about 10% of brain tissue with glia contributing roughly the other 90%. The reason early stimulation experiments did not show obvious functions for a lot of the brain is that a lot of brain power is actually devoted to very subtle, complex tasks - like extrapolation, inference, abstraction, cross-correlation, generalization, synthesis and other high-order functions. Realistically, we collectively use most of the brain we have, just like we collectively use most of the physical strength, lung capacity, cardiovascular capacity, and so forth. As individual humans we may use much less than our capacity - just as a \u201ccouch potato\u201d watching TV is not using muscular or cardiovascular capacity. Obviously, the answer for that is \u201cget off the couch\u201d. The same is true for cognition. Push your limits and you will use as much as you can. You may then expand your limits to some extent. However, unlike muscle function we do not observe that brain capacity (e.g. \u201cIQ\u201d) can be markedly changed by effort. We can become more skilled in using what we have. ",

The belief that we do not use 100% of our brains, and that some potential remains somehow untapped it simply not true.  The processing power of a human brain far outstrips any computer yet made, perhaps even all the computers ever made together. A top of the line super computer can take tens of thousands of input datum, process it for 10 minutes and predict what the weather will be later that day.  A human brain can take the input from eyes looking out the window and do the same thing, with as much accuracy, in a few seconds. ",

The brain cycles dip in and out as it enters different cycles and each time it enters a cycle the electrical impulses trigger the neurons . These electrical impulse can become electricity to charge a 25 volt bulb Triggering the Neurons in all parts of your brain is an automatic activity and that does not cause the neurons to produce a response or create a braim impression or a file The Brain cycles Range from Beta 14\u201325 cycles per second ,Alpha, 7\u201314 / Theta, 4\u20137 /Delta 0\u20134 And the optimum cycle is 10 cycles but in this cycle your brain naturally gives you sleep signal s If you fall asleep ,your brain is not being used but the neurons continue to spark However if you were into music or being creative designing somenthing or inventing something or painting or even decorating a cake or a hall , you will linger in this Alpha Brain cyclce and charge alot of brain neurones and activate cells create files and images then this part of the brain is used ... Another example normally in Theta level a person is fast asleep, in dream state with Rapid eye movement (REM) but if you attached the electrodes of a EEG machine which is used to read brainwaves and cause a graph so as to identify the brain cycles . The head of a faith healer ,one who uses prayer or the hands to heal ,he or she will be functioning in Theta ....this is not unusual or parnormal . All successful faith healers, Yogis who can do unsual task like making a boy walk up a Rope flung into the sky , like drinking continously gallons of milk or living in Himalayas in freezing cold without colthes except a loin cloth they all give a theta brainwave reading .when doing any of these ...4\u20137 cycles per second or pulsations yes this brain will prove extreme use in theta level In India and other asia regions many medicine man priests and pastors use Delta brainwaves to form miracles .In India the Swamji can drink gallons of milk as a show of their psychological and physiology control of their body .which can only be done if you can function in Delta . The brain in right hemisphere is invisibly partioned for each brain cycle if you use Alpha level often the brain aciitivity does not overflow to the rest of the partitions like Theta and Delta . Learning to function at will effectively in both hemispheres using all of the brain neurons to constantly function in Right Brain Alpha ,(7-114 cycles ) Theta ( 4-7) Delta (0-4) and Left Brain ( 14- 25 ) qualifies the usage of 100% of the brain . This does not mean the brain does not function higher than 26 it does but it also detects various disorders with these high frequency so for a normal person its best to lower the brain patterns to 10 and below to be effective iand function in a special manner to tap your Genius faculty Nobody uses 100% of his or her brain many many brilliant people and those gifted with talents prove to use 2/3 of their Brain effectively in their lifetime Technology and Nanotechnology has advanced so much so the fronteirs of the Human brains activity and capability is no more a unknown secret There is loads of research on the Brain .brain cycles ,brain neurons as to why ,when ,and what causes it to function the way it functions in any usual and unusual manner . To use 100% of the brain is what \"Soul searching \" is about because when this occurs even though only for a split second you have all the answers within you through your concious connection with the Universal Conciousness . Strangely that enlightenment anchors you to the ground contended with life in a very genuine way .You fear nothing and you are just happy you have the \"odering pronciple \" so to speak . It does not mean once you touch 100% activity it will remain so no not at all .You have to train your brain to function effectively 100% As long as you are a earth being enjoy it while it lastbe normal, learn to use both hemispheres effectively for your own happiness ,own intelligence and even your own purpose in this life ",

This is called a very severe epileptic seizure, i.e. when one part of the brain starts to fire frantically and uncontrollably and affects the rest to start firing uncontrollably too. During a normal day (with many different activities) all parts of your brain will be active but not at once. The other side of the question is \u201ccan we improve ourselves?\u201d - The answer is yes! By training we can do alot, but there are limits. Lots of our mental capacities also depend on things we cannot control ourselves or did not have a chance to control like genes, upbringing which is controlled by parents doctors and government in general (think critical period nutrition and health rather than school because school has little effect compared to these factors) and other surrounding factors like is everyone around me vaccinated and is exceptionalism not suppressed in society and so on. So if you could optimise all these factors and on top of that get good training and access to learning resources, then you could probably expect to be a combination of Nobel prize winners several times over, poets, musicians, acrobats and really cunning, ruthless and liberated from ethics politicians like Machiavelli describes. So all the good things (especially the ruthlessness and freedom from ethics) :D Normal people would bore you and be annoying with their slowly evolving thoughts, but you wouldn't need to care about them anymore, they are just holding you back\u2026 just like the first true AI will think about us. #CuthuluAI #SuperSmart #NoLivesMatter (I like black humor.

While everyone is right that the vast unused portion of the brain is a myth, it is still a myth that persists - probably for the reason that it feels like it is true. One reason for this may be the dual system brain we all use. When we say \"I\" we are often referring to our conscious (self-aware) brain, which is only a portion of your usable neurons. A good bit of the brain fuction is devoted to non-conscious processes and decision making. I've seen estimates that between 45% and 90% of the choices you make every day are non-conscious, and that doesn't even account for the brain work expended on maintenance systems like breathing, heart beat, etc.  So yes, technically we make full use of the amazingly efficient cognitive machine we call a brain. But because our consciousness lays on top of a much larger non-conscious piece, it feels like there's a lot we leave on the table.  The above is all conjecture. Lots and lots of evidence for non-conscious processing (see behavioral economics or embodied cognition), but I have seen no studies linking the dual system brain structure to the pervasive idea that we do not make full use of our brain. I just think it fits. ",

As an aside, the use of the 10% capacity question was a vehicle in the movie (Lucy) to address a much more fundamental question. If you had godlike powers (omniscience, omnipotence), how would that affect the human condition? What would/could/should you do if you could do/know everything, and would you be justified in that, or any choice.  As usual, people get hung up on trivialities and miss the bigger picture, because they're looking for flaws instead of leveraging what is given into something worthwhile.

Nevertheless, I argue that there are several ways how the \u201c10% hypothesis\u201d could be considered true: Yes, we lose most of our neurons throughout our life, beginning from when we are still in the womb. Yes, not all the brain areas contribute equally to a certain brain state, and yes some brain lesions might leave the patient mind surprisingly \u201cintact\u201d. But that\u00b4s exactly how the brain is supposed to work! Let\u00b4s give you some examples: In a given moment, cars occupy only 10% of the city grid plan, large empty spaces are not used between two cars. How fast would we go if we cover 100% of the streets with cars? A google search provides you only with 10% of all possible pages that are in the search engine! how much more information would we get if every google search would display all possible results? While running, you use only 10% of your muscles at the same time, alternating between extensors and flexors, how fast would you run if you would contract all the muscles at the same time? I think you got the answer. Yes, we might not use the whole brain, or the whole brain at its maximum computational potential in any given time. But the brain works much like a stone sculpture: you get to what you want by eliminating what\u00b4s useless. \u201cless is more\u201d So, you know what would happen if we use 100% of our brain capacity? In neuroscience we call it \u201cseizure\u201d: not much fun. ",

Your premise is that there is no consequence.We would die because (not a complete list)Glutamate is the main transmitter in the brain. Using our brain = neurons fire = glutamate is released. Its also very toxic. Any neuron with ionotropic glutamate receptors would be clamped at 0 mV, meaning they would fire once. ONCE. And then die because of all the calcium influx into the cell.All muscles would become spastic including the ones we need for breathing. Tremendous suffocation :DTo put it into a simple analogy: if you use 100 % of your car, you would rev up and brake at the same time, mess up all seat settings while lowering AND moving the windows up, turn into BOTH directions and completely destroy it.

            "answer_text": "I'm working on it. It appears that people have 7 neural centers. In most people, the first three are almost entirely dormant, and, in general, they are not all coordinated. I work with them in this order.  The Heart Center is a neural center in the heart that opens us to a sense of love and harmony. (This is pure science. Check out http://heartmath.org.)The prefrontal cortex opens us up to a spiritual experience of oneness. The neocortex integrates the logical/rational view of life with the emotional/experiential view.The cortex works in 2 parts, sometimes separated on the left and right sides of the brain, but not always. One is logical and linguistic, and has many functions that are largely or uniquely human. The other is the experiential and emotional view of life, which we share with social mammals.The neo-mammalian brain is capable of primitive learning.The base of the brain, sometimes called the reptilian brain, responds rapidly to sensory input, but is limited to 6 options.The belly brain, located in the abdomen near the stomach can be at rest, heading for food, or throwing up. When integrated with the other brains, it provides gut intuition.My research and experience indicates that, as we activate these centers and improve communication among them, we become both more loving and more intuitive. Four levels of intuition open up - gut feeling, emotional intuition, rapid logical processing, and higher intuition. If we keep this going, then love consciousness, pervading all the brains, releases the experience of fear. That is, perfect love casts out fear. It is really fun to combine today's neuroscience and multiple spiritual and mystical traditions in such a practical way. And people who know me say its working. ",

Actually, humans do use 100% of their brains unless they have been injured and lost part of their brains in the accident. It is not that we fail to use all our mental power, but that many of us lack the cross-connections of dendrites between neurons within our brains. Most people lack critical thinking skills, memory capacity, creativity or sensitivity that they would otherwise use. Getting these abilities is always possible if only the person would take the time and use their energy to enter into neurogenic activities so that their brains will develop the dendrite cross connections they need. Doing puzzles, solving mazes, answering questions (like here in QUORA) and arguing in debates are all ways to build dendrite cross connections within your brain. ",

Example- if your eyes are closed then you are not seeing. If you are not seeing then the vision center of the brain is on standby. If you are not eating then taste is on standby, etc. Each activity uses a special set of brain centers but not all of them at the same time. I f someone used MRI or some other test to study brain function, it would appear that a large portion of the brain was inactive. It wasn't inactive but just on standby until needed for a certain task.Some really interesting work has been done with people who have lost parts of their brain in accidents or from disease. The intricacy of brain function is almost beyond comprehension. ",

It seems to me that your question really means \u201cIf we had consciousness control over 100% of our brain function what more could we do?\u201d If we had to think about every breathe we take, our conscience would be too occupied to do much more. We would not likely be able to determine what to do next. We would be so busy attempting to determine what to do with the load of sensory data in our environment that we would likely shut down and eventually die. Pattern recognition is an automatic brain process that enables us to negotiate our environment and choose what sensory data needs attention and how we should attend to it. And, you still have to remember to breathe. And what is this memory thing that we need to manage? Oops, did you remember to breathe? ",

No matter how much you are using at any time, it has to be less than half for the simple reason that the other half needs to be available to receive the next packet of information and process. It works by conveying information back and forth. To use it 100% as you are thinking would be like filling a room with people and having them all talking at the same time. No one is listening. Nothing is actually getting processed. Now if you bring the room to order and say, wait your turn or at least listen and respond to only the immediate people to your right before picking a direction to address your response to the next group of people. Some may be busy doing something else and not even notice the communication. Some will bring up something entirely different. Some will inject new ideas\u2026 This is how the brain works with billions of neurons and trillions of connections in groups of specialists. You can\u2019t run all the circuits at once as nothing is conveyed or processed when you do. Therefore the goal is to optimize the use of your mind, not to use the most. ",

Parts of your brain are responsible for different things. Imagine you are jogging. When jogging, you activate the parts of your brain responsible for navigation and motion. When you are doing a puzzle, you activate the parts responsible for spatial awareness. If you are doing multiple things at once, or a hard task, you will use more of your brain. Theoretically you could use 100% of your brain, but it would be nearly impossible to make every neuron fire at once. I see no reason why or how you could use every neuron at once. Some parts of your brain store memory. Why would you need to need to access every memory at once? ",

Though consciously, you perform specific tasks only, like walking to your home from a nearby grocery store, your brain performs the following tasks: Trying to remember if you have forgotten to buy anything.All the while navigating you to your home using your well memorised route to your home.While keeping you alive by maintaining your vital functions.While helping you keep your balance and controlling your motor functions.While constantly studying the changes in terrain, weather, traffic, suspicious people, possible stuff that may go wrong and so on, just to make sure you reach your home safe and on time.Play music in your head so you won't get bored!!This takes the full usage of the brain. It has your five senses activated, your vitals up and running, your cognitive abilities active, your memory constantly in use, your intuition and emotional self ready to act if any danger should present itself. Our body must be the most complex system in the world. So give your brain some credit. It works so hard so you don't have to all the time! ",

Correction of negative astrological aspects. And yes, some centers are related to clairvoyance, intuition and others. But there is also important to develop virtues, purity, high moral standarts. Otherwise could be very dangerous - for the one itself and for others. Most of the peoples not read to use this high abilities in the right way, but could be made preparations.

Consciousness When we are purely conscious stage that time we use our mind power. As our consciousness level rise we are able to use our mind power. But in surrounding areas full of distractions , then how we can get at least normal level consciousness always . Thus we fail to use every time conscious. Higher level of consciousness :- every single moment when we live in higher level of consciousness stage that time our mind power will expanding infinite wisdom and knowledge power , but according to science if man can reach the 20% mind power he has not any desire to in materistic world. He has free from fear, worry, pain. But science says it is only research theory. Spiritual world According to scriptures that time some sages has treamendeous Divine power , accquied through meditation. In meditation they were full aware and conscious, that time were possible . But not sure they reach the top Like a mahadav ,Brahma. Nowday it is not possible for for ordinary people. If any sage trying to practice through meditation in Himalayas. May be possible or not . I'm not sure... Thank you ",

Different parts of the brain have their own duties, but they don't all perform them at once. Some wait until you're asleep because they aren't suppressed by your conscious mind then. The idea that we only use \u201c10%\u201d of our brains or whatever is completely false. Humans do have abilities that come out in extreme conditions, usually because of adrenaline and other substances flooding the system. Some abilities are enhanced in situations because the brain suppresses them to a degree normally since they aren't necessary for everyday life, but that's not us using only a small part of our brain all the time. Most people don't need the strength to lift a truck in everyday life, so the brain suppresses that ability so that you don't expend more energy and resources than absolutely necessary for life. ",

From Sam Wang, an awesome neuroscientist at Princeton, the whole \u2018self-help\u2019 industry developed this myth. Here are some truths: The entire brain, all parts, are active, all the time. The brain is an organ. The neurons that create it and the cells that support these neurons are always doing something. If you\u2019re referring to how on MRIs perhaps people may see it as if parts are dormant or inactive then this is not exactly as it seems. These \u2018inactive\u2019 blobs are sinple significanty less active than all other parts of the brain and so do not show up as colored splotches. To further this, the entire idea that your brain only activates certain parts when certain situations arise (You begin to read therefore your \u2018reading center\u2019 of the brain activates) is already misguided. Many parts will be used more frequently at one monent in time to complete even the simplest of tasks, however do not forget that all parts are still active. Thank you for the question! I\u2019ll be happy to try and supply any answers to questions you may have. ",

I can explain See, Our brain has neuroconnections & nerves and this universe has stars and galaxies . Both of these are uncountable (billions) and even looks same when looked at , So what I suggest is ,every human being is connected to the universe ,the more they know about it the more they control. NOTE - Every BEING on the planet has control over everything in this world ,the one's who know are using it in its favour ,and the one's who don't are calling it by many names Destiny,Nature, Spirituality ETC. PS - You are the center of the universe and the world revolves around you and even lies in you. #when u know everything and nothing. ",

The person would just be doing something that requires an extraordinary amount of cognitive attention. Think about it: if you\u2019re only using 10% (or some other similarly small number) of your brain, that means 90% of your brain could be removed without any repercussions, if removed properly.

But this is just a myth, according to an interviewwith neurologist Barry Gordon in Scientific American. He explained that the majority of the brain is almost always active. The 10 percent myth was also debunked in a study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. One common brain imaging technique, called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can measure activity in the brain while a person is performing different tasks. Using this and similar methods, researchers show that most of our brain is in use most of the time, even when a person is performing a very simple action. A lot of the brain is even active when a person is resting or sleeping. The percentage of the brain in use at any given time varies from person to person. It also depends on what a person is doing or thinking about. ",

I can tell you that most of the answers you are going to get will be very insensitive, and I am warning you ahead of time. But to be useful, I will answer the question as if we did use 10%. We would most likely be able to have much more control over our cells, and be able to think at speed close to that of a computer. Though We wouldn\u2019t be able to use telekinesis, because that is against the laws of physics, and just impossible no matter what your brain capacity. ",

Even so, there is a lot of merit is using more of the brain at once, or even more of the trillions of neuroconnectors at once. Striving to excel is always great on so many levels, but its hard to say exactly how far any of us will eventually be able to grow as a species. There are probably so many things that have influenced our evolution over many millennia. The fossil record suggests that we have been evolving quicker over the last five thousand years by as much as seven percent. Scientists have suggested as we solve more problems, such as microbes and viruses, we will have less reason to evolve in the future, so we may need to take charge of our own evolution at some point. Right now the only control we have over self-evolving is through life\u2019s experiences, and even though it is more of a biological function to pass on good genes, it also serves to actuate genes.

What you may really mean to ask is about how much of that do we use \"consciously\", using the pre frontal cortex (pfc) vs the more involuntary, \"unconscious\" brain functions in the temporal lobe such as the hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus that take care of a range of functions ranging from emotions, hunger, thirst, long term memory etc.  You may get more precise answers if your question is about the pre frontal cortex of the brain and not about the brain itself! If you really do mean to ask about the brain - the basic assumption itself is biologically incorrect, so it can't really be sensibly answered! ",

But the reality is we use 100% of our brain. Compare the likes of a human to that of an animal and see the real differences and you will understand. 80% however is an obvious downgrade and would be what I believe is retarded mental growth and we would be stuck in the stone ages. Just like Michael Soso stated : \u201cnothing would happen because all humans already use 100% of their brains. If everyone started using just 80% (however one might define such a thing), the effects would be disastrous.\u201d ",

I say the word \u2018dog\u2019 and a particular type of dog or things associated with a dog appear in your mind, which are different from the ideas that appear in mine. If I said the word \u2018dog\u2019 to someone whose never seen a dog, doesn't know what a dog is or a baby or someone who cant understand langue, then there\u2019s going to be less things that light up - but that no indication of intelligence or percentage of brain used.

Jokes apart those who wrote that neuroscience proved that we use our brain 100 % already means they are telling about the biological brain, and not the potential of the brain. Brain can project the mind and mind can do a lot more than everyone can imagine. The true harmony of soul body and mind can do the magic what was never imagined before. The intuition is one of the supereme evidence that we are not really using our brain. After we fight woth artificial intelligence and machine world, true potential of the brain can be evident soon.

            "answer_text": "Sid's answer veers just a tad towards the \"New Age\" IMO.... Most of the human brain is actually used pretty much all the time.  It's essentially running our body.  A great deal of processing is concerned with mundane physiological tasks like digestion and respiration and endocrine activity and movement, and all those things that we don't \"think\" about but which are nonetheless controlled by the brain. We only use a certain amount of the brain for conscious thought and information processing, and again that goes on all the time even if we're not particularly aware of it.  The notion that we don't use a large percentage of the brain is simply false. ",

Now,What would happen if you find a roll of 100$ bills on the road on 17th Feb 2015, on Thursday ? Well, If I still am the person to answer... I would be the most sad person there. Good till here !Now if the human brain was 100% working, what would have been happend ! *You might have realized that I am lucky*You might have realized that I may be fooling you by writing this*You might get feeling of jealousy*You might realize that some dates are not in Sync with days*You might follow me *You might up-vote this*You might not read ahead*You might think this is the weird answer*Or you might not think anything of the list So, Believe me ! Even if we are able to use 100% of the brain, I ensure you that, we humans, still be the humans and our feelings still be the same. The only thing that would change is how we are going to interpret the world around us, and how quick we are going to do that. Using 1% or 100% brain, is not going to change the much. You may want to see the evolution in that case. When Charles said, we were primate sometimes back, all the intellectuals started to derive the theory around it. And if you accept those theories, we are using 90% more brain than the primates, perhaps. Though, the only thing change till this moment is, How we interpret the world around us? Nothing more ! ",

Not too long ago, glial cells or glia, were thought to be \u201conly\u201d support cells \u2014 they cleaned the bathrooms, took out the trash, got everyone up for work each day, and made certain that everyone had enough rest and enough to eat. Glia represent about 50% of brain cells, neurons make up the rest. We now know, and have known for a while, that glia do much more than regular maintenance. They are, instead, charged with maintaining the health of neurons and other glia; protecting cells under attack from alien invaders; coordinating rescue activity for neurons under siege and so much more. They do the heavy lifting. Check it out: The Other Brain: The Scientific and Medical Breakthroughs That Will Heal Our Brains and Revolutionize Our Health by Fields Ph.D., R. Douglas It\u2019s a great resource for professional and non-professionals and a good read.

            "answer_text": "You already are. The notion that a human being uses only 10% of his / her brain is a myth. Enough scientific advances have taken place to show that every part of the brain is indeed carrying out some function or the other. Depending on the architecture of the neurons in various parts of your brain, they are assigned numbers termed as \u201cBrodmann areas\u201d. For example, when you are seeing this message on your screen, Brodmann area 17(the primary visual cortex) is active & so on & so forth for virtually every part of the cerebral hemisphere. With the advent of functional MRI & PET scans, neuroscientists can directly observe which part of the brain is activated by a particular stimulus. Still having doubts? Just think about this : A rippling body builder decides to avoid the gym for a year. What would happen? His muscles will simply atrophy because they are not being used. Similar principles apply to neural tissue. If you were indeed using only \u201c10%\u201d of the brain you were born with, then 90% of it will simply atrophy & you would still be using 100% of your remaining brain! ",

Imagine having to control every aspect of your body function, your heart rate, breathing, the constant cycles of hormone secretion, your digestion and bowel movements. Those are not things I want under my conscious control. And this is excluding the ginormous amount of info you would receive every millisecond about the position of every part of your body. Even controlling your higher functions will be like climbing the Everest when you have to compare and dissect every stimulus to decide on which emotion you want to show the outer world. Fact remains that we humans tend to want things under unconscious control rather than actually thinking and doing. Compare brushing your teeth to solving a differential equation. You might even feel tired after solving the equation because we will allocate more brain resource into a conscious activity that we have to direct. Everything we do, we do to practise enough so that we do it without thinking. So let's be thankful that we are the way we are. ",

The brain has certain functions in order that we can think (as we call it), many of whose locations within the brain are known to modern science. the brain is hardware. The hippocampus, for example organises long term memory, other parts of the brain look after short term memory. The old limbic brain stem is the oldest part of the brain. It is believed to look after, fight or flight reactions. So the brain is necessary but in and of itself it is not sufficient for thinking, unless you subscribe to the notion that thought is \u2018content\u2019 in the form of \u2018representations\u2019 ensconced \u2018somewhere\u2019 in the brain and functioning as electric impulses forming synaptic connections to memory neurons where memories are formed and held in situ till called upon to become conscious. We do read each others minds. Every time you discuss a topic, you shape your response to achieve a certain response, the one you want to achieve, we mirror one another, in actions like taking similar postures; folding arms, touching our faces, placing our hands on hips, all these, in a social context are non-verbal signals, also known as phatic communications (I like you, you like me), that we unconsciously share with others, especially those we are amicable towards, we even have signals to let people know we don\u2019t like them. We share a common language, It is not your or my language but a shared community of speakers and using this common form of communication we know what there are saying and what they mean (unless of course they are trying to deceive us). Super human powers belong in comic books and the \u2018hero\u2019 movies. There are however, folk with remarkable skills. others who can do incredible things like remember every event in their lives in detail, but this turns out to be a curse, as they are never fully conscious to their present lives, they ruminate over past events, as their immediate \u2018real\u2019 life passes them by.

Inhibition of communication between neurons is just as important as firing between neurons.  But this question is likely asking something else. Specifically:\"Does using ALL of our brain make us smarter?\"Even if we ignore the severe seizure that would come about from doing so, the answer would still be no. The amount of memory and information every human holds in their brain is immense, and an attempt to 'notice' every function and memory at one time would be impossible to comprehend. The parts of the brain responsible for waking and sleeping would be running at the same time.The motor pathways for running and walking would be activated at the same time.Every usually independent function of the brain would paired with a likely incompatible function, resulting in nothing particularly good for both your mental and physical capabilities.

Practice letting answers / conclusions come out of nowhere and acting on this, in a responsible manner obviously. Use your conscious thinking to evaluate as opposed to formulate. You will be amazed at your new found creativity.Also practice not thinking (takes lots of practice) to let the mind work to its full capacity. Use Zen techniques. No need to pick up the religious baggage, which isn't really there anyway.If you are a programmer try to not let the need for structured flow cross over to your other mental activity.

Using 100% of it would result in many brain cells being both stimulated and inhibited at the same time, and they are not designed to work that way. To do most things, many parts of the brain are used in quick succession. So in fact, quite a bit of your brain does get used often, but not all in the same nanosecond. What people are usually talking about when they ask this, is having their working memory work better. Getting plenty of sleep, good nutrition, exercise, and practice at different problems, will do that. Little kids memorizing things, learning a new language, songs, music, and playing sports helps a lot to develop the brain for adulthood. Anything that makes you use your eyes and coordinate with your hands - like drawing, playing a musical instrument - develops that ability. ",

The amount of prisons and the size of the legal industry confirm this. Not to mention the size of mental, psychological, emotion treatment as a result of self inflicted harm is staggering. Obesity, alcoholism, drug addiction, pharmaceutical poisoning, dysfunctional relationships, war selfishness, etc. I could go on and on. No, if our body and brain did not control most of our functions, we as a species would have been extinct long ago. The goal then should be to appreciate and maximize to its full potential the portion of our brains we do have control over. Stop the madness and self destruction.

            "answer_text": "Our brain works 100% but there is a little twist. Our brain is divided in 2 parts. One is concious mind which is around from 2% to 13\u201314% ( varying person to person) Second is un-concious or say sub concious mind, which is around 86% to 98% ( varying combination with concious mind, in every human being) . Work of sub concious mind is only and only to record things, through our 5 sensing parts of our body. whatever we see through our eyes, hear with ears, smells with nose, taste with tongue and finally touch and feel (these are 5 sensing parts of our body) The higher percentage of concious mind, the higher percentage of your IQ and Intelligence. Very famous Scientists like Elbert Einstein or Newton were having around 13% of concious mind. And human with 2\u20133 of concious mind, falls in a category of mental retarded. Both part of our brain i.e. concious mind and subconscious mind are sync and works together. Whenever we wants an answer or a solution for a question or a problem, our concious mind send your question to subconscious mind to process the related information. Your subconscious mind search the related information (multifold faster than Google search engine) and send it to concious mind and your concious mind choose one of the best option out of many answer or information, supplied by your subconscious mind. And yes, you can increase your active brain (concious mind). Watch a video on YouTube The formula to increase brain power . Please watch this till end otherwise you won't be able to understand the science, i.e. how should we position our head while we are sleeping and why ? because there is a connection between our Earth, earth's magnetic field and human brain, sleep and memory. Explanation of science starts after 4 minutes so please have patience. This may help you in increasing your conscious mind. Hope this may help you.

If we required full control over our brain this would be quite terrible because it would mean things like breathing, metabolism, and body temperature would have to be constantly monitored. If we had full control of those areas but didn't have to exercise it, we would have the advantage of being able to optimize our bodies for particular circumstances and disadvantage of being able to kill ourselves by setting our bodily to ranges that aren't long compatible with life.

Every single neuron in every single part of the brain is used every single minute of every day until you die. But not all at the same time. Its analog. Constantly adjusting to a constant stream of information. Think of it like multi tasking. You can juggle multiple things at once by switching back and forth but you cant do multiple things at exactly the same time. You cant inhale and exhale at the same time. Its a give and take. ",

Other parts of the brain are storing memory, so you would be accessing irrelevant memory. If all parts of the brain had maximum blood flow simultaneously I'd expect major intercranial pressure, probably an aneurism. ",

The origin of this myth that humans are only able to use 10% of their brain took from some prevalent theories from the 19th century. And since then it has become a hot topic for some of the science fictions without any scientific credibility. This myth took speed with a common belief that percentage of the brain used by the great scientist Albert Einstein was 13% which is just 3% more utilization than the normal human. He did many amazing scientific discoveries and people thought that if we were able to use 100% of our brains than that would bring wonders to this world. 10% brain usages myth The belief that we are only able to use 10% of our brains is half truth and half a lie. The only truth to this 10% myth is that our brain consists of 10% neurons which help us in processing and transmitting information while the remaining 90% is made of glial cells which act as a support system for the neurons and provides insulation to them.

The local volumes show different levels of activity, depending on what is happening in the brain. The demands of a specific part of the brain can be measured using positron emission tomography (measures glucose uptake rates) and fMRI (measures blood flow). We can also monitor the rapid changes in activity throughout the brain using electroencephalography (relatively old technology) and magnetoencephalography (a newer and faster technology). We can make movies of brain activity from these imaging techniques. When played, we see activity moving from one part of the brain to another. Even a simple stimulus causes activity that rapidly moves around, taking in all of the brain. ",

            "answer_text": "False premise, as others in this thread have noticed.  Serious brain researchers say that while we perhaps  don't use our brains as efficiently as we might, there's no evidence we  have vast unused abilities. Admittedly no one has ever tested all the tens of  billions of neurons in a given brain. You've certainly got a few spares;  otherwise no one would recover from a stroke. But attempts to map out  the cerebral cortex, the center of the higher mental functions, have not  found large areas that don't do anything. The general view is that the  brain is too small (just three pounds), uses too many resources (20  percent of body oxygen utilization though it accounts for just 2 percent  of weight), and has too much to do for 90 percent of it to be  completely comatose.\" - Cecil Adams, Do we really use only 10 percent of our brains?

And the different lobes have different functionality as mentioned. So the brain has to work as a whole for a human to walk around, sit, or for that matter even sleep.

We use close to 100% of our brains functional capacity at any given time.  A large portion of the brain functions subconsciously, making split-second decisions about our environment and movement through the senses.  There are also other levels of subconscious thought that play into decision making that we aren't consciously aware of. Because of the beain's characteristic of neuroplasticity, the brain is capable to expand it's boundaries and capacities through deliberate practices/systems.  Which may explain, for example, the abnormal section in Einstein's brain associated with visualspatial abilities, which is debatably associated to his practice of thought experiments. ",

I could separate them all and tell which ones were the deepest one, the fastest from my conscience, and which ones were more on the surface, almost reaching the spoken word. It was very weird. It's like I had a lot of time in one split second to do all that. Now I find it impossible but maybe I didn't try hard enough. Most of the things we could do would be ourselves related but knowing how to control perception, thoughts and attitude and be able to change your behaviour on the spot because you're in control of your brain, that would mean being able to partially control the environment around you. For example, still as a kid i could make things happen. As I was so good in anticipating what people were thinking in specific situations (especially stupid teenagers as they were all following the same patterns, no offence) that I could determine what was next with a good percentage of accuracy. And make my moves according to what direction I wanted that situation to take. ",

Also even if you could do all those things as well as have memory recall of past lives and could predict the future to 99.9 % accuracy you wouldn't be using 100% of your brain all at once.

We obviously don\u2019t use every single bit at maximum capacity at the same time; much like how we are not always using 100% of our muscle mass at any time.

The brain is always working at 100% doing what it needs to fuction any given time. Sure, some brains are able to do a lot more, and some damaged brains do a lot less. Think of two factories that both have 100 workers making the same product. Factory 1 has a quota of 1000 products and factory 2 has 10,000. Even though factory 1 has a lower quota then factory 2, it is still using all 100 workers. The factory 2 workers will be more exhausted at the end of their shift and need more rest. Bottom line is, your mind is working at 100%, but you can always push it to work harder. You just may be exhausted later with a giant migraine. ",

People can access states where they are able to use parts of the brain together which do not normally communicate. This can be done by the follwing. Magnetic stimulation. A year or more of meditation. Certain substances such as LSD or Cannabis. When done, people experience things ranging from increased ascociative thinking, slowed perception of time, blending of senses and loss of identity. But all of the brain is used. ",

There are no dormant regions in the brain just waiting to be activated to give you psychic powers or suchlike. Think about it like this: your brain is a fantastically expensive organ. By expensive, I mean that it takes a lot of energy to run the brain - up to 20% of the body\u2019s energy is consumed by the brain. Now if 90% of the brain were simply sitting there, unused, then that would be a tremendous amount of energy spent on maintaining something that does nothing. Evolution would never permit that to happen, because an animal that spends a huge percentage of its body\u2019s energy maintaining a useless structure is far from the fittest.

Im not just talking about heartbeat, digestive functions, involuntary breathing, chemical needs, vision processing, what do you think does all the dirty work? But, for the sake of the person asking, im going to assume that this does not mean all the Neurons firing at once, but rather what if all portions of the Brain was reallocated for computing style processing and thinking, including the parts that keep you alive and stuff. Well, who knows? It\u2019s never been done before. Maybe we would become several billion times faster and smarter than we already are, and give Quantum and Photonic Computing a run for their money?

If we can use 20% then we could just communicate through telepathy. It's really great to think what we can do when we have 100% brain capacity but till now we have no answer just concepts and imagination.

However, if we were ever to be able to take full control of our brain we could, theoretically, change anything we wanted in our sensations and behavior. like accessing the source code of a program. we could change how hungry we are in what conditions, delete habits and add new ones, cause our sense of taste to change so that healthy food seems sweet and sugar nauseating. make running release more endorphins to make it more fun, add information like in the matrix etc. the examples are endless. The down side is, in my opinion, and in the current level of human understanding of the brain we are very far from a technology like this remote control (i have no idea how close monks are) and so even if we manage to change something, we are very likely to mess up much more. let\u2019s say i want to like broccoli, maybe i will like broccoli so much that i will eat it non stop until i literally burst and die. I hurt just thinking about it. It\u2019s a nice thought experiment though :) ",

What will be the difference between the two hands after a certain amount of time. One will be weaker and the other will be stronger. Because cells in the week hand have not been used and repaired properly and regularly they are not at good shape.   This says that if a certain part of the brain is not used it should grow weaker, but brain can always be used just like that to analyse things unless there are physical changes(Injuries).So the brain always uses 100% but not the whole of the memory part, but still memories do not die out. It just takes time to access them. And we do forget things(Like what happened in the our age was 1st and 2nd). Sounds reasonable to me.Hope this helps... ",

Like he could see, hear from a far distance. Like he could travel faster than air.  Practically it is not possible to prove what I have mentioned!

Note that these people don't necessarily exercise 100% control of everything at any given moment, just that there is little they can't control when and if they want to. Such people use this control to pursue a spiritual perfection that will let them break free of the passions and become one with the universe. Any power or control that seems magical or superhuman is called a siddhe and is usually regarded as a curiosity on the way to the Great Perfection, not an end in itself. In other words, if you could take total control over brain and body, you'd find there are more important things to do with your time. ",

Dont really believe everything literally, there are encoded secrets, signs your consciousness will give you. This is human potential, vision beyond the horizon. Science is limited in its own sense, Human is not. ",

Thus, the human brain can, and often is, operating at 100% capacity and even more. ",

Or maybe you mean \"I heard we only use 10% of our brain, what would happen if we used 100%?\" Then I'd say you heard wrong and that a brain's processing power is not simple enough to describe as a 0\u2013100 meter. If you just meant \"if you could do whatever you want (e.g. delete specific memories at will)\" then you already know what's possible\u2026 things like deleting memories at will. ",

Evolutionarily speaking, our brain is developed to operate at its peak depending on what we are doing. We could surely feel a sense of inefficiency when we are tired or distracted by something because we are not machines and many factors can influence our natural ability to use the brain in a particular circumstance. However, the fact we don't use our brain at its peak doesn\u2019t make sense because it would mean we have to enable some parts of the brain like a CPU core. Of course exercise and practice can improve our focus and efficiency for a particular task but this is another argument. ",

Your body does so much automatically at the behest of the brain. You can feel heat and cold, understand what you are touching. Having complete, conscious control over our brains would be a nightmare. We would have to deliberately choreograph every action. But it does make for wonderful science fiction, doesn\u2019t it? Imagine being so in control of the brain that you had X-ray vision! Except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Our eyes receive light. We don\u2019t send anything from our eyes to probe the surroundings. Or imagine being able to move things telekinetically. You might imagine it. You just can\u2019t do it. Moving things requires physical force, and the mind is not connected to the outside world except through your body. There are reasons that mentalists have regularly been exposed as frauds. Granted, there is much we don\u2019t know about the brain. But we know physics and chemistry. And superhuman powers or X-men abilities or mutants who transform reality with their mind just don\u2019t exist. We all want to be more than we are. But if we make the most of who we are and work hard to learn and understand the world around us, we can do some pretty remarkable things. ",

Brains are malleable and somewhat self-healing, and not always busy - external stimuli coming through skin, ears, eyes, etc. cause given parts of the brain to become active. Fact - pound for pound the brain uses a large multiple of the calories used by e.g. red muscle. Resting the brain is a necessary economy. Revving up the brain such as to study, think, plan, design, etc. coincides with the rest of your body going into a resting state. Marathoners may do casual arithmetic about liters of water and miles to go, but they don\u2019t solve quadratic equations in their heads. Nature / GOD\u2019s design / evolution / what-have-you tends to be very \u201csmart\u201d and economical in just about everything. Just like pumping iron or working out on the track, you can \u2018train\u2019 your brain. In fact, learning to ride a bicycle does that. Learning to study does that. Learning to play a musical instrument does that. The net truth is that our brains are trainable, but not nearly as expansive as we hope. ",

For example, Centre for intake of breath and to stop breathing will compensate with each other and no action will occur we will die. Similarly for heart, Heart will stop beating.
