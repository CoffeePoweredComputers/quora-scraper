            "answer_text": "Mashed potatoes become an uncountable substance with added water, milk, butter, salt or whatever else you add, but they're still made of a number of potatoes. You still have 50 potatoes minus however much of them you peeled before mashing, which could be nothing if you like the skins in there but I'd say about 1.75\u20132.25 potato masses worth of skin and outer starch would be removed peeling 50 potatoes. That leaves 47.75 potatoes at least. Also if you've eaten any then the number goes down. A serving of mashed potatoes probably has about 2/3 of a potato in it. So if you've had two servings, you've eaten 1.33 potatoes and reduced it to 46.42 potatoes. But if you made 50 potatoes worth it's likely you made it for a big event and more people have eaten than just you. Assuming a serving has 2/3 of a potato, you made 75 servings of mashed potatoes. It's not clear if this is a single option meal where you'd make more than enough of a dish for everyone, in which case probably about 40\u201350 people are attending, or a potluck where you'd make enough for not quite everyone, or for everyone to just sample, in which case 90\u2013100 people are there. It really depends how good your mashed potatoes are too. ",
