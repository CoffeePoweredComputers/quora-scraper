            "answer_text": "If I asked you how long a shopping cart of fruit is, could you tell me? No you couldn\u2019t. If your cart had watermelons you may be able to get two in the cart and their length would be around 4 feet. on the other hand if it was filled with eggs it could easily exceed 150 feet. Now to your question. If the acres are in in the shape of a square there would be about 1/4 of a mile long. Now if your 40 acres were 1 foot wide by 1,742,400 long, the total square feet in 40 acres, there would be about 330 miles. ( the watermelons and the eggs) So if you were to fence in your \u201c40 Acres\u201d , it would require about one mile of fencing if they were in the a of a square or 3 miles and two feet of fencing if it was a one foot wide strip containing the 40 acres.

            "answer_text": "I thought I\u2019d try a different take on this question, which as everyone else has pointed out has no actual answer. The origin of the acre as a unit of area is in feudal agriculture. It was a useful unit of land in relation to arable farming defined as a chain by a furlong. Hence an acre is 220 x 22 yards (4840 square yards or 43,560 square feet). A furlong (corruption of the term furrow-long and 220 yards long) is the distance over which a ploughman with a team of oxen could reasonably be expected to plough a straight furrow. A chain (22 yards) is the width in which it is possible to turn round a plough to go back in the opposite direction. A furlong is one eighth of a mile, so if you were to line up 40 acres one after another they would be five miles long (by 22 yards wide). If you were to put them side by side 40 acres would be 880 (40 times 22) yards long (by 220 yards wide), or half a mile. Q - How long is 40 acres in miles? ",
