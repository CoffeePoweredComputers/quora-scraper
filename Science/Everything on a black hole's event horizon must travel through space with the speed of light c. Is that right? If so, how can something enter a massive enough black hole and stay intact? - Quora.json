            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an article written from the hopeful point of view that we know what a black hole really is. We do not. We know that when too much stuff gets concentrated into a small enough space, it bends spacetime into a permanent configuration that we\u2019ve taken to calling a black hole. Until Hawking came along and we then knew that it\u2019s a semi-permanent configuration \u2014 permanent in any normal sense but over sufficiently long timescales the black hole evaporates. But what do we really know? And what happens? So what actually happens is we don\u2019t know. If quantum physics is just wrong and black holes don\u2019t really evaporate at all, then the description of \u201cAnne\u2019s\u201d point of view from the article is incorrect. She\u2019d see you fall across the horizon and not see anything after that, and would have no idea what became of you, while you would be able to see out but you\u2019d never be able to leave. Probably you die from tidal forces as you are drawn to the center. Probably because\u2026 no one has ever seen inside a black hole, and singularities aren\u2019t physical phenomena, they\u2019re mathematical phenomena that as far as anyone can tell do not and cannot manifest in a physical form. Thus, a mathematical singularity is a place where our best answer is \u201cwe don\u2019t know.\u201d We don\u2019t know. If Einstein is wrong about black hole physics then what happens is you burn up at the event horizon. Anne sees your clock slow down and predicts that from your point of view it\u2019s a quick death. From your point of view you see Anne\u2019s clock speed up and\u2026 experience a quick death. But we have no real reason to believe Einstein is wrong, we\u2019ve not done a single experiment that would give us cause to doubt. We don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the right answer, whatever some pop science article wants to claim about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you saying you think moving at light speed will somehow mean you won\u2019t be intact? Remember it called relativity theory for a reason. Just because something is traveling a c relative to some distant observers, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s even moving in it\u2019s own reference frame (in fact nothing ever moves in it\u2019s own reference frame). Here\u2019s an infalling trajectory in spacetime with the light cone (the future directions of emitted light) of the infalling particle. Notice that the particle is not falling at the speed of light in it\u2019s own frame.  One way to think of it is imagine the black hole is like a sink hole and spacetime is flowing into it like water. You\u2019re in a boat and it has a certain maximum speed relative to the water. So there\u2019s a point at which the water in flowing in faster than your boat can go\u2026that\u2019s the event horizon. But nothing happens to you as you cross it. It just means you can\u2019t go back. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. From any side \u2014 from center or from the Space. The fact is that outside matter is falling with a speed of about 1/3 of c on average; due to a rotation of plasma on accretion disc real radial speed is just about 20,000 mi/s. Nowadays internal model of black hole says that nothing even trying to come close to event horizon from the inside even with a half speed of c. Matter that got inside is slow down to a zero speed. Event horizon is imaginary line and it has no special features. Only one magic property: nothing material can pass it from inside. Light can not be generated inside black hole in a direction going from the center. But if something would be able to beam light out \u2014 it will go through event horizon. Event horizon is fully transparent for magnetic field and gravity. ",

Nothing stays intact on the way into a black hole. The endothermic fission that must be the reason for the near absolute zero temperature inside a BH is sure to reduce everything to primitive forms of matter and or energy. This disassembly can very well be going on gradually starting outside the event horizon and finishing inside and closer to the actual, physical core of the BH. ",
