            "answer_text": "Most agree that there are 10 Trillion cells in a human body, and all but neurons replace themselves on a schedule, related to how long it takes for them to wear-out, or when they are damaged. The process is called \u201cmitosis\u201d. Doing a little math, we can see that Billions of cells are replacing themselves, every hour of every day. The most critical part of the job is separating the double DNA strands in each cell, and copying the DNA\u2019s 30 Billion codes onto the new strands in the nucleus. One gene, p53, in each cell controls when, where, and how the replication is done, corrects mistakes, and sends the death signal to the old cell or to the new cell if it is incorrect and can\u2019t be corrected. This gene codes for protein TP53, or TSP53, the tumor suppressor protein, called \u201cthe protector of the genome\u201d. This suicide process is called \u201capoptosis\u201d. Some sources claim that 1000 of these replications involve mistakes, every day, and only one, on average, isn\u2019t corrected and must be sent the irreversible suicide signal. Some of these mutant cells escape that death signal and go on to replicate normally, one for one, becoming \u201cbenign\u201d tumors, or are \u201cmalignant\u201d if they replicate uncontrollably. This has been studied for many years, and they know how the apoptosis signal fails, but they don\u2019t know why. I see no drug, general vaccine, or contemplated therapy, that will affect the cancer cells without affecting other healthy cells. One possible cause of cancer that can be prevented is -statistics show that, as a rule, only weak young people and older people, who have lost muscle mass with age, get cancer. Low muscle mass is now considered evidence of weak immune systems, and it has now been shown that obesity strongly relates to future cancer, and obesity usually is associated with lack of ability to exercise and loss of muscle mass. Looking at the data, we may want to connect the dots, for ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Cancer occurs when too many cells are allowed to grow. In cancerous cells, the normal control mechanisms of the cell are repressed, preventing the cell from stopping this abnormal growth and proliferation. Normally, a healthy cell responds to signals from both within itself and from the rest of the body. Among other things, these signals can cause the cell to stop replicating or even undergo apoptosis. Apoptosis, which is also called programmed cell death, is one of the ways that the body can prevent cancer from developing. However, as explained by Nature Research: science journals, jobs, information and services., cancer is the result of mutations accumulating in the DNA of a cell. These mutations often prevent the cell from responding to the internal and external signals that tell healthy cells to stop growing or die. Because they do not respond to these signals, the cells begin to multiply and form a tumor. While the tumor is growing, additional mutations occur in the cell\u2019s DNA. Some of these mutations are beneficial to the cancerous cells, so the tumors grow even larger. As these mutations are passed down to daughter cells, the entire mass becomes larger and larger. Eventually, some pieces may break away, or metastasize, and cause tumors to form in other parts of the body. ",
