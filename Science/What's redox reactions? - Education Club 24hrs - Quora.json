            "answer_text": "First of all we should know that about oxidation and reduction . Also we should know that what is Oxydising agent and reducing agent. After that we can explain redox reaction. Oxidation : - Addition of oxygen and removal of hydrogen is called oxidation. For example, Mg + O2 => MgO NaH + Heat => Na + H2 In first example we can see addition of oxygen and in second example we can see removel of hydrogen. OR Loss of election is called oxidation. For example Sodium have a tendency to loose one electron to complete outermost shell. Na (2 ,8 ,1) => Na^+ (2 ,8) + 1e Mg (2, 8, 2) = > Mg^+2( 2 , 8) +2e Simply we can see loss of electron of Na and Mg Now, Reduction :- Removel of oxygen or addition of hydrogen is called reduction. For example, CuO +Zn => ZnO + Cu OR Gain of electron is called reduction. For example, Cl (2,8 ,7) +1e => Cl^-( 2 , 8 , 8) Oxydising agent:- are those chemical which gives oxygen for oxidation. Reducing agent :- are those chemical which gives hydrogen for reduction CuO +Zn => ZnO + Cu In this reaction, Oxidation :- Zn Reduction:- CuO Oxydising agent :- CuO Reducing agent :- Zn When oxidation and reduction takes place simultaneously is called Redox Reaction. Redox means (Red + Ox) => reduction and oxidation both In the above example CuO convert into Cu => Reduction (Oxydising agent) Zn convert into ZnO => Oxidation (Reducing agent) ",

            "answer_text": "ANSWER An oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two species. An oxidation-reduction reaction is any chemical reaction in which the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron.The formation of hydrogen fluoride is an example of a redox reaction. We can break the reaction down to analyze the oxidation and reduction of reactants. The hydrogen is oxidized and loses two electrons, so each hydrogen becomes positive.H2\u200b+2F\u21922HF ",

CuO + H2 \u2014\u2014\u2014 Cu + H2O Here copper oxide (CuO) has lost oxygen and firmed copper(Cu), which is called reduction & H2 has gained oxygen to form water(H2O) which is called oxidation.
