            "answer_text": "\u201cGroup\u201d? It\u2019s clear that this is one of those high school trivia questions, because the obvious answer is the Group IIA elements, the divalent cations like magnesium and calcium. But that\u2019s not exactly a complete answer, is it?  (image adapted from Periodic Table with Charges - 118 Elements) If you look at the image above, where I\u2019ve circled some of the notable ones in a magenta oval, you see that there are more elements with two valence electrons to give, and in fact all of the early transition metals from manganese to zinc all seem to be able to give two valence electrons. In fact, all of the group IIB elements seem to have this same property, so if I may be so bold, I\u2019d suggest that both group IIA and IIB have two valence electrons. But that\u2019s not all- you have europium as well, and lead. So it\u2019s not just \u201cgroups\u201d that have this property, but a smattering of others outside the groups as well. And, of course, you need to consider the fact that mercury is\u2026 mercurial, and can be either +1 or +2. And i think I left out one or two examples\u2026 can you find others above? The point here is that \u201cvalency\u201d is a incomplete theory of how molecules form. When you begin looking at how more complicated molecules form, you see instances of partial or fluctuating valency, partial charges, hypervalency, and a whole bestiary of new properties. The valence of atoms is just a first degree approximation of the underlying properties of atoms, and my advice is not to get too hung up on the exact answering of such a question. \u2026unless of course, this is one of those high school quizzes you get, in which case if you start tacking on \u201c\u2026and europium!\u201d you\u2019re likely to flunk for being a smartass. But understand that these things aren\u2019t cut and dry rules and doctrines that you can quote chapter and verse as you get older and wiser. ",
