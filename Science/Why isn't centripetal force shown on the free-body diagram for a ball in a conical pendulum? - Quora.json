            "answer_text": "In order to be able to understand this, first let us understand the meaning of centripetal force. Whenever an object moves on a circular path, it is undergoing a continuous change in direction. This change in direction is to brought by the action of a force acting on it. More specifically if there is a resultant force which is directed towards the centre of the circle, then this situation is possible. So if you see any object moving in a circle, you must realise that there must be forces acting on an object which have a resultant component towards the Centre. This resultant component towards the centre is called the centripetal force. There is no additional force acting on the object. Whatever real forces like that of gravity, normal force, tension in a string or spring force are acting on the object, there will be a net resultant of these forces towards the centre which will be called the centripetal force. I hope that makes it clear that we do not show a centrietal force in the free body diagram. Please upvote if you liked the answer. This will be a motivation for me to keep writing answers. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as \"centripetal force.\" Forces are real things. For example in a conical pendulum, two real forces are acting, the string tension and gravity. If you want to call the horizontal component of the string tension by some special name, as very bad physics texts sometimes do, that tends to confuse students totally, as this question illustrates. Please don't do it, textbooks. Components of vectors generally don't need names, especially names that disguise what vector component the component is! Things are still not as bad as they were in the hopelessly nonsensical cookbook physics texts that one saw before 1950, where also sometimes included on force diagrams was the completely imaginary \"centrifugal\" force, and 2nd Law problems involving acceleration were worked as if they were statics problems! It seemed a miracle to me that anyone ever learned physics, and based on Quora questions that I see daily, it appears that almost no one ever did learn physics, except the lucky ones who made it through the nonsense of the elementary courses, figured things out, learned real physics at last from the more advanced courses, and became professional physicists.
