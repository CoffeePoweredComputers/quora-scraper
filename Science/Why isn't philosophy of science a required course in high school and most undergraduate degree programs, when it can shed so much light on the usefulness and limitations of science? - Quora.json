            "answer_text": "It sounds like why are not 5 year old kids married, and why are they not taught about contraception? The little-known fact is that the human is born with roughly 25% of the brain, and needs to grow for 25 years to get a fully formed brain. Philosophy requires a fully formed brain. It should not be attempted before someone is 25 years old. Do not expect a 10-year old boy to play cricket as well as MS Dhoni or Virat Kohli. A degree of maturity is needed. Most people do not have full brains, even if they have aged. Here is an example of what a mature thinker and an immature one will do: Start with the straight fact: every person needs food to stay alive, and more people need more food, say in proportion to their numbers. Thus 100 people need 100 times the food that 1 man needs.Next, no food can be grown without land (actually food can be grown without land, in aquaponic systems.) Land is a factor of production of food.The immature person\u2019s head doe snot include the idea that land is not sufficient to grow food, though it is necessary In addition to land, one needs labor to extract the food from the land. No labor, no food, even if the land is lying fallow and empty. (Remember, gathering the food is not possible without labor; catching the fish is not possible without he labor of the catcher). But the immature man thinks that the amount of land fixes the amount of food that can be produced to carry (keep) the number of people.A mature man knows that there is no such thing as a carrying capacity of land, because the amount of food depends on the number of laborers gathering/growing the food. The world has the same amount of land, forever fixed, but as more people worked on land, they got more food from the same land. This means that the land\u2019s carrying capacity is an absurd idea: nothing called carrying capacity exists.There are people who may be 75 years old, but who lack mature heads. The brain is there, but it remains unused, because it was not trained to think. People who cannot think that more people not only eat more food but also produce more food are the ones who will not be philosophers.",

            "answer_text": "Science is anything that can be measured. Philosophy is anything made up in human imagination. Right there you have a never-ending fight because human imagination does not like to be restricted in any way, not even the requirement to stick to measurable concepts. Example: Science is based on three postulates: Every phenomenon has a cause.Every phenomenon and its cause can be known and understood.All laws operate the same always and everywhere.Then scientists make up \u201cblack holes\u201d, violating all three postulates, and they consider that to be serious science. But getting back to the original question, US high schools don\u2019t even teach how to do well in US high schools. ",
