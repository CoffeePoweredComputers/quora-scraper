            "answer_text": "The difference between the two is that the citric acid has been reacted with an alkaline sodium salt (sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or other sodium based alkaline salt). This converts the acid to a sodium salt (sodium citrate). Note: citric acid is multifunctional and contains three carboxylic groups. You can neutralize one, two or three of the groups. Sodium citrate is when all three groups have been neutralized ",

            "answer_text": "The chemical structure of citric acid (a tribasic acid) is HOOCCH2.C(OH)COOH.CH2COOH. The tri-sodium salt of citric acid is commonly referred to as sodium citrate where all the carboxylic hydrogens have been replaced by sodium. The structure of sodium citrate is NaOOCCH2.C(OH)COONa.CH2COONa. Mono-sodium citrate and di-sodium citrate are also known where one and two carboxylic hydrogens respectively have been replaced by sodium. ",
