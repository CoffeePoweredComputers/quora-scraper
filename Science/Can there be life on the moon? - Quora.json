            "answer_text": "Why Is There No Life On The Moon? Without any atmosphere, or the ability to create one, the moon cannot provide the basic conditions for life to develop. When you stare up into the night sky, it\u2019s hard to miss the brightest object and our closest celestial neighbour \u2013 the moon. It has fascinated humans for thousands of years, was worshipped as a god in the past, and has inspired countless generations to wonder whether alien life may be waiting for us on our doorstep. However, with the advent of space travel, our 6 Apollo missions to the moon, and our improved ability to learn about the composition of celestial bodies from Earth, we now know that the moon cannot and never has supported life. The questions, therefore, is why does the moon contain no signs of life? What is the Moon? The moon is our planet\u2019s natural satellite, orbiting Earth every 27.3 days and rotating on its own axis every 27 days. Interestingly enough, this similarity in its rotation and orbit means that the same side of the moon always faces Earth, a phenomenon called synchronous rotation. The moon is roughly 27% the size of the Earth, with a diameter of 3,474 kilometers. There is some debate about how the moon was formed, but the prevailing theory is the giant-impact theory, which argues that in the early days of our planet\u2019s formation, before any life had developed, another planetary body the size of Mars crashed into the young Earth, jettisoning billions of tons of elemental material into the orbit around the planet. There was so much debris that gravity was able to form and pull it together, forming what we know today as the moon. Since that point, the Moon\u2019s orbit has regularized around our planet, so accurately that we base our calendar progression off its changing phases. However, while the moon often feels like another planet, a moon is very different than a planetary body. The most basic different is that a planet orbits a star, whereas a moon orbits a planet. Furthermore, in the case ofEarth and its moon, the composition of the planet is different. At the center of the Earth is a dense core of heavy metals, which creates a magnetic field and a strong gravitational pull, which enables the planet to retain an atmosphere. Without our atmosphere, none of us would be here today, nor would you be reading this article! Does the Moon have an atmosphere? As mentioned above, the moon does not have the same composition as the Earth, and while some of the elements present on the moon are the same, this is likely because of the moon\u2019s formation (the Giant-Impact Theory). In general, this different in composition means that the moon cannot have an atmosphere because it is not geologically active. Without the release or production of gases in the core of a planetary body or moon, an atmosphere would be unable to form \u2013 atmospheres don\u2019t happen spontaneously! Furthermore, even if those gases were to be produced or released, the low gravity of the moon would make it difficult to hold onto those molecules. For a molecule to be released into the emptiness of space, they need to exceed the escape velocity of the planet or moon. When the sun strikes these molecules, it energizes them, and if they are moving fast enough to overcome the pull of gravity, they will escape.  In the case of Earth\u2019s moon, any light molecules present there would be immediately energized by the sun, due to Earth\u2019s proximity to our star, and those molecules would escape into the emptiness of space, making the formation of an atmosphere next to impossible. That being said, some heavy molecules are present on the surface of the moon, forming what is commonly known as an exosphere. It is extremely low in density, trillions of times less concentrated than the atmospheric molecules on Earth, but heavy molecules can be found bouncing around the surface of the moon. This is far different than an atmosphere, but there are some molecules found on our orbiting neighbor. Is life impossible on the Moon? Without the presence of an atmosphere, there is no chance for the formation of more complex molecules that are required for life (as we know it). When astronomers peer at distant exoplanets and moons, they are primarily searching for signs of water, or the possibility that water once existed there. Our understanding of life is Earth-centric, and we know that water was integral in the development of life here. On the Moon, based on the history of its formation, its lack of an atmosphere and its classification as a \u201cdead\u201d rock, there is no feasible way for life to develop and prosper on the moon. This is not to say that life cannot survive on the moon, as many science fiction fans are hoping. Our technological advancements mean that we may someday be able to colonize the moon, although recent decades have seen our attention shift to the possibility of establishing a colony on Mars.  The only life that could survive on the moon (or anywhere else in the vacuum of empty space) is the tardigrade. Also known as the water bear, this microscopic organism has been found all over the world and has demonstrated remarkable hardiness to temperature and pressure extremes, as well as surviving without any water. To date, this is the only living organism that has been shown to survive in the vacuum of space, which is a combination of intense pressure, low temperature and high radiation from the sun\u2019s rays. A sample of tardigrades were placed on the outside of a shuttle that orbited the planet for 10 days and then re-entered the atmosphere. Shockingly, more than 60% of the tardigrades survived the experience, which has fascinated scientists ever since, leading to their better understanding of tardigrade\u2019s \u201cstasis\u201d or \u201cdessication\u201d strategy. Going into detail about what makes tardigrades so special is beyond the scope of this article, but when it comes to life potentially surviving on the moon, they are the only creatures who could do so \u2013 as far as we know!

            "answer_text": "Judging by the way the question is phrased I'd say the issue isn't just the zone the planet is in, but the host of other htings you need to make it livable. As Niranjan Daitbankar and Ernest Adams note, there's some basic ingredients you need for life. The moon has a few of them -- for example, there's a little water on the moon and certainly it orbits the sun at the right distance. But to have life you need at a minimum to retain an atmosphere, and you need to be able to have all kinds of complex chemical reactions. As far as anyone can tell water or some other solvent is necessary for those reactions to occur.  Carl Sagan in Cosmos proposed that water isn't the only solvent -- he uses sulfuric acid as an example (sulfuric acid actually stays liquid at a larger temperature range than water). But for any liquids at all to exist you need gas pressure of some kind or other. The moon hasn't got any of that, since its gravity was too weak to retain an atmosphere.  As Mr. Adams notes, a magnetic field is a big help if you want life because solar radiation breaks down complex molecules. That is, there's a whole sea of charged particles (mostly protons) that streams out from the sun. When those particles smack into molecules like DNA they alter them, sometimes breaking them up completely. The Magnetc field around the Earth traps those particles and keeps them away from us. The moon has no field, and this is why solar and ocosmic ray radiation is a hazard for astronauts who go there or plan to be there longer than a few days.  I should add that Mars is in the habitable zone too (barely) and it has no magnetic field to speak of either. That's one reason most of its atmosphere literally blew away.  Now, it is certainly possible to have a metabolism absent liquids. And it's even possible that you could develop a kind of life that involved slow reactions with crystalline structures, made of molecules that are much less vulnerable to radiation and don't need oxygen - perhaps the reactions are powered by the chemical changes wrought by sunlight (one reason the moon has dark spots is \"space weathering\" where certain metals turn black in the sun). But it wouldn't be anything like what we have on Earth. We might not even recognize it as alive. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people suspect the moon once had large quantities of water and atmosphere, but it was eventually lost do to low gravity, and the earth pulling it away, no magnetic field, and many various factors which may have affected the moon. If there was water at one point on the moon, there could have been primitive life on it. However in it\u2019s current state, the moon cannot support any forms of known life forms. It\u2019s temperature changes are super extreme between day and night, It\u2019s constantly bombarded by solar flairs, cosmic particles, cosmic rays, and radiation; and harbors only microscopic amounts of water contained in the rocks. Essentially all life sustaining elements are missing from the moon, and there\u2019s no protection from the radiation of the sun and space. If there is life on the moon, it would probably be near some ice or water deposits below the surface well beyond our site or ability to scan. If there was ever microscopic life on the moon, it would be really hard to find fossils of it, because the moon was not only extremely volcanic ages ago, but it was heavily bombarded by impacting meteors and comets which would have destroyed and eroded any traces of life on the moon, including any possibles which might have been left in the stone.

            "answer_text": "Currently, there is absolutely no chance that there is any kind of life on the moon whatsoever. There are no alien colonies. There are no ancient ghost colonies of either humans from earth or from any other planets. There are no ruins of building sticking out of craters. There is nothing there. It is a host for fantasies. It is a place for the imagination of science fiction writers. It is a black hole into which deceitful governments shovel cash. Government spending can spur the economy. Until recently, the communist government of China spent their cash on building infra structure, and great modern cities. The people of China seem to have benefited with at least better housing. The darling of the United States is aerospace. The spin off is a great university system which attracts people from the world over. For the American people, to absorb the graduates, we have high tech. A huge aerospace industry of technocrats with security clearances has avoided the creation of a restless questioning intelligentsia. So the moon is probably a plasma. It may be a physical body close to earth somehow hovering in the electric universe. It is nothing that our not so sovereign minds are allowed to conceive. (In all the sci-fi in all the world, in all history, never has there been a flat earth sci-fi movie, or comic, or theme park). But the moon is nothing anyone can walk upon. The moon is nothing anyone has ever walked upon. The better question is \u201cwhat is the life of the moon?\u201d That is that the moon exists as a cash cow for military, and that is the cow which jumps over the moon. ",

            "answer_text": "We have a few issues with living on the moon. Firstly, and perhaps the most obvious problem; there\u2019s no air on the moon. Not to mention the sad excuse of gravity that the moon possesses. The moon also has a laughable atmosphere, causing temperatures to swing from 253 degrees, to negative 387 degrees Fahrenheit in a single day. And since there\u2019s no atmosphere, the sun\u2019s UV rays would cut through us with little resistance. Something else that is pretty nice to have is water. The moon has no water. Water is obviously essential in order for there to be life on a planet. And it\u2019d required in order to grow food on the lunar surface. For water to be transferred to the moon, a space agency would have to pay a considerable sum of money, time after time. Then there\u2019s the tiny problem of regolith; which is essentially the (primarily) dust that covers the moon\u2019s 40-mile-thick lunar crust, which, by the way, is also covered in boulders and rocks. The moons jagged and dangerous crust isn\u2019t exactly optimal for humans or any machinery that we take with us. Not to mention how long it takes to build infrastructure, and how often it doesn\u2019t even work. All this happening on a deserted rock that orbits our planet also is not going to be cheap. Mars is a much better suitor for sustaining human life, but that\u2019s for another answer. For now, we can just dream\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "As far as we know, no, the Moon has never, does not, and will never support any life. Not naturally, without technological help (i.e. bring a space suit). That is, disregarding any science fiction and speculation about strange alien lifeforms that we don\u2019t know if they can even exist. The moon does not have an atmosphere and no water. Meaning: First of all obviously there is no air to breath, and nothing to drink. Which makes it impossible for humans or pretty much any life form that we know, to stay there longer.There is no protection from solar UV-radiation or other harmful space radiation such as Gamma radiation.Also, no protection from meteorites; the Earth atmosphere protects us from smaller meteorites; which are the most numerous.There is no \u2018insulation\u2019, meaning it will be sizzling hot during the \u2018day\u2019 (half of a synodic month, so 14.75 earth days) and freezing cold during the \u2018night\u2019; the other 14.75 earth days of the synodic month.Because of the above reasons, and also because there is no \u2018soil\u2019 (just the fine rock dust called regolith) there is also no plant or animal life possible, meaning there won\u2019t be anything to eat. Sure, you could either bring all the food in from Earth (terribly expensive; the logistic lines are a nightmare, not even talking about traffic jams) or you could build some sort of huge garden dome, create some sort of soil and build a huge farming ecosystem on that and power it with energy from the Sun. But still, also for your animals and plants there won\u2019t be anything to breathe. Creating oxygen (O2), carbondioxide (CO2) for your plants, and I guess you will also need a lot of nitrogen (N2) like on Earth, or everybody will die of oxygen-poisoning, will be incredibly expensive. You would need chemical processing plants to build this air, that is, if you find an answer to where you\u2019re going to get the building blocks from. What are you going to create O2, CO2 and N2 from? There is nothing on the Moon that we know of that you can extract these chemicals from in sufficiant quantities. So again, you\u2019ll probably have to bring the air itself or the building blocks in from Earth, which is incredibly expensive. If you succeed in tackling all of that: does the Moon then support life? Or does the giant chemical-organic-housing complex that you built support life? And the question remains: why would you want to live there? There aren\u2019t really any benefits (unless you really love solitude, starry black skies, and living in a giant air sealed city surrounded by a featureless grey dusty landscape) that are worth all these incredibly expensive investments.

            "answer_text": "Yes, lunar settlement will likely become possible with technology developed in the next 100 years. The main problem specifically on the moon is silicate glass. The moon's entire surface is coated in sharp silicate glass. This is because of the erosion from all the micro-meteorite impacts that have occurred on the moon over the years. There is no atmospheric or water erosion to soften the edges of these glass particles so they are very sharp and very small. When the Apollo astronauts went ro the moon from 1969\u20131972 they had to keep their spacesuits on while sleeping in the Lunar Lander to prevent breathung in any of the dusty particles their space suits were covered with into their lungs. This meant they were limited to living inside their space suits which severely limited the amount of oxygen, food, and water available to them. Apollo 17, the longest amount of time humans lived on the moon for, was only 75 hours long. This problem coupd be solved by engineering machines that could remove all of the dust particles from astronauts suits before they entered into living structures. The other problems with living on the moon would be building and maintaining habitats that provide for every need of the astronauts for life without being supplied from Earth while protecting them from cosmic radiation. This involves making basically a self contained micro ecosystem on the moon, like on Earth everything would have to be recycled but in a much smaller space, realistically smaller anf much less massive than many buildings on Earth. Rocketing building parts to the moon is so prohibitively expensive that the buildings would have to be made on the moon from the lunar silicate glass, which can be made into a kind of concrete, so the silicate glass being there is also helpful. The lunar habitats would have to be airtight to maintain Earth's atmospheric pressure in the vacuum of space. Even more importantly than this they would have to protect the astronauts from solar radiation. We are protected from solar radiation on Earth because of the Earth's magnetosphere, but this does not reach out to the moon (except very rarely in maybe one spot for a very short period of time). The Apollo missions had to be limited to less than 14 days in part because any exposure much longer than that to radiation outside of Earth's magnetosphere would have been fatal, even with their space suits on. About 3 feet of lunar concrete over the habitat would be necessary to shelter the lunar inhabitants from the radiation. In most places on the moon additional technological advancements would be needed to adequately recycle water and oxygen. On the International Space Station water and oxygen are already recycled, but very inefficiently. Most of the oxygen that the astronauts breathe has to be sent up in rockets. The water recycling is much closer to the efficiency needed but additional improvements are still needed. There is some water ice particularly near the Moon's South Pole that could be used for water and oxygen by converting it into oxygen and hydrogen through electrolysis which requires an electricity supply such as from solar panels. This could also be used to create rocket fuel. Food recyclation would be the most difficult, on Earth it typically takes about 1/3 of an acre of land to feed 1 person, so this would obviously have to be reduced on the moon. There are some hydroponic food habitats on the Earth in developement that are nearly 10 times as efficient as an average acre of crops particularly when combined with insect farming and aquaponics which means structures as little as 2000 sq ft (186 sq m) might feed a person on the moon year round. The plants could also help recycle water and oxygen. Given the high amount of radiation on the moon the plants would have to be grown in the lunar habitat under 3 feet of lunar concrete, which means they would either rely on periscopic windows for sunlight or electric UV lights using electricity from solar panels like is done in the ISS. The lunar night is 2 weeks long so if grown using periscopic windows plants would have to be genetically modified to be compatible with the Moon's diurnal cycles. Batteries could be used to store electric energy during the lunar day to provide it to the lunar habitats during the lunar night. Another one of the problems on the moon is tge extreme temperatures there. Temperatures range from 250 degrees Fahrenheit during the day to -286 degrees Fahrenheit during the night. The Apollo astronauts visited the moon during the lunar morning when the lunar ground was still cold. This mean that the water in the skin of their suits was able to transfer the heat from the sun from the suits so that the astronauts did not overheat. If the sun had set while the Apollo astronauts were on one of their EVAs with the lunar buggies several miles from the Lunar Lander they almist certainly would have died from hypothermia as their space suits did not provide adequate protection from -286 F cold. If astronauts were going to live on the moon even just for a full Lunar day or about 28 Earths they would need to protect themselves from these extreme temperarures. -286 F makes most materials including steels very brittle as you can see from putting things in liquid nitrogen. In my material science engineering class I observed that aluminum retains ductility far better than steel does at these colder temperatures so there are some material options at these colder temperatures but not many. Ultimately astronauts would want to live at least 10 feet (3m) underground where the lunar temperatures are a fairly consistent -30 F (-34 C). This is cold, but not as cold as the conditions scientists and others who live in the interior of Antarctica experience. The lunar habitat would be buried anyway to protect from radiation so this kills two birds with one stone. The lunar habitat would still need to be heated, this could be done using electricity from solar panels which of course would be stored in batteries to be used during the lunar night. The lunar habitat could also be surrounded by a pool of water that retain some of this heat. Finally, the Moon has 1/6 the gravity as the Earth does. No matter how much exercise astronauts have done on the International Space System this has been shown to have increasingly harmful effects on humans in the long run. In order for humans to live on the moon they would need to have artificial gravity, such as that provided by centrifugal acceleration. This has been done before in space for the Gemini 4 orbit in 1967 when two Gemini capsules were tethered to each other so they could slighly spin. Recently it has been done on the ISS with experiments on mice in a centrifuge. The mice lived healthy lives after the experiment without the bone loss and other negative effects of microgravity. On the Moon the lunar habitats would have to be centrifuges at least 10 m in radius and contained underneath a lunar concrete dome with solar panels on the lunar surface providing the electricity to the motors that would keep the centrufuge spinning at the necessary speed for artificial Earth gravity. The astronauts would enter and exit through a rod in the middle of the centrifuge, climbing up to the top above the dome where they would exit onto the lunar surface. Developing and combining all of these technologies will make the first lunar settlement a reality maybe by the end of the 21st century. Once we have settled the moon we can settle pretty much anywhere we want as the moon is not much more habitable than the vacuum of space. Many of these technological innovations will probably be used on the first interstellar spacecraft which could take generations to reach the stars. Clearly it can be seen that lunar settlement is not about the survival of the human species, as Elon Musk argues for Mars colonization, if humans can live on the moon it is very unlikely that anything will happen on the Earth that would make it uninhabitable to us. Living on the moon would be very fun though and it should make the future pretty exciting for us humans. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are several reasons to choose from\u2026 Maybe because the lack of atmosphere doesn't only making ot impossible to breath, but also lowering the boiling point of water to- or below 0\u00b0C. This means a pressurized suit must be weared all times just to avoid instant and painful death.Another good reason would be temperature. Normally it is like -170\u00b0C there which means a heated suit must be weared all times just to avoid instant and painful death.The lack of a magnetic field is also worth mentioning. It means no shielding from cosmic radiation, therefore staying on the surface of the Moon is somewhat lile staying in a microwave oven. Which means astronauts must spend most of their time behind radiation shielding just to avoid slow and painful death.But it could be the bone density reduction caused be the lower gravity which renders people incapable to return to Earth after a certain time spent on the Moon.\u201cWe need to carry food, oxygen and water from Earth. There is a limit to how much we carry.\u201d - (Padmanabh Sathe)(Feel free to add your own reason in the comments.) ",

            "answer_text": "As you didn't ask about any moon in particular I will use Earths moon as the example for this discussion. The moon occasionally has everything you would need to host life of some sort or another. We know it has a partial atmosphere which equates to about a tenth of that of the Earth. There have been plenty of recordings of dust clouds and precipitation which means it must have some sort of wind or moving air other than that of the typical vacuum. This movement of air or wind would explain the shallow depth to most of the craters found around the moon. Once an impact is made with the surface then the dust is carried into the crater by this lunar wind and permanently deposited. References Dust Cloud Around the Moon Explained (Infographic)Lopsided Cloud of Dust Discovered Around the MoonNeil Armstrong once gave a moon rock to Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees. After Armstrong and Drees\u2019 death a museum acquired the rock from the prime minister\u2019s private e collection and decided to test its authenticity. The results were shocking as it was found to be nothing but petrified wood. Some would write this off as being a fake but I unfortunately know otherwise. The moon is filled with ancient forests and reminence of giant trees scattered about its surface.  If you compare craters and old trees it's very easy to spot the differences. References \u2018Moon rock\u2019 in museum is just petrified woodAlthough us humans look forward to breathing insects and many other organisms don't require Oxygen to live. The United States launched Biosatellite I in 1966 and Biosatellite I/II in 1967 with fruit flies, parasitic wasps, flour beetles and frog eggs, along with bacteria, amoebae, plants and fungi. These organisms are being hosted in an inflatable satellites environment with an atmosphere A LOT like the moon. The organisms are still alive and well today floating around in space.

Life first started on the earth because of water and if no water we can imagine no life. Air is also required to breathe and no air is on the moon or we can say that oxygen is required by human beings to breathe is not enough on the moon for the survival. Moreover the temperature on the moon is not suitable for the life to exist. Other than these basic needs there are more reasons because of which life is not possible on the moon such as the angle at which the moon is tilted, its speed of revolution around the sun, speed of its rotation around its own axis and distance from the sun etc. Earth is the only planet that fulfills all these conditions to make life possible whereas many of these conditions are not fulfilled by the moon and hence there is no life. But nowadays a question arises that whether aliens also needs the above mentioned conditions. It is possible that they can live without air, water and atmosphere and can make life possible but still no such alien or civilization is found yet on the moon. ",

The question got merged with a totally different one regarding THE Moon, aka Luna, Earth\u2019s moon. I just clicked \u201cundo merge\u201d, let\u2019s see what happens. So there\u2019s no reason why one couldn\u2019t. Being a moon is not a physical property, it\u2019s only topology. If a celestial object orbits a star or stars (or even a black hole), it\u2019s called a planet. If the object orbits a planet, then it\u2019s called a moon. There\u2019s no connection between the name and physical properties like size or if it\u2019s habitable or not. Jupiter\u2019s largest moon, Ganymede is larger than Mercury, for example. Definitely larger than Pluto, but poor Pluto is not a planet anymore due to its small size. So there\u2019s nothing preventing moons to have conditions and circumstances that allow life to form. Sci-fi dealt with this kind of situation too. In Isaac Asimov\u2019s Nemesis, it even helps that it\u2019s a moon, not a planet. The planet is too close to a brown dwarf, so it\u2019s tidally locked. Its moon, however, is tidally locked to the planet, so it gets a day-night cycle, preventing one side from heating up and the other to cool down too much. ",

Of course life on earth wouldn't have been here without earth being in the habitable zone, but even if there was no atmosphere, no oxygen, no liquid water, no moderate temperature, life wouldn't emerge. These are important factors, in fact just as important as a planet being in the habitable zone. On Moon, there is no atmosphere because of lack of a gravity as strong as on earth. Furthermore, there is no liquid water. The temperature on moon is not as moderate as it is on earth. Another important reason of emergence of life on earth, is the presence of carbon and silicon compounds in its surface. Organic matter was formed mostly from carbon, silicon and water, which are present on earth in abundance. On moon, these are not present. Although it can be debated that the conditions on earth cannot be the only conditions where life can emerge, we haven't found life emerging when such conditions are not met. Hence one could argue that if earth-like conditions are not met, life cannot emerge. ",

Micro-meteoroids pelt the craggy surface. And since there\u2019s no atmosphere, the sun\u2019s UV rays would slice through us like a hot butter knife. But if you want to live there:- According to Dr. Paul Spudis of Houston\u2019s Lunar and Planetary Institute. There could be billions of metric tons of water hidden in the Moon. And that water is vital, just as it is on Earth. It\u2019s a galactic Swiss Army knife. \u201cYou can drink it, use it to shield you from cosmic radiation, [use it in] food and sanitation, and crack it into oxygen to breathe,\u201d he says.\u201d In the form of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, it is the most powerful chemical rocket propellant known.\u201d To survive anywhere, of course we need water and air. On the Moon, the trick is where and how to get it.Regolith, ( lunar dirt) is 42 percent oxygen. If we can mine regolith of its oxygen and combine it with hydrogen, there\u2019s our water ticket. We can also use that oxygen to, you know, breathe. And we can also use it in rocket fuel. (That\u2019s a complex task, however, that involves heating that regolith to 900 degrees Celsius.) Air and water aside, some believe that we can inhabit the Moon the same way our ancient ancestors inhabited Earth for millennia. Like Earth, the Moon has a ton of caves. Could the same principle work on the moon? A company called Astrobotic wants to send rovers to the moon to scope out those cave networks\u2014those caves that could protect humans from all that radiation and raining meteorites.

Astronauts from the Apollo 12 mission brought back parts of Surveyor 3, which, when examined on earth, held still viable Earthly bacteria within it. So it is possible that bacteria from earth are still living on the moon in various hardware (and other things like bags of poop) we left on the moon. On the other hand samples of Lunar material brought back have shown to be devoid of life. Also life may (but most likely not) exist deep underground - on Earth scientists have found traces of life from 12 miles underground\u2026therefor is it possible ( not validated) that life may exist miles under the lunar surface, however this life would be fairly small and probably not more complex then nematodes. If such life did exist it would likely be a case of a large asteroid blasting some of these deep dwelling life from the Earth to the Moon. Highly unlikely but not zero chance.  ",

If all that were to be done, then you could live on the moon, provided you could convince the folks on earth that you were worth it to send up there. But that\u2019s an amazing amount of money. Far simpler would be to send bots up to the moon that could be remotely operated. Apart from the adventure of having apes on the moon, anything that people could do there could be done for less with robots, maybe with a small crew of engineers to help with set-up and then head home while the bots do their thing. There\u2019s a lot of space right here on earth, so I think that we\u2019re going to be doing things remotely for a while: if we do them at all that is. ",

Just recently, it was reported that Russian cosmonauts on the International Space Station discovered bacteria on the outside of the station. It is unclear whether or not the bacteria was actually living out there, but if bacteria can survive on the outside of an orbiting space station, then the prospects of them surviving inside the Moon isn\u2019t so bad. Generally, bacteria need liquid water at least some of the time to survive. There is no liquid water on the surface of the Moon, but conditions underground should allow for liquid water to exist at least sometimes in certain areas. This would be in areas where the ground temperature rises to above 0 Celsius during the lunar \u201cday.\u201d On the surface, water would evaporate (really sublimate) at that temperature, but underground, it could be trapped and achieve a high enough pressure to form liquid water. To determine if there is life in the Moon, we would need to dig down into the ground in locations that the temperature is appropriate for liquid water to form. We haven\u2019t done that yet, but it should be possible on future Moon missions. If it turns out that there is life in the Moon, it would be a monumental discovery. If life can exist there, then it could also possibly exist in Mars, asteroids, comets, and other moons throughout the solar system. It could turn out that life in space is actually abundant. ",

So it\u2019s not only plausible that life exists there, it actually has. Even if it was imported for a brief time. Considering there is already a source of energy (the sun), all you really need is water, and life of bacterial grade could survive. Depending on how you define what life is, it may not really be necessary for those two things. Life of microbial size can thrive in a wide variety of alternate environments to those that you and I find pleasing. If you are wondering why there is no life more like what we have here on Earth; big, visible, mobile, thinking animals\u2026 The reason there is no life on the Moon is simply that the conditions are not right. All of the things we have here like, stable atmosphere, stable temperatures, reliable energy sources, water in a liquid state, etc\u2026 Those conditions don\u2019t exist on the Moon.

The ions present in the top layers of the atmosphere absorb these radiations thus protecting any life form on Earth. Secondly, water. Life is believed to have originated in water. And without water there could be no life on Earth. The atmosphere helped control the temperatures on Earth for micro organisms to flourish. And water cycle created on Earth due to the perfect condition that Earth being at the right distance from the Sun, helped sustain life forms on Earth. The moon lacks in both these aspects. So there is no life on moon. We still could be wrong. No one has actually proved there is no life on moon. So we've wait and watch until someone proves it. ",

Even if you only count those of about the same size (or larger) than our moon, then there a dozens of them in our solar System.In all likelihood uncounted numbers in the universe.---However, there are some Problems with life on moons, at least in our system.Moons are by definition smaller than planets.Usually much smaller (OUR moon is the exception, not the rule).That means that moons usually do neither have an atmosphere, nor water or other fluids in the form of oceans on the surface, except if they are frigging cold.The only moon with a significant atmosphere (at 1.5 Earth pressure, even thicker than ours, but 98% is nitrogen, and most of the rest argon) is Titan, orbiting around Saturn. So in our System, there MIGHT be life as we know it in sub-surface oceans IN moons, especially in the Jovian moon Europa. But this is not proven. ",

            "answer_text": "Like which life are you talking about? An alien life or humans going from earth to moon (astronauts) If you're talking about the latter, yes of course people have been to the Moon. As one needs all the training and oxygen supply and protective space suits and packed foods and all the necessities. But if you're talking about an alien life, I believe it is not possible. I call my theory, \u201cthe oxy-life theory\" by which I mean that any place which has oxygen also has life and any place which doesn't have O2 is completely desolate and lifeless. I don't think that there is life possible without oxygen and H2O (water). Now you might argue that the Moon has water but before going there let me ask you, is the presence of water an evidence of oxygen? Well not exactly. It is the evidence that oxygen once used to exist but may be because of an explosion with hydrogen all the then present oxygen got converted to water or mixed with other gases and elements. So, I don't support the idea of an alien life. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many reasons why there is no life on the Moon. Here\u2019s why: First of all, let\u2019s talk about temperature. Simple as it is, the Moon can be harshy cold, and unbearably hot. Temperatures can drop as low as -233 Degrees Celsius. Moreover, since it has no real atmosphere, the temperatures can be as hot as they are cold.Secondly, there is no magnetic field. This means that the moon is completely exposed to radiation from the sun, and outer space.Thirdly, something essential for life is water. Although there is some water to be found on the moon, it is not enough for us to live on.Fourthly, oxygen. The moon lacks water and oxygen. Two essential things for there to be life on the moon.The fifth reason would be gravity. The moon\u2019s gravity is exactly 1/6 that of Earth, gravity which human bodies are not used to, or anyone for that matter.There are many more reasons, these are the most basic ones. Hope I helped.

Wells wrote his book First Men in the Moon, about a pair of late 19th century British explorers who found a material, called Cavorite, that could block gravity, and used it to take a trip to the Moon, the possibility of life there, however faint, still existed. When our travellers reached the moon, they found a whole race of beings called Selenites living beneath the surface. Ironically, just as the first Apollo astronauts were quarantined after returning from the journey because of fear they had picked up a strange bug on the moon, one of the earthmen in Wells story happened to have a cold, which he gave to the Selenites, who had no resistence to it. So even if there had been life on the moon before, there wasn't afterwards. ",

The moon does not have the same composition as earth, while some of the elements present are same. Furthermore, even if those gases were to be produced the low gravity of the moon would make it difficult to hold onto those molecules. In the case of moon, any light molecules present there would be immediately energized by the sun, due to earth's proximity and these molucules would escape into the emptiness of space, making the formarion of atmosphere next to impossible. Without the presence of an atmosphere there is no change for the formation of more complex molucules that are required for life on moon. ",

Not having atmosphere means that Moon has no \u201cblanket\u201d isolating it from emptiness of space. So, it is baked during day and frozen at nighttime. Moreover, its single day lasts a month, so baking and freezing it thorough. All this means there is no liquid water, either - there probably is some ice in shady places around poles, brought by cometary impacts. We might be able to use it when we finally get around to return to our satellite, but, as far as we know, it is not useful for \u201cunaided\u201d life.

Study of the camera on return to Earth revealed[1]that spores of a common Earth bacterium, Streptococcus mitis, had hitched a ride to the Moon on Surveyor 3 and survived there three years in the vacuum, radiation, and alternating cold and heat of the Lunar surface. Learning that even years of exposure did not kill bacteria spurred greater efforts to sterilize probes to places with possible native life, like Mars and Europa, to prevent scientists from accidentally \"discovering\" Earth life on other worlds. But there were a number of probes launched to the Moon in the 1960s, before space programs were very careful with sterilizing spaceships. So there are probably a few dormant  bacteria still on the Moon today, not growing, but in hibernation. As for native life, though, we're pretty sure the Moon's sterile.

But it is wildly economically unfeasible. The cost would be huge and gain us very little. There are no commercially viable resources on the moon. MacDonald has the lunar inhabitants mining deuterium but it relies on the idea that fusion becomes the main source of energy on earth and various technologies to make transportation can also be developed. Whether this could ever be an economic reality is doubtful. ",

Considering they can survive the radiation, temperatures and pressures, they could cling to life on the organic molecules present in the dust and that which rains down on the moon. Over time their metabolisms would increase due to mutations, so they wouldn't just be lying on their sides barely alive. Eventually you would have something that could walk around and form colonies. There is every reason to think there is life on the moon. After its formation it was so geologically active it had an atmosphere twice as thick as present day Mars, which is considered sufficient for life to survive. There is far more water on the Moon than we believe, with one probe finding what appeared to be a river. It is likely there is a great del of life beneath the surface, with possible microbes on the surface. There is also every reason to think the tardigrades could survive and form functional colonies on the Moon. ",

To me if I was a betting man I would always bet on life. Life always finds a way to survive and to procreate. As far as life developing on the moon I would say no, any life found there would probably be from some cross contamination with something on a man made object or even on an asteroid from another planet. On earth we have these organisms called poly-extremophiles which are capable of surviving in the most inhospitable environments. One in particular, a bacteria called Deinococcus radiodurans is extremely resistant to high levels of ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, desiccation, electrophilic and oxidizing chemicals. It is even able to repair its own DNA. If something like this was transferred to the moon I believe it would have a high likelihood of survivability. ",

The Moon has a deep and abiding need for water and she is one of the three water signs: Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio. Actually much of the Moon's water is now found on Earth, and will be transferred back to Her. But most curious is the disposition of her children from there to the Earth. ",

The moon also has a very weak magnetic field, so there is a high risk from solar radiation, this makes it difficult for life to be sustainable. Additionally, the dust on the surface of the moon is very fine and breathing it in can be fatal to life forms that we are familiar with. ",

Properly designed LED plant grow lights that emit only in frequencies plants can use. Grow light - Photosynthetic efficiency - Wikipedia For actual sunlight, where only 45% of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range, the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11%. So if using LED grow lights restricted to frequencies the plants can use, the theoretical efficency is .11/.45 = 24.44%, about 10 times what the other fellow claimed, and we can optimum light intensity and dark-light cycles.
