            "answer_text": "The microbiota in a new born baby comes from the mother's vagina during the course of child birth. This is something we were taught during our biology classes. However, after reading this question, I took to google and found a very interesting report Baby\u2019s first gut bacteria may come from mum\u2019s mouthThe placenta is held responsible for the first microflora and interstingly, it comes from mother's mouth!!! So we have a new concept that the origin of microflora is from the mother's mouth (indirectly though!).Hope that answers your question! ",

Viruses and bacteria initially originate outside the body (in air, in water or other liquids, and on contact surfaces), then enter the body and attempt to set up opportunistic colonies inside. ",
