            "answer_text": "My answer will be a bit different from others, and to simplify, I am going to consider two hydrogen atoms. The argument is similar for larger atoms, but it gets a little more complicated as the quantum number n increases, in part because ether are more electrons present. We start with the premise that there is wave particle duality, and that the final motion is determined by the requirements to comply with a wave, or a wave function for those who do not like waves. The point is, whatever it is, it is a solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and behaves like a wave. (I happen to support the concept that there is a wave, which makes the following easier, but what follows still applies as long as the function hs the characteristics of a wave.) Consider the 1s wave. If you view the solution, you may notice there are no nodes in it, and the wave falls off smoothly to zero at infinity, which you can consider as the only node. Think about waves, and ask yourself, how many nodes in a period? The answer is two, one node to either start or end the period and the other to separate the crest from the trough. The usual representation of the 1s orbital shows either a crest or a trough, but not both. Accordingly, the actual period is two cycles, and since motion in a central field has two degrees of freedom, there is a quantum of action to each degree of freedom. This also comes from quantised classical mechanics, see Schiller Phys. Rev. 125, 1100, (1962) for a more significant explanation. The reason why electrons pair is now obvious: provided there is a phase difference of \u03c0, the wave can produce a crest and a trough in one cycle - a non-spin version of the Exclusion Principle. (The reason the spins are opposite is actually exactly the same - the magnetic interactions require a wave function of their own, and there has to be a phase difference of \u03c0). Caveat: Those who believe in the state vector formalism and in particular those who believe in the Schr\u00f6dinger cat will not like that because I have factorised the state. If you accept that, then you can get the bond length and bond energy of hydrogen simply by mental arithmetic, or at worst, with a pencil and paper. Details of that in my ebook, \u201cGuidance Waves\u201d. However, the answer to your question is, electrons can pair because that permits a wave with a crest and a trough in one \u201ccycle\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Josh Sinanan. Here is an attempt to list some of the principles at work. Sharing of electrons (covalent bonds) can not be explained by classical physics - it is a quantum mechanical QM phenomenon.When asking a why question, you are asking to invoke the principle of causality in QM. Two events A & B may be causally related only if event A happens before event B and their separation in space-time is such that light has enough time to travel from A to B (or rather more precisely, information - since information is capped at the speed of light; unless some of the particles in event A and event B are Quantum Entangled.)There gets a point at which it is easier to answer the question how, rather than why - especially with me, since I do not fully comprehend bonding; So I will be frequently using this poetic license ;-)A system will try to get to the least energy state, or ground state - one which is most stable an with the least potential energy, releasing energy in the process.So what is it about a covalent bond between two atoms that makes it a lower energy state - than two independent atoms? There are two positively charged neucleii and negatively charged electrons involved in the bond formation. There is electrostatic attraction and repulsion between these charged particles. The total potential energy of the molecule complex is lower after bond formation. That energy would be imparted to the electrons as kinetic energy. The electrons would settle down into the lowest orbital and expelling the kinetic energy out into photons. For a bond to form there may be also be barrier energy to overcome initially. The balance between the barrier energy and expelled energy will dictate whether the reaction is spontaneous, or forced, endothermic or exothermic. In the S-block and P-block elements in the periodic table, the valence electrons[1][2][3]are the ones that are furthest out, and that have the highest energy (compared to the other electrons in that atom.) Among these, covalent bonds are generally formed among Hydrogen (from the group 1) and groups 14\u201317 (Carbon-Fluorine). These elements have valence electrons in their S & P sub-shells.  Augmented Lewis diagram for H, C & O:  Orbital diagram for Fluorine:  Diagram for Fluorine atom representing valence electrons, and one of two noble gas configurations (He & Ne) it could try to get in to.  There are constraints in spacetime that discourage two particles from occupying the same spot at the same time. Essentially there are quantum fields (roughly one for each particle in the Standard Model) that pervade spacetime. Within the electron quantum field, two electrons may occupy the same space (same shell, subshell and orbital with an atom or molecule) only if they have a different spin - as dictated by Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle. This is true of other fermions like protons & neutrons as well which are composite particles with half integer spin - but that is beyond the scope of this article.For the bond to occur, the two electrons are in a shared orbital, and hence have to have opposite spins. These two electrons started out in their individual atoms with spins that had no relationship to one another - specifically when it came to their spins. During the formation of the covalent bond, the electrons get quantumly entangled. This event actually causes information (about the spin) which was originally localized to each of the single electrons, to now be smeared across the two electrons. Information entropy has now gone up. And the electron pair is now entangled for eternity. This itself is a thermodynamically more stable state.Energy released is generally in the suboptical range - microwaves.The pair of electrons within (each) covalent bond are in a new orbital - this is an overlapping electron cloud (between the orbital of the two electron orbitals around the original unbonded atoms.) The shape of an orbital is the probabilistic distribution electron locations in 3-d of a wave function representing excitation in the electron QM field (that behaves like a standing wave.)Footnotes[1] Valence electron[2] Counting valence electrons for main group elements[3] How to Find Valence Electrons",
