            "answer_text": "Something that is melting is actually burning. Ice melts in water, what does it all mean? With a thermal bombarding of neutron in atmosphere Carbon consecutively changes into Nitrogen. There are certain magicians around us but we are used to see them everyday, we do not value too much about their art. During photosynthesis plants capture Chlorine from sunlight, Nitrogen from atmosphere...Water through its root.Finally they produce Oxygen. The temprature of Oxygen is minus 318 degree Fahrenheit. Indeed is a more cool substance than Ice. Ozone is an Isotope of Oxygen. O3... It is a known Isotope. Whether Oxygen could appear in dark energy as forming another Isotope bonding like O7, O9, O21, O115 or not is beyond the imagination of humans. Here we study only about heat, we had been never taught about coldness. The complete absence of heat is cold. You boil water above 100 degree C, It never goes up. There is something called specific heat. An additional hidden heat that sits in water boiling above its boiling point. You have to autogrant this fact Ozone layer, which was an umbrella to penetrating hazardous ultra-violet rays was a more cooler substance than Ice we are encountering here. It was a superb known coolent. Ice is water, It is widely accepted thing but somewhere it is a wrong self granted assumption. Why? All fruits have sucrose in them, sacranization is a process..where sucrose splits in one atom of fractose and one atom of glucose. Structural formula to glucose and fractose is known. But structural formula of Sucrose is a completely unknown thing to anyone. Ice is water, Ice can be broken or melt into water. It contains water in it. Like sucrose has one atom of glucose and one atom of fractose. Does it have water as H3O18 form? the process to freeze water into Ice is completely known. Cool Ammonia turns the thick layer of water into Ice, the process of airation in cooler breaks an atom of Oxygen from water. Water coolers air carries more Oxygen relative to Air Conditioners. At O degree celcius, 32 degree Fahrenheit water turns into Ice, into a complex solid structure. Which very like wood, bargains with water and try to convince it. It is able to break a human skull, seems to be a hard substance but is hiding a very cool dark energy in itself. It is lighter than water. Check the fact and allow to float it over your heating surface. The normal water at 25 degree celcius, checkout for claimed fact and figure out Indeed is a dark energy having less than -318 degree Fahrenheit hidden in it. 25 degree is a big temprature to burn it in few minutes. In the case of Glaciers, Few years, Few months. In Heat energy all molecules as usual, they move from higher temprature to lower temprature point. Everything that water could burn and melt down into basic elements. According to my modern hypothesis shall float over its surface. Now banana has hidden camphor and other cellulose elements in it. It is in the shape of a canoe. Archimidies upthrust law also tries to balance the body. Surface tension could also be a supportive reason to let the body float but in case of Ice, there is consecutive exchange of energy. Ice is a dissolving and burning body like camphor in water. Freeze my final hypothesis, at 25 degree celcius, water couldn't burn steel but it was quite capable to break the bondings of Oxygen hiding in it as an Isotope below than -318 degree Fahrenheit. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that ice is less dense than water. The question then becomes: Why is ice, which is water in solid form, lighter than water in its liquid form? Something must be happening to water when it freezes. One molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, or H2O. The hydrogen atom is slightly positive, and the oxygen atom is slightly negative. At room temperature, these water molecules are loosely linked and free to move around easily, which is what defines the liquid state of matter. Once the temperature hits 32\u00b0F, or 0\u00b0C, the molecules line up in a rigid six-sided honeycomb structure, with water molecules\u2014the more positively charged hydrogen attracting the more positively charged hydrogen\u2014linking up with each other in a process called hydrogen bonding. This causes the molecules to move more slowly and take up more space. You have ice. Because the same weight or mass now takes up more space, it is less dense and floats on water. We can put salt on ice to melt it. Salt is sodium chloride, or NaCl. (Technically, most salt for sidewalks is potassium chloride, or KCl, but the chemical process works the same way.) The sodium atom in a salt molecule has a slight positive charge, and the chloride atom has a tiny negative charge. A water molecule has one atom of oxygen bound to two atoms of hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms are attached to one side of the oxygen atom, resulting in a water molecule having a positive charge on the side where the hydrogen atoms are and a negative charge on the other side, where the oxygen atom is. The sodium chloride ions pull and tug on the water\u2019s two hydrogen atoms (unlike charges attract) and tear the bonds apart. The ice no longer has a honeycomb structure. It has melted. In order for the melted ice to freeze again, it has to go much lower than 32\u00b0F; the salt has lowered the freezing point of the water. Most of Earth\u2019s ice is packed into huge sheets called glaciers. The largest glacier covers most of the Antarctic continent and holds about 90 percent of the world\u2019s ice. If all of it were to melt, the oceans would rise 187 feet. You might want try this science experiment. Fill a drinking glass with water, and then put an ice cube in the water. You can see that the ice cube floats. Now, using isopropyl rubbing alcohol that you can buy in any drugstore, fill a glass with alcohol and carefully drop in an ice cube. What happens to the ice cube? Alcohol is less dense than water, less even, than frozen water, so, since the ice cube is denser than the alcohol in the glass, it sinks.
