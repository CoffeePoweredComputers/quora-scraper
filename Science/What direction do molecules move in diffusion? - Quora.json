            "answer_text": "The way I learned it and the way I still know it as is diffusion is the movement of molecules along a concentration gradient. Which means the molecules will move from a region where they are highly concentrated to areas where they are less concentrated. ... It moves outside the cell where it is less concentrated. ",

            "answer_text": "In any diffusional process, molecules in fact move in all directions. Thinking about the diffusional pathway of a single molecule, it takes the form of a random walk. However, considering the collection of diffusing molecules as a wbole, the average direction of diffusion is down the concentration gradient, from high to low concentration. ",
