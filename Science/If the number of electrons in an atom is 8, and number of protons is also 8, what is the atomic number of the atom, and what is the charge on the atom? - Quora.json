            "answer_text": "The number of protons is the atomic number. Therefore the element is Carbon. The proton being positively charged and the electrons being negatively charged makes this a neutral charge since 8+ + 8- = 0. The number of electrons can change by sharing with other atoms, or in mostly ionic bonds, being given away, or receiving extra. Give away electrons results in a net positively charged ION. Extra electrons result in a net negatively charged ION. (Only net neutrally charged particles are atoms.) If you change the number of protons, you no longer have the same element. ",

            "answer_text": "As no of electron or protons are considered as same so when there are 8 proton in an element .it's atomic no will be 8. In atomic form there will be no charge on it . When we configure it's electronic configuration it will be 1s\u00b22s\u00b2 2p\u2074 .in this situation it has 4 electron needs .to fill there octat it needs 4 electron. ",
