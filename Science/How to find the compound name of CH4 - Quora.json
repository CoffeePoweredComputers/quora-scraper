            "answer_text": "The reason you're having so much trouble with this is because it's organic, so it plays by different rules, as Kieran Russell points out. Plus, it's also a 1 carbon structure, which means it's a double exception. Normally long carbon-carbon chains are named after how many carbons they have (with the Greek root). For example, pentane is made of 5 carbons. However, under 5 carbons, there's a special set of names we use. 1 Carbon - Methane 2 Carbons - Ethane 3 Carbons - Propane 4 Carbons - Butane  5 to infinity - Use greek prefixes.  ",

            "answer_text": "A chemical with the general formula CnH2n+2 is an alkane, CH4 fulfils this formula and therefore is named with the suffix -ane. The root is given by the number of carbon atoms in the longest chain, which is just one in this case giving the root meth-. Putting these together gives us methane, the name of CH4. ",
