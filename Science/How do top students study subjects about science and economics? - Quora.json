            "answer_text": "I don't think that there is one correct answer to this question. What really matters is how you learn. I could go on and on with specific examples, but I don't think it would help you much. You have to just figure out what works best for you. There is a lot of trial and error involved and in any case you will need to put a lot of time into your work.  I was a physics major in college and frequently would have to learn new math concepts on my own in order to answer homework questions. There are a lot of good resources for every subject online, so find out what they are and use them. Wolfram Alpha is an example for math/physics. Ask professors when you don't understand a concept and don't ignore homework even if it will not be graded. They give assignments for a reason and not to keep you from having a social life. So many people are shy about asking questions because they don't want to admit they don't understand something.....you're not helping yourself if you do that.  Also, you want to get good grades, but the point is to learn the material. In 50 years no one is going to care if you got an A- rather than an A in any particular class. If you are going through the motions and getting good grades only to forget everything at the end of the semester then you are doing it wrong. Working in groups can be a big help, but a good rule of thumb is that if you do your homework with a group and get A's on the homework and a C on the test then it may help to try to do the homework on your own.  Just keep trying different methods and ask your peers what they do to study for a particular class. That will give you some ideas. I can't be too specific because I studied for different classes in different ways and the odds are you will not be taking the exact same classes. A few last general tips. Don't pull an all-nighter for more than 6 days in a given week. Really though, make sure you get enough sleep. These subjects are hard enough when you are not tired and impossible when you are. Coffee is good in moderation (I can't say I live by that though....) and I avoid energy drinks personally. Don't give up because something is hard to understand. Yes, it does seem easy when the professor shows/explains in class, but they have years and years of experience. Many professors will tell you that it was just as hard for them when they were first learning. ",
