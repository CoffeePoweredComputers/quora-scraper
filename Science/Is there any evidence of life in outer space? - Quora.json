We have not \u2018heard\u2019 anything during the 60+ years we have listened in our radio telescopes (SETI), we have not (yet) seen any \u2018molecular signatures of life\u2019 in spectra from exo-planets, this may change with the launch of the James Webb space telescope next year. We have also not seen any \u2018structures\u2019 (dyson spheres/swarms, ring worlds,\u2026) that would be a sign of intelligent life. In addition, we have no real idea of how life develops \u2018from scratch\u2019 so it is difficult to know if it is one-in-a-million chance or one-in-a-trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion (some scientists think it is even lower than that!).
