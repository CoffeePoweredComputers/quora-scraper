            "answer_text": "No. The Sun is significantly larger than the Earth. Its light will reach beyond 180 degrees because of the angle of the light rays from the Sun\u2019s area beyond the Earth\u2019s circumference. The atmosphere on Earth will also refract these rays and show them after sunset. The periods of light in this extended time are referred to as twilight. There are three periods of twilight\u2014Civil Twilight (the brightest period), Nautical Twilight, and Astronomical Twilight. In the morning these periods comprise Dawn, and in the evening they are Dusk. After the Astronomical Dusk it is dark; night. The dark remains until the Astronomical Dawn.
