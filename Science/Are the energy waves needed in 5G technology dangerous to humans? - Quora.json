            "answer_text": "Yes. 5G millimeter waves and it\u2019s use of beam forming is dangerous. Also, it uses legacy waves, all the earlier generations of radiation from 2G and 3G and 4G so all the harm that those waves have been shown to cause will still be there. And out there in the atmosphere are the other frequencies for TV and radio and radar and from electrical transmission fields and electric railroads and vehicles The government and industry inform you otherwise. They justify this deception of 5G safety based on the difference between ionizing (dangerous) and non-ionizing (not dangerous) radiation. However, it has been known for at least 50 years that the non-ionizing radiation of radar causes health problems. One of the first issues was distinctive cataracts in the back of radar workers eyes these were identified at least 60 years ago. It makes sense that these waves heat tissue on the inside the body like a microwave oven. The millimeter waves vibrate the human tissue to create heat inside the body. This is especially dangerous where there isn\u2019t blood circulation to cool the tissue. Another similar body part is testicles. Here the damage of DNA breaks is transferred to the yet to be born. For over 50 years it has been known that these waves cause irreparable reproductive harm. This is unconscionable. The 5G steerable beam will bounce off of hard surfaces and into people who are in the crossfire of the small cell and the handset or RFID tag. These are unintended targets. There will be lots of 5G second hand smoke: For instance children we protect from cell phones to grade 8 who have heads at the unfortunate height for unintended beam impact and they will suffer at least cataract risk. At an early age their genetic material, sperm and egg, will be subject to 5G radar technology. These children will be subject to 5G radiation from their conception until they themselves wish to reproduce. We know 5G causes sterilty, infertility, miscarriages and genetic defects. There is no benefit from 5G whatsoever that justifies these risks. Cars used to have 120 mph on the speedometer. Cars can be made to go very much faster than 120. There is bad technology that has benefits(speed) which we reject. Not only is the user put into harms way, but everyone is, including the innocent child playing under the 5G small cell outside your house. ",

            "answer_text": "All over the internet there is people flipping out because 5G will use frequencies 7x higher than wifi, and 20x higher than 4g. Afterall, we use microwaves to cook our food which works by using radio waves to resonate the water in the food. So let's look at the electromagnetic spectrum  Microwaves goes up to 10^12 or 1000 ghz.The infrared from our remote controls is 10\u2013100x that, the frequency that eyes pickup to perceive color is over 100,000 ghz. Yet gee, our light bulbs outputting several watts have not killed us all. Ionizing waves (those to the right of visible light in the EM Spectrum) are the real danger.When you get into the y rays (1 Quintilian hz or 1 billion ghz), then those waves are ionizing and are smaller than our atoms. Thus, yes these waves can break apart atoms and destroy DNA. Lower band ionizing waves (x-rays and ultraviolet) are even safe at low levels/duration. We use x-rays for imaging and ultraviolet radiation is why we get sunburns if out in the sun too long.However non-ionizing waves (those to the left) can only be dangerous with high output power Your microwave oven uses the same frequency as your 2.4 ghz band WiFi router. Yet, gee no one has ever had a bag a popcorn start popping from a nearby router. Reason being is that your microwave oven uses 1000w of power in a very confined space to cook your food while your typical WiFi router does not even use 500 miliwatts or 0.5 watts. Your 5g radio towers will require many more cells, so instead of 3g/4g towers broadcasting at a few hundred watts of power to span for miles, you will have local neighborhood cells broadcasting at 20 watts to go a few blocks. If anything 2 ghz at 100 watts is more dangerous (within a few hundred feet), vs 30 ghz at 20 watts.To be harmed by 20 watts in microwave frequency band you would have to either hold the antenna for several minutes, or stand still 4\u20135 ft away from it for hours. By definition, ANYTHING that creates a frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum (thus disrupting a zero state) is \u201cradiation\u201d. The frequency that allows me to see blue stripes on my shirt is \u201cradiation\u201d, the sound my keyboard is making now as I type is \u201cradiation\u201d, the infrared frequency my body heat gives off is \u201cradiation\u201d. The problem is that most people only think of radiation like the gamma radiation (a y-ray) from a nuclear explosion. So the uninformed/misinformed doomsayers are equating high level y-ray level radiation to non-ionizing microwaves that are less than 0.0000001 the frequency of y-rays.  ADDED: Great news for all the complete fools who are concerned about 5g.For only $350 you can get a USB Stick that creates a magical 5G blocking force field to surround you \u2026... so a $25 128gb flash drive that has a sticker on it.Please don\u2019t buy this fake $350 anti-5G USB stick ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, as initial concern was raised by some \u201cso-called\u201d technician and later debunked, but anyways, I will try in the simplest matter to explain. The main and most important fallacy in this myth is: \u201cFrequency of 5G network is way above current standards and therefore much more dangerous\u201d. What if I tell you this: \u201cHuman body emits a high amount of radiation during their lifetime that has a frequency of at least 5000 TIMES higher than 5G\u201d. Does that mean that humans are dangerous? Not really, there are emitters of 430THz electromagnetic waves, that are emitted all around us, and people call it infrared light. (Many people don\u2019t know that light is also electromagnetic wave as much as radio signals, noise from the space and many other). Fire is, for example, one of the ones that emit all kinds of high-frequency waves and it\u2019s really high energy. Can it hurt humans? Sure it can IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN FIRE. But someone also said, these are too high frequencies, and we should study specifically ones that are used for 5G and there are no studies based on these specific frequencies. WRONG. So far people were testing all kinds of radio waves, on many subjects, yet they didn\u2019t find any correlation between any claim about the dangers of 5G. Why is it like this? Higher frequency photons carry a higher amount of energy and thus, they have a bigger chance of breaking electrons from atoms/molecules, basically damaging a molecular structure (including our DNA in cells), which eventually leads to a chance of getting some nasty DNA that have damaged genetic material that controls cell-reproduction and starts replicating indefinitely. That is something that we surely recognize around us and it\u2019s called cancer. Lower frequency (lower than UV lights) photons carry a low amount of energy, fair enough to spin electrons of radiated molecule/atom, but doesn\u2019t have enough energy to detach them away. This radiation creates heat. (fire, microwave, light bulb, and eventually 2G, 3G, 4G, Wifi, etc\u2026). Because it doesn\u2019t detach electrons, that's the reason why they are called non-ionizing radiation. So next time when someone complains about 5G, you can tell them that they have a higher chance to get cancer from some light bulb than 5G antenna. ",

            "answer_text": "The energy used to transmit messages in mobile phones is a radio/microwave radiation\u2026 but do not be afraid of those words, they are not dangerous. Microwaves and radio waves are on the electromagnetic spectrum, in the diagram below they are on the far right where it lists radar, FM, TV, shortwave, and AM signals.  Now, there are some dangerous energy listed in that diagram as well, you might notice gamma rays and X-rays. You may even recognise ultraviolet rays (which give skin cancer). Notice all the bad ones are on the left? The ones on the left are highly ionising, if they hit your DNA then they have a high likelihood of doing damage. the further to the left the more dangerous also because the further to the left the more penetrating they are, they are more able to pass through the skin (hence X-rays are used to look inside you).Those energies to the right are less penetrating and less ionising. They are less likely to damage your DNA and do not penetrate into the body very well. Consider the middle: Visible light. This is less dangerous than X-Rays, but more dangerous than the signals from a mobile phone (FM variety).In fact, Infrared rays are more dangerous than mobile radiation\u2026 and they are abundant in anything hot, like a hot meal\u2026 or the computer sitting on your desk right now. So Mobile phone signals, including 5G signals are of little to no danger. I would be more concerned about other sources of energy\u2026 like your next dinner. ",

            "answer_text": "Nah. I know a transmission far more dangerous. We\u2019re exposed to it every day, and it makes any fears about 5G seem minuscule. 5G will first be used in the same LTE band - no change in frequencies there, it will just blink and blip in a different digital \u201clanguage.\u201d That\u2019s 600 MHz to 6 GHz - all stuff we already have. It will also eventually use millimeter bands 24\u201386 GHz. These are used in fiber-optics, radar, some kinds of Wi-Fi and wireless video transmission. All stuff we already have. There is something that concerns me though. Higher than any frequency 5G will ever use, above 400,000GHz (infra-red), above 550,000GHz (green light), even above 750THz, is a special point at which the photons involved with radio frequencies become so opaque that they affect everything they impact, and they have so much energy that they don\u2019t just jiggle atoms and warm things up. Above 750THz, photons can change the bonds within the building blocks of life. They have so much energy they can plow through a cell wall, through the nucleus, and directly change DNA. This type of radio transmission is very dangerous and yet very few people know its frequency. You, or someone you\u2019ve lived with, will almost definitely get cancer from it, and it makes all fears about 5G, true or misled, laughable. Without 100% protection or shelter from it, there\u2019s only one good way to protect yourself when you\u2019re exposed: Wear sunscreen. ",

            "answer_text": "It is, indeed. Radiation-wise, it's safer (due to choice of frequencies as well as reduced power), but even if it was more harmful than G1-4 in that respect, that effect would be negligible. The problems (there are two) are a lot worse than that, because they attack humanity on a much more severe level. They create misunderstandings that take focus away from things that are, in profound and actual ways, important. Problem #1: 5G sounds bigger than 4G. It isn't. The problem with mobile networks is that they need to become SMALLER, because we fill them up (the bigger area a tower covers, the more users it needs to handle, and that's a bottle-neck). In radio terms, smaller means lower power. As in less radiation. So that we can put in MORE towers, closer together, and thus cater for more people in densely populated areas. Then, you may wonder, what if I live in a rural area and they don't put more towers in? No worries. Your equipment and the tower gear down. Sure, each lower \u201cgear\u201d (4G, 3G etc) gives you more radiation, but still quite safe. The speed steps down accordingly, but you can at least enjoy the 5G label on your phone. Shiny. Problem #2: 5G mobile networking is, to a layman, completely indistinguishable from 5GHz Wifi. They are, of course, not related in any way, shape or form, but explaining (trying to explain) this to laymen is today stealing at least 5% of the productivity in the IT sector. So\u2026 closing words: PLEASE go back to sleep OR spend your energy thinking about climate change or the upoming zombie apocalypse. Hm. The \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d was meant as a joke, but on second thought, it MAY be a clear and present danger, as compared to 5G radiation. ",

About 4000+ US Personnel in US Airforce Base in Florida was (without their knowledge) \"zapped\" with Psychotronic Radiation for few years, developing cancers and other diseases.

I developed Diabetes, Intestines had to be shortened and my teeth started falling out! THIS IS DANGEROUS AND MUST BE STOPPED! The Soviet Union started this development, but realised the Death Potential and help a summit to present the World about this and suggested a treaty signed NOT to develop this incredibly dangerous weapon, guess who refused...DA!

            "answer_text": "Yes. Tesla said, \u2018Everything is a wave.\u2019. The higher the frequency, the smaller the wave. When a wave gets small enough, it starts acting like a particle. So, lets say a proton flies threw you body and hits some of your DNA. Not good, right? But 5G waves are way bigger than protons. Just how big does a wave have to be before it will do no not harm to a human? AM radio waves are really big. They are so big that they can not harm DNA. But an AM radio station next to a public school was shocking the kids when they touched the fence. And some of the kids were feels ill. The children\u2019s symptoms cleared up when the AM radio station was shutdown. What the above shows us is that really small, weak waves and very big strong waves, both have the ability to be dangerous to humans. And not all humans react the same way when exposed to frequency = X and energy level = Y. Note: radiation exposer is accumulative. 3 people get the same amount of sunlight. 1 person get cancer in 5 years. 1 person get skin cancer in 50 years. And the 3nd person never gets cancer. If 5G shortens the average lifespan by 6 months, is that okay? How about 6 years? 5G is cool and will solve so many social problems.

Turn on a 5g (10 - 300 gig) transmitter in a room with birds, or bees & watch the chaos\u2026.. Look at the video of 1940s airport radar rotating & how the aphids on tomato plants over 10 miles away were bouncing in unison to the speed of the radar rotation\u2026 Yes cell phone & wifi transmission waves damage cells, DNA, etc\u2026. Yes UV can KILL you, but our atmosphere happens to filter it pretty good. Only when \u201cwe\u201d produce it in concentrate, or destroy natures uv filter is it a real danger. What I\u2019m reading from the brainwashed libtard sheep here is basically like saying, earth has magnetic poles North & south, and it\u2019s safe, so a junk yard car crane magnet is safe\u2026 Microwave ovens are safe according to some of these re treads, so I\u2019ll rig your microwave door to operate while open, see if your ok with that\u2026 I can buy a little laser at the dollar tree, it cant burn or melt anything, not even butter. (0.005watt) but what about at 1 watt or 5 watts? Holy shit your burning crap. At 30 watts or 60 watts, your cutting through 1/2\u2033 wood or 1/16\u2033 metal give or take\u2026 So how \u201cpowerful\u201d are these 5g towers? Ever see a video of a led street light / 5g tower? The capacitors & power supply wires are WAY overkill\u2026 Not like the tiny wires transmitting in your cell phone, more like the speaker wires on your 120 watt per channel stereo tower speakers\u2026 Basically about a 120volt 10amp load or more at higher voltage (street lights are 220 volt) so the power supply is at least 1 leg (120v) Do we build our subways or buses with the ability to be cranked up to 300mph? 700mph? 5,000mph/? Or our house water pressure to not be about 75psi, but 750psi, or 7,500psi?, You can cook a turkey in front of a airport radar dish, but i see here ONLY EVERYTHING TO THE LEFT is dangerous, microwave (radar range) is safe, LOL!

            "answer_text": "No. To be honest, this question doesn\u2019t really require more than one word answer, but I feel obligated anyway. I once did a science fair project on radio waves and found out that they are literally everywhere. The radio waves from the new devices used to be used by wireless TV stations. Now that TV stations transmit digitally, you can pack them a lot closer together in the radio spectrum, which means you don\u2019t need as much spectrum. Little TV stations also fell out of fashion because youtube killed them off. But anyway, the radiation that is known to be harmful is ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation starts somewhere around Ultra Violet A. You know. UVA. The stuff you put on broad-spectrum sun screen to protect yourself against. Below that in energy is light, as in the stuff you see. Below that is infared, which the air absorbs pretty readily, which is why your TV remote has a limited range. Lower frequencies, such as microwaves are very efficiently absorbed by water, which makes it ideal for cooking food. Way below that is the spectrum (and therefore even less energy) is the recently opened up for the new technology, 5 gigahertz or so. It\u2019s really not harmful. ",

            "answer_text": "No, obviously not. It is the usual fishing for conspiracy and sensational news. 5G tower or phone radiation is of the same kind and frequencies than 4G and 3G and 2G. Due to sensitivity of electronic components the standards have continuously been driven to lower radiation power. So power of 2G was way stronger than 3G, which is turn was stronger than 4G which will again be stronger than 5G. To illustrate this by numbers: the max radiation from a 2G handset was 2 Watts; the max radiation from 4G handsets is 200 milli Watts (which is merely 10%). Also the radiation of 2G was pulse shaped. A lot of older conspiracies made a big fuss about the pulsed radiation. this is no longer true since CDMA (3G). And: the number of users worldwide has grown from a couple of thousands in 1991, when GSM was introduced, to something like 5 Billions today. Already 15 years ago half of the population of industrialized countries were using \u201chazardous\u201d mobile phones. Anything heard about new diseases growing at that pace, that could reasonably be traced back to that radiation (I would assume that people would be smart enough to understand that neither Ebola nor Aids could potentially be traced back to mobile radiation. And the number of cancer cases has continuously gone down (when you look at age strata). You would have to see a surge in young age cancer, if any of the claims made towards mobile phone threats would have a grain of truth in it. ",

            "answer_text": "There have been some people saying that 5G emits harmful radiation but is this really the case? To find out the answer, let\u2019s look into a few things. Radiation can be defined as electromagnetic waves. There are two types of radiation: nonionizing radiation and ionizing radiation. Nonionizing radiation energizes electrons while ionizing radiation rips them from the atoms. The latter can be dangerous because it destabilizes atoms. It damages cells, increasing their likelihood of becoming cancer cells. Ionizing radiation is stronger than nonionizing radiation. Waves with a smaller diameter are stronger. Because of this, there is some fear that 5G could be dangerous. So how strong is 5G?  To give some sense of scale, radiation starts to become ionizing a bit after it goes past visible light (within the ultraviolet spectrum). The diameter of 5G waves are 1\u201310 millimeters which puts it right at the boundary of microwaves and infrared. Ionizing radiation starts at the 10\u2013100 nm range. At this point, you have much more to worry from the sun than from 5G. Unlike 5G, the sun emits visible light and some ultraviolet light which leads to sunburns. ",

            "answer_text": "light spectrum waves have higher energy but they does not penetrate deep into your flesh tissues; while mm wave band radiations have enough energy and can penetrate your flesh tissues deeper enough to harm it. That is the reason microwave oven is more efficient for cooking than light bulb. No-ionizing photons do not have to knock out electron to damage life, it just have to vibrate the atom enough to heat it up or disturb the natural stability of its structure by change the delicate thermodynamic balance in it to damage the tissues and disorder the function of it. It causes damage mainly by thermal effect or structural destabilising effect, there also may have some other effects that cause damages. The difference in destructivity between light and lower frequency waves range used in radio wave microwave and mm wave is their penetrating ability and resonative ability differences. And the lower frequencies range radiation more likely to match a resonating object in living structure such as atom, molecule, cell, organ\u2026 and for resonating destruction, no need for much energy input but the constancy for frequency, intensity, direction are more important. So even it is the lower end of the frequency, if it fit in the above conditions, it still can cause great damage to life. For that reason, even the low frequency sound wave in the teen Hz range can kill a big animal like human and elephant (if it is locked in the room). Of course, the frequencies that higher than light spectrum will have so much energy that it just rams through your tissue and damage everything on the way, though the ozone layer and the earth magnetic fields get rid of most of them. For the ones that hit us, we have natural defence and repair mechanisms to deal with them when that damage is within our natural ability to deal with. ",

            "answer_text": "I certainly hope not. Given the number of people exposed to mobile phones. There is some evidence that low frequency 50hz non-ionizing radiation from high voltage power lines increases cancer in children. Electromagnetic Fields and Cancer One of the issues with cancer is that it takes years to develop and so we may be just at the tip of an iceberg of cancers caused by mobile phones. Personal I have a mobile but I limit my exposure by limiting my call length. Also talking on speaker phone is much safer than holding it directly to your head. The field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. So double the distance and you get 4 times less energy from the phone. see: Inverse-square law - Wikipedia Cell phone radiation: A self-defense guide (FAQ) WHO: Cell phones may cause cancer I think the jury is out on this one. Best to reduce your risk if you can. At work I will use my VoIP \u201cland line\u201d rather than making a call on my mobile from my desk. I prefer to SMS than talk on a mobile. But given that I sit for hours surrounded by Wi-Fi and 3 monitors at work chances are I am doomed like the rest of us\u2026 :-) At least the monitors are flat screens now. The hundreds of thousand of monitor hours I have accumulated from being surrounded by for decades CRT\u2019s can\u2019t have been good for me either. None of us will get out of this world alive, something has got to get us one day. ",

            "answer_text": "Q) Are the energy waves needed in 5G technology dangerous to humans? A) The 5G is intended to work in 2 frequency ranges. The lower frequency called as Sub6 that are pretty much the same frequencies that are used for 4G. The higher mmWave frequency are the once that will prove this super fast internet speed. I assume you are more concerned about the mmWave frequencies! The mmWave frequency used for 5G mainly uses the ka band (common ones are 28 and 38 GHz). The health concern have always been there even with the lower mobile frequency. And with the 5G mmWave frequency the concerns have only increased. However , these high frequencies are already in use. For example the Satellite TV broadcasting uses the similar Ka band frequencies. So at least till now these high frequencies have not proved to cause any problem to humans. That said, many creatures like birds have though be affected, even by the lower frequencies of 4G, though this is not actually proven. If this theory is true, the impact could be worse because of 5G frequencies. Read more about effect on birds: Does cellphone use kill birds?

            "answer_text": ":-) A typical microwave oven has 850 to 1800 watts of power. To put that in some perspective for you, a typical smartphone puts out 0.25 watt of power. Not even 1 watt. A light bulb might be 25 watts. Original analog cellphones, remember the big Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d phones? put out 2 watts. A police/fire radio goes up to 5 watts. So, on the phone side you should be quite safe. Many years of phone use by billions of people seems to confirm that. Cell towers put out a lot more power. An outdoor small cell could be 5\u201310 watts, or even 20 watts. Cell towers are normally around 40 watts. The critical thing about wireless and power is that the power dissipates very quickly over space. This is called free space loss. As long as you maintain a safe distance from the emitting source it should be perfectly safe at the power levels used. That\u2019s one reason you will see fences around cell towers. Safety. And most outdoor small cells are mounted a good distance above ground, also for safety. (And for better coverage.) ",

            "answer_text": "5G will not kill us no matter how much speculation you do regarding its harmful effects on mankind and other living creatures on earth. This is because 5G uses the same LTE band in the 600 MHz to 6 GHz frequency and will use millimeter bands between 24 GHz 86 GHz.  Image credit: Rush Home All these frequencies are already in use in fiber optics, Wi-Fi, radar and wireless video transmissions. The problem lies with stronger signals at a higher frequency and that might have adverse effects on all living organism but it will not kill us like that. As per researches conducted by the American National Cancer Institute, there have been very few connections between the usage of mobile phones and risk of brain tumors but most of the studies have found no association between them. However, it is not advisable to use cell phones for a long time whether it is 4G or 5G as it radiates a lot of heat and might affect the human body. The radiation from cellphones is at the low-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum, making them much safer than high-energy radiation like x-rays and gamma rays. While the latter gives off ionizing radiation, meaning they have enough energy to ionize an atom or molecule and thus damage cell DNA resulting in cancer, RF radiation does not. RF radiation only has enough energy to move or vibrate atoms in a molecule, not enough to ionize it.  Hope it helps! OKportal Technology ",

Or more often, disinformation. For decades there have been military and civilian radio and radar installations, including close to the frequency ranges now under discussion. The personnel on those stations have been exposed to much higher intensities of radio waves than the general population, and for much much longer. There have been epidemiological studies that compare people that are exposed for long times to military radio and radar transmissions. No difference to the rest of the population with otherwise similar lifestyles. How is 5G technology dangerous to your health?

            "answer_text": "There is extensive longitudinal experiments with both animals and quasi experiments with humans to suggest that high levels of prolonged exposure to the EMR emitted by wireless technologies are carninogenic. This is why many countries like France and Israel have much lower safe exposure limits than say here in Australia, and even stricter limits around children such as through switching off wireless routers when not in use. The 5G network will greatly increase the exposure levels by their direct beam transmission. It is not of the same level of danger as X rays, for example, but there is a reason why mobile phone companies in the fine print do not recommend speaking with your phone held to your head. The cellular damage caused is more than just the heating potential, even if they do not fully understand how the damage occurs. Have a search also for the 100s of scientists who have petitioned their concern for the 5G network. Many scientists also recommend that wireless EMR microwaves be moved from WHO class 2B carnigoen (potential human carcinogen) classification to class 2A or even class 1.

            "answer_text": "How To Learn 5G in 5 Minutes First of all In the future, from 1G, 2G to 5G development, everyone will be engaged in frequency. First of all, everyone should know that communication is divided into wired and wireless. Wired such as copper wire, optical fiber, etc. Send wireless messages over the air. Optically the optical fiber can go up to 26 TBPS. However, wireless should not be able to achieve high speeds. Some telecommunications companies in Hong Kong boast that 4G is up to 600 Mbps, but the average internet speed in Hong Kong is only 17.73 Mbps, which is unmatched by wired. Therefore, 5G wireless will achieve high-speed point-to-point transmission, breaking the most important barrier! Wireless communication uses electromagnetic waves for communication. Electromagnetic waves are divided into radio waves and light waves, and currently they communicate primarily with radio waves. Radio waves have different uses for different frequencies, including shipping, civil and military. The frequency of radio waves used from 1G to 4G is getting higher and higher. The higher the radio frequency, the more data can be stored, such as moving from a good closet to a long and strong closet. The speed is also fast.see more ",

            "answer_text": "Many people gave great answers. Non ionizing radition in 5g spectrum can certainly be dangerous. It\u2019s how you use it. Mobile phone companies are greedy and under constant pressure to provide faster, bigger networks. Installing new towers and lowering power output is not a scalable deployment model. Less antenna power means less chance to catch cancer through cell mutation, burn your eye retina, develop headackes, etc. More antenna power means less towers and wider area coverage but also greater health impact. What public needs is strict, routine monitoring of every cell tower in the area, developed by independent companies, not mobile operators. I would go as far as monitoring equippment manufacturers so they too adhere to safety standards and their devices facilitate external monitoring through e-port, etc. And of course, as you roll 5g out, log population health statistics, especially radiation related issues. Keep in mind, electromagnetic fields can superimpose, meaning that two two towers from different providers can increase field energy level in the area beyond what\u2019s considered safe. Simple analogy would be take two flash lights and point a spot. ",

David Fred's answer to I live about 50-60 meters in front of a cell phone tower (several white rectangular panels). I can see it directly from my living room window, because I live on the 5th floor, I'm right in front of it on the same level. Should I be worried? David Fred's answer to There is a tower with a radio antenna installed adjacent the building below my building. The distance is about ~30 meters away from my floor. Does EMF radiation get worse as I go up away from the antenna? Also, is this setup legal in other countries? ",

            "answer_text": "Citizens in several countries have been protesting about the harmful effects 5G network nodes could have on humans and the environment. However, it is also important to note that vast majority of the frequencies being used for 5G have been used in the past for other data transmissions like TV broadcasts, Wi-Fi, radar, wireless video transmissions. Hence all the harm that all these wave frequencies have been shown to cause will still be there. 5G is set to be rolled out in two stages. In the first stage, 5G will operate in bands below 6GHz , which is where 4G equipment work. Also 5G base stations will be in certain small areas and not everywhere. In the second stage, there will be huge improvements in bandwidth and data rates, more base stations and millimetre-wave frequencies will be used. The energy waves needed for these are also already in use for high data transmissions like wireless video, radar etc etc. This essentially means there will be no further harm due to 5G energy wave transmissions than what is already present now in the ecosystem. To allay citizens fears, various agencies and science communities continue to research on the effect of 5G energy waves on humans, animals and plants. ",

The network is supposed to be up to 100 times faster than current data speeds, but it requires cellphone tower equipment to be closer to users than before. Wireless companies in the U.S. say they'll have to install about 300,000 new antennas \u2013 roughly equal to the total number of cell towers built over the past three decades. That's causing outrage and alarm in some neighborhoods, as antennas go up around homes.

There are unfortunately instances where the 5G cellular/mobile telecommunications network and the 5GHz Wi-Fi band are being incorrectly referred to as the same thing, which they are not, as I\u2019m sure you know. This then results in unnecessary and baseless scare tactics. Did you mean the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band as opposed to the 5GHz Wi-Fi band? Most Wi-Fi routers these days provide both and will automatically switch between the two depending on how people have equipment set up in their homes with regard to distance between the router and various devices and if there are any obstacles such as walls, which of course you would already know too, but some people reading your response may not :-).

When it comes to 5G cell towers on street lights in front of your house what this means is that power output from those towers will be greatly reduced and your wireless device (sometimes glued to your head during a phone call) also will drop power output to reach the towers as they will be much closer. It\u2019s very similar to Wifi Access points in high density locations like schools, the power output must be greatly reduced (partly because it\u2019s not needed) in order to reduce interference. Once the upcoming spectrum auctions take place (for 3.5GHz and above) and deployed it shouldn\u2019t be much different than your 5GHz wifi at home. ",
