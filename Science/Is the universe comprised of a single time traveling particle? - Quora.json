            "answer_text": "There is a postulate by John Wheeler which is known as the One-electron universe, the idea is that all electrons and positrons in the universe are the result of a single particle traveling back and forth through space and time. Wheeler thought that this single electron, when travelling backwards in time, behaved like what we know as a positron. He even told Richard Feynman about this. The postulate is unlikely to ever be tested, even tracking individual electrons is a hard task thanks to the characteristics of the quantum realm. Now, regarding your question, if we go even further and assume that every particle in the universe is the same particle traveling through space-time we would have to think of a mechanism by wich this omni-particle changes characteristics like spin, charge and mass while interacting a gazillion times with itself.

There are values for vector direction and [-] or [+] charge that will differentiate the superpostioned particles one from another. ",
