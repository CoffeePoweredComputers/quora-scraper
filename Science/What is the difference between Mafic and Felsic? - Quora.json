            "answer_text": "Mafic and felsic are terms to describe, both visually and chemically, the silica content of an igneous rock. Felsic rocks have a higher silica content (65% to 75%), so they are generally harder, lighter in color, are enriched in elements such as sodium and potassium and may contain quartz (if the silica content is high enough, the rock is \u201coversaturated\u201d in silica i.e. there\u2019s more SiO2 available than can be taken up in minerals like alkaline feldspar, so it ends up forming quartz). Felsic magmas tend to be very viscous, and are often erupted explosively (for example, Vesuvius). An example of felsic rock would be rhyolite. Mafic rocks have a relatively low silica content (45% to 55%), are generally softer and darker in color, and are enriched in elements like iron, magnesium and nickel. Mafic magmas are less viscous, so flow, rather than erupt explosively. An example of mafic magma would be basalt (for example, Hawaii). Between these two are Intermediate rocks, which literally describe rocks with a silica content between felsic and mafic (i.e. 55% to 65%). An example of an intermediate rock would be Andesite. There are also ultramafic rocks, which are very depleted in silica (below 45%), and highly enriched in iron and magnesium. Minerals like olivine tend to occur in ultramafic rocks; an example of ultramafic rock would be komatiite. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Richard - something like this has been asked and answered several times, and you should just search Quora for similar questions - Mafic and felsic are archaic terms (though still in use) to refer to igneous rock composition. But, basically, a \u2018mafic\u2019 rock is a rock containing many mineral which are rich in iron and magnesium, as opposed to a \u2018felsic\u2019 rock which is relative poor in magnesium but relatively high in silica content (the iron is moderate in a felsic rock, but magnesium is nearly absent). Most mafic rocks are dark colored - black, gray to green; most felsic rocks are lighter - light gray to white, pink or red. ",
