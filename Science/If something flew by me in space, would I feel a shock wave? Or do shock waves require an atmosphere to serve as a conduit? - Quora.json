            "answer_text": "Yes, beside sound, all other effect apply. The gas from the rockets of the object flying by would rock your boat. If the object is a large rock with metallic content, it would induce electric and magnetic effects. You would hear metal contracting and possibly chirp noise. Your computers may reboot, failing the kick their internal watchdog on time. Even minutes before the time the object is closest to you, some static electricity would be perceived, somewhat like in Siberia, before a large objects felt. Of course, the Dopler effect would shift the frequency if radar reflection from high to low, like a train do with sound waves. ",

            "answer_text": "Shock waves (well, physical ones) require a medium to travel through. In space, a bullet, or a Saturn V could pass by you with inches to spare, and you wouldn\u2019t feel a thing. (Unless the Saturn V had it\u2019s engines on, that is\u2026) Then, there\u2019s EMP, which is a shock wave, but it doesn\u2019t require a physical medium, as it\u2019s electromagnetic in nature\u2026 ",
