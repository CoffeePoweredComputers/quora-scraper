            "answer_text": "Show him how interesting they are! And do it before school makes them seem like a chore. There\u2019s nothing to interest a boy in science like looking at a drop of pond water under a microscope, and discovering a whole world of microsocopic creatures in it. Or peering through a telescope at Saturn\u2019s rings. There are wonderful math enrichment books for kids that emphasize the fun and interesting nature of mathematics, something that\u2019s sadly overlooked in the typical elementary and high school curricula, with its emphasis on basic skills and algorithms. Too many students never have an opportunity to take a university-level course in higher math, and discover just how fascinating it is. And don\u2019t forget museums like the American Museum of Natural History \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to interest a boy in science like standing face-to-face with Tyrannosaurus rex! And most of all, show him how interesting this stuff is by example. My father was always fascinated by science, and my grandfather as well. A gifted naturalist, Dad could show you the ancient creatures hiding under a rock, and explain that the lichens were a symbiosis of fungus and algae, and that the soil of New England was rocky because the topsoil had been carried away by glaciers in the last ice age. And I was early exposed to interesting and exciting scientists as well \u2014 I\u2019m told I was particularly taken with the astronomer Fred Hoyle, being shown different kinds of clouds from a meteorologist, seeing a mainframe computer for the first time courtesy of a family friend who worked in IT.

Follow the steps below Nourish your child's curiosity.Answer or try to answer or help your child in finding the answer to the questions he has.And the most important part - even if your area of concentration is only on the three subjects you mentioned in the question, don't limit your attention to the questions of your child from those areas only. If you do it in the right manner, your child as well as you will figure out what is his area of interest.Last but not the least, remember this - your child is an individual. That means he has his own identity. That intern means that he has his likes and dislikes as well. Please don't impose your wishes/likes on him. Let him explore things and experiment. He will surely find the right path.",

            "answer_text": "Well, to a certain extent, some children are just going to have a natural bent towards subjects like math and science. Or they may lean more towards the arts or literature. But it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and encourage various interests, as long as you\u2019re prepared for the fact that they may never want to ultimately pursue that field. And, as far as some suggestions on how to do that, there are some great museums and activity centers out there that allow children to be hands on with things involving science and technology. Or have them talk with different people employed in these fields and see where you can go with math, science, and IT. Lastly, don\u2019t underestimate the value of doing things together at home. You can try different experiments together, do math games, or explore how computers/electronics/etc. work. Just things to show that learning in this area can truly be fun. Hope this helps! ",

They will be happier. You can watch fun learning programs/ documentaries or discovery kids with your child. Some fun programs for younger children like Magic School Bus or Story Bots are good. Then do fun science learning with practical experiments that you can do with your kid at home. There are coding apps for kids as young as 3 or 4 that help kids learning coding logic, Learn math by making it fun and practical and connecting it with real life situations. Try all this but let your kid decide. ",

If your kid likes to read, encourage them to try to write something they would want to read, make suggestions for more detail in certain areas. (areas that require research into math, science, IT, etc.) If I wanted to instill an interest for math or science in a child; I would suggest making something from the idea to the finished product. girls, jewelry/ boys, a sword (false edged). Both would require learning about properties of materials (strength, melting points), mass and volume (weight, balance point, center of gravity, fluidic volume for castings) and both would also help with understanding artistic concepts (Why is this one prettier than that one?) research and computer skills gained during the design phase can provide a firm foundation for IT (Remember you need to understand how to do an equation to do good coding, that\u2019s why it sometimes counts as a math credit).

Example (young child): To teach biology to a young child, you may start by asking your kid to discover which animal you have in mind. Give the kid a hint \u2014 the animal-type name starts with an R. For example: Kid: Does it have 4 feet? You: No. Kid: Does it have 2 feet? You: Yes. Kid: Is it a bird? You: Yes, but what type of bird? Kid: Rooster? You: No. Kid: Does it have red on it? You: Yes. Kid: But I already guessed a rooster? You: It\u2019s a different bird that has red on it. Kid: Robin. You: Yes. (pat kid or smile to kid, etc.) In this way you engage your child in learning, and your child will be interested to what you show interest. ",

There are no ATARI computers now, but I still would play games with him by presenting math puzzles and let him try to solve them. Help him when he can\u2019t do it. You can help with science by doing interesting experiments with him. ",
