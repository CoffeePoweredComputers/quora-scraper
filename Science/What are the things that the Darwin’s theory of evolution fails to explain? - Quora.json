            "answer_text": "Literally everything. It explains nothing. Darwin\u2019s theory was intended to explain how complex organisms evolved from the first life, but it utterly failed. I would call it the most embarrassingly stupid theory in history and a disgrace to science. It is illogical, mathematically insane and contrary to overwhelming evidence. It is only supported by ideological physicalist religious nuts, like Richard Dawkins. Darwinism, a mix of random slop and a death filter that destroys anything with random slop, is the most destructive force imaginable, not a perpetual creation machine. There is not the slightest possibility that any trait has been created by Neo-Darwinian means. Darwin simply shrugged and said \u201cjust lucky, I guess\u201d, not exactly an explanatory enlightenment. Neo-Darwinism does not explain the results of the scientific method. For example, it doesn\u2019t explain why we can and do induce evolution on a daily basis by merely changing the environment of an organism in a stressful, but non-lethal way. By making the disagreeable environment non-lethal, scientists brilliantly do what Darwin and his followers didn\u2019t bother to do, test both with and without a death filter. With no selection death filter, evolution STILL happens just fine, thank you. The FACT that scientists are able to induce evolution by changing the environment of an organism and watching it intelligently change the very genetic locus that they predicted would change, means that Darwinism is unequivocally debunked. Still, we can go on to the numerous other things Darwin failed to explain, although a full list would be too long. Darwinism doesn\u2019t explain why there is no evidence of randomness. Oh sure, they will say \u201cyou must not understand my sophisticated theory! We have an excuse for not having any evidence. Selection hides all the evidence by killing the multitudes of misfits we assume existed, but can\u2019t show. So we know we are right even though all the evidence is against us.\u201d First, having an excuse for lacking evidence is a piss poor replacement for actually having evidence. Second, it doesn\u2019t prove anything in your favor that all known evidence is against you. Most importantly, though, selection should not be able to eliminate ALL evidence. It is not hard to tell randomness from intelligent intent. No two things could be more different. Like comparing inanimate to animate objects, a child can master it. Yet we see birth after birth with only extremely rare hints of anything random. There are 60 mutations per human birth and 7 billion humans on earth. This gave us a combined 420 billion mutations. If mutations were random (equal probability distribution) we would have had every genetic locus in our genome change 140 times over just in extant humans. Yet all humans are within 99.9% of each other genetically. For this result to be due to selection death, we would need a 99.9% mortality rate. We keep excellent records on human births and deaths worldwide and we know we have a low mortality rate, so selection is not the reason for the conservation of information under such prolific change. Well over 99.9% of our genome should cause a harmful effect if mutated. Yet well over 99.99% of our mutations are functional and, of those that aren\u2019t, well over 99.9% are repaired. Of the remaining few that survive to reproduction age, well over 99% are not inherited. There is no evidence of randomness in any aspect of any life, let alone in mutations. In 2013, the NGSS finally removed the word \u201crandom\u201d from its section on mutations, to the cheers of scientists around the world. It doesn\u2019t explain how random changes to a complex code don\u2019t cause unavoidable extinction. Try making a digitized version of a Mozart composition become a Taylor Swift song in short random changes. Randomness is noise and noise destroys order. Restoring order again is hopeless once it even starts to unravel. Try making just a handful of random blind keystrokes to your next message and see if they are harmful, neutral or an improvement. You will find ONLY harm, especially if you keep blind typing to try to get your complex order back. If Darwinism were real, all life would rapidly become extinct, and by rapidly, I do mean one generation would be all it takes for us. Randomness is EXTREMELY destructive. Remember, if random change is your mechanism, time and number of trials are your worst enemies, due to the unavoidable and overwhelming destruction. Go ahead, try to imagine something more destructive than making random changes. Try to think of something less likely to be caused by randomness than intelligent life and then try to think of a worse answer to evolution than Darwinism. If random damage was a foolproof way to attain complex functional order, then we should avoid bombing an enemy\u2019s war munitions factories out of fear of a chance improvement to their weaponry systems. Random change is the very definition of destruction. Focusing only on the odds of gaining benefit without accepting the overwhelming biocidal extinction that would be the unavoidable result is delusional. Darwinists don\u2019t explain how we avoid the Malthusian Trap, which is degradation to a point just barely above the survival level. Even if there was some unknown reason that we avoided extinction, we would not avoid the fate of useless but non-fatal oddities. Theoretically, we should be loaded to the hilt with amorphous, asymmetrical, odd and useless appendages of every kind. If Darwinism had turned out to be true, we would have so many of these irregularities that we are just barely above literally dying because of them. If we can have a flap of skin forming a functional well-fitting eyelid conveniently under our control by luck somehow, then we ought to have dozens of flaps of skin on our shoulders, backs or other areas, with or without controllable musculature, all over our bodies. Not a single creature would die from an eyelid on their butt cheeks or an optic nerve in their forearm. We just never get these clearly non-fatal yet useless features. A common excuse (they DO have excuses, don\u2019t they?) that Darwinians use for this absence of evidence for randomness is that the \u201cexpense of energy\u201d killed off those who had that half a gram of skin flap on their thighs. This is despite the fact that the animal kingdom burns an average of about 40% of its abundant energy supply on play. If the energy it takes to carry around a two pictogram optic nerve in my forearm would kill me, I would already be doomed. Darwinism doesn\u2019t explain Punctuated Equilibrium. Popular belief among laypersons assumes evolution to be a slow, steady, slight change - as Darwin said it was. Darwin was wrong again. In a steady environment, species maintain a static genome, changing the same hot spots in their genome back and forth within a limited genomic range. Then, when they do change, they do so in large leaps of information, all at once. Evolution, when it does happen, is rapid and in large leaps. We do not get teeth by getting holes in the gums, followed by roots, followed by pulp, etc. We get full functional teeth all at once, just as we get all organs in full functional features. The cell activates a sequence if data when it is needed and ready, not before. Darwinism doesn\u2019t explain the actual mechanisms of evolution that we DO see, none of which are Darwinian at all. We see numerous mechanisms at work, known as Natural Genetic Engineering, or the genoplasticity of cells, who read, write and edit their own genomes. These mechanisms include endosymbiosis polyploidy, frameshifting, hybridization, viral, horizontal genetic transfer, transposition, chromosomal fusion events, epigenetics and the deletion, duplication, activation or silencing of genetic sequences. All of these mechanisms alter large amounts of genetic data all in one generation, thus not Darwinian gradualism, and very precise and predictable areas of the genome are affected, so none of them have been seen to be random. Upon closer examination, we see that these mechanisms are preceded by environmental monitoring systems, homeostatic regulatory systems and heavy intercellular communication, so the cells know what they are doing and the change is predictable. For example, in horizontal genetic transfer, cells in distress send out an SOS signal, to which another cell responds. The rescuing cell transcribes and packages up a needed section of their genome into a vesicle for transport. They then send the vesicle to the receiving cell, which imports it, opens the vesicle, and inserts the needed information in the genome, saving their lives. As this is happening under direct observation, at the same time, the exact same section of the genome is being transferred among countless other cells on the same plate. This process is a far cry from the \u201crandom copy error\u201d foolishness of last century\u2019s Darwinians. Darwinists don\u2019t even hope to explain the first life, an enormous hole that other theories DO explain. We only know that the only thing that has ever caused life is another life form. Millions of dollars and decades of attempts to create life from non-life have all resulted in the exact same thing: clumps of matter that sit there lifelessly, behaving NOTHING like life. Yes, Darwinians, we are all aware that you never claimed your failed theory COULD explain first life, but the fact remains that it CAN\u2019T, thus it is not just a legitimate answer to this question, but it is an enormous gap in your overall physicalist explanation. Teleological explanations, which are essentially revolving around intelligent fields of consciousness intentionally forming matter, are not only following evidence better than you, but easily answer your origin-of-life failure. Some Darwinians think this is a small failure or that, once they have a living organism, the rest of forming the diversity of life is a piece of cake. Wrong. If chemical accident is your creation theory, then getting one extremely lucky break is far more credible than ongoing incredible luck. Almost anything can happen once, just don\u2019t push your luck and expect ongoing constant lucky breaks. If somebody wins a card game with a royal flush, shake their hand. If they get a royal flush every time, CHECK their hands. Sure, it would be statistically impossible to get a fully functional 747 to form by a tornado in a junk yard, but it would be vastly worse odds to get that aircraft by starting with an engine, becoming a lawn mower, then a go cart, then a car, etc., all the while it must self-fuel, accidentally replicate and somehow gain an intelligent pilot, without stalling the engine or even leaking fuel.  All of this has to be the result of a long lasting tornado, which is consistently destructive to things we build. Darwin said God \u201cbreathed life\u201d into the first organism. In other words, he had no answer. If your theory needs a miracle to get started, you have nothing to stand on. Darwinism doesn\u2019t explain intelligence, self aware consciousness or intentional activity. Darwinism requires blind accident, which can\u2019t cause intelligent problem-solving skills. Chemical collisions can\u2019t cause awareness. Either intelligence is the original causal property of nature or we have no answer for free will, which clearly exists. Accidental intelligence is an oxymoron. Unintentional intention is impossible by definition. Trillions of organisms worldwide are performing trillions of functional movements daily and the physicalists have yet to explain a single one. If we are all bags of lucky chemicals can they just once show us a test tube with contents that do calculus or a thermal vent that sings Dixie? Darwinians claim that intelligence \u201cemerged\u201d, but that is not an explanation, even if it was true. And it isn\u2019t true. Intelligent agency is required for functional movements, especially complex functional activities like reproduction. There is no chance that any reproduction ever happened without teleology, thus it existed in the first living organism, if not before that. We wouldn\u2019t have even called first life alive if it didn\u2019t move or think intelligently. Experiments show that mice exposed to electric shocks when simultaneously exposed to the odor of cherry blossoms will learn to fear the smell of cherry blossoms. This fear of cherry blossom odor is also inherited by their children, even if the offspring were never exposed to the shocks and never see their fathers who were shocked. Intelligence is inherited, not a random chemical. If the fear of cherry blossoms is genetic, then it sure isn\u2019t random genetics. Neurologists also confirm that it is intelligent thought that forms the brain, not the other way around. Hebbian Law is the very cornerstone of neuroscience, and it always puts the thought first, then the brain formation for more efficient thought. If it had turned out that the brain forms the mind, rather than the other way around, there would be no way to explain how any of our thoughts, let alone nearly all of them, are coherent, functional or even relevant. Intelligence is to life as water is to wet. Any attempt to use the intelligent activity of life to \u201ccause\u201d intelligence is pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps. Darwinism doesn\u2019t explain how selection, a subtractive filter, can add anything. Selection can never \u201cselect\u201d anything that doesn\u2019t already exist in the first place. In other words, it doesn\u2019t cause anything. By basic chronological order, it is obvious that crediting selection for evolution is reversing cause and effect. Selection isn\u2019t even an actual thing that does anything at all. The very best it can \u201cdo\u201d is to NOT kill. To NOT do something is the passive state of doing nothing at all. There really is no third external party called \u201cselection\u201d doing something constructive to an organism. The organism does 100% of the work of evolution. Selection is just an unfortunate word invented by Darwin that is intended to make it seem like the organism is the passive recipient of something given to it externally. An extortionist also uses misrepresentative terms like \u201cinsurance\u201d or even \u201cprotection\u201d, but we all know they are not doing any good for the victim of their threats. Selection is no different. It does literally no good for evolution. Some Darwinians claim selection gives \u201cdirection\u201d. No, it DOESN\u2019T. It merely eliminates anything that hasn\u2019t correctly given ITSELF direction. In fact, selection is an enormous hindrance to evolution, because it removes the ability to take a few steps back in order to move much further forward. At least some of the dead creatures, the losers of the selection game, could have and would have been able to gain beneficial new traits, if they had survived. I can get from Mozart to Taylor Swift as long as you don\u2019t mind the ugly noise in between. Selection makes Darwin\u2019s Luck Theory worse because it does not accept the transition phase, even though his theory in intending to explain transition. Therefore, randomness itself is not the MOST destructive thing imaginable. Randomness, along with an unforgiving filter that demands constant success or else it kills, is even more destructive. Imagine a painter creating a portrait being decommissioned because her employer stopped her mid-way because it didn\u2019t look like a person while half completed. Selection is a merciless purveyor of death, not a help of any kind. Darwin never explained how competition for limited resources - selection death - can change the genome of a survivor. That doesn\u2019t even make sense. Some Darwinians, misunderstanding what breeders have known for centuries, think that selection actually does CAUSE new traits. They truly think that killing the unfit, CAUSES more fit to somehow magically appear, like the spouse who junks the old car thinking that will cause the money to buy a new car to magically appear. If you kill animals at the less desired end of the genomic range, there is no change to the genetics of those that lived. Hitler learned this the hard way, mass murdering not just Jews and other hated ethnic persons, but also those with physical and mental handicaps, assuming this would somehow create a master race. Of course it didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t ever work. What would have been the genome changer? For example, if the state of Wyoming wanted to increase the size of its buffalo by killing the smaller ones, it would not work. Buffalo have a genomic range of a half ton to 1.25 tons, so killing buffalo weighing less than a ton would lead to a population of buffalo from one to 1.25 ton, the maximum size their genome allows. NOTHING about death to others changes the genome. Eventually, when the killing stops, the buffalo will go right back to their genomic range of .5 to 1.25 tons. Darwin himself tested this idea with pigeons and found that he could not change the genomic range of the surviving pigeons any more than had the dead pigeons lived. It isn\u2019t as if your genes are taking a poll of survivors to see what genetic changes they should make. Nevermind that at the top end of physical size, the difference between the biggest and the second biggest is epigenetic, nutritional or glandular based. Genes don\u2019t try to get farther from a \u201cnorm\u201d that they aren\u2019t even aware of. They don\u2019t try to maintain a \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d by changing their genetics to move in a consistent direction. The idea that killing one creature changes the genetics of another is preposterous and has no explanatory mechanism. Darwinians never did explain the creation of a novel trait, the primary question in the first place. Selection obviously can\u2019t do such a thing, so what actually causes new functional traits? Luck. Darwinism is 100% a luck theory. Literally everything we see in the biosphere is all luck, according to Darwinians. Brilliant. If you really push a Darwinian for an actual cause of a genetic upgrade, once they find that you aren\u2019t impressed by an hour of discussing selection, they will mutter the word \u201cvariations\u201d under their breath, assuming that suffices to explain a cardio-vascular system with no leaks. Then they will quickly jump to discussing selection again, as if \u201cbeneficial traits benefit\u201d was the part being challenged. Mathematicians have consistently concluded that the odds of creating even a single averaged sized functional protein by luck would be 1 out 10 to the 77th power. To put this in perspective, there have been only 1 x 10 to the 40th power living organisms in the 4 billion year history of life and only 1 x 10 to the 18th seconds since the Big Bang. There is not the slightest possibility that Neo-Darwinism has ever created even a single simple trait. It literally never happened. Even the odds against the complex chemistry doesn\u2019t quite measure the enormity of the Luck Theory problem, even if we set aside the inevitable destruction. You still need functional movements to make the chemicals do more than they do in dead people or in vivo. Like the child who gets a prize no matter which plastic duck he retrieves from the pond at the faire, Darwinians think their only options are good or better, with an occasional bad to dismiss. They think the only possible changes to a monkey tail, for example, are long, short or medium length tails, like ordering fries at McDonald\u2019s. It never crosses their mind that the overwhelmingly vast majority of random options make it look less and less like a tail. Try putting peaches in a blender and ending up with pears. Random shuffling creates garbage and ONLY garbage. Oh sure, technically its possible for an asteroid to hit a distant planet and create a cityscape, but it isn\u2019t a viable theory to teach students. Ask a Darwinian what made a giraffe get a long neck and they will tell you \u201cbecause all the short necked ones died\u201d. At a few seconds thought this seems so simple you feel silly for asking. Then after a cup of coffee and a little thought, you realize they never actually explained how the genome of the giraffe changed to include the long neck, even if you do ignore that shorter necked creatures thrive just fine. Come to think of it, Darwinians never really explained anything. ",

            "answer_text": "The full title is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races (Species) in the Struggle for Life (1859). In that sphere, it doesn\u2019t fail to explain anything. It is a theory meant to explain how species originated by natural selection. However, for the mechanism of this theory to be able to function, hundreds of millions of years are/were required. This was hard to swallow for the religious community and some of less secular scientists, so it was met with some criticism. You have to understand that before Darwin\u2019s theory, there were bunch of other ideas about species and the age of the Earth. For instance, the creation theory says that god created Earth and every animal as they are about 6,000 years ago, and the species are fixed or unchanging. With this idea in mind, Carolus Linnaeus, devised a system of classification of living things in a logical order called Systema Naturae (1735). He also named human homosapiens and categorized us with primates. George Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, argued that species do change over generations (he speculated primates and human maybe related) but didn\u2019t believe species evolve into new species. Buffon also believed that Earth was over 75k years old and nature should be explained using natural laws rather than religious teachings. He published Histoire Naturelle in 44 volumes (1749-1804). Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\u2019s theory of transmutation of species was perhaps one of the first realized theories about evolution. It was met with a lot of criticism. He believed that microscopic organisms could appear out of unliving things and evolve to become more complex over time, ultimate goal being the human beings. He believed that animals evolve through time, for instance, giraffes stretching necks for leaves would make the necks longer from generation to generation. He also thought animals could lose or acquire new organs based on use or lack of use. As fossils of extinct animals became more frequent, George Cuvier promoted an idea called catastrophism, which stated that there were probably great floods or other catastrophes that killed off animals and gave way to new animals. William Paley a theological philosopher, advocated the idea of god as a watchmaker. In his book, Natural Theology or Evidence of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (1802) he tried to explain that god created the mechanism of animals. Like a watchmaker creates the parts, the mechanism and the watch, and sets it in motion to do it\u2019s job. Charles Lyell with further developments in geology, in three volumes of Principles of Geology (1830-1833), explained the fact that the Earth was significantly older than believed before, and that the same forces that guided the Earth today were in place from the early time. It served as conclusive evidence for theory of James Hutton called uniformitarianism. The idea that same forces have been governing Earth for all this time, helped Charles Darwin arrive at his theory. Charles Lyell was one of the first to estimate that Earth was older than 300 million years based on his studies. This evidence in turn was enough for Darwin\u2019s theory to be plausible\u2026 ",
