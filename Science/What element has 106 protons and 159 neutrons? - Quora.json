            "answer_text": "An element with Z = 106 is named Seaborgium (Sg), an American nuclear chemist who was responsible for the synthesis of all the actinide elements (primarily Z beyond 94 to 103) and proposed actinoid concept. He was awarded Nobel prize for his unique contributions. Sg with 159 neutrons will have mass number (A) = 265 and is highly unstable with half-life of the order of milliseconds. Incidentally it is the only element which was named after a living scientist though there was lot of controversy in naming it but finally accepted by IUPAC. ",
