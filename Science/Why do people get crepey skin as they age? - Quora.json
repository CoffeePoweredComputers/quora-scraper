            "answer_text": "People usually associate crow\u2019s feet and laugh lines with getting older. After all, as your skin ages, it loses elasticity and can start to show wrinkles and fine lines.  Watch video on Best Home Remedy For Wrinkles And Sagging Skin But these physical signs of aging sometimes have nothing to do with aging at all. Other lifestyle and environmental factors can take a toll on your physical appearance, including a poor diet, lack of sleep, and chronic stress. It\u2019s not just your imagination; those wrinkles in the mirror could have more to do with your daily habits than you think. To turn back the clock, be sure to address these major causes of wrinkles, and avoid the the foods that age you 20 years. It should come as no surprise that the biggest culprit for wrinkles is exposure to the sun. Both UVA rays, which penetrate the skin\u2019s deepest layers, and UVB rays, which cause sunburn, can lead to premature aging and wrinkles. Not only does staying out of the sun (and out of tanning beds!) protect you from skin cancer, but it will also keep you looking young. \u201cThe first and most common type [of skin wrinkling] is from chronic sun damage,\u201d MD, board-certified dermatologist, says. \u201cSun damage results in loss of collagen and elastin resulting in wrinkling of the skin.\u201d To protect your skin, be sure to wear at least an SPF 30 daily. When going out in the sun, especially if you\u2019ll be exposed to water, be sure to reapply your sunblock often and load up on these foods to prevent sun burn. 2 Pollution  You may not think much about the environment that you live in, but it can play a major impact on those deep wrinkles and fine lines. \u201cPollution is another environmental factor- contributing to free radical damage,\u201d explains MD, board-certified dermatologist and Director of the Dermatologic Surgery Center of Washington. In fact, a 2010 study published in the journal found that women who lived in urban settings had more wrinkles and age spots than those living in rural areas over a 24-year period. If you live in a heavily populated city, be sure to wash your face at night before bed to remove the pollution particles. 3 Lack of Sleep  You know getting enough sleep is essential to help you feel your best and can even help you lose weight. But did you know it can also help your skin stay smooth? \u201cLack of sleep contributes [to wrinkles] because the pH of the skin is altered by not sleeping enough and that skin cells\u2019 ability to remain hydrated,\u201d Skelsey explains. \u201cAdditionally, it\u2019s during sleep that toxins are flushed from the body.\u201d Be sure to get the recommended 6-8 hours a night for maximum health benefits; it\u2019s called beauty sleep for a reason. 4 Stress  A busy work schedule or personal drama not only takes a toll on your mental and emotional well-being; it can affect you physically, too. \u201cStress increases cortisol levels which will reduce the skin\u2019s ability to hold moisture,\u201d Skelsey says. \u201cAdditionally elevated blood sugar damages the collagen and elastin fibers in the skin. These are the critical support structures that keep skin from sagging and developing wrinkles.\u201d Try to find ways to de-stress, whether that\u2019s going for walks after dinner, hanging out with friends, or seeing a therapist. 5 Sugar  You already know that sugar causes weight gain, especially in your belly; it\u2019s why readers have found so much success with the zero sugar diet after eliminating it. But there\u2019s another reason to put down the sweets and the soda\u2014they age your skin. \u201cEating too much sugar will surely lead to premature aging. After sugar is ingested it goes through a process called glycation, which involves binding to different proteins in our bodies,\u201d MD, board-certified dermatologist of Goldenberg Dermatology, explains. \u201cUnfortunately, these proteins include collagen and elastin. By binding to these building blocks of the skin, sugar weakens collagen and elastin and will lead to an appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Glycation also produces toxic products that further cause premature aging.\u201d For maximum health and beauty benefits, try cutting out sugar for two weeks. You\u2019ll have more energy, lose weight, and start to turn back the clock on fine lines and wrinkles. 6 Squinting  If you\u2019ve been wearing the same old pair of glasses for years and are desperately in need of a new prescription, you\u2019re not just hurting your eyes. \u201cSquinting and other facial expressions are the result of muscle contraction. The more the muscles are used, the stronger they become,\u201d Goldenberg explains. \u201cThese muscle movements cause skin cells to be squeezed and wrinkles to form. Excessive squinting will, therefore, lead to deeper wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity.\u201d Visit your optometrist to get a proper prescription ASAP, and wear sunglasses whenever you\u2019re in the sun. 7 Drinking Out of a Straw  Save Sure, drinking darker liquids such as iced tea and cold brew out of a straw can protect your teeth from being stained, but it can also cause wrinkles to develop around your mouth. Similar to how squinting causes wrinkles around the eyes, drinking out of a straw creates fine lines on and around your lips. \u201cDrinking out of a straw involves muscle contraction around the lips. If this is done repeatedly, the muscles will become stronger and wrinkles will become deeper and more apparent,\u201d Goldenberg explains. 8 Dry Skin  Dry skin isn\u2019t just uncomfortable; it can add years onto your life. \u201cSkin that is chronically dry is also more susceptible to wrinkles,\u201d Skelsey explains. \u201cA dry environment can result in the skin losing some of its \u2018scaffolding\u2019 and succumbing to wrinkles.\u201d Make sure you moisturize day and night, especially on your face. Investing in a nourishing under-eye cream is also a good idea since the skin underneath the eyes is thinner and more susceptible to fine lines. 9 Smoking  This should come as no surprise: after the sun, smoking is one of the biggest culprits for wrinkles. Not only does the position of a cigarette in your mouth lead to fine lines, but the toxins from the cigarette itself can age your skin. \u201cNicotine in cigarettes causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the skin, which leaves it more prone to wrinkling because vital nutrients cannot reach the epidermis,\u201d Skelsey explains. Plus, smoking is linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. You\u2019ve probably heard this before, but it bears repeating: quit smoking ASAP! ",

            "answer_text": " Our skin can gradually become more loose and flaccid. But when the skin begins to feel thin as paper, the most common cause isn't aging. Crepey skin is skin that appears thin and wrinkled, bearing a resemblance to crepe paper. It also exhibits a loss of elasticity; when stretched, it does not return to its normal state as quickly or fully as it once would have. Unlike wrinkles around the eyes and mouth (that result from repeated muscle movements), crepey skin typically can be traced to sun damage. Over time, exposure to the sun breaks down elastin, the fibers in your skin that allow it to stretch and return to its normal position. The thin, loose skin also tends to develop brown \u201cage\u201d or \u201cliver\u201d spots and red broken capillaries. It most commonly occurs in areas of frequent sun exposure (e.g., under the eyes), but shaded parts of the body, such as the insides of the upper arms, may also adopt a crepey appearance. Sun damage is the most common cause of crepey skin, but it certainly isn't the only cause. Other common causes of crepey skin include: GeneticsSmokingPollutionDryness (dehydration) of skinSubstantial weight loss or gainInadequate sleepImproper nutritionCrepey skin usually begins to appear when you\u2019re in your 40s. But it can show up as early as your 20s if you are a chronic tanning-bed user or have gained and lost substantial amounts of weight. Over time, UV radiation breaks down collagen and elastin, which help prevent skin from thinning, stretching and wrinkling. Individuals with fair skin are especially susceptible to skin damage from UV radiation. Medications are another potential cause of crepey skin, such as long-term prednisone.
