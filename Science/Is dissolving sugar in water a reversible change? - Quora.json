            "answer_text": "Yes but it\u2019s not straightforward. If it was salt instead of sugar you could just heat the solution to drive off the water leaving salt crystals. If you wanted you could also condense the steam being given off and collect the water too. Sugar isn\u2019t like that. If you heat a sugar solution some of the water boils away but instead of nice crystals you get a concentrated sugar syrup. If you keep heating that the sugar will burn. The trick is to heat the sugar solution in a vacuum. The water boils away at a lower temperature, doesn\u2019t burn and gives you nice white sugar crystals. Industrially this is how white sugar is made. ",

            "answer_text": "Dissolving sugar in water is an example of a reversible change. Why i would tell you that chemical change produces new chemical products. In order for sugar in water to be a chemical change, something new would need to result. A chemical reaction would have to occur. However, mixing sugar and water simply produces... sugar in water! The substances may change form, but not identity. That's a physical reversible change. ",

But the problem is that the sugar is volatile solute and by evaporating the sugar also get evaporated So, this process can\u2019t be happen acc. to chemistry. Thanxx ",
