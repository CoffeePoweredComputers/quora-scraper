            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an excerpt of an article I have written on Inflation [Full article here: Inflation. Everything you Need to Know About it.] The first question that pops into our heads when we hear the word inflation is: Is it good or bad? And the answer will always be both yes and no. But before that, we should understand what it is, what causes it, and how is it stimulated or controlled? Inflation in its most basic definition is a sustained rise in prices. We can categorize it in two ways, the first way is the main categorization (i.e. type) and the second way is how fast or which way it goes (i.e. magnitude and direction). We can start with the first categorization that gives us two main types of inflation: Cost-push inflation: it occurs when the economy starts to overheat due to excessive growth activity. It can be explained by a simple imbalance in demand/supply powers where demand increases at a faster rate than supply. This type is usually controlled through a hike in interest rates and a decrease in money supply. Raising interest rates discourages borrowing for businesses and thus slows down the economy. Another effect of this is that it makes the currency more attractive as an investment and thus it appreciates in value. An appreciating currency has a deflationary effect.Demand-pull inflation: it occurs when there is a general hike in global commodity prices or taxes. It is determined by the supply side. Intuitively, when commodity (raw materials) prices rise, the firms\u2019 costs rise as well, and to combat this, they have to raise prices in order to keep their margins. An example of demand-pull inflation can be a gradual significant rise in oil prices. It is worth mentioning that this type of inflation is not desired as it is accompanied by a fall in the standards of living and due to the fact that governments cannot do much about it.Now, we can categorize inflation according to how fast it moves or in which direction: Regular inflation: This is the usual 2\u20133% expected annual rise in prices. It is the desired and targeted inflation level for many developed world countries as it can be controlled and does not hinder business and economic growth by much.Disinflation: This is a fall in the rate at which inflation increases. For example, if inflation rose by 1% last year, a disinflation happens when inflation rises by 0.5% this year. It can be a warning signal that we are approaching a risky deflationary zone.Stagflation: This is a relatively rare type where inflation is high and increasing while the economy is stagnating, and unemployment is high. The term was first used by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Iain Macleod. This type of inflation can be considered the ultimate nightmare to central bankers as they do not really have much to combat it.Deflation: Although it may seem like a good thing given that deflation is the general fall in prices, it has its repercussions over the long-term. When prices fall and consumers are happy in the short-term, businesses may suffer from decreased margins and may resort to lay-offs to survive.More types of inflation: Shrinkflation: This phenomenon occurs when prices stay the same, but firms reduce the size of their goods. Hence, it is another form of a price increase. Imagine 100 grams of a good priced at $1 in the form of a specific size bag. Shrinkflation occurs when the firm keeps the good at $1 with probably the same bag but usually fills it with 70\u201380 grams of the good. Therefore, the consumer sees the same product but in reality, there is less of it, thus, paying the same price for less.Hyperinflation: It is a rapid uncontrollable rise in inflation. Usually happens in times of war and turmoil and not necessarily in developing countries. It has occurred in Germany and Russia before. There is not an exact percentage increase per year to signify inflation, but some people consider a 50% per month can be considered hyperinflation. The most notable of example is Zimbabwe in 2008 when the inflation rate reached 79,600,000,000% per month (That is 79 Billion percent).Inflation has its effect on Asset Prices. For a trader or an investor or even simply an average citizen, knowing the effect of inflation on wealth is important. We can summarize these effects below: Equities: If inflation is around expectations, equities should perform positively. During high inflationary periods, equities do not perform so well and are generally negative. And finally, in a deflationary environment, equities are also negative due to the decline of the economic activity.Fixed-income: A higher inflation is typically negative for fixed-income securities. As inflation can spur a rate hike, bond prices have to fall (Remember the negative relationship between bond prices and their yields). Fixed-income bonds are the most exposed to inflationary risk. If an investor has a bond that promises 3% a year when inflation is at 4%, the net gain is -1%. Return should be on a real basis (With inflation accounted for) rather than on a nominal basis (Without inflation). During normal times, the returns are relatively stable for both short and long-term fixed-income securities. When inflation is higher than expected, bonds perform poorly as prices drop due to rising yields. With deflation, bonds perform positively due to the fact that future fixed cash flows have a bigger purchasing power.Commodities: Although the relationship between inflation and commodities is becoming more and more complicated over time, it is generally thought of as positive and many commodities can be seen as an inflation hedge (e.g. Gold).Currencies: A slowly rising inflation can have a negative effect on currencies up to the point where investors expect a rate hike, then the effect becomes positive because the currency will be more attractive if it pays a higher yield.Real Estate: If inflation is around expectations, real estate doesn\u2019t move much and remains relatively the same. If inflation is above expectations or high, then it has a general positive effect as real estate values go up with inflation. During deflationary periods, it is a negative impact as prices start declining.",

            "answer_text": "How are the Feds Coping with Inflationary Pressures? The short answer is on how inflation is measured and what components of the economy are used. The Feds rely on the Consumer Price Index (basket of goods and services CPI) and its components are used to fine-tune other economic series for price changes and interpretation of these indicators into inflation-free dollars. The resulting blend of indicators renders the purchasing power of a consumer's dollar measured against the exchange in value of goods and services that a given dollar will buy at a given calendar time. Episodes of high inflation can often be attributed to lax monetary policy. If the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes. There is agreement among many economists about the proportionality distribution between excess currency circulation and prices. This relationship between money supply and the size of the economy is known as the quantity theory of money, and is one of the oldest hypotheses in economics. Central banks use a target inflation rate to modulate economic growth, money supply and consumption but if inflation gets out of hand it could mean that the target inflation is not under control or that the commitment to a target is not strong enough for political reasons. The world in general and in the US in particular, have enjoyed low inflation and abundance of goods to choose from for an extended period of time which, can be explained by a combination of sound economic policies and technological change. Technology has also increased productivity, thereby reducing the costs of inputs to a unit of production. Most economies have now flattened productivity gains, nonetheless, inflation is still low? Analysts are studying and trying to explain a new wave of productivity based on a \u201cshared economy\u201d mainly, based on the effects of international trade and the expansion of other means of production. Some of this added productivity is coming from resources that used to be idle but are now participating in economic growth. A good example of the share economic expansion is Uber\u2019s-- car sharing and Airbnb's--home sharing economic models. Additionally, as the world\u2019s population gets older, another component of change must be included with its impact on changing demographics and how it can exert inflationary pressure in the short and long run. Finally, the effect of globalization is changing traditional economic statistical metrics to include new methods to asses its effects on share economies. The extended period of low inflation and interest rates is nearing its end as the accumulated effects of the economic variables suggest that expectations in the financial and commodity markets will translate to changes in price levels in the larger economy. The shift is mostly driven by an increase in investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation. In the United States, prices of inflation-protected bonds imply that investors currently expect consumer prices to rise and the Trump administration policies may be playing a role. Largess in tax cuts and increased spending will result in hundreds of billions of dollars more in Treasury bonds being issued in the coming years which mean the government will have to pay higher interest rates to find buyers of that debt. As a result, the Feds are facing economic realities unrelated to politics and must apply the traditional equation of [New Debt-Maturing Debt = Primary Deficit + Interest Payments]. In other words, the government must issue new debt to cover the primary deficit which is-- the difference between non-interest spending and revenues\u2014the principal on debt, and interest payments on past debt. This economic reality is inescapable no matter how Trump massages his economic policies and his rosy scenario messaging to the public. ",
