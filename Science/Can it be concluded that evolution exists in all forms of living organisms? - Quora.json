            "answer_text": "No. In fact just the opposite. The true and most logical conclusion is that evolution has never occurred. Even if the evolutionists claim that evolution, means changes. This on the surface seems to be true. But this is not what the evolutionists are saying when they say change. Their change is based upon their understanding that all of the different kinds of lifeforms, were the result of one lone \u201ccommon\u201d ancestor that is the common ancestor to all of the different kinds of organisms on up to today. So when they say change, while, what they are wanting you to think, a bacteria can become resistant, or an offspring is not identical to the parents, they are wanting you to accept that one kind of lifeform, like a bacteria, will change so much that one of its descendants was supposedly able to become all of the other kinds of organisms. But what they are saying is not what has happened. Which is what is observed, whenever we see a puppy born to a dog. An ape baby born to a mother ape. And this cuts the legs out from under the fallacy of evolution. Because what is observed is not what they claim to have happened. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s helpful to think of evolution not as a process but in fact as an outcome of many different processes under certain conditions. The conditions are very simply described: Populations comprise slight differences in individualsIndividuals reproduceThe differences are inherited by the offspringThe environment contains features that inherently favour some individuals more than others due to their differencesIn that situation, it is said that evolution is bound to be an outcome. Note that these conditions don\u2019t specify, and nor do they require, that the populations are made up of living organisms. Evolution happens in computer programs and in every kind of system that meets these conditions. When it\u2019s broken down like this, you can probably see why that\u2019s the case. Evolution is a simple, mathematical result. The environmental pressure acts like a giant sieve. The pieces that can fall through won\u2019t all fall through instantly, but after enough time gently shaking it, eventually they all will, and the remaining pieces will be only those that are not filtered out by that particular sieve.

            "answer_text": "Evolution doesn\u2019t \u201cexist in all forms of living organisms\u201d. Evolution is the process that describes how all living organisms are successful or not. One never knows what trait will be successful, it all depends on how successfully the population of organisms overcomes environmental challenges. Since the environment is always changing, traits that were not so important yesterday can become a dominant reason for evolution to be dramatic. Fish in the ocean are becoming smaller, and less fertile, since we\u2019ve removed the really big ones, and smaller fish have fewer eggs/offspring. Also, mature fish that are small get through the nets, to have more small offspring, that have fewer eggs. That is the response of a species to an environmental challenge, also known as evolution. ",

            "answer_text": "Evolution occurs in all things. Evolution is change and is part of the physical law of entropy in which all things are devolving into more chaos. Stars go through an origin and evolution dealt with in the science of astronomy. Minerals go though that process as well, and is dealt with in the science of geology. In biology, living cells and cellular organisms go through evolution that involves the instructions in DNA for building the living cells. The non-living viruses that require a living cell to infect and grow in also undergo evolution of their RNA or DNA in which their viral structure evolves to take advantage of whatever living organisms will support their survival as a virion and infection plus growth in a new victim. Biological evolution generally occurs via mutations which are in general deleterious but the beneficial ones help the survival of the species as long as the current environment allows it. Evolution exists in all forms of living and non-living matter! ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Can it be concluded that evolution exists in all forms of living organisms? A: Technically, evolution exists between generations of all forms of living organisms. The organism themselves do not evolve: the population does, by passing on their genes with variation and then be subjected to natural selection, and over time. There may be periods of equilibrium, simply because the population has reached peak efficiency for that particular environment. But if they move elsewhere, or something happens that changes the environment, then the population undergoes rapid evolution to adapt to the new environment. The only organisms that don\u2019t undergo this process are those that are extinct. ",
