When coming through Ellis Island the guy in front of him declared his name to get George Ferguson, and the next guy said, \u201cSam Ting.\u201d Yes, the number of protons is the \"Sam Ting\u201d as the atomic number.

Carbon is number 6, with 6 protons, and a variety of possible neutron configurations, including the famous  isotope. ",
