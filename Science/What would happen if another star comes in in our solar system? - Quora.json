            "answer_text": "Well, if the star also had a collection planets with it, there would probably be some trading of planets. The orbits of the planets surrounding each star would start changing well before the star passed though, and would continue to change for a while after. The star would have to get pretty far away before the orbits around each would stabilize again. It is entirely possible that the star could pass through without hitting anything. There is a lot of empty space in the solar system. But certainly some things, including planets, will fall into one of the stars. Additionally, both stars' course through the galaxy would be altered. No really telling what the effect of this would be. ",

            "answer_text": "If a star as big as our own sun comes anywhere near our solar system alot can happen 1. If it comes through the plane of our solar system (the approximate alignment of planets in one plane) it can detract outer planets and cause them to either wander away or capture them in its own gravity, depends on its gravitational strength. 2. If it comes perpendicular to the plane it can cause sharing of planets or cosmic collisions. Either way its an havoc. But if a star 10x size of sun comes by, the story is simple TL;DR : It sucks it all including sun and we never existed in universe ",
