            "answer_text": "An hydraulic or pneumatic system consists of: a power source, either a hydraulic pump, or an air compressor a control system of valves,(either manual or electrically controlled) a source for interacting with the environment,( either cylinders, rotary actuators, or motors) connections between the components (usually hoses) an appropriate fluid (hydraulic oil, or compressed gas, usually air) When all this is connected appropriately the operator is able to exert forces that are beyond normal human ranges, either in power, speed, or accuracy, to accomplish work. Systems can be purely one or the other but air over hydraulics are not uncommon. Hydraulics tend to be messy as pressures are very high and leaks seem inevitable. Pneumatics tend to be faster and cleaner, but do not have the rigidity or inherent power of hydraulics. Air is compressible and hydraulic fluid, like other liquids is not. ",

            "answer_text": "In the most basic sense, you're turning pressure into force and motion. You can achieve mechanical advantage by having two different diameter cylinders connected via a hose - at a given pressure, a large diameter piston will travel less and produce more force, and a smaller diameter piston will have more travel but less force. The biggest difference between pneumatic and hydraulic is that gases are compressible and liquids are not. ",
