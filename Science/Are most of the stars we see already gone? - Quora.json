            "answer_text": "Do you watch Cosmos? If not, I really recommend you to watch it.  The fourth episode is titled: A Sky Full of Ghosts Tyson begins the episode by retelling the tale of astronomer William Herschel and his father having an evening stroll on the beach. William asks his father, \u201cDad, you do believe in ghosts?\u201d His dad replied, \u201cYes son. But not the paranormal kind of ghosts. Look up. You see those stars? What if I told you that you\u2019re looking at a sky full of ghosts? Many of the stars you\u2019re seeing right now are already dead because light from them took a lot of time to reach us.\u201d While William\u2019s dad may be right about those stars being dead, it\u2019s not very likely. A star\u2019s lifetime comprises of several billion years. Our own star, the Sun, formed around 5 billion years ago, and it\u2019s predicted that it will live for another 5 billion years until it turns into a Red Giant[1] and finally a White Dwarf[2]. The death process of a star includes a lot of stuff. About 0.1% of the stars in the night sky may be of the kind which suddenly explode and are dead in a very less time. Usually, for stars like the Sun and most of the stars in the night sky, the death process (yes, they have a process of death) lasts a few billion years; depending on the star\u2019s nature. Sometimes, stars die turning into a red giant, and then a white dwarf (like the Sun). Other times, they may turn into a red giant, expand more into a red supergiant[3], then result in a supernova[4] explosion and finally turn into a neutron star or even a black hole. This whole process takes a lot of time. Also, changes are easily observed a few million (or thousand, depending on the star) years after the process begins. So, when you talk about stars being dead in the night sky, especially the stars which you can see using your naked eye; nope, that\u2019s not quite possible. You\u2019re only seeing about 9500 stars in the night sky with your naked eye, you can\u2019t see more; quite contradictory to the well known psuedo-fact that you see millions of stars. There are millions of stars; but you can\u2019t see more than 10,000 of them. Yeah, feel free to count them in case you\u2019re really curious!  These stars which you see in the night sky, are not more than a few hundred thousand light years far away. Some might be as close as a thousand or a few hundred light years. This means that we\u2019re seeing them right now as they were around 10000 to 100000 years back. So, if at all any of the stars are undergoing their death processes, they couldn\u2019t have begun very long ago; at most a few million years. So, their death would easily take a few hundred million years or even a few billion years more. However, there some selected few who are really really close to their death. They\u2019ve already come to the end of their death processes (end is around 100,000 years here). One example is Eta Carinae.  It is relatively close to its supernova explosion stage. In the 1840s it underwent a massive paroxysm, just short of a supernova. One the one hand, Eta Carinae may last for quite some time (possilby 50,000 years more), whereas on the other hand, it won\u2019t be incorrect to assume that it is already dead, since it is a good 7500 light years away. All in all, no, most stars that you see in the night sky are alive and going very well. They\u2019re not dead, and won\u2019t be for quite some time. In fact, some of them may even last longer than the Sun. The thing is, the stars which we see are way too close, and their death processes are way too slow that they might end up dead while the light being transmitted to us is of the time that they were alive. It\u2019s possible, but the odds are strongly against the possibility. Hope this helps :D Footnotes[1] Red giant | Wikiwand[2] White dwarf | Wikiwand[3] Red supergiant star | Wikiwand[4] Supernova | Wikiwand",

            "answer_text": "You asked: \u201cAre most of the stars we see already gone?\u201d The short answer is: NOThe longer answer is: Yes (Well, kinda - it\u2019s complicated. Here is why) First that is a good question, since as you know, we are basically seeing everything as it was back in time. We are seeing the Moon the way it was about 1.3 seconds ago, we are seeing the Sun the way it was about 8.3 minutes ago. Light propagates at about 300,000 KM per second, so we are seeing everything the way it was in the past. Amazingly enough - even in \u2018normal small scales\u2019 - that works out to light propagating at about 1 foot per nanosecond. So even when you look across the room, you\u2019re really seeing the far wall the way it was 10 nanoseconds ago. Watch a football game and the touchdown in the far end zone was actually 300 nanoseconds ago. EVERYTHING we see is the way it was in the past. So, the answer is sorta \u2018yes\u2019, because when we look at stars in the sky, they are all many many years back in time from us. The closest other star is over 4 light years away, and many are 400 or 4,000 light years away from us. For curiosity sake - here is a list of the Sun, and the 15 next closest stars to us. Sun - about 8.3 light minutes from EarthAlpha Centauri star system- Proxima Centauri \u2013 4.24 ly- Alpha Centauri A - 4.36 ly- Alpha Centauri B \u2013 4.36 lyBarnard's Star \u2013 5.96 lyWISE 1049-5319 \u2013 6.5 lyWolf 359 \u2013 7.78 ly (Resistance was NOT futile!)Lalande 21185 8.3 lySirius star system- Sirius A \u2013 8.58 ly- Sirius B \u2013 8.58 lyLuyten 726-8- UV Ceti - 8.73 ly- GI 65 B - 8.73 lyRoss 154 \u2013 9.68 lyRoss 248 \u2013 10.32 lyWISE 1506+7027 \u2013 10.52 lyEpsilon Eridani - 10.52 ly (Yes - that Vulcan!)OK, now here is why \u201cNO\u201d is really the answer to your question, explained simply\u2026 when we look up with our naked eyes, bigger and brighter and closer stars are easier to see, while smaller and dimmer and farther stars are more difficult to see. And here is the meat of the whole thing.. the farthest away star that we can see with the naked eye, is only about 16,000 light years away. That\u2019s all. Every star that we can see as an individual star when we look up, is inside our galaxy (inside the Milky Way), and it is 16,000 light years or closer. Most of them are actually much, much closer. Stars generally live for billions of years, and since we are only looking a few thousand of years back in time, that means that everything we can see with our naked eyes would almost all be alive - and burning (fusing) away just fine. NOW - when we start looking with telescopes, that all changes. There are stars in the Milky Way which are visible as individual stars, which are nearly 60,000 light years away. We can resolve them as individual stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. And we can also see individual stars in other galaxies which are many millions, or even billions of years back in time. Recently, a gigantic blue star nicknamed \u201cIcarus\u201d was discovered (with a little help from Gravitational lensing) and it\u2019s is 9 BILLION LIGHT YEARS away. Considering that Blue Giant stars may only live some 10\u2019s or 100\u2019s of MILLIONS of years before consuming all their Hydrogen and Helium - Icarus is long since dead. Stars which are millions or billions of light years away are much much more likely to already be dead than those which are visible to the naked eye, and only several thousand light years away. And technically, we can even see the collective \u2018glow\u2019 of stars further out than what we can resolve individually. So we are seeing photos (or other electromagnetic radiation) from these stars, even if we\u2019re looking at a galaxy which is (due to the expansion of the Universe) now 20 or 50 billion light years away. Many of those stars are most likely dead - even if we can\u2019t resolve individual stars that far away - there would be new stars which are burning away there, which we have not yet seen be born. BUT, the short answer is: NO, most of the stars we see are NOT already gone. Not with our naked eyes at least. Most of the few thousand stars we can see with our eyes are only several thousand light years away, and almost all of them would be alive and well. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to very popular belief, it is likely that none of the stars you easily observe with the naked-eye are already dead, with a very short list of possible exceptions. This is because human vision is so weak that almost all of the objects we can view without a telescope are only a few dozen, hundred, or thousand light years away. Since low-mass stars live for many billions of years, and high-mass stars millions, it is unlikely anything significant has happened in a handful of centuries to the relatively few stars we admire in the night sky. All this being said, the short list of naked-eye stars teetering at death's door which might already be dead (but probably aren't) include: Eta CarinaeBetelgeuseAntaresIt should be added that those stars will die rapidly and dramatically as supernovae. Low and intermediate-mass stars experience drawn out deaths taking eons to complete. Arcturus and Aldebaran are examples of naked-eye stars in the midst of their lengthy demise. ",

The Milky way is about 100,000 light years across. The further out you look and the more distant the galaxy, the greater the precentage of stars will have died in the time it took their light to reach us, but it will never be the majority because the majority of stars are red dwarfs and their average life-span is older then the age of the universe. A percentage of stars that we see, especially when looking at very distant galaxies, are probably now dead, but likely never a majority. ",

This is because we see the stars because of their light, and light travels at a finite speed. One light year is the distance light travels in a year. So if a star is 10 light years away, the light from it that is reaching us now took 10 years to get here. So we see that star as it was 10 years ago. All the stars that are visible to the naked eye are close enough that it is quite improbable that any of them have died since the light currently reaching us left them. Most of the stars you can see are a few hundred to a few thousand light years away. The farthest is about 16,000 light years away while the closest is just over 4 light years away. A few thousand years is insignificant in the lifespan of a star. ",

The only individual stars we can see are all in our own Milky Way galaxy; and the Milky Way galaxy is only 100,000 light years in diameter. That means that in the time it took light from the most distant star in our galaxy to reach us, that star has aged only about 9 ten-thousandths of 1 percent of its life span. Hardly enough time for any star to grow old and die. ",

Because stars are so mind numbingly distant from us, it takes light on the order of 4 to 10,000 years to reach your eyes. You are continuously seeing the stars the way they were 4, 5, 6, 10, 100, or even 10,000 years ago. It is always possible that a very tiny few may have burned out or exploded but you will neither see them suddenly vanish nor observe them briefly getting thousands of times brighter. The lack of light or the bright increase in light has not yet reached us. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is speed of light. It takes roughly 8 minutes for the light from our sun to reach the Earth - and about 4,3 years for the light from Alpha Centauri to reach us. The distance light travels in a year is called - tadaa - a light year, and this means that when you look at a distant object, you do actually see it in the past, not the present. This is also true if you look at a person in your living room, but the speed of light is about 300.000 km/sec making the \u2018past\u2019 and \u2018present\u2019 virtually identical when we are talking about a few meters - but with a star a million light years away, you see it a million years in the past. So, if you invent instanous travel, grab a hugely powerfull telescope and goes to Alpha Centauri to look at the Earth - you\u2019ll see Obama as the president of United States of America, not Trump. If you use it to go about 66 million light years away - you\u2019ll see dinosaurs roaming \u2026 ",
