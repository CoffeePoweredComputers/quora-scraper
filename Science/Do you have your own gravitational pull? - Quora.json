Gravity is very weak, it takes a large mass for it to be noticeable. And, dispute appearances, I have not acquired that much mass yet. ",

I read once in a discussion on Astrology that the doctor and nurses in a delivery room have far more gravitational \u2018pull\u2019 than any astronomical object! Realistically, people are not born under the sign of Taurus, but under the sign of Nurse Jones! ",
