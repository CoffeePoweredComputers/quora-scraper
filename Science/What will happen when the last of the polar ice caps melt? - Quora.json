            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t hold your breath it\u2019s going to be a while. We are living in the quaternary glaciation that began about 2.5 million years ago. For the last million years or so we have had a fairly regular cycle of ten or fifteen thousand years of climate similar to present, then a hundred thousand years or so of much cooler climate, example being a couple miles thick sheet of ice in parts of what is now the United States. The Earth has been cooling generally for the last few thousand years of our current Holocene interglacial that is twelve thousand years or so old. In the next few thousand years we will enter another glaciation, and before that we will experience lesser cool periods like the Little Ice Age and other warm periods like our current Modern Warm Period. There is no evidence of any process that might melt the polar ice caps in the near future. Of course, in a few billion years the sun will vaporize us all and the polar ice caps with us. ",
