            "answer_text": "Synonym How to Calculate Valency by Clayton Browne, Demand Media This is a graphic representing a molecule of gypsum, a common material used in construction. The valency of an element measures its ability to combine with other elements. The valency is determined by the number of electrons in the outer shell of each atom of an element. All atoms with two or more electron shells are most stable when they have eight electrons in their outer shell, but only a few elements are naturally formed that way (neon, for example), and most that just have one or two electrons in their outer shell (lithium, for example) or six or seven (oxygen, for example) tend to react, or combine their outer-shell electrons with the outer-shell electrons of other adjacent elements to bond and form more stable multi-element molecules.

The periodic table is organized by groups in rows and columns, and the elements of groups I-VIII have the same valency as others in their group. All the elements in group VIII have eight electrons in their outer shells, and thus have a valency of zero (highly stable). Elements in group I just have one valent electron in their outer shells and thus have a valency of one, which means they are very reactive. Group IV/valency 4 elements like carbon are relatively stable. Group VI and VII elements like oxygen are also reactive as they seek electron pairs to complete their outer shell octet. Step 2 Calculate the valency of an element using the total number of electrons. The valency of an atom is equal to the number of electrons in the outer shell if that number is four or less. Otherwise, the valency is equal to eight minus the number of electrons in the outer shell. The number of electrons in each shell of an atom is regular so if you know the number of electrons in the atom, then you can calculate the valency. All atoms (except hydrogen) have two electrons in the first electron shell, and up to eight electrons in each succeeding electron shell. For example, carbon has six electrons, two in the first shell, and four in the outer shell, giving it a valency of four. Oxygen has eight electrons, two in the first shell and six in the outer shell, giving it a valency of two (8 - 6 = 2). Step 3 Calculate the valency of multi-element molecules using the same procedure. For example, to determine the valency of the ionic molecule phosphorus tetraoxide (PO4, four atoms of oxygen and one atom phosphorus) you multiply the total valency of the four oxygen atoms (valency 2) and subtract that from the valency of the phosphorus atom (valency 5). That reveals the valency of PO4 is 3.

            "answer_text": "For s block elements, it is easy to find the valency. Of the element belongs to group 1 of the periodic table then it will have a valency of +1 and if it belongs to group 2 then it will have a valency of +2. If you talk about p block elements, then you can find out their valencies by writing their electronic configuration and then finding out the number of electrons in the valence shell and accordingly find out their valencies. Example: Chlorine: atomic number 17, number of valence electrons in valence shell is 7 so it will accept one electron to achieve its octet or noble gas configuration. Hence its valency will be 1(or you can say -1 also). Note: chlorine also forms covalent bond that is the bond formed by sharing of electron(s) instead of donating or accepting them. Carbon: atomic number 6, number of valence electrons in valence shell is 4. It is difficult to accept 4 electrons to achieve its octet and also difficult to lose 4 electrons to have 2 electrons in first shell because in both of these cases it will not at all be stable. Hence carbon forms covalent compounds by sharing is electrons. If you talk about d block elements, then you can't actually know which element has what valency because all the d block elements show variable valencies. Example: Iron shows two valencies- +2 and +3, similarly Copper also shows two valencies- +1 and +2. ",

For metals, it is equal to the number of electrons in the outermost shell of their atoms, and for nonmetals it is eight minus the number of electrons in the outermost shell. Elements lose or add electrons only to become more stable. To calculate valency you must have to calculate the outer shell electrons for that you have to know electron configuration. When you say 20 you are talking about Calcium. The electronic configuration of Ca is [Ar]4s2 or you can write in this way(junior level) K=2, L=8, M=8, N=2. In the both cases the outermost electron number is 2. So if it loses 2 electrons then it will obtain stable noble gas ( Ar) configuration. Therefore valency of calcium is 2. ",

You can do this by simply writing out the electronic configuration and then arranging the electrons in subshells. After that, if the element belongs to the S or P block then you can get the valency by the group number or 8-group number depending on whether it's a metal or not. If you, however, get a element that belongs in the d block then you will have keep in mind the general trends. For f block, there is no such general rule so you have to remember the elements by their sub-groups. Hope you found this answer helpful. ",
