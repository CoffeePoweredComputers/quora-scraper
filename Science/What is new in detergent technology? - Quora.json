The new method for producing liquid detergent lies on the fact that dry components are mixed with other liquids, such as water, to make a solution out of the \"older detergents\" (between quotation marks  because the formula has changed). Most detergents are based on sodium hydroxide (NaOH) but some new technologies have been invented and are starting to be used, such as enzymes to fasten the process of cleaning [1].   Recently, more concentrated liquid products have been introduced. One method of producing these products uses new high-energy mixing processes in combination with stabilizing agents.
