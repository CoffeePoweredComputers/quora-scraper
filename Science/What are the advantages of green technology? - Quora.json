            "answer_text": "Here the advantages of the green technology are given below and to know more visit this article. Green technology (also known as environmental technology, clean technology or green tech) is the application of environmental monitoring, green chemistry, environmental science, and various technological processes for environmental protection. This term is also used for sustainable energy production technologies such as wind turbines, bioreactors, recycling, photovoltaics, etc. Also, environmental technology may be related to electronic devices and gadgets that promote the sustainable resources management. Green technology (also known as environmental technology, clean technology or green tech) is the application of environmental monitoring, green chemistry, environmental science, and various technological processes for environmental protection.  Many people think that this technology is a fairly recent phenomenon, but its origins date back to the beginning of the last century \u2013 just remember the electric taxis and different types of windmill. Even wave and solar energy are applied more than a century. However, widespread use of green technology has begun in the early 1990s. Green technology includes different technological processes to protect the environment or to revive and repair already damaged ecosystems. In general, all green technologies can be divided into two very broad groups: technologies that deal with global warming and sustainable technologies. There are many examples of environmental technology application (in different fields), and some of them are: Recycling \u2013 includes solid waste management, waste incineration technology, different types of wastewater treatments, and other eco-friendly waste recycling technologies.Renewable (alternative) energy technology \u2013 energy production from renewable natural resources such as sun, water, wood, wind and so on.Water purification \u2013 in addition to water purification technologies, various activities and environmental campaigns have been organized to help purify water around the world.Air purification \u2013 it refers to green technologies and cultivation of plants to remove CO2 and keep air fresh.Sewage treatment \u2013 green technology similar to water purification.Environmental remediation \u2013 the removal of contaminants or pollutants for the general environment protection.Energy conservation \u2013 the utilization of electrical devices that use smaller amounts of energy; this leads to the decrease of electricity consumption which causes less consumption of fossil fuels.Advantages of green technology to the environment are enormous, but the most important benefits are: It uses renewable resources that never depletes in nature. Therefore, future generation can benefit from them too, without harming the planet.Environmental technology uses latest energy generation techniques. For example, green nanotechnology that uses green chemistry and green engineering is one of the newest in green technologies.Offers environmental solutions for disposal and recycling of waste. It effectively changes waste production in a way that it doesn\u2019t harm our environment.Green technology has no adverse effect on our planet and it uses sustainable production of energy.This technology uses various innovative methods to create a number of environmentally friendly products.In information technologies, green technology (or \u201cClean Tech\u201d) is the application of gadgets as well as other devices, which reduce energy consumption and save the environment. Some of these well-known IT applications include: the hybrid and electric cars (with great fuel efficiency);solar cells / panels; smartphones or smart phone-car tech; computers and tablets that use less battery power; energy efficient monitors; Industrial Internet and cloud computing. With each passing day, the number of these green devices and gadgets is growing! ",

            "answer_text": "The main goals of becoming a green manufacturing company are to: Use fewer natural resources;Reduce pollution and waste;Recycle and reuse materials; andModerate their emissions during production.This requires anyone wanting to go green manufacturing to research, develop, or implement smart technologies to help them determine the best practices to lower their impact on the environment. For small to medium manufacturing companies, it could be as simple as refreshing yourself on what is modern manufacturing and understanding the concept of lean manufacturing. Well, other than the sense of pride you\u2019ll feel from saving the planet and keeping it habitable for all living things, there are also smart financial rewards to reap when you go green manufacturing, you\u2019ll be happy to know. If you follow the green manufacturing definition properly, you can expect to see: Lower material costs;Decreased overhead expenses;Increased employee morale;Reduced downtime; andJob creation (admittedly, this last point is circumstantial to how your business adapts to a green production model).",

So, either the Power gets used, or wasted with a Heat Load!) 3) Cutting Peak Power Usage: Cycled Air Conditioning  4) CFL & LED Lights throughout the house.

Many different approaches are being tried on small scales now , but many are fast approaching commercial scale. Solar photovoltaic and wind, substitution of natural gas for coal, energy conservation, net zero building technologies where in the cold and temperate earth zones, buildings are being constructed that are super well insulated to provide a livable climate with almost zero energy use. Novel fission reactor designs and fusion reactors are also in the works and will soon be tried, although these could still be decades away from commercial deployment. ",
