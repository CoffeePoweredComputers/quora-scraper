            "answer_text": "Yes. Having been with my mother when she was preparing to pass (and then passing), my father as he approached death, and four cats who\u2019ve passed (one from oral cancer, one from kidney failure, one who was just ancient at 21, and one who had a myriad of things that got him at 18.5), I can say that without a doubt, people and animals take on a smell within days of their death. The best way I can describe it is if you spilled orange juice and milk on the kitchen floor together, and the milk soured. This is why I\u2019m certain that my cat, Stanley, is not dying, but is merely having one of his worst-ever flare ups of stomatitis, herpes, and now severe dehydration\u2014despite what the vet said. I lost three cats in three years\u2019 time (2014\u201316), and ALL of them had that fruity weird smell in the last few days before they croaked (along with exhibiting certain behaviors). Stanley smells just slightly like yeast, which is the smell of infection. Since he has stomatitis, meaning his mouth is a flaming auditorium of ulcers and abscesses, that\u2019s infection. It can be bacterial or fungal. (Side note: cats with these issues as well as IBD, pancreatitis, and renal insufficiency or kidney disease can flare up and \u201ccrash\u201d\u2014look absolutely near death, but with the correct treatment intervention, recover and go back to normal. But not all vets recognize this and many suggest euthanasia when there is a very good chance that with treatment, in two weeks, kitty will be fine.) But yes. Impending death (within a few days of departure) has a smell, as does actual death. They are different, but distinct. And though diabetes smells sweet, it does NOT smell like dying. Dying is unmistakeable. Once you\u2019ve smelled it on a living being that\u2019s in the process of leaving, you will never forget it. ",

            "answer_text": "Death smell Has anybody experienced the smell of death? By that I don\u2019t mean the smell of a rotting cadaver or a dead human body. Let me explain. I will cut a long story short, hopefully without being disrespectful to anybody. My wife had a girlfriend, let\u2019s call her J, who was dying of cancer in a Danish Hospital. J was in her final stages and had only weeks to live. My wife decided to fly to Denmark to be at J\u2019s side and see if she could comfort her or help in any way. Both J and my wife are from Singapore and know each other for many years. As my wife entered the hospital room where J was bedded, my wife smelled a putrid smell, which she describes as a \u2018death smell\u2019 but could not describe it any other way. It was an odor she had never smelled before. My wife stayed in J\u2019s hospital room in an extra bed for over a week. She insist that even after having a thorough shower THAT death odor was still on her, my wife\u2019s, skin. After several days of further unsuccessful treatment the girl was flown back to Singapore accompanied by an expert medical nurse to die. As it happened I was present at the religious \u2018sent off\u2019. But that is unimportant for this story. This is now 4 years ago. Now to my story. J\u2019s husband, although European, decided to move with his European company back to Singapore, partly for better job prospect and partly since their two boys have closer ties to his decease wives family and for all intent and purposed look more Asian than European. The husband let\u2019s call him A, just recently met this girl S, which he feels is perfect for him. She loves his boys, she is intelligent, good conversationalist, good looking, independent, ophthalmologist [eye surgeon], all in all they fit like hand in glove to coin a phrase, A is over-the-moon. BUT, she had breast cancer and one mastectomy two years ago and is still on medication for another two to three years. They dated several times, got on like the proverbial house on fire and agreed to have an \u2018adult sleep over\u2019. All good so far. However, at the moment of close contact A could smell the death odor on her skin, the same as he encountered from his wife. It immediately caused an erectile dysfunction. My wife is the God-mother of his and J\u2019s children and they, A and my wife, have a good relationship and A confides his personal problems in my wife, as he has no close friends in Singapore. All good and above board as far as I am concerned. I myself cannot contribute to this discussion, because I have not experienced death odor but I am interested to hear from the world wide audience on Quora. One thing I want to add, A has had, since his wife passed away, several intimate encounters with local [Asian] ladies, all successful and uncomplicated if you get my drift. He is adamant that this is NOT a recall from when his wife was ill. He is well past this, it is well and truly a closed chapter. He feels that Death is knocking on the door of S and is scared to take this relationship further in case the emotional cost will be too high. ",
