            "answer_text": "No, for two reasons. First, there is very little gas in the stratosphere compared to ground level simply because the pressure is so much lower. I haven\u2019t done the math recently, but something like 90% of the atmosphere is in the troposphere, while the troposphere is (if I remember correctly) the smallest volume of any layer. Second, helium in any atmospheric level will be buoyant compared to other gases. It\u2019s not gonna stop moving until it escapes the Earth entirely. ",
