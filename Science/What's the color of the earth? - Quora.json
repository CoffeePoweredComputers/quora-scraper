            "answer_text": "There aren\u2019t really any colors on Earth, or anywhere else for that matter. Colors exist solely as perceptions; they are created by our visual systems (our eyes and brain) in response to the stimulus of electromagnetic waves over a relatively narrow slice of the EM spectrum. Your eyes can distinguish, under the best of conditions, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2\u20133 million different colors or shades, and that\u2019s it. And I\u2019m afraid I have to disagree with a couple of the other answers. The \u201cprimary colors\u201d (typically red, green, and blue when dealing with light, or \u201cred\u201d (actually magenta), \u201cblue\u201d (cyan), and yellow when dealing with paints, pigments and the like) are really nothing special; they\u2019re simply that collection of three colors than can cover the majority (but by no means all) of the colors that can be seen. Your eyes do not really see in primaries. There are three different sorts of color receptors in the retina (which is why it does take three colors to provide reasonable \u201cfull color\u201d coverage), but their response curves really don\u2019t correspond to single specific colors but rather broad ranges that have a considerable amount of overlap. So it is not true that the full range of color available to human vision is determined by just three colors, nor is it true that that range is in any sense \u201cinfinite.\u201d ",
