            "answer_text": "AlCl3 is a covalent compound formed by sharing of electrons. Electronic configuration of Al: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p1 Electronic configuration of Cl: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5 Aluminum has 3 valence electrons and can form 3 bonds with 3 chlorine atoms. Hence 3 bonds are formed by only 6 electrons but it is not following octet rule. Electronic configuration of Al after forming bonds with Cl atoms: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p4 Aluminum has 1 vacant orbital. Thus Al can form one more bond. This bond will be a coordinate bond.  Therefore AlCl3 always exist in a dimer form (Al2Cl6). 3 sigma bond and 1 coordinate bond per Al atom. Thus octet rule is satisfied. ",

            "answer_text": "Octet rule: As the name suggests it is number eight rule means eight electrons needed to fill orbitals. this law is limited to quantum no. = 2 In the case of AlCl3, if we draw the covalent structure of AlCl3, Al has 6 valence electron and not having 8 valence electron so it lacks electrons and an electron-deficient compound so it is not able to follow the octet rule and also a lewis acid .similar examples are BF3, PCl5. Octet rule can be expanded up to 18 which is also known as 18 electron rule which required ns, np, and nd orbital filling. ",
