            "answer_text": "By definition, it is the 1s orbital, which correlates with the 1s electron energy level, which is defined to be the lowest such level. The Uncertainty/Indeterminancy Principle tells us that for atomic electrons that we can\u2019t know both their positions and energies to suitable precisions, so a choice had to be made. Since everything is more closely related to their energies, we opted for knowing their energies and it is from their energies that we know them, label them. Their positions, therefore, devolve into being probabilities that aren\u2019t very well defined. So \u201c1s\u201d is a label we slap on electrons that have the lowest energy in any atom. If you compare their actual energies, you will find that the 1s energies from different atoms are really quite different. The only thing that distinguishes them is \u201clowest.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your point of view. Flavio Matsumoto is correct, the most energy is released, when populating the 1s orbital, so it is at its lowest possible energy state. But if you are asking which orbital has yielded the lowest energy, is easiest to ionize, it is the first valence electron orbital for that element. ",
