            "answer_text": "Hey there, My advice would be to not decide based on marks and availability. These two years should ideally form a nice base for your college career. Consider your long term goals and focus on subjects that you feel you would be forced to encounter later on. So if you're planning to take Maths in the future but not any other subject in the science stream then don't take the science stream. Take some other stream that offers maths and maybe other subjects that you will compulsorily learn when you take math in college like computer science. All that said, these are 2 very important years in your schooling education- whatever you decide to take, take them seriously and endeavour to give your best. Hope this helped and All the best! ",
