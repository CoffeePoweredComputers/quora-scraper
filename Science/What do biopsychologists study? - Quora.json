            "answer_text": "Psychologists try to understand how our minds work and how people behave. Its different sub-disciplines emphasize various aspects of human behavior or bring in special tools to study people. Social psychologists, for example, study how we interact with each other while sensory psychologists focus on vision, hearing, taste, etc. Biologically oriented psychologists study how our bodies, genes, physiology, evolution, and brains influence us. This is one of the founding works of evolutionary psychology. It offered ideas about how the behavioral differences between men and women might have evolved. It also proposed hypotheses about the evolution of many other human behaviors, such as language, empathy, and altruism.  Another topic that\u2019s clearly both biological and psychological is emotions. This book looked at emotions and feelings from an evolutionary and comparative point of view, proposing hypotheses about how smiles, frowns, blushing, and other facial expressions might have evolved. These studies relied heavily on comparisons between humans and animals. More modern scientists have extended this research into other biological fields including neurophysiology and endocrinology.  Amazingly, the author of these works was a geologist and biologist who made his reputation studying the geology of coral atolls and the biology of barnacles. Even though he published long ago, his books remain some of the great founding documents in evolutionary psychology. Neuroscience has long been an important sub-discipline. This guy, Lashley, is another founder of modern biopsychology. He tried, without much success, to discover where, in the brain, memories are stored.  This guy was one of the pioneers in the study of how hormones influence sexual behavior in lab rats, another topic having both biological and psychological components.[1] When I was in graduate school, his X-rated illustrations of rats were a part of most courses in physiological psychology.  Genetics has always been an important sub-discipline. The second author of this work, John Fuller, was my mentor. When I knew him, he was studying the genetics of brain size in mice.  This guy was more of a bit player in his field. He studied genetics, endocrinology, biochemistry, nutrition, and other biological influences on food intake, obesity, and taste. Again, both biology and psychology are essential to understand these topics.  Footnotes[1] The National Academies Press",
