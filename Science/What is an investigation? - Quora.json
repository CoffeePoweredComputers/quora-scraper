It can be either OVERT or COVERT depending on what are the operative condition. If the investigation is being done in an hostile environment and there are chances that people responsible for lapses will temper with the evidence or block the investigation- you go covert; which means you do not disclose the correct reason for gathering information and collect data in disguise.
