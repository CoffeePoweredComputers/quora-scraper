            "answer_text": "Pure water is not visible in the liquid or vapour state. When we see it, it either has something in it to give colour or particles, or there is an interface. That is we can see the line between water and air or water and another liquid such as oil. This occurs because the difference in refractive index of the two materials means that light rays coming at an angle (i.e. not exactly perpendicular to the surface) have the angle changed when they go into the other medium. Now: why can we see steam from a kettle? Because what we see is a cloud of tiny droplets of water, just like a cloud. Each drop has an interface so light does not come straight through. If you look carefully you will see a gap between the cloud and the kettle spout. This is what engineers mean by steam, a colorless gas of water. Air is visible in two conditions. First as bubbles in liquid. Again the kettle first makes dissolved air come out. Sometimes water from the mains will be cloudy because of tiny bubbles, but these will settle out. What you are seeing is the air in the water, acting just the same as water drops in air in a cloud. If you have ever seen a coke brazier, the air above is wavy. Now of course, this is the combustion gases, but the same thing can be seen above a hot plate, where it is just air. The hot air has a different refractive index from the cold air, so light passing between them gets slightly bent, though not as much as air and water. ",

            "answer_text": "If we spent our lives in vacuum, then we'd think that both air and water were transparent fluids. We'd notice that air does bend light far less than the water does(refractive index of water is more than that of air). In a vacuum environment, a clear bag of air would behave less like a lens, if compared to a clear bag of water. Actual classroom demonstration: get an aquarium full of water. Fill a water-balloon. Now hold the balloon submerged in the aquarium, and let it release the water. See anything? Nope. This obviously proves that water is invisible. :) And if we had a gas-filled environment, and then released the contents of a gas-filled balloon, we could prove to ourselves that gas is invisible. No? We are airfish, living at the bottom of the nitrogen ocean, and firmly convinced that gas is an invisible material. Here's yet another perspective: suppose that you're about 1000KM tall. You bend down, cup your hands, and scoop up some of Earth's atmosphere. Lift it high into the vacuum. It looks like translucent light-blue smoke! The KMs-deep pool of air in your hands makes your palms a bit hard to see. Pour it out again, and as it falls it forms a brilliant sky-blue plume against the blackness of space. Obviously air is far from invisible. ",
