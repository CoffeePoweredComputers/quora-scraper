            "answer_text": "The uncertainty principle is true because another thing is true: on the level of individual particles, their properties do not behave like numbers. This is very weird, very difficult to digest, but this is the fundamental truth behind quantum physics. Specifically, these quantities are not commutative, so we have [math]pq-qp\\ne 0[/math]. (In this case, [math]p[/math] and [math]q[/math] can represent anything, but in common notation, [math]p[/math] would be the momentum and [math]q[/math], the position.) But these non-number quantities have another special property: sometimes, they behave like numbers. When one of the quantities of a system happens to behave like a number, the system is said to be in an eigenstate (half-German, half-English word) with respect to that quantity. But here is the thing, however: Imagine a system that is simultaneously in an eigenstate with respect to [math]p[/math] and [math]q[/math]. If that were to happen, we would have [math]pq-qp=0[/math], according to the rules of ordinary arithmetic. This violates our fundamental discovery about the quantum world, namely that [math]pq-qp\\ne 0[/math]. This contradiction is resolved when we realize that when the system is in an eigenstate with respect to [math]p[/math], it cannot be in an eigenstate with respect to [math]q[/math] at the same time. In short, if [math]p[/math] is a number, [math]q[/math] is not, and vice versa. What this means is that measuring [math]p[/math] (that is, interacting with the quantum system using a measurement apparatus in a specific manner) puts [math]q[/math] in a state in which it has no well-determined number value. Or alternatively, we can try to measure [math]p[/math] and [math]q[/math] simultaneously, but cannot do so accurately; the error, or uncertainty in the measurement must be large enough such that [math]pq-qp[/math] deviates from 0 by the requisite amount. As to why Nature behaves in this manner, why fundamental quantities do not behave like numbers\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not a question physics can answer. You have to ask priests or philosophers. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to your question is beautiful. Here ,I only explain the logical basis behind the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle :It is a very famous principle that follows from the De Broglie Hypothesis. De Broglie suggested a brilliant but 'difficult to digest' idea in 1924. He proposed that all moving bodies have a wave nature ..i.e, it has properties of both particles and waves . It has a dual nature.Moreover he suggested that it is a completely general one that applies to all.However, for massive bodies ,say a moving bus/car or any daily life stuff we see with our naked eyes, it can be easily showed that the wave nature is super negligible , therefore we don't interpret them as a wave. But for the particles at subatomic level , like electrons, the wave nature cannot be underestimated at all .Since a subatomic particle has wave nature, it should have a wavelength .It was named De Broglie wavelength , given by the formula :wavelength=(h/momentum)where, h=Planck's Constant.Note:It is clear from this formula,that the momentum can be calculated if the wavelength is known.i.e, momentum=(h/wavelength) .Remember this ,we will need this a few seconds later.Ofcourse this was a very unconventional idea.Yet his theory could explain otherwise mysterious data like :Why does the electron revolve around the nucleus only in orbits in which it's angular momentum is integral multiple of h/2\u03c0,i.e, it explained why the Bohr quantisation of angular momentum worked.But it had consequences. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is one of them.This is how: It is difficult to digest that a particle behaves as a wave because of obvious reasons. I mean the particle is localized in space while wave is spread over a region of space.Now we move on to understand the logical basis for the uncertainty principle. If the moving object is a particle, it has a position at certain instant of time. So it does not have a wavelength (because a particle does not have a wavelength,.. It is localized in space). Remember the De Broglie Formula I mentioned above?..momentum=(h/wavelength).. The momentum can't be measured if wavelength is not known. So in this case , the position can be known but not the momentum.Now let's go to analyse the wave nature . If the moving object behaves like a wave instead , it has a wavelength and therefore you can measure it's momentum from the above formula but it has no position (because a wave has no position, it is spread over space).So this time the momentum can be measured but not the position.Now let me say you that a quantum system has a strange feature that when you measure it , you disturb it and your measurement affects the system. But before measurement it exists as a superposition of it's various states. So before you measure, the moving object has a dual nature . But when you try to measure it's precise position, you force it to show it's particle nature (only a particle/body has a precise position) and that renders it impossible to measure it's wavelength and therefore it's momentum can't be measured. When you try to measure it's momentum , you force it to show it's wave nature (because momentum is associated with the De Broglie wavelength) and therefore it's position can not be measured.This is what Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says us,i.e, one can not measure both position and momentum of a particle simultaneously and precisely with unlimited accuracy. To measure one of the above quantity precisely ,one has to compromise with the accuracy of the other quantity .Edit : I have tried to answer your question in simple words,without using a mathematical proof taught in a quantum mechanics course ,using the non-commutativity of position and momentum operators, so that a normal man can understand the logic behind this . If you want a mathematical proof it can be found is most standard quantum mechanics text book. I hope it helps. :) Edit 2: For those who might get the impression that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is about our limitation or inability to precisely measure the position and momentum, I want to stress on the fact that it's not. Infact it's a property of the quantum system that it fluctuates. I don't want to go deep into this in this context since it's not the question at hand, and there's a lot in it to say if I get started, but I do encourage you to go ahead and do some research about experiment conducted by Yuji Hasegawa, a physicist at Vienna University of Technology, Austria to learn the latest answer to the question whether uncertainty principle is a measurement problem or a property of the quantum system. Infact I want to note one more important thing that the mathematical form of uncertainty principle we use in our university papers and books is not even Heisenberg's. It was given by another guy named Kennard, so we are using Kennard's uncertainty principle. And Heisenberg did give his own uncertainty principle in a slightly different mathematical form and he himself considered it to be measurement problem but today we know that he was not correct about it. I highly encourage the reader to go ahead and search about 1. Kennard's uncertainty principle, 2. Experiment conducted by Yuji Hasegawa regarding Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. That's all ! Have a nice day :) ",
