            "answer_text": "Physicists and mathematicians are people too, and people enjoy fantasizing, telling outlandish stories, competing with each other to \u201cblow your mind\u201d with some absurd story about physical reality. String \u201ctheory\u201d (in quotes because the definition of a scientific theory requires that it can be tested / verified / falsified, and string \u201ctheory\u201d is only math, not physical, not testable) will not deliver on anything because the universe is made of forces, not numbers. Numbers can only describe these forces, numerically, and in relation to each other. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that any theory is false if it uses more than 3 dimensions or more than 1 fundamental force. Hence, string theory was dead in the water at its inception and so was General Relativity (GR). Fortunately, scientists are going to replace GR soon enough; my only hope is that they should look for a replacement of string theory as well. In fact, they should replace any theory that uses more than 3Ds or more than 1 fundamental force - that\u2019s virtually all of them. The one force of nature is the EM force which is generated by EM fields which are generated by electric charges. Hence, future theories should be based on EM fields i.e. a form of EM field theory. This means that string theory will never deliver on these outlandish ideas. The clue is in the question via the word \u2018outlandish\u2019. ",
