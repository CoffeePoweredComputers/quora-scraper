            "answer_text": "The way I think of it, the sciences follow experiences of various kinds, like observations and experiments, that can be quantified, or expressed in a formula. They follow a rational/ empirical approach to the exploration of what exists. A clear example is Chemistry. Generally speaking, the Humanities deal with values, art, creativity, and \u201cphilosophizing about\u201d the sciences, art, history, religion, etc. These topics may contain observations and experiences of certain kinds, as food for thought, too. So there is some overlap between, say, physics and metaphysics. For example, is the concept of a Multiverse a concept of physics, or metaphysics? Philosophical Physicists and Philosophers who knew their physics disagree on that question, and others, related to their interpretations of quantum mechanics. But while we can make a \u201crough & ready\u201d distinction between the humanities and the sciences, we cannot make a hard and fast, logically necessary, mathematically quantifiable distinction between the \u201ctwo.\u201d It is a deep philosophical question.

            "answer_text": "Science, in terms of college fields, is a field base on experiments involving data collecting and mathematics. Which is the reason why the fields under science are always undergoing experiments and logical statistic analysis as their research. Humanities, in terms of college fields, is base on interpretations involving human behavior. Which is the reason why the fields under humanities are always undergoing study of historical arts and literature as their research. In conclusion, the difference between humanities and science is that science is base on logic and experiment while humanities is base on interpretations made into tertiary source. Meaning that science is objective while humanities is subjective. That is the main difference between them. ",
