            "answer_text": "Heat can be transferred from one place to another by three methods: conduction in solids, convection of fluids (liquids or gases), and radiation through anything that will allow radiation to pass. The method used to transfer heat is usually the one that is the most efficient. If there is a temperature difference in a system, heat will always move from higher to lower temperatures.  A thermal infrared image of a coffee cup filled with a hot liquid. Notice the rings of color showing heat traveling from the hot liquid through the metal cup. You can see this in the metal spoon as well. This is a good example of conduction. CONDUCTION : Conduction occurs when two object at different temperatures are in contact with each other. Heat flows from the warmer to the cooler object until they are both at the same temperature. Conduction is the movement of heat through a substance by the collision of molecules. At the place where the two object touch, the faster-moving molecules of the warmer object collide with the slower moving molecules of the cooler object. As they collide, the faster molecules give up some of their energy to the slower molecules. The slower molecules gain more thermal energy and collide with other molecules in the cooler object. This process continues until heat energy from the warmer object spreads throughout the cooler object. Some substances conduct heat more easily than others. Solids are better conductor than liquids and liquids are better conductor than gases. Metals are very good conductors of heat, while air is very poor conductor of heat. You experience heat transfer by conduction whenever you touch something that is hotter or colder than your skin e.g. when you wash your hands in warm or cold water. CONVECTION : In liquids and gases, convection is usually the most efficient way to transfer heat. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. As this happens, cooler liquid or gas takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This cycle results in a continous circulation pattern and heat is transfered to cooler areas. You see convection when you boil water in a pan. The bubbles of water that rise are the hotter parts of the water rising to the cooler area of water at the top of the pan. You have probably heard the expression \"Hot air rises and cool air falls to take its place\" - this is a description of convection in our atmosphere. Heat energy is transfered by the circulation of the air. This thermal infrared image shows hot oil boiling in a pan. The oil is transfering heat out of the pan by convection. Notice the hot (yellow) centers of rising hot oil and the cooler outlines of the sinking oil. Image courtesy of K.-P. M\u00f6llmann and M. Vollmer, University of Applied Sciences Brandenburg/Germany.  A thermal infrared image of the center of our galaxy. This heat from numerous stars and interstellar clouds traveled about 24,000 light years (about 150,000,000,000,000,000 miles!) through space by radiation to reach our infrared telescopes. RADIATION : Both conduction and convection require matter to transfer heat. Radiation is a method of heat transfer that does not rely upon any contact between the heat source and the heated object. For example, we feel heat from the sun even though we are not touching it. Heat can be transmitted though empty space by thermal radiation. Thermal radiation (often called infrared radiation) is a type electromagnetic radiation (or light). Radiation is a form of energy transport consisting of electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light. No mass is exchanged and no medium is required. Objects emit radiation when high energy electrons in a higher atomic level fall down to lower energy levels. The energy lost is emitted as light or electromagnetic radiation. Energy that is absorbed by an atom causes its electrons to \"jump\" up to higher energy levels. All objects absorb and emit radiation. ( Here is a java applet showing how an atom absorbs and emits radiation) When the absorption of energy balances the emission of energy, the temperature of an object stays constant. If the absorption of energy is greater than the emission of energy, the temperature of an object rises. If the absorption of energy is less than the emission of energy, the temperature of an object falls. ",

            "answer_text": "there are three ways by which heat energy can be transferred.1. ConductionThis method is mainly in Solids; When you heat one end of a metal rod, the atoms at this end gain energy and start vibrating faster about a fixed point, the faster vibrations lead to the heat energy being transferred to their neighbour atoms and so on until the energy is transferred all the way to the other end. We say heat has been conducted in the rod.2. ConvectionThis is common in Gases and Liquids; when you heat a beaker of water using a flame, the atoms at the base are first to gain the heat and they start moving faster and expand slightly making the water at the base at lower density than the temperature at the surface, therefore, the water at the bas moves up to replace the uppermost layer of atoms which, when it moves down, gets heated up and rises once more to replace an upper layer. We visualise the liquid as a number of horizontal layers and that each two layers interchange their positions at all times therefore heat is distributed around the whole liquid.Convection currents ( the interchange of layers) takes place from down to up which is why if you try to heat a liquid from above it will not work very well. Same Process happens with gases, this is how air conditioners units work.3. Radiationthis is how we get the heat from the sun; the heat transfers by radiation when there is no medium for the heat to flow in as well as when there is a medium. convection and conduction require a medium to take place.
