            "answer_text": "Scientific research conducted in the pursuit of commercial profit refers to the creation of knowledge so that it can be used specifically for the acquisition of wealth, by its nature often done by private companies. This is in contrast to research conducted by governmental agencies which are usually non-profit, so that the information gained from research belongs to the people. This essay shall explore the merits and demerits of commercially oriented research. The basis of scientific research is gaining knowledge and in its use, often to improve the world. In both respects this commercially driven research proves to be superior, as research is done more efficiently and limited resources are focused on relevant places where its use is most needed. As such, commercial research often treads across moral boundaries. The lure of profits often cause scientists to override morality, Stem-cell research, for example, holds great potential for profits as a promise of an elixir of life, able to replace every part of the body and provide eternal youth. Such a technology would increase the life of many, as well as the wealth of the researchers. Unfortunately, it entails the destruction of life. Embryos, precursors to human babies, are destroyed to provide the stem-cells for the research. Some scientists have no qualms about this destruction of life, presumably for the advancement of science, but evidently for the pursuit of profit. Lastly, privatization of knowledge may impede scientific progress sometimes, instead of increasing the rate of research. Scientific research involves working on previous knowledge to create new knowledge. The invention of the printing press led to the Industrial Revolution as knowledge was more easily shared. With the privatisation of knowledge, scientific information becomes a currency to be closely guarded and not to be shared. As such, many companies working on similar projects waste resources to research repetitive information that has already been discovered, thus slowing down the overall rate of research. ",

That knowledge can also help with theories and teaching and different varieties of things that knowledge can be useful for. For example, A teacher who has done their scientific research knows so much more and can teach their students from what they have learnt so in actual fact it\u2019s as if that single student has done their scientific research because they are learning the same thing as the teacher did. Another example would be that if you are proving your theory you need to have done some scientific research in order to prove your theory and also to improve your thoery further. Moreover, you can back it up against with other huge scientific figures in history as that could make your theory more reliable. Key things that some people want to know before they believe the theory is if that person did their scientific research. From this you know that scientific theory is really underrated and seen as not important when you don\u2019t know the full extent of how useful and important it is. ",
