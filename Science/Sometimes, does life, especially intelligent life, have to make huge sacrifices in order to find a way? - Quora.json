            "answer_text": "Not at all. Sacrifices are never needed. Giving and receiving are one. Give someone a smile, you'll receive one back. Give someone a nasty remark, you'll most likely receive the same back. What's unique about it is the more you give, the more you have to give. Give someone a smile, you'll receive one back, which will make your smile even brighter. So if you want more of something, give it, don't sacrifice it. Many, for example, will sacrifice peace for money. Then they receive neither. If you want more peace, give peace. Be peace. ",
