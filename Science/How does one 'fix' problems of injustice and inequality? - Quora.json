            "answer_text": "The founding fathers of the United States of America knew how to answer your question. \u201cWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\u201d [1] The first step when fixing anything is identifying what is broken. If your car won't start because there is no gas in the tank, replacing the battery will not start the car. If \u201cjustice\u201d is broken, \u201cinjustice\u201d is the natural outcome. Likewise, if \u201cequality\u201d is broken, \u201cinequality\u201d is the natural outcome. The second step in fixing anything is figuring out why it broke. If there is no gas in the car's tank, it's because the last person to drive it didn't add more gas to the tank. Or possibly, someone has siphoned the gas. Justice If justice is broken because the law does not cover the perceived injustice, and so the perpetrator cannot be held accountable, then fix the law. If justice is broken because the law would cover the injustice, but the perpetrator found a loophole to avoid the law, then fix the law, or find a snag in the loophole. If justice is broken because people's feelings were hurt by a lawful action that was perceived as hurtful, then the injured party ought to act like an adult and talk with the injuring party, gently explaining to them why what they did hurt, and that it would be preferable for them not do it again. Perhaps the parties can come to a middle ground. If justice is broken because the involved parties can find no middle ground, and so injustice becomes inevitable, then change the law to benefit both parties and so create a middle ground. Either that, or one party or the other needs to leave the environment which bred the injustice. Equality \u201cAll men (mankind = also women) are created equal.\u201d People are born with no material wealth of their own. They might be born into families who have acquired material wealth, but each infant leaves the womb materially poor. What they each have is equality under God and under the law as a living and breathing person. This means each person can seek opportunities to improve their lives via the use of their life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. It does not, nor should it ever mean that each person has a right to what someone else has worked for in the use of their life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. If there is true inequality, it is because someone has forgotten that they are not God and that someone else has the same rights as them. At that point, refer to above about justice.

            "answer_text": "I believe that we can \u201cfix\u201d problems of injustice and inequality. As I see it, it all comes down to massive Unemployment and Poverty. If we solve these then we solve it all. This is because the essence of Racism is the fear that the propertied class has of the Unemployed and the Poor. Because that is typically (but not always) colored, there is a bias that colored people are inferior. No allowance is made for the fact that for the first 250 years of the Black American experience in the USA, it was illegal to teach a Black American to read. It\u2019s well known that children learn mainly at home \u2014 but with this home heritage handicap, the Black American has almost always been at an artificial disadvantage. (IQ tests, e.g. are mainly literacy tests.) Back to the question. How can we fix it? Here\u2019s my proposal: Teach Small Business principles in all Public Schools to all children, starting with Primary School every year through Secondary School.This alone can orient all children to the artificial Global Marketplace into which they will all soon be thrown.If we did this, then I predict that in only one generation we\u2019d see the end of Unemployment and Poverty as we have known it. The vast bulk of our social and economic problems would begin to resolve \u2013 child hunger, crime, gangs, drug abuse and political radicals. Once these problems fade away \u2014 fear of colored citizens will also fade away. Also, the resentment that colored citizens have traditionally borne against the propertied class will fade away \u2014 because with Full Employment, nobody will give a damn about Income Inequality anymore. It will be a different world. Some will say that this is too easy. Yet I see it as the easiest and most intuitive non-violent solution. Others will say that my projected outcome is too optimistic. I say it is realistic, and I invite AI/ML computer models to test my projected outcome. I don\u2019t advocate all people becoming small businesspersons. I advocate all children knowing how business works, to make them better employees, and to know how to survive during recessions.All Big Businesses started as Small Businesses, so the principles transfer easily.It\u2019s no good to teach Trades in Public School, because nobody can guarantee in ten years which Trades will be glutted with workers, or even exist.Yet Small Business principles have lasted for centuries with only minor changes.",
