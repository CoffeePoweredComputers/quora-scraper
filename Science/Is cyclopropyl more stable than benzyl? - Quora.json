            "answer_text": "If you are asking about the stability of carbocation, then benzyl carbocaton is more stable than cyclopropyl carbocation due to resonance. However, cyclopropenyl cation (3 membered ring with 1 double bond and a positively charged carbon ) is much more stable than benzyl carbocation due to aromaticity. The order of stability is as follows: aromaticity> mesomeric effect > resonance > hyperconjugation > inductie effect. ",
