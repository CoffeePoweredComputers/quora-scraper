            "answer_text": "I assume you must be having vast knowledge about science as well as mathematics. If the answer is yes, then these are the best ways to make money you can adopt: TUTIONS: You can teach students, by doing tuitions. Believe it or not, you can earn much more than you think if you teach science and mathematics well. You can also teach online tuitions. Freelance in you aren\u2019t teaching tuitions. BLOGGING/YOUTUBE: I would suggest you to start a science blog or a YouTube channel. If you adopt either of these methods, you won\u2019t only earn money, but would help people(students), and increase your knowledge as well. EDUCATIONAL APP: You can even create an educational android/iOS app. But, for that, you have to invest money. There are other ways too, like affiliate marketing or content writing, but for that, you may need to learn new skills. But the aforementioned ways are best for you. If I were in your place, I would first start tuition classes and do freelancing and earn enough money from there so that I can invest in creating my website. I would simultaneously do tuitions and work on my website for 6 months. After I would be sure that my website is generating enough revenue, I would become a full-time blogger and after next year, I would decide to make my app. THANKS! ",

If you luck in skills, you will not be able to earn more and for a longer run. Just explore everything. Don't make stuck your life with the limited option without even exploring thousand of things because later you will regret for it. ",
