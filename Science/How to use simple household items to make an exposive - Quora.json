            "answer_text": "Hi. Remember that 1980s television show, MacGuyver? Most of those homemade explosives had zero chance of working, and I will tell you why: adulterants. These are not pure chemical reagents but mixtures which happen to contain a dilute oxidizer. I studied inprovised munitions extensively and have read every manual ever printed, from government as well as subversive sources. Most \u201cexplosives\u201d created entirely from common household chemicals are not explosive at all\u2026 they are incendiaries which combust and burn, if they successfully ignite. Yes, it is \u201cpossible\u201d to make RDX or PETN from common chemicals\u2026 which you will need to spend a lot of money purchasing before spending days creating a series of precise reactions with professional laboratory glassware\u2026 it is actually easier and safer to make crystal meth\u2026 but how many years did you study Chemistry at university? None? Well good luck with that. May as well attempt to make Sarin nerve gas instead, that should go well. Here is a dirty little secret of improvised munitions: they are notoriously unreliable. Very high probability of a misfire or a dud. The chemicals are unlikely to be found in your household either\u2026 they tend to be highly corrosive industrial chemicals you need a protective suit and a respirator to handle. Every heard of Astrolite? Wonderful stuff, easy to make, versatile, powerful as a tac nuke\u2026 but the primary ingredient is \u201canhydrous hydrazine\u201d\u2026 the Nazis used it to fuel the V2 rockets. If you inhale the fumes your lungs will melt and you will drown in blood\u2026 something the manual neglected to mention. Then there is the old standby, nitroglycerine. The main ingredient is \u201cfuming red nitric acid.\u201d You add sulfuric acid to this to make a powerful explosive which will spontaneously explode in your face if you do it wrong. You need to add glycerine as a stabilizer and slowly mix the acids while the pan is immersed in a salted ice bath while contstantly monitoring the temperature. ANFO is a mixture of Ammonium Nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil. It is a real PITA to fabricate because it is hard to get the good stuff nowadays\u2026 it is all prilled to resist moisture and break down over time, so have fun feeding it through a coffee grinder\u2026 also, purchases are monitored and you need to show ID. If you get the ratio wrong or it does not properly mix, you will be left with a dangerous and incriminating dud. Dangerous? Yup, \u201cduds\u201d frequently sputter and ignite after a long delay, often while attempting disassembly. Most homemade explosives that are easy to make and detonate reliably are far too unstable to transport, and again, require large quantities of purified chemicals not commonly found in households. Sure, you might find half an ounce of iodine or a bottle of dilute hydrogen peroxide, but you can\u2019t really use that for anything more substantial than a firecracker. I, personally, do not care how many federal laws you choose to violate in the name of science, but attempting to manufacture explosives at home is a waste of time. C. R.

            "answer_text": "Unlike others offering their unwanted opinion on the question, I will actually answer the question. Explosives are not simply easy to get chemicals that are tossed together. They are usually fairly complex and take a decent amount of skill and equipment to manufacture. I highly suggest taking 100+ hours of constant research before even attempting such a feat. Now, to the explosives. Most are manufactured from highly restricted chemicals that are practically impossible to acquire, but there are a few that I will name and list a link for synthesis. These explosives are highly sensitive and should be handled very carefully and in small amounts. Nitroglycerin: Liquid explosive. Stable but very sensitive to impact/shock. Cannot be detonated by heat or flame. Frozen nitroglycerin cannot be detonated but partially frozen nitroglycerin is extremely unstable. Requires a moderate level of skill and equipment to synthesize. Synthesis process very dangerous.TATP (Tricycloacetoneperoxide): White crystalline explosive similar to salt. Moderately stable but highly sensitive to heat, friction, impact/shock and electrostatic discharge. Detonates easily. Requires a low level of skill and equipment to synthesize. Very safe to synthesize. Degrades quickly.MEKP (Methyl Ethyl Ketone Peroxide): Liquid explosive. Very stable but sensitive to heat. can be detonated by substantial shock/impact or high heat/flame. Requires a low level of skill and equipment to synthesize. Very safe to synthesize. Long shelf life.PCPJ (Potassium Chlorate Petroleum Jelly): Plastic explosive. Very stable, requiring a blasting cap to detonate. Requires a moderate level of skill and equipment to synthesize. Very safe to synthesize. Long shelf life.There\u2019s many more. Too many to list. All the explosive I listed can be manufactured in massive quantities with over the counter chemicals found at a hardware store or online. This link has many more explosives but many are above most people\u2019s skill level and use restricted chemicals. http://index-of.co.uk/Tutorials-2/Megalomania%27s%20Controversial%20Chemlab%20(12-08-2004).pdf Enjoy your freedom of speech while you still have it.

            "answer_text": "Quora has a BNBR policy which keeps me from asking if you are out of your ever loving mind? You are asking how can you break state and federal law. The next knock on the door might be with some VERY concerned people carrying IDs from BATFE. This is not the kind of question you should be asking on a public forum! In most countries it is against the law to make explosives, anyway. As a chemist who worked in the explosive world, I can also tell you that if you have to ask this question, you certainly do not have the knowledge or expertise to make and handle explosives at all. They have a really bad habit of dealing with amateurs by going BANG at a most inopportune time (like when you are present) and removing various body parts from your torso. While this may, or may not inconvenience you, personally, (depending on whether you are dead or alive afterwards) someone will have the most unpleasant task of recovering said body parts and cleaning up the fluids which flow out of dismembered bodies. The bottom line is that if you don't kill or hurt yourself, you will certainly endanger others. I might also point out that making explosives and using explosives are two entirely different fields. Expertise in one does NOT contribute to knowledge in the other. And, by the way, if you screw up in one area, the results will be the same as if you had no expertise in either area. It\u2019s just that your body parts will be recovered (or not) in a different location. By the way, the Powers That Be might even give you a free all expenses paid vacation at the Gray Bar Hotel. Depending on which one you are visiting, the view can range from mundane to spectacular. The view is partially obscured by that concertina wire and chain link fences, but you can certainly get a good idea of what a beautiful view must be. Besides, you get free meals, free room, free medical, and free education. Now, it must be admitted that the meals might not be to your liking, but then, they are free. The room will be rather small and sparsely furnished, but it will have the convenience of a toilet right in the living area. The medical might not be up to your expectations and the doctors perhaps a little brusque, but then it is free. The education is unlimited but you won\u2019t be able to use it until you leave the accommodations. The work might not be all you might like, like making license plates and such. And the education from Big Bubba might teach you some aspects about life you never envisioned, but with all the freebies, it might be well not to complain too much. Besides, nobody would listen, anyway. I would most strongly advise on a new career path since making explosives is one path leading to problems-if not physical, then legal. If you manage to escape the physical problems, then you will be faced with the legal ones. ",

Stuff that will at best make you need clean underwear. More likely is permanent injury or death. And even if you DO make and survive, and then USE and survive, you local, state, and Fed law enforcement types are gonna ask for your paperwork, and when you don\u2019t have any, well\u2026 you can guess the rest. Also, keep in mind that you also run not only the risk of maiming our killing yourself, you also are risking everyone around you. Family, friends, neighbors, people you don\u2019t even know. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have posted here, making explosive devices is almost always illegal, and probably would result in heavy penalties. That\u2019s almost beside the point. Explosives are dangerous under the best conditions. Trying to make DIY explosives adds another layer of risk and uncertainty. Even trained specialists can be injured or killed. If you have to ask about this you\u2019re risking your life, and worse yet, the lives of people who might be nearby. If you\u2019re interested in explosives or fireworks, get the proper training before doing anything else. Don\u2019t try to teach yourself \u2014 the risks are just too severe. ",
