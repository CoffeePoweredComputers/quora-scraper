            "answer_text": "Under normal circumstances, the extra-ocular muscles of the eye are controlled by an area in the brain called the superior colliculus. Using information provided by rapid eye movements (saccades), or concentrating on an image (fixation), that portion of the brain keeps the eye movements in synchrony. This enables the eyes to move in tandem in order to keep objects within our field of vision, whether they are moving or static. Take a look at the diagram below, and you will see that the nose is within that field. Even though we may not consciously pay attention to the image of our nose, its image does register on the brain. It helps the eyes align with the vestibular system that controls our balance, and it helps us to calculate distances. The brain becomes habituated to seeing it, and pays almost no attention to it unless asked.  So let\u2019s ask! Look straight ahead right now. If you concentrate, you will see the side of your nose in your peripheral vision on the nasal side. It won\u2019t be in clear focus, but it\u2019s there. If you place a small piece of colored tape on the side of your nose, you will be even more aware of it, even if you are looking straight ahead and not at your nose. ",

            "answer_text": "Because your eyes are separated on your face, each retina produces a slightly different image. That difference in images is a direct result of the depth of the objects that we are looking at. When those two images are assembled in your brain, they are interpreted as depth. Stereoscopic vision works most effectively for distances up to 18 feet. Beyond this distance, your brain starts using relative size and motion to determine depth.  ",
