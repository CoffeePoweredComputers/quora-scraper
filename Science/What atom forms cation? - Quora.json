            "answer_text": "All metals (and hydrogen) form cations. Any element in the left block of the periodic table (Groups 1&2), Group 3, and the middle 'd' block (transition metals) form cations. Hydrogen and metalloids (elements on the zigzag between transition metals and non-metals) also form cations. Hope this answers your question. ",
