            "answer_text": "We know that, Na- is a metal whereas Cl-is a non-metal. If a metal and a non metal form a compound then, the bond between them is Electrovalent or Ionic bond. An Electrovalent compound is the one that is formed due to transfer of electrons from the positively charged metal to the negatively charged non-metal.(Example- Sodium loses its electron to make its second shell its valence shell to satisfy its octet while the chlorine gains one to complete its octet). On the other hand, Covalent are the ones formed due to sharing of electrons between atoms.(Example- two atoms of oxygen shares electrons to satisfy each others octet in the valence shell and join to form molecular oxygen). So, in Covalent compounds the electrons revolve around the both element\u2019s shell to satisfy its octet and structurally bond to each other. In Ionic compounds the electrons are transferred from one atom to the other and so are not structurally bonded. They are only held by electro-attractive forces between the elements formed due to opposite charges on them.(Note: metal will have a positive charge due to loss of electron while the non metal will develop a negative charge due to gain electrons.)

            "answer_text": "a molecule is considered to be a discrete small unit made up of atoms joined together, then NaCl, and any other ionic solid is not really a molecule. In NaCl we have a repetitive crystal structure in which each Na + ion is surrounded by Cl - ions, and vice-versa, for as far as the crystal extends. There really isn't such a thing as an NaCl molecule. But the formula does tell us that there is 1 Na for every 1 Cl, which you could verify by counting the individual atoms in this crystal, so the formula of NaCl is correct ",
