            "answer_text": "The short answer is: No. The long answer is not really, though it has been tried. In order to test whether bacteria were essential, newborn mice were carefully raised in a completely sterile environment, fed sterilized food, and allowed no contact with non-sterile animals. Biologists were astonished by the results. These sterile mice never developed proper intestinal walls; while normal mice have thick, resilient walls, these mice had thin walls that were easily ruptured by the normal passage of digesting food. They lacked sufficient intestinal mucus to allow stools to exit easily, and the stools lacked healthy bulk levels. They also had a great deal of difficulty digesting food without microbial assistance. They were incredibly fragile and died early. In addition, normal microbiota are vital as a first-line defense against pathogens. On any given day, you come into contact with microbes that could produce a lethal infection if allowed to colonize your body. Luckily, your natural skin and mucosal commensals generally prevent such invasion by outcompeting any interlopers.  So essentially, to survive without bacteria, you would need to live in a completely sterile environment in order to prevent near-immediate death from infection, avoid contact with any other life forms, and subsist on a sterilized, liquid diet specially created to be absorbed without gut flora.Personally, I can't call that living.

            "answer_text": "Let's start with the fact that digestion cannot occur without the various strains of bacteria that humans are born with. Oh sure, the body produces a few digestive enzymes, but those only break down masticated tissues into smaller parts. Beyond that, it's up to the friendlies to convert toxic and undigestable materials into something that can be distributed throughout our bodies and to our cells. So, can it be done? Yeah, if you keep them in a bacteriostatic quarantine, and if the only nutrients they consume are i.v. fluids. But any exposure to any foreign microorganism would kill the test subject because it would have no immunity. You see, a lot of our immunity depends on trillions of microorganisms that are already established in our bodies. They are essential in our metabolic processes and in our immunity. It's a synergistic relationship: we keep them alive and they keep is alive. Seems like an even trade. The real problems start when you begin taking antibiotics. If you don't understand what I mean by that, then it's definitely time to amp your level of research. ",

            "answer_text": "Just fyi, humans might not exist had bacteria not existed before them. Human cells are eukaryotic, while single celled bacteria are prokaryotic, cells so much smaller than human cells that at least one constituent of human cells is believed to have once been a bacterial cell. The mitochondria inside our human cells aid us in generating energy (ATP), and they carry DNA that only comes from your mother, unlike the DNA of the human genome, which comes from both parents. If the very existence of human life depended on bacterial life, why would anyone imagine that human life could exist without bacteria? That might not be a satisfying answer, however it does encourage another form for your question, and it leads me to conjecture NO. Someone else with much deeper knowledge than I will have to tell you exactly why that might be the correct answer. You can bet that someone has the correct answer. It is rare that scientific questions don\u2019t already have solid answers. ",

I know you love cakes but never went that deep to understand biology!!! 5. so, after eating all these how are they digested???? i can keep writing these questions for days they are that much important to human life. Humans without bacteria is nothing leave about humans this earth would not have evolved because of bacteria. ",

These mice are known as gnotobiotic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnotobiotic_animal). Mice can even be raised completely free of bacteria and are called germ-free (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ-free_animal). These mice have a variety of developmental, nutritional, and behavioral differences from normally raised mice (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12306431). They are often used in laboratory experiments that test the effects of gut bacteria on health.  It would be extremely difficult (not to mention ethically suspect) to raise a human child in such an environment, and it is unclear if they would die outright. The child would likely have a number of medical difficulties and would be more susceptible to a variety of nutritional and immunological problems. ",

Bacteria does not only help us digest food but it helps us to absorb more nutrients. Bacteria in the digestive system also supply us with vitamins like biotin and vitamin, and they are the primary source of these vitamins. Scientific experiments of guinea pigs have found that those raised in a sterile environment without any bacteria, are malnourished and they die young.Exposure to bacteria has been known to be an important part in the development of our immune systems.
