            "answer_text": "He was examining cathode tubes, in which energy rays were observed traveling between the cathode and anode inside a cathode tube. He measured various properties of the rays, which were later understood to be electrons. During these experiments, he also observed rays traveling in the opposite direction. The properties of these rays seemed to vary depending on the residual gas in the tube, and it was the measurements of the properties of ionized hydrogen gas in the tube that was in fact measuring data concerning the proton. He had no idea what they were, but were later known to be protons. ",
