            "answer_text": "Sugar is a \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d. If you look at that name you recognize \u201ccarbo\u201d and \u201chydrate\u201d. The carbo comes from carbon, and the hydrate indicates water. If you look at the chemical formula of sugars, you will notice that there is always twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms, and about the same amount of carbon atoms as oxygen atoms. What you observed is a thermal decomposition of sugar into carbon and water. Water vapor is formed, but it condenses in the cold part of the tube. ",
