            "answer_text": "You can not kill molecules. They are not alive. But ultrasounds in excess of 180 decibels can kill people. High power ultrasound at frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz can disintegrate biological cells including bacteria. High power ultrasound can also disintegrate corn slurry and enhance liquefaction and saccharification for higher ethanol yield in dry corn milling plants. The ultrasound does not interact directly with molecules to induce the chemical change, as its typical wavelength (in the millimeter range) is too long compared to the molecules. ",
