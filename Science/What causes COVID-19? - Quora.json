            "answer_text": "Question: What is the truth behind COVID-19 on cruise ships? The truth? Cruise ships are poorly cleaned and sanitized at the best of times - COVID-19 was \u201cwaiting\u201d for an opportunity like cruise ships, as most are barely cleaned between voyages and thus are incubators for illness. This should have been obvious during the various norovirus outbreaks in the recent past; however cruise ship companies downplayed that and cruisers ignored it.Despite having THOUSANDS of passengers and crew onboard, cruise ships have very minimal medical facilities - Basically if you get ill on a cruise, unless they are able to air evacuate you to a mainland hospital, there\u2019s a good chance that you might die. Cruise lines were NOT prepared for the spread of a highly infectious communicable disease, and people died as a result.It\u2019s a floating jail - For reasons that aren\u2019t exactly clear, many passengers seem to forget that they cannot leave a cruise ship during a disease outbreak. Not only will the ship not dock at any port, international maritime laws allow the cruise lines to enact quarantine measures which are far stricter than any which being undertaken in most of the Western world. Basically you are at the mercy of the cruise line if a disease like COVID-19 erupts and you\u2019d better be well-aware of that before you depart.COVID-19 found an \u201cideal\u201d set of victims on cruise ships - Basically many cruise ships are \u201cfloating retirement homes\u201d. The passengers are often elderly, many of them have one or more preexisting illnesses (often respiratory ones), and many of require medications to remain relatively healthy. Cruise ships know this, and yet they seemingly had no plans for a communicable disease outbreak, meaning COVID-19 had its \u201cchoice\u201d of victims.The HVAC systems on cruise ships aren\u2019t cleaned very often and they leave a lot to be desired - Basically passengers are breathing recirculated air, and that air isn\u2019t scrubbed or filtered to prevent the transmission of airborne pathogens. If you have one or more people on a cruise ship who is ill, they are likely going to infect a large number of people during the cruise. Since no one checks passengers before they board (Only recently before the industry shutdown were temperatures checked and of course there\u2019s no health screening of passengers, or for that matter crew members or contractors who service the vessel) COVID-19 was probably on many of the ships and passengers and crew only discovered their infection (if they were asymptomatic or only slightly ill, they may never discover it) after they returned home and had been in contact with dozens or hundreds of other people.Frankly, until there are multiple effective treatments, and eventually a vaccine, it will be an unwise decision to take a cruise. Even if the cruise lines promote their new hygiene and sanitation standards, they would still have too many loopholes in their systems to make cruising a safe or a pleasurable experience.

            "answer_text": "The cause of the actual disease is a novel bat coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, somehow transmitted to a human (or humans), which spreads with phenomenal ease and speed from one person to another. This evidently is a common coronavirus seen in bats, but it\u2019s never been seen in humans before; because it doesn\u2019t appear to cause any particular damage to a bat\u2019s system, no one is sure why it\u2019s so devastating to a human. Despite current popular political theories, there is no evidence at all that this coronavirus was man-made deliberately in a lab as a bio-warfare weapon; every indication tells experts that it originated naturally. It is possible (however unlikely) that one of the two laboratories near the Wuhan (China) live animal market, to which the first infection was traced, could have been studying this virus (the labs do study bat coronaviruses) and that it possibly infected one of the lab workers, who then went to the market and spread it among those gathered there. However, if that did happen (and so far there is no evidence that it did, since none of the first few hundred cases appeared in anyone working at either lab), it does not appear to have been deliberate. Bat coronaviruses have never transmitted directly to humans before (only through another mammal that acted as an intermediate host), so it was probably assumed that this one would follow the same pattern and possibly no one at the lab thought of wearing protective gear while studying them, since they didn\u2019t think it was contagious from the bats. But that\u2019s all just supposition. The most likely cause of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted to humans is that it passed from a bat to a pangolin, also known as a scaly anteater (indigenous to both Africa and Asia), and the pangolin acted as an intermediate host until it managed to pass it to a human. I don\u2019t know whether a pangolin was at the Wuhan animal market, but the market is still being called the place of origin for covid-19. The big cause of covid-19 becoming a global pandemic, though, was, for the largest part, slow governmental responses to the disease as it appeared in different countries outside China. If everyone had done what New Zealand did and immediately shut down their borders to all outside travel and instituted lockdown upon first hearing about it, it would probably have remained in just isolated clumps here and there instead of affecting everyone all over the world. New Zealand is also dependent on other countries for food and other goods, but they restricted shipping to just a few ports and instantly began mass testing at those ports and throughout the country\u2014-something we all should have done. Of course, NZ is a small island country, so probably not everyone had those same options; still, nobody else really took it seriously until it was already spreading like wildfire, so no country with international air travel or with shipping ports was spared.
