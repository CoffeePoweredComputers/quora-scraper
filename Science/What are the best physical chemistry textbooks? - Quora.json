            "answer_text": "It depends. If you really want a fundamental understanding of physical chemistry, I'd skip the chemistry, initially, and get a sound understanding of the physics first. My vote for one of the best quantum mechanics books of all time is Principles of Quantum Mechanics by P. A. M. Dirac. If you're serious about getting a fundamental understanding, then you should consider reading some math books or taking some math courses. Beyond introductory calculus, I would consider learning ordinary and partial differential equations, linear algebra, probability theory, group theory, and real and complex analysis. That's a lot, but it's all important. I almost forgot. The calculus of variations shows up again and again in the theories of physics. Newton's laws can be formulated with the calculus of variations. The result is called Lagrange's equations. Nobody knows why the calculus of variations keeps showing up. Maybe there's some underlying unified theory yet to be discovered. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a student 45 to 50 years ago, the most popular books (in India) were those by Samuel Glasstone. Some of his books are : 1. Textbook of Physical Chemistry, 2. Thermodynamics for Chemists, 3. Introduction to Electrochemistry, and 4. Theoretical Chemistry. Each one I still consider to be very very good. We also used to consult Daniels and Alberty , and the book by A J Mee. Mee's book I didn't like much. Taylor and Glasstone (Treatise on Physical Chemistry) was encyclopedic and I didn't consult the book till MSc. Later on I came across the book by Atkins . It is a good book but not as comprehensive as TBP by Glasstone. However, I have seen only its first edition. The first book on Quantum Chemistry that I read was by Walter Kauzmann. I found it very good. Pauling and Wilson was more popular . Eyeing,Walter and Kimball was a little more difficult. Later on I was suggested to read the book by Pilar ( Elementary Quantum Chemistry) . A wonderful book , it was not elementary as the name suggests. I also found 'Wave mechanics of atoms , molecules and ions' by Schutte a good book. The book by Szabo and Ostlund is also very good. I read it around 1986\u201387. I have not read Indian authors' books much. I have heard the book by KL Kapoor to be good. I am sorry I have not read it. ",

            "answer_text": "Physical Chemistry is all about the applications of the techniques and the theories of Physics to the studies of Chemical systems. Therefore, you need to have a deeper understanding of both chemistry and physics. In Physical Chemistry, you will be studying more about molecules and atoms. Now based on your objective you need to decide which textbook you want to study. Mostly Students who opt for PCM appear for IIT- JEE exams and students from PCB aspires for NEET exams. In both cases, we at Hellobachho recommends students to study from either OP Tandon or HC Verma for detailed explanation and qualitative questions to practice. Hellobachho is an e-learning institute who is dedicated to making students independent of any coaching institutes. Our students have become more confident as they get video lectures that they can watch at the convenience of their homes. This way students have more time for self-study and practice. In other cases like your personal interest and curiosity on this particular, we suggest going for Atkins' Physical Chemistry, by Julio de Paula, Peter Atkins. This is very well known among students who wish to pursue their long term career in Physical Chemistry.

It is clearly written, logically ordered, and asks you to derive much of the content yourself before it presents the result in small, bite-sized steps, which will do wonders both for your understanding of quantum chemistry and for your confidence in your ability as a budding physical chemist. This will probably be out of sequence for your course, which will probably cover thermo before quantum, but if you have time and interest it would be a very good idea to work through some of McQuarrie to convince yourself that this isn't a particularly difficult or confusing subject before Atkins can throw a wrench in the works. The original 1983 edition is probably best; the 2007 version relies heavily on numerical analysis programs, which is an unnecessary distraction in a first quantum course. ",

Perhaps the biggest change in the years since the first edition is the proliferation of computational chemistry programs that calculate molecular properties. McQuarrie has presented step-by-step SCF calculations of a helium atom in Chapter 9 and a hydrogen molecule in Chapter 10, in addition to including an entire chapter on the Hartree-Fock method and post-Hartree-Fock methods for the calculation of molecular properties. The book also uses problems to encourage the use of an invaluable National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) website that lists experimental data and the results of various ab initio calculations for hundreds of molecules.
