            "answer_text": "In the vast majority of cases, you will excrete the gum in your feces in a few days. This is probably the case at least 99.9% of the time, I cannot find statistics. It may be more like 99.999% of the time. In very rare instances, swallowing indigestible substances can cause a bezoar, which is a lump of stuff trapped in your stomach. Bezoars made of hair are perhaps the most common. If you had a hair bezoar (a trichobezoar), then gum will often add to it, as will various other things that usually don't form bezoars on their own. Chewing gum bezoars have been reported in medical literature, but they usually form from unusual \"traditional\" gum bases. In other words, not the gum you buy at the corner store. If your grandmother makes gum from dried tree sap, you might have a problem. I would also be careful with her wild mushroom salad (mushrooms are often poisonous, but not if you buy them at the grocery store). ",

I\u2019ve lived long enough (70+ yrs.) and chewed (and swallowed) enough gum through those years, and continued chewing, that, based on personal \u201cgum experience\u201d I would say, \u201cNothing remarkable!\u201d My digestive system has continued normal digestion, my respiratory system has continued normal respiration (no bubbles), etc. In other words, nothing has plugged me up or expelled from me anything considered \u201cinappropriate.\u201d So, I suppose I have no abnormal gummy messes within my total digestive system! Additionally, I have never experienced abnormal bubbles from any inappropriate orifice. So, despite what some people would choose to speculate, my un-scientific conclusion would have to be: the body digests what it can and expels what it can\u2019t. ",
