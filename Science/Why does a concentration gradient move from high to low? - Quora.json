            "answer_text": "From a principle standpoint, it is in fulfillment of the law of entropy. In chemistry and physics everything naturally seeks the position of lowest energy and highest stability. The state of diffusion is the state of highest entropy which means lowest energy according to the law of thermodynamics. To counteract that gradient you need to pump in energy. That's how dynamically active cell membrane ion pumps work: Energy is supplied by adenosine triphosphate, and it primes the transfer mechanism. The ATP releases its energy and reverts to adenosine diphosphate for the next cycle; then the energized molecular pump shunts the ion against the osmotic gradient across the cell wall. Life is always working like that: going against the natural flow of degradation and diffusion, concentrating cell stuffs and ions and increasing the order of molecular and organic complexity. ",
