            "answer_text": "This depends on how full the balloons are, if they have been scratched by anything, how large the balloons are, etc. The less helium in the balloon, the higher it can go, because with less space taken up by helium, the balloon will have more room to expand, as atmospheric pressure decreases as altitude increases, before it pops. If the balloon has a scratch, say from a blade grass or your fingernail or something, then the balloon will not be able to expand as much, because the scratch weakens the balloons wall, and since it expands as it goes up, the max altitude will be less than a balloon without any scratches Also, the larger the balloon, the larger it can expand, resulting in a higher max altitude ",

            "answer_text": "A helium ballon rises because of Archimedes principle. It will keep on rising till the surrounding air is more dense than inside. As the ballon goes up the sky, the pressure of surrounding air decreases which causes the balloon to expand. So it is also upto the amount of extra space present inside the balloon amd its eleasticity to how much it can expand before bursting. If the ballon doesn't burst than it will rise to a max height of 32 km above the earth's surface where the density becomes equal to density of helium inside the balloon. ",
