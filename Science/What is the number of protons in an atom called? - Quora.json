            "answer_text": "TLDR: Atomic number The number of protons is called the atomic number. Due to the fact that the number of protons and electrons in an atom are equal in order for it to be neutral, the atomic number can also denote the number of electrons. When given the mass number, the atomic number can also be used to calculate the number of neutrons; the mass number is protons + neutrons, and so neutrons can be figured out from taking the atomic number (smallest) from the mass number (biggest). (Mass-atomic). Sorry about the extra unnecessary information. Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": "That is the atomic number, which can be used to determine the electron count and the nuclear charge. The former is equal to the atomic number minus the net charge of the atom, while the latter is one positive charge times the atomic number. Meanwhile, the atomic mass number is determined by the number of nucleons. A nucleon is a proton or neutron, which means that the mass number will always be equal to or greater than the atomic number. ",
