            "answer_text": "Food can be contaminated by bacteria in many, many ways. the way in which animals are raised can contribute to high bacteria counts in their sleeping areas, as in battery raised chickens, which are kept in crowded and frequently unclean environments. Anyone who handles food can contaminate it by failing to maintain adequate standards of cleanliness. food that is stored at improper temperatures will encourage the growth of bacteria, which is in the air and on every surface that we handle. Ground meat is more likely to be contaminated than while pieces of meat, simply because there is more surface area for bacteria to grow on. Fortunately, there are ways to keep our food safe, and most of them involve nothing more than keeping your hands and surfaces clean, and keeping the food at the proper temperature. There are guidelines for internal temperatures of meat that guarantee food safety as well. We are surrounded by bacteria at all times. They live in the air and on our skin. Most of them are harmless and a few are very helpful indeed. Try making pickles, or yogurt or sauerkraut or sourdough bread without bacteria. You\u2019ll be disappointed. The trick is knowing enough to reduce our exposure to inimical beasties. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be answered in an elaborate way, detailing the existence of microbes everywhere in the visible world, or in very brie, through some understandable illustrations. Bacteria are unicellular living entity.They are divided in to many species and each species has many strains.They are present everywhere, as I have already mentioned,in this earth.Each human body harbours on an average of 40 trillions ( 4 x 10 v13 ) of them.They have many beneficial actions on our body.Although inside tissues of many fruits, vegetables, fish, meat animals and birds are normally sterile, their outside can have many millions of bacteria from diverse species.These come from the environment ( soil, water, air and any thing they get contact with.Processed foods also pick up bacteria during processing, depending upon the methods used.Some processing methods can reduce the load, such as washing.Some methods can kill some to reduce load in specific rate , as in pasteurization of milk.Some methods can reduce their numbers to minimum, like canning of foods or ultra heat processing of foods.Alternately in some foods, their numbers are enhanced, like fermented foods.Except, on specific situation, we do not have sterile foods, that are free from bacteria and that is for immunocompromised and similar patients.We as consumers, also recontaminate processed food by our insanitary practices during use of our foods.So when you eat/drink something or lick a lollipop, suck your thumb. or give an affectionate kiss to someone, you always give and take some of those single celled living cells , we call bacteria.
