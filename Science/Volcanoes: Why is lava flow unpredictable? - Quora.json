            "answer_text": "As Bob Singer pointed out, you actually can simulate viscous lava flow. I bet, it is done frequently, too. Internally, you have to deal with partial crystallization of molten rock into a viscous mush with crystalz of different size, shape, elasticity, et cetera. And don't forget the not as predictable supply from the magma chamber. You will face inconsistancies in external parameters as well. Take earthquakes for example. They might be related to the volcanic activity or induced from somewhere else. They might change the topography and change the flow. More importingly, new dykes can occur (more or less swarmed!) because of the stress transfer from earth movements and supply can be induced and cease (even without new dyke generation). Maybe large enough fissures take away from the lava flow, ultimately changing it.  What about the weather? Weather locally, is not as predictable as you pointed out (at least, I don't think so). This goes especially for highly heterogenious cases like the atmosphere in vicinity to an volcanic eruption. Moist and cool air is able to increase viscosity of the rim of the lava flows, potentially centralizing their remaining interior movement. It is able to solidify and stop the movement at all.  Now, include underground and surface water as well as tidal activities into the mix and their potential radical cooling, and rapid steam-explosions. As solidification of lava is able to cause huge changes in the movement of the residuae, you can imagin a seemingly quite chaotic or, at least, highly complex system. Weather is complex, too, as as that, hard to simulate. However, most lava flow which is directly interesting as natural hazard (and risk to human life and environments) is small in comparison to the external factors/boundary conditions. This makes exact models hard to come by, I presume. ",

            "answer_text": "While most of the time the path is predictable based on terrain, because the temperature of the lava is not uniform different portions of the flow will change density as they cool sooner than others, thus changing the path of the flow. Also the surface being covered can change the temperature either melting and adding to the flow, or cooling the flow to slow it down. ",
