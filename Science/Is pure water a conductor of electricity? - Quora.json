            "answer_text": "This is a type of question which appears often at Quora. The question has an answer which is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d depending on details like \u201cwhere do you draw the line between conducting and not conducting?\u201d So better is just to say that although \u201cdissociation constant( 10^-14)\u201d as given in another answer, we can measure very small conductivity, even quite easily. Thus we can find an example, Conductivity of various water solutions at 25\u00b0, Pure water 0.055 \u03bcS/cm for one selected temperature. One must appreciate that reaching the pure state takes some effort and just leaving the sample standing around in a beaker for awhile will contaminate the water with CO2, forming a weak acid and changing the conductivity. Anyway, let the OP decide whether equipment is available to observe this value while making sure the water is truly pure, including free of CO2. Incidentally, the acidity of water containing CO2 is a factor in destruction of coral, where the rise of atmospheric CO2 from burning fossil fuels, etc. is driving up the acidity of sea water. The acidity is weak but still significant. ",

            "answer_text": "No, pure water does not conduct electricity.Water will only conduct electricity when it has an electrolyte present, when ions are in solution which will allow for the flow of an electric current. Tap water is not pure water, even this has a very small amount of ions present which will allow the wate to conduct to a small degree. To improve the water's conductivity, one can use one of many very common electrolytes, for example \"Salt\", Sodium Chloride is a strong electrolyte.\"Strong\" and \"weak\" when talking about electrolytes refers to their ability to break up into ions in solution. \"Strong\" electrolytes will completely break up into ions whereas \"weak\" electrolytes will not break up completely (although they will break up to a degree). An example of a weak electrolyte is acetic acid (AKA \"vinegar\"), this weak electrolyte will also allow for the flow of an electric current through water.There are also \"non-electrolytes\" such as sugar which do not break into ions at all and will not allow for the flow an an electric current. Hope it helps :) ",
