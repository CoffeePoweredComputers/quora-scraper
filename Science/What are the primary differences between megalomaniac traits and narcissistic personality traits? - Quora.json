            "answer_text": "KInd of splitting atoms on this one. Megalomaniac traits are generally just a term that happens to combine many of the traits we find with NPD. They don\u2019t comprehensively cover all of them but they are largely the same. Megalomania is a \u2018delusional mental illness\u2019 on a Google search. I use that term very loosely as you won\u2019t find it in any official resources nor is it a diagnosable condition. On the \u2018internet of things\u2019 however it is marked by feelings of personal omnipotence and grandeur. Even Wikipedia redirects to NPD. I would consider it a word simplifying via a single word or label a number of the common traits and characteristics of NPD but nothing I would use in an official way. Thank you for the A2A ",
