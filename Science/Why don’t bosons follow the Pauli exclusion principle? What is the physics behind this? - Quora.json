            "answer_text": "Essentially, because the argument that does make fermions follow this principle doesn\u2019t hold. Let me review the argument. [Kinda. I\u2019m skipping a bunch of details that make this argument actually work, but it should work for a conceptual picture.] When you swap the place of two fermions, your system goes to \u201cminus itself.\u201d If those fermions were in the same place, then your system would be equal before and after the swap (since you didn\u2019t do anything), so the system would have to be equal to minus itself. But that means that your system is equal to zero, which means your system doesn\u2019t exist. Now, bosons fail right at the beginning. When you swap to bosons, by definition, your system goes to itself, not minus itself. Thus, you can\u2019t conclude that a system with two bosons in the same place is \u201czero\u201d; therefore, such states are allowed. Thus, since there\u2019s no reasons bosons couldn\u2019t be in the same place (unlike fermions!), bosons don\u2019t have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. ",
