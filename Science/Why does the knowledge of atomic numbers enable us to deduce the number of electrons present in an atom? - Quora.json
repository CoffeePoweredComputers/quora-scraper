            "answer_text": "It does not. The number of electrons in any atoms is variable. So, you need some indicator of their number, such as the charge on the atom, etc. For example, if the atom is neutral in charge, the number of electrons is equal to the atomic number (which equates to the nuclear charge and the unit of + charge is exactly the same quantity as the unit of - charge).

            "answer_text": "Simply because atoms are electrically neutral. They are made up of 3 components, protons and neutrons in the nucleus and electrons orbiting in \u2018shells\u2019 at some distance from the nucleus. Of these protons have a single positive charge, electrons have a single negative charge and neutrons are electrically neutral. The Atomic Number is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus. In order to be electrically neutral the atom must therefore have an equal number of orbiting electrons. ",
