            "answer_text": "It\u2019s never really been explained on screen, but according to official Star Trek reference volumes, the replicators do not have sufficient resolution for the task - neither, for the record, do cargo transporters without modifications. Replicators and cargo transporters work on molecular-level resolution. Personnel transporters work on the subatomic or quantum level. In order to get around certain limitations of quantum physics, personnel transporters use components called Heisenberg compensators which are sometimes referenced in technobabble on the show. You may, quite justifiably, wonder why don\u2019t they just install Heisenberg compensators on replicators and replicate living matter. This, too, has never been explained, and in fact we have seen transporters successfully replicate rather than merely transport living beings, so it doesn\u2019t appear to be a technical limitation. In the TNG episode Second Chances, the Enterprise returned to a planet where Commander Riker had undertaken a difficult mission as a Starfleet lieutenant, and discovered that a transporter accident had created a second Lieutenant Riker who remained on the surface for the next eight years. After his rescue, this second Riker, who chose to go by \u201cThomas,\u201d transferred to another ship before ultimately betraying Starfleet and joining the Maquis. This may give us part of our answer: replicating sapient beings could lead to identity theft and other security issues. But the other part, to my mind, is largely this: the Federation is extremely paranoid when it comes to cloning and genetic manipulation. Genetic engineering is forbidden except to correct life-threatening defects (this is why Deep Space Nine\u2019s Dr. Julian Bashir nearly had to resign when it was discovered his parents had subjected him to eugenic treatment), and cloning appears to be similarly forbidden. The Federation doesn\u2019t even appear to use cloned organs in medical treatment much, if at all, instead relying on cybernetic implants such as Captain Picard\u2019s heart and Geordi LaForge\u2019s visor. Thus, it is very likely that the Federation explicitly forbids experimentation with transporters and replicators to duplicate living tissue. It is entirely possible that other cultures have engaged in such experimentation, but we have yet to see it on screen. ",

            "answer_text": "The key part of the explanation in not technological, but practical storytelling.  A Star Trek writer working on reasons why the transporters and replicators work for a small number of sharply-defined purposes, but why they can\u2019t be used for purposes that would ruin the story. If you could use the transporter to (for example) store a person\u2019s patterns for decades (using whatever method Scotty used to keep his own from breaking down), then why couldn\u2019t you \u201cbring back the dead\u201d by dematerialising the last stored copy of someone who had been killed or simply died of old age? Why couldn\u2019t you have eternal youth by periodically resetting the flesh to an earlier state? (Remember they restored a nearly dead Doctor Pulaski using the transporter and she even retained her memories of events up to the moment of the procedure; TNG second-season episode \u201cUnnatural Selection\u201d.) Why couldn\u2019t you take your best soldiers and scientists and replicate hundreds of thousands of them and go on berserk wars of conquest - against enemies who would no doubt start doing the same thing, resulting in a new kind of war? (An even faster version of the Dominion\u2019s production methods of Jem\u2019Hadar soldiers, whose military skills appear to be part of their genetic code.) The problem with inventing future technology is that you also have to account for all the implications. In the case of the Star Trek transporter and replicator technology, the writers have to do handsprings to explain away why such things as I list above are just not possible, or at least not practical. But it\u2019s okay, I have reconciled myself to the fact that even if someone invents lightsabers like on Star Wars, they will never allow me to own a \u201clightsaber riding lawnmower,\u201d a \u201clightsaber electric shaver,\u201d or a \u201clightsaber bug zapper.\u201d (Maybe a lightsaber cordless drill? Can those things do corkscrews?) That\u2019s writers for you - they want their cake, but they lick off the icing before you get any! ",
