            "answer_text": "Hello, Winning a science fair is not so important. What you do after a science fair with what you have learned is more important. Did the science project teach you about how to do research? Did the project inspire you to achieve something later in your eal career or was it just a one of project to win a prize? I feel the same way about PhD\u2019s. Was the PhD a one time thing that you can brag about or did it make you into a useful researcher and inspire you to do something with that knowledge. So a bit off the track. But there are many factors and luck is one and judges bias is another and what topics are currently popular are another factor. For me a good project involves many factors. I think science fair projects are good in that they teach how all kinds of subjects can come together to produce something. The winning projects often go to kids who did have help from smart parents or teachers or someone because a child in middle school has no way on his or her own to do the necessary research required for a complicated project. In the end of course it is just the student and the judges so the student has to know something and be able to explain the project to all kinds of people from the general public to kids to experts in a confident way. The project should show that you know how to do research. It helps to do something original which can be just a small variation on someone\u2019s project that you liked on the Internet but you made your own innovations on it or researched how to fix up what you thought was lacking in their project. In the end you have your display, your talk and your ability to make people excited about your research. The project doesn\u2019t matter that much. Not many projects are really ready for real prime time usefulness anyway. Like a project on diagnosing Cancer for example sounds pretty good but what student has the medical knowledge to really understand in a deep way what they are talking about without 5 to 10 years of University? There are all kinds of guidelines on the Internet on what judges are looking for that can help. Sometimes it is luck to just pick a right topic. The same goes actually for getting a PhD. Some people get nowhere not because they are dumb but just because they picked a topic which turned out to be too difficult. Just at the start of a project you don\u2019t know if you can succeed or not. The idea is not to get a right answer but to show you can do research. Creative or new innovative ideas probably get a higher score. If it is your first time then the idea is just to put in an effort , not to aim for some prize. So light reflectors and potato batteries and volcanos are fine for the early grade beginners but won\u2019t do for middle school or high school. The higher the grade level, the more is expected of you. Maybe the best chance someone has is in middle school. After that you almost are competing with people who are approaching professional research levels. There is not easy winning formula. The main thing is to put in the time to research and do as much as you can. I think working on something for a year is better than trying to crash course or whip up some project in a month or two before the science fair and doing some project that you really have no passion for. A winner in anything has a real passion for the stuff they do and they research all angles of that subject and strive to be as expert as possible. For a new area you could know a lot more than the judges sometimes but they can still judge you on your presentation, your confidence, your research skills, the relevance of your project etc. A case in point if you are into math and science is that the field of AI is skyrocketing these days so there are tons f projects there for even a middle school student. Some projects may require some math that you do not know but you don\u2019t need to understand that whole subject but just know enough to talk about some particular equation or calculation that you need. There is nothing wrong with getting help but in the end , it is just you trying to show the public and judges something that will excite them. It may or may not be useful but that does not totally matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Science fairs and other science-based competitions provide opportunities for students to explore topics of personal interest. Curiosity, organization and tenacity help to complete these projects. Looking at previous winning projects, whether local or international, may suggest first-place science project ideas as well as provide insights into what makes a first-place project. No project idea is guaranteed to be a first-place project idea, but you can improve your odds of winning by following guidelines. Finding Science Competitions Find a project and competition that appeals to you. Science fairs may be familiar science competitions for many people, but other science-based competitions also exist. John Hopkins Center for Talented Youth lists Gifted and Talented Science Competitions (see References). Each competition has its own rules and requirements. Some competitions allow teams to compete while others require students to work individually (which doesn't mean you can't ask for help from experts). Some competitions require all submissions be online while other competitions take place at physical sites at local, regional, state, national and even international venues. Review Past Winners Reviewing past winners helps understand the competition in terms of types of projects and the judging perspective. For example, the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair 2018 Grand Award Winners list shows that the majority of winning projects benefit people in some way. A logical inference, therefore, suggests that projects that positively impact people have an advantage in this competition. https://sciencing.com/1st-place-science-project-ideas-7916341.html ",
