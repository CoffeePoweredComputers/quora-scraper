            "answer_text": "First of all thanks for asking this question . The formation of lead nitrate solution is in this way . Lead(II) nitrate can be obtained by dissolving metallic lead in aqueous nitric acid: Pb + 4 HNO3\u2192 Pb(NO3)2 + 2 NO2 + 2 H2O More commonly, it is obtained by dissolving lead(II) oxide in nitric acid: PbO + 2 HNO3 \u2192 Pb(NO3)2 + H2O In either case, since the solvent is concentrated nitric acid (in which lead(II) nitrate has very low solubility) and the resulting solution contains nitrate ions, anhydrous crystals of lead(II) nitrate spontaneously form as a result of the common ion effect: Most commercially available lead(II) nitrate, as well as laboratory-scale material, is produced accordingly. Supply is in 25 kilogram bags up to 1000 kilogram big bags, and in laboratory containers, both by general producers of laboratory chemicals and by producers of lead and lead compounds. No large-scale production has been reported. In nitric acid treatment of lead-containing wastes, e.g., in the processing of lead\u2013bismuth wastes from lead refineries, impure solutions of lead(II) nitrate are formed as by-product. These solutions are reported to be used in the gold cyanidation process. ",

            "answer_text": "Lead nitrate is a soluble salt of lead: Lead(II) nitrate - Wikipedia To make a solution, use solid lead nitrate and add water. If you are starting with solid lead metal, carefully add concentrated nitric acid, as described in the above Wikipedia article. The reaction will create lead nitrate in solution. Note that lead nitrate is toxic. ",
