            "answer_text": "I agree with Mayowa, if you are wanting to just learn code then starting with Python is a nice gateway. Python is also a great language with lots of perks. Since you asked the benefit of one over the other I will drop my two cents on just the one. A benefit of learning Javascript over Python is popularity and future growth of libraries. If you compare which languages are getting more frameworks and more pull requests it is Javascript. Sure, JS is known for the animated websites but it has gone way above that. There is growth in a lot of JS frameworks which allows you to be \u201ca full stack developer\u201d and not need the backend systems. There was a time that JavaScript would need something else to be the foundation of the backend content handled by Java, Python, PHP, and/or Ruby for example. However, with JavaScript being able to do its\u2019 own middleware those hardened requirements are dwindling. JavaScript also has plenty of CLI package solutions. This allows developers that know JS to deliver command line tools which are often owned by your Ruby/Python/Perl shops. Even in Mobile development where you may need to learn a language for Android and then another for Apple\u2026are wrapped into JS frameworks, AngularJS. I watched a friend of mine build a functional App using \u201cionicframework\u201d. It was impressive how well it worked. They made a book (Developing an Ionic Edge) outlining how it was done. As JavaScript continues to wrap common functions and needs into more frameworks and packages it will allow developers to deliver solutions in a common enviroment. Checkout the ( npm ) site to learn more about the packages in the community. ",

            "answer_text": "JavaScript is the king of front end web and over the last several years has moved into the backend, mobile, desktop, and IoT, which means its becoming/is the king of building applications. A lot of comments today continue to *only* talk about JavaScript being relevant on the front end, but that is now dated information. If your goal is to build user applications for web/mobile/desktop then learning JavaScript is a benefit over Python. Python is used more for teaching, academics, number crunching, AI prototyping, and backend development. It\u2019s not ideal to use Python for front end development. However, for example, you could take a strange approach and compile Python to JavaScript for front end web but not sure why you would do that when frameworks like React/Redux exist for front end JavaScript. Additionally there are frameworks to do front end mobile work in Python, but they aren\u2019t nearly as popular or effective as React Native or as effortless as Ionic/Cordova. ",

            "answer_text": "Both JavaScript and Python are dynamic languages - Dynamic programming language - Wikipedia Just that the application of both is different. Python is used more in academic settings, it\u2019s a perfect programming language to teach new students. It\u2019s very very good for artificial intelligence and machine learning. JavaScript on the other hand is used more in web programming and development to make your website interactive, when you click a button and you expect back a certain behavior or result, a JavaScript code is running under the hood. They are both easy to learn and get started with. If you are new to programming and just want to get started really fast by building something for the web, then you should be learning JavaScript. But before you dive deep into JavaScript some knowledge of HTML and CSS is required (you just need to know the basics). But if you plan to study computer science later on, then you should be learning Python. ",

            "answer_text": "The main benefit of learning JavaScript over Python is that you will be able to write code that runs natively in the browser. While it is technically possible to compile Python into JavaScript, and thus run it in the browser, the number of developers who do this is minuscule in comparison to the number who just write JavaScript. This is because of the increased complexity involved, as well as more difficult debugging. JavaScript also has advantages when developing front-end applications that run outside the browser. such as native mobile applications for Android and iOS. While there are options for doing this using Python, at appears that JavaScript-based solutions, such as React Native and PhoneGap, are significantly more popular. In terms of the languages themselves, I like both, and believe you can advance your programming skills using either. They are both good choices. ",
