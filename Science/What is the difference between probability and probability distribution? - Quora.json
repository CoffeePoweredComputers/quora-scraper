            "answer_text": "In short: Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.whereas, Probability Distribution is the distribution curve plotted of the probabilities of the random variables VS the random variables. It is useful because if you know the pdf (probability distribution function) of an event, then you can predict the outcome an event. Certain common events follow the standard curves like the Normal distribution (Gaussian) curve.Probability (denoted by capital P) is simple terms defines the favorable chance/occurrence of an outcome of an event when all the outcomes of the event have taken place. Mathematically, Probability of an event [math]P(X=x)[/math]:-  As an example, tossing of an unbiased coin has a probability of head [math][H][/math] or tail [math][T][/math] both as [math]P[X=H]=P[X=T]=p(x)=\\dfrac{1}{2}[/math] where X is a random variable. random variable: a quantity whose value is random and to which a probability distribution is assigned, such as the possible outcome of a roll of a die or tossing a coin. they are of two types:- discrete random variable: obtained by counting values for which there are no in-between values, such as the integers 0, 1, 2, \u2026.continuous random variable: obtained from data that can take infinitely many values on a continuous integral scaleProbability distribution (denoted by small p) These are some of the properties that the pdf follows for both variables. For discrete random variable:-The probability that x can take a specific value is [math]p(x)[/math]. That is [math]P[X=x]=p(x)=p_x[/math][math]p(x)[/math]is non-negative for all real x i.e. [math]0\u2264 p(x)\u2264 1[/math]The sum of [math]p(x)[/math] over all possible values of [math]x[/math] is [math]1[/math], i.e [math]\u2211p_j=1[/math] where [math]j [/math]represents all possible values that [math]x[/math] can have and [math]p_j[/math] is the probability at [math]x_j[/math].   For continuous random variable:-The probability that x is between two points a and b is[math] p[a\u2264x\u2264b]= \\displaystyle\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx[/math]It is non-negative for all real x.The integral of the probability function is one, that is [math]\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\,dx = 1 [/math] Please note f(x) is the probability density function is also denoted by p(x).

            "answer_text": "Let,s consider an example of tossing a coin. The number of possible outcomes are: {Head,Tail} Suppose X be the event of getting head. Therefore the chance of getting head =1/2 Hence, The probability is nothing but a chance of occurring a particular event out of the total event. And how this probability for the different event distributed are known to be a probability distribution. Hence we can write P(Head)=0.5 P(No head)=0.5 ",
