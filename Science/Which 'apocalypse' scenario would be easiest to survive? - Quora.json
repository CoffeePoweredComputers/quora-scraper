            "answer_text": "As a Prepper, I prefer to prepare for realistic future disasters. The US Government denies it ( of course) but every US State below the 45 degree axis line has no protection against an EMP attack. Does the technology to destroy or disrupt our National electric grids exist? Yes, it does. Any nation that can launch a satellite into space has the knowledge to do it. That may well explain why Trump has decided to thaw relations with Russia. So could we survive an EMP attack? Well, even the worst one would only disrupt 3 or four States, so the answer is yes. I\u2019m not downplaying the damage, however. At least 4 million people would die by the time the power grids are restored and martial law lifted by the US Government in the States afflicted. Our society would be forever changed, as well. A society in crisis becomes less tolerant and more enclosed. ",

            "answer_text": "If we include those that can happen and those that cannot, then the zombie apocalypse wins, hands down. At least in modern industrialized nations, it would likely never reach truly apocalyptic proportions. Real world events are a bit more challenging. Pick your scenario. Now, how widespread is the effect? I tend to favor something like a Carrington event as the most survivable, by far. ",
