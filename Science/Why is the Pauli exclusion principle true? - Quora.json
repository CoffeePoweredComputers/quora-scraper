            "answer_text": "In Quantum mechanics, the rules are generally without reasons. They are initially premised upon experiment and observation. As knowledge is gained, they become relational and even rational in some cases. The real problem is, we do not have a physical model of particles, and therefore the reasons for the rules will always be, to some degree, abstract. For most, this is unsatisfying. I, like others, believe there is a yet to be discovered, physical reality underlying the mechanics of 3-D spin angular momentum. This involves thinking of particles, such as electrons, not as points, but as circulations having finite dimensions.[1] See part II pages 24 - 34 of the linked reference.
