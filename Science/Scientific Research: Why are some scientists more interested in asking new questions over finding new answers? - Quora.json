            "answer_text": "Asking new questions is how you get to new answers. Scientific research has 2 aspects: theory/hypothesis formulation and theory/hypothesis evaluation. It is said, with a great deal of truth, that data is only useful in relation to a hypothesis. Gathering data for the sake of gathering data generally leads nowhere. Instead, data is gathered specifically to test a hypothesis. Of course, that means you have to have the hypothesis first! So making new hypotheses is extremely important. Technically, hypotheses/theories are statements about the physical universe. An example (from my research) would be: Human multipotent adult stem cells injected into a normal rat will not be rejected by the immune system. However, many hypotheses start out informally as questions. In this particular case, my question was: I wonder what will happen if I inject human multipotent adult stem cells in the skin of a normal rat, as in a human PPD test? Will they be rejected? At that point I designed the experiment to test this, with the appropriate controls. The answer was new. Because the question was new. ",

            "answer_text": "Asking questions and searching for answers go hand in hand in science and any endeavor in life. It is important to keep an open mind when searching for answers. Scientist try not to \u201cfind\u201d a preconceived answer. Of course scientists are human and we generally have an end in mind when performing an experiment. In order to design and experiment you have to think about what you might expect. However, if you discover something you didn\u2019t expect during and experiment then a scientist\u2019s training will help to not dismiss this as an error. Often an experiment will fail entirely. A scientist will then ask new questions to try to understand why the experiment failed or if the unexpected results reveal something they hadn\u2019t considered. Scientific publications are almost always about experimental successes. However, laboratory failures are the norm in science and an important phenomena for developing new knowledge too. ",
