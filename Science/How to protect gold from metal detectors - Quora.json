I actually did a post on this exact thing (but my post also includes GPRs) \u2026 I hope you enjoy it. Note this is mostly about hiding it in dirt, basement, etc., rather than putting it in secret places in the living areas of your home. Hiding Gold or Treasure at Your Home from Metal Detectors (for-fun Post) ...- Metal Detecting in the USA Limits of Treasure Hunting Equipment for Finding Gold ALL metal detectors overload in the presence of large quantities of iron. If the buried treasure is very close to the large iron, the gold signal will be almost completely masked.The buried treasure would need to be 8-10\u2033 minimum away from the large iron object before a typical metal detector would audibly separate them.GPR (ground penetrating radar) displays on rough, blurry shapes that requires an interpretation by the operator and/or data expert. You will need to know how \u201cnormal\u201d objects appear underground and simulate those so there\u2019s no suspicion when the data is reviewed.Ground density differences and buried items are easy to find using long probes often used for privy digging. Defeating Metal Detectors for finding your Gold Treasure: The things that will defeat a metal detector searching for your gold treasure include: Depth of the burial (but this also makes the stash hard to remove.)A large amount of IRON masking the signal, even if shallow.Assumptions by the operator.The effort required to carefully expose the doubtful object & put the object back in place afterward.Searcher reburies the \u201cfound item\u201d ignoring what might be buried underneath it.Signs of burial that look like typical maintenance.much more in the article\u2026..",

            "answer_text": "I am unsure of what scenario you may be referring to, therefore my answer can only be a general one. A handheld metal detector in the field will only penetrate the ground to a certain depth, depending on the type and quality of the detector and the size of the piece of gold. The larger the nugget the deeper it will be detected. If you are referring to say an airport scanner, then I am unaware of anything that will stop the gold, or any metal from being detected. If this doesn't answer your question, maybe you can explain the situation in a little more detail. Cheers. ",
