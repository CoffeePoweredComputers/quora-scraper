While there has been better positive case numbers, there doesn't seem to.a one to one correlation between testing and death toll even accounting for the expected delays between the two. So, I think both a lack of testing and better mask wearing and distancing are the explanation for the drop in positive casesParts of the GOP are actively trying to downplay the severity of the epidemic, and fudging the testing is easier than fudging the death toll. But worldometer has the country with 1280 dead today. ",
