            "answer_text": "Can an individual organism evolve? In everyday use of the word \"evolve\"we all evolve over our lifetimes. But not in the Darwinian sense of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Evolution is about individuals in a population out competing one another in the environment where they live. The best adapted ones are more successful in reproducing and passing on genes. The basic ingredients needed for Darwinian Evolution are Reproduction with heritable traits.Variation of heritable traits within a population, where new variations occasionally appear due to incidental reproduction errors (mutations).Selection pressures causing differences in reproduction rates, for the different variations in the traits.The words I put in bold show why an individual cannot evolve. It can not happen during the lifetime of an individual, the point where heritable information (DNA) is passed to the next generation is key to the process. We need a population with variation. An individual is no population and has no variation. Difference in reproductive success drive the whole process. It happens because of the differences between individuals in a population. We cannot have that with just one individual. ",

Biological evolution describes the changes in a population of organisms caused by the accumulation of inheritable variation. A single organism can develop. I conjecture that the word \u2018develop\u2019 in biological jargon corresponds to your meaning of the word \u2018evolve\u2019. A child \u2018develops\u2019 in to an adult. A child does not evolve into an \u2018adult\u2019. An embryo develops into a baby. The embryo does not evolve into a baby. A population of extant birds evolved from a non avian dinosaur. The population of extant birds did not develop from a non avian dinosaur. There are some borderline situations where both words may be applicable. We now know that cancer cells both develop AND evolve from somatic cells. It is hard to pin down. The cancer cells are arguably part of a single organism from which it emerged. Yet a cancer cell is in some ways an individual organism itself. I sometimes use the word \u2018emerge\u2019 for those borderline cases. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends upon which meaning of \u2018evolve/evolution\u2019 you are using. If you mean Evolution by Natural Selection, then no because that happens on populations rather than individuals. If you just mean can people evolve in the colloquial sense of changing, then sure. Evolution by natural selection needs a population where: - Individuals differ - Differences are inherited - Individuals produce more offspring than the environment can support Given those things, we expect that over time those individuals best suited to survive in their environment will continue to reproduce and those least suited will eventually die out. There are a lot of questions here on Evolution and it would seem that many are targeted at poking holes in Evolutionary Theory. Anybody who actually understands Evolution would realize that the fundamental theory is simply a statement of empirical facts and hence could only be overturned if those facts were falsified. It is hard to imagine a coherent universe where those facts could actually be falsified. You can see those three facts above in two generations of Maple trees. Beyond its simple roots, Evolution can become incredibly complex and it is certain that there are disagreements and misunderstandings as to which mechanisms are most important in particular cases. Discovering that some particular mechanism thought to be important is not that important does not invalidate the Theory of Evolution any more than a mistaken theory of chemical mechanisms for a type of reaction invalidates the Periodic table of the Elements.

            "answer_text": "Not in the biological definition of the term. Individuals can grow, and then they survive (or dcon\u2019t) and reproduce (or don\u2019t). But eventually, all individuals will die. Populations can evolve, as a given trait becomes more common or less common. But each individual has the traits that s/he has. Pokemon, Lamarck, the X-Men, and creationists claim that evolution is about one organism \u201cmagically\u201d turning into something different, but that\u2019s not how actual biological evolution works. An individual either survives and reproduces (in which case the next generation includes copies of those traits that made survival and reproduction possible) or it doesn\u2019t. As soon as someone asks you for an example of one individual \u201cevolving\u201d into another, you can automatically dismiss them, because they have no idea how the process works, and they are arguing against a figment of their imagination. Hope that helps. ",

Then those children have more children than those without the allele, etc etc. Over generations eventually everyone is descended from that first individual.
