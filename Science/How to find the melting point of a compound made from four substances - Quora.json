And OFTEN this melting point, and the melting points of its derivatives, can identify a substance unequivocally\u2026 On the other hand, an impure, or mixed substance, will have a melting point range \u2026and this cannot really aid in identification\u2026 You must separate, SOMEHOW, the mixture into its components\u2026 ",
