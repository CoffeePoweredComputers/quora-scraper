            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really know, but I\u2019d like to speculate here and, then, come back and see what is said by someone who knows what they are talking about. For me, science is a philosophical approach to understanding the world that has a rigorous methodology that provides evidence for or evidence against an assertion. It never proves anything because it is always open to new facts and new ways of seeing things. However, evidence can be very strong and provide a high degree of confidence or validity in certain things. Yet, science depends on being able to measure things. There are many things that we cannot measure. A good instance of this was the idea that energy exists everywhere in the universe. In 1855 (?), two scientists tried to measure this universal background energy, but failed. So, many said that there was no universal background energy, although that hadn\u2019t been proven. In 1986, a team of U.S. Air Force researchers had better equipment and provided a clear measurement of the universal background energy. It exists in all directions, so there is strong evidence that there is energy everywhere in the universe. There are a lot of so-called scientists (and popular media reporters) who will tell you that there is proof of this or that, or that there is proof that something is not so. They will refuse to believe any new assertion or even new evidence for or against something because they believe they already have all the fact. They know everything. But their belief is not science at all; it is a form of religion. Technology refers to using tools to accomplish things a human being can normally do. These tools have become so advanced that many people believe they will begin operating on their own, making their own decisions. They are programmed to perform certain tasks without human supervision. However, with artificial intelligence, certain people are asserting that tools (machines) will become conscious, will become superior to human beings, and will eventually supersede humans as an intelligent life form. This is actually within the realm of possibility, but mostly these people are talking about advanced but elegant computer programs that can learn about the world and process information many times faster that humans do. These machine learning programs, even when connected to a robot, are not true intelligence. They are artificial. They have not evolved over millions of years to be integral to the planet and are not expressions of the universe as we are. Yet, when our understanding of quantum physics improves - especially in the realm of energy flow in and around biological life forms and their integration into the universal energy field - then we might be able to design and build an intelligent life form to supersede human beings. Society is simply a group of people who manage to live together. They share a lot of physical and ideological concepts, many of which have been passed down over hundreds or thousands of years. The home is an interesting concept, expressed in our society as a box made of wood and other materials which can contain an environmentally controlled atmosphere suitable for human comfort. When humans occupy the house, they become familiar with it and the people who frequent the place. It\u2019s worth noting that homes and families are not always healthy, despite the persons feeling attached to them. The house itself may contain toxins like radon or black mold. People may form a \u201cpecking order\u201d wherein one person becomes the scapegoat for any and all negative feelings in the family. Science, technology and society have the meanings we assign to them. ",

            "answer_text": "With all due respect to Mr. Bruss, I\u2019d like to clarify slightly his otherwise sound definition for science. Science is a methodology.

This is loosely referred to as technology. Society is simply a group of people/individuals with a fixed locale, language, culture, etc. and has nothing whatsoever to do with the precious two topics.
