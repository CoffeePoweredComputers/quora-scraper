            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll go wild and give you _two_ examples :) An ion is like a molecule, except that it has an electrical charge. This almost always means that it has unequal numbers of protons and electrons (there are other charged particles, such as positrons, but they hardly ever show up in ordinary chemistry). So if you have eight protons (which means you\u2019re an oxygen atom) and nine electrons, you have a net charge of negative one, which makes you a negatively charged ion or \u201canion.\u201d If you have eight protons but only five electrons, you have a net charge of +3, which makes you a cation. (Other people will tell you that it\u2019s impossible to make O3+. They\u2019re wrong :)) So \u2014 the first way an ion can form by having one of its electrons \u201cknocked off\u201d by an electromagnetic wave. Ordinarily you have to be a fairly strong wave to do this \u2014 there are a very few chemical structures that can be ionized by visible light, but almost all atoms and molecules require a harder hit, such as ultraviolet light or gamma radiation. If this happens to you, you lose an electron, which means you _lose_ a negative charge, so your net charge is now +1 and you\u2019re a cation. This is a physical effect called \u201cionization,\u201d but most people would agree that it\u2019s not a chemical reaction, since only one atom is involved. The second way _is_ a chemical reaction. Let\u2019s start with an electrically neutral sodium atom (atomic number 11) and a chlorine atom, which is also electrically neutral (with an atomic number of 35). For reasons you can read about in a chapter on the alkali metals, the sodium atom has a very pesky electron that it would love to get rid of \u2014 but it can\u2019t just shoot it into space, because the electrostatic attraction between an electron and the resulting positively charged sodium ion would be _YUGE_. The electron would just change its mind and come back. (This actually happens \u2014 it\u2019s called fluorescence.) However, if we mix it up with a chlorine atom as well, the story is very different. The chlorine atom is absolutely delighted to accept that extra electron (read about halogens to learn more). So now we have a much more friendly situation. The sodium atom gives up its pesky outer electron and becomes a sodium ion, Na+, and the chlorine atom accepts the electron and becomes a chloRIDE ion (Cl-). And they stick together \u2014 why? Because opposite charges attract. Now for a story. Little Miss Chlorine came home from school one day and her mommy said \u2014 \u201cWhy Miss Chlorine, you\u2019ve grown an extra electron! You\u2019ll need a whole closet of new dresses. How on earth did you let that happen? Have you been hanging out with that nasty Sodium again?\u201d Miss Chlorine burst into tears and said, \u201cOh, Mommy \u2014 he just gave me a RIDE\u2026\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Since the answers provided below seem inadequate, I will address some of the misconceptions in them. Ions, of course, are charged molecules (using the broad definition of molecule, which includes individual atoms). Ions are not \u201cusually\u201d formed from atoms. This is a misperception fomented by the way we teach chemistry. Chemistry is usually taught by teaching from the foundations upwards, so we start with elements, describe atoms, then move on to compounds, molecules and ions. But in the region of this planet in which we live, the biosphere, this is misleading. Here, compounds are the norm, and elements are very, very rare. A few elements can be found in their elemental states (O2, N2, Au, Ag, etc.) but the amounts found in the elemental state are often dwarfed by the amounts in the compound state. For example, the amount of oxygen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere is dwarfed by the amount of oxygen in the Earth\u2019s crust. You can find small pieces of elemental iron lying around, but the vast majority of the iron around us is in the form of iron compounds. The upshot of this is that where we live, compound forms of the elements are \u201cnormal\u201d and elements are not. Similarly neutral atoms (being what the elements are made of) are not normal, but ions are. Take sodium, for example, which does not occur in nature in its elemental form, but its ionic form is ubiquitous. For example, about 1.5% of all of the ocean\u2019s mass is sodium. So, the \u201cchain of causation\u201d of \u201catoms gain or lose electrons to become ions\u201d is almost exactly backward. (As mentioned this is the order in which things were taught and since atoms are taught first, ions are linked back to the already taught atoms.) The odds are, in the case of Na+ ions, that those ions have been ions for millions if not billions of years and, if they have ever been transformed into atoms (by man, doesn\u2019t happen to any extent naturally), they didn\u2019t stay atoms for very long. Given any opportunity to interact with other chemicals, the sodium atoms revert back to their \u201cnormal\u201d state, as ions, in a trice. So, if you are in a student in a beginning chemistry course, the answer you are probably expected to come up with is \u201catoms gain or lose electrons \u2026\u201d The only thing lacking in such an answer is the truth. This mistake of chemical pedagogy is amplified as \u201cionic bonding\u201d is discussed which, in beginning chemistry classes, is almost always described using electron-transfer reactions, e.g. Na + Cl2 = NaCl, which is also far from being true. If you want to see ionic bonding in action, just evaporate some seawater (or salt water). As the water evaporates, the ions present bond with one another to make crystals. No electron transfers are involved. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean \u201cHow does iron form?\u201d or \u201cHow do ions form?\u201d. It's an important difference. If your question is how ions are \u201cformed\" then I can tell you this much (but I ain't a scientist; I leave the big answer to the real scientists): TL;DR: Ions can be formed in chemical reactions, natural decaying of momecules, heat and many more ways. Ions are in everything. For example: they are a product of natural \u201cdecaying\". For example the autoprotolysis of water: in this natural process 2 Water molecumes decay into one hydroxide ion and one hydronium ion. This is only one example of the formation of ions. You could say that whenever something is dissolved in a liquid, ions will be a product (To my knowledge this does not apply to the elements in the 8th main group. Correct me if I'm wrong). Ions can form in other actions too. The dissolvement is only one that I thought was easy to describe. Again: I'm not a scientist and all this is based upon my school knowledge. If I'm wrong at any point please correct me. Sorry for some bad wording but Ive never had chemistry in English. ",

            "answer_text": "Ions are mainly formed by unstable elements by gaining or losing of electron(s) in the process of attaining there stability as they combine with other elements to form a bond. Example 1; Na=11\tE. A is 2.8.1, For it to be stable, it loses 1 electron to form sodium ion (Na+) with a configuration of 2.8. It loses 1 electron instead of gaining 7. This is because the energy required to lose 1 electron is lower than that needed to gain 7. Therefore Na produces a cation (positively charged ion). Example 2; Sulphur has ATOMIC no. 16, E. A=2.8.6, It gains 2 electrons to be stable instead of losing 6 electrons. This is because of energy involved. It therefore gains 2 electrons to form a chloride ion (S2-) with arrangement of 2.8.8. Therefore, Sulphur produces an (anion\u2014:A negatively charged ion) ",

Metal atoms form positiveions, while non-metal atoms form negative ions. The strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions are called ionic bonds. ",

            "answer_text": "When an atom either loses it's electron or gains electron to achieve noble gas configuration or fully filled octet then it becomes ion. When an atom loses electron then cation is formed that is the atom gets positive charge nd when an atom gains electron then anion is formed I.e. it gets negative charge. This can be understood by karma theory. When a man (here atom) donates one rupee (here electron), he gets positive karma. Nd when he robs one rupee (here electron), he gets negative karma. ",

This can happen by chemical change or by receiving energy in the form of heat or radiation. The other way is almost to the same, when a molecule splits with an uneven distribution of charge. The same mechanism as before can make this energetically favourable. ",
