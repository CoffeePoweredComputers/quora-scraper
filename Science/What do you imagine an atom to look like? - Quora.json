            "answer_text": "I have a hard time grasping what an Atom looks like. Can you help explain it? Start with the simplest atom: Hydrogen. It has one proton as the \u201cnucleus\u201d, and one electron which we describe as being in orbit around the nucleus. Both or portrayed as little balls, like a very tiny planet with a moon. That\u2019s an image made up of physical things we recognize, since most people can picture physical them. But they are not physical things themselves \u2026 they are the stuff physical things are made of. So.. instead of a tiny planet in the center, imagine that it is a tiny ball of cotton. The \u201ccotton\u201d is a positively charged \u201cproton\u201d. The electron is more of a wave that surrounds the proton. The wave moves so fast that it appears to be nearly everywhere at once, but it spends a bit more time at the peaks. So, that\u2019s your image: a tiny cotton ball in the middle of an electron wave. You see more of the electron at the upper and lower peaks of its \u201cwave\u201d.  Heavier elements have more protons, and some neutrons to help hold the protons together. As you add electron waves, the electron \u201ccloud\u201d gets bigger and more complex. If you put this atom in an electric field, the electron cloud will distort, so the nucleus is no longer in the center. It becomes more of an egg shape.  ",

            "answer_text": "Answer #1: Atoms are tiny. Seriously, you do not understand how tiny they are. You can't use light to look at individual atoms, because light itself is bigger than that. In a very real sense, there is no such thing as \u201cwhat an atom looks like\u201d. Answer #2: If you imagine an atom as the size of a building, the nucleus would be a speck of dust near the middle. The rest of the atom is occupied (just barely) by electrons vibrating in rhythmic patterns so fast that there isn't any way to track them as discrete particles, not even in theory. The best you can do is clouds of probability. But those clouds are sturdy enough to produce all of the solid, liquids, and gases we see in the universe. ",
