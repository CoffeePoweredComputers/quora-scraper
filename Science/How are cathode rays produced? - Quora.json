            "answer_text": "Cathode rays are produced inside a vacuum tube using a positively charged element called \u201ccathode\u201d on the neck end of the tube and a High voltage negatively charged \u201canode\u201d at the opposite face end of the tube\u2026 When the cathode element is heated, it produces positively charged ions, which are attracted by the high voltage negative potential existing on the anode\u2019s coated face plate\u2026 As the electron beams travel between the cathode and the anode plate, they passes in between two other charge bodies called deflection plates which forces the beams to move and be deflected depending on how much the deflection plates are energized /charged.. In a sense the deflection plates influence the ions to move in certain directions before they hit the phosphor coated anode\u2026 The cathode to anode can be the equivalent of horizontal sweeps, while the deflection plates causes the vertical sweep..in my perspectives\u2026 Like painting the x-y axis onto the face of the tube..

            "answer_text": "A heating element, usually operating on 6 volts AC, heats a cathode red hot which drives electrons off the surface of the cathode. High positive voltages on various grids and elements in the tube attract and accelerate the electrons toward the phosphor coated glass screen. In the case of an oscilloscope, several thousand volts are applied to the inside of the screen while various voltages applied to grids focus the beam and deflection plates move the beam up and down and back and forth. In the case of a TV set or computer monitor, deflection coils on the outside of the tube move the beam around while up to 30,000 volts are applied to the inside of the screen. In the case of TV, most of the programming is a waste of time and electric power. ",
