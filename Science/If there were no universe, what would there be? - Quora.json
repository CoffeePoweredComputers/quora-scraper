            "answer_text": "Maybe there is no universe already ! If you ever look closely in vacuum you will find out that space is an ocean full of particles and anti particles that spontaneously form and destroy. They lliterally exist and cease to exist at the same time ! The quantum world is rather strange. Things are there and things aren't there. You are made of these fundamental particles as well therefore it wouldn't be wrong to say that fundamental particles at quantum level are created and annihilated to form you at the same time. Which simply means that in a really short amount of time , you probably don't exist but boom! The next moment you do ! The same thing happens in this universe , it is an ocean where particles are disturbances (ripples) on it's surface. Therefore the universe already doesn't exists but it does exists. Extra info: The formation and annhilation of particles in vacuum is known as quantum fluctuation. A quantum fluctuation is the temporary appearance of energetic particles out of empty space, as allowed by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states that for a pair of conjugate variables such as position/momentum or energy/time, it is impossible to have a precisely determined value of each member of the pair at the same time. For example, a particle pair can pop out of the vacuum during a very short time interval. An extension is applicable to the \"uncertainty in time\" and \"uncertainty in energy\" (including the rest mass energy mc2{\\displaystyle mc^{2}}). When the mass is very large like a macroscopic object, the uncertainties and thus the quantum effect become very small, and classical physics is applicable. In quantum mechanics, and in particular in quantum field theory, Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows energy to briefly decay intoparticles and antiparticles which then annihilate back to energy without violating physical conservation laws. As time and space are being probed at smaller scales, the energy of such particles, called virtual particles, increases. Combining this observation with the fact that in Einstein'stheory of general relativity energy curvesspace-time, one can imagine that at sufficiently small scales the energy of these fluctuations would be large enough to cause significant departures from the smooth space-time seen at macroscopic scales, giving space-time a \"foamy\" character Mind blowing isn't it ? :) Edit: I went a little off the route as per the question because it asked \u201cwhat would be there if there wasn't a universe?\u201d Well theories say that if there is no universe , there would be a true vacuum. Particles won't be able to exist in such a state. It will be like a blank canvas where you don't have the paint to draw things. I hope this helped you :) ",

            "answer_text": "\\U0001f315\\U0001f311\\U0001f315\\U0001f311.....An Indian scientist swayam prakash revealed all the secrets of science and universe and also proved the presence of cluster universe. In a science academy he explained his theory in short.According to him If u assume there is nothing then itself a question arises that why not infinite. Thus a self balance process starts. Because this here zero and infinite both exist and universe expands 3 dimensions x y z, matter and space +proton - electron neutron in time past present and future cluster universe which behaves like zero for each other all are because this.Approximate a zero size can have very big universe because size is internal ratio and relation. 0+1=universe Total no. of universe =0+1+infinite(0+1)=infinite. For a matter time and 3 dimensions, proportionality and constants are necessary. Soul is part of god. An American scientist asked him your analysis is true but there are unknown possibilities of existence of some other factors or options which is beyond imagination for human brain how u will analyze.He replied, great there was nothing like numbers and options before universe so there is no question like this. Self balance theory can solve all science secrets and problems.This is base of nature and human life so everyone should know this. ",
