            "answer_text": "Well, depending on the size, temperature, luminity , distance, among other algothirms inherent in the star , the light is beamed outwardly from the spherical surface of the star. There is X amount of photons spreading apart to ever bigger spherical reception around the star for light years that the star start to dim as the X amount of photons is divided into the ever larger spherical surface at every level . If you are 50 light years away from that star , you get X amount of photons and the next guy who is 100 light years away will get less than half X amount of photons because of the Pi multipied by radius of the sphere or you roughly get about two and half times as much photons as the other guy 100 light years away. You get about 6.5 times as much photons as the guy after the next guy that is 200 light years away. and so on.. The guy who is about a million light years away, will get almost nothing from the star in terms of photons.. The star simply fades out due to the much bigger spherical surface that is a million light years away.. you probably do not notice that around here on Earth as it is just miles here and there.. But for stars that is measured in light years and the huge amount of photons being given off by any of the stars is able to \u201cclaw\u201d its way over ponderous distances known as light years.. Eventually, each of the stars will cease to be visible of its own light at certain point very far away enough. Dilution of photons do happen over great distances. Telescopes are like five , ten, or thirty foot wide eyepupils compaed to our eyepupils that is only a few millimeter across so telescopes are able to capture enough photons and funnel it down into eyepieces or camera lens to show the distant stars.. Still , more distant stars are not captured with our telescopes, so we refer to different electromagnetic wavelengths like ultraviolet spectrum, microwaves, xrays, gammarays, and so called cosmic rays to help us peer ever further into the ever expanse of the ever fainter and fainter stars no matter how bright they still are way over there. Their photons can only spread so far toward ever expanding spherical theresholds of the universe as we know it. ",

            "answer_text": "It is more difficult to see a specific grain of sand 3 meters away, then to see stars at night on a clean atmosphere. Our eyes retina sensors convert photons to electric impulses to the brain. Anything that can project photons to the retina will be \u201cseen by the brain\u201d\u2026 just remembering that we don\u2019t actual \u201csee things\u201d, our brain \u201cdream\u201d about creating an image of the radiation that hit our retina. Anyhow, the far star projects a tremendous unimaginable quantity of photons and spread all around, some of those photons travel short, hit other matter in the space, even masses, planets, gases, other stars, etc, but other photons travel forever with no obstruction, some hit our retina, and they are enough in quantity and energy to be converted to electric impulses to our brain, so we actually \u201cdream\u201d about its existence. Most people can\u2019t understand this animal seeing thing. We take it for granted without even thinking about that. You can for a fact \u201csee\u201d things by other ways. Touch, is a good example, and it is very similar to sonar echo-location of dolphins and bats. Do this experiment. Close your eyes, ask your friend to put a known object over the table, a cell phone, a battery, a fork, a shoe, a screwdriver, anything that you may know. Now, with your eyes closed, try to identify the object. You will be able in few seconds. How you do it? Because your fingers are transferring information about the form of the object, weight, texture to your brain, and your brain will do an extra job trying to match that information to what it has in memory, it will find comparisons easily. After you know what is it, your brain will actually \u201cdream\u201d about the object, and colors will start to fly, you will be able to tell the color of the object if you remember seeing it around before. Your memory will kick up, and you will be able to even tell something more, like, \u201coh, the screwdriver is dirty in the handle\u201d, or something like that. You see, you don\u2019t need your eyes to see, you just need very little information about the object and a previous memorization of it. If you never saw the object before, you will not be able to tell almost nothing about it, perhaps you will be able to say its temperature, if it is soft or hard, if it has sharpen edges, the weight, how big, and then, you will try to make connections with the memory of other things\u2026 For example, it has sharpen edges and it is hard and cold, may be it is some sort of saw or knife, but you will only be able to say that because you already know a saw or a knife. So, you are able to say you are seeing a star in the black sky, because it is a small bright white dot of light, hanging up there, and because you already saw stars before and know how they are. By the way, our Sun is a star, you see it everyday, it is very far away, and it was not in your question\u2026 ",
