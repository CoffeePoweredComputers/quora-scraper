            "answer_text": "File under \u201cYou learn something new every day.\u201d When I first heard about a radar satellite for mapping the oceans, I thought \u201cIt\u2019s flat! Duh!\u201d Well, it turns out the oceans are anything but flat. Depending on how you process the data, you can detect wave height, even in places like the Southern Ocean where ships are few. You can monitor sea ice. Currents pile water up against the continents making the sea a meter or so higher. And you can map the ocean floor. Areas of mass excess like seamounts have slightly higher gravity and pull the sea surface down, and areas with less mass, like trenches, have lower gravity and the sea surface bulges upward. You get a subdued mirror image of the sea floor. It\u2019s not like you see bumps and hollows on the sea - they\u2019re meters high and kilometers across - but radar can detect them.  This is what one of the earliest maps looked like, before it had the pretty elevation colors added. Trenches are obvious, many fracture zones are visible, the mid-ocean ridges show up and especially dramatic is the \u201cmoat\u201d around the Hawaiian hot spot track, where the weight of the volcanoes depresses the crust. The virtue of satellites is that they\u2019re global. And when I saw this, my response was \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t seen it, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy are satellites used to map the ocean floor?\u201d Satellites generally aren\u2019t used to chart the ocean, they can be used to provide some coarse resolution (kilometer) estimates about the seafloor. For charting purposes, high-resolution (centimeter to meter) scale acoustic echo sounding is used in waters deeper than 30\u201350m. The International Hydrographic Organization has not yet released policies on using satellite derived bathymetry in nautical charts, though perhaps someday soon satellite multi-spectral imagery may be used to chart shallow coastal waters.
