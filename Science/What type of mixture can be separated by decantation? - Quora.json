            "answer_text": "Any mixture which consists of two phases: e.g . Ether and water, you can decant off the top layer of ether, or run the bottom layer (water) out of a separating funnel. The separation is not perfect, as ether has some solubility in water and water has some solubility in ether. e.g. Barium sulfate powder and water. This is a two-phase system because the salt is insoluble in water. Decant the water off. Hundreds of other examples, where ever you have two phases. ",
