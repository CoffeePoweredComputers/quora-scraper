            "answer_text": "There is a core of very real but soft science, on the same order as economics.  As with all retrospective sciences, gathering hard data is difficult, and you're required to do what experiments you can as the world allows.   It's not completely devoid of hard data.  Sex researchers like Robin Baker and Mark Bellis gather genuine hard data: http://www.springerlink.com/content/p571746037354634/ And economics researchers like Dan Ariely and linguists like Steven Pinker are contributing to evolutionary psychology with real experiments. Unfortunately, the explanatory power over the past is limited.  The theories of evolutionary psychology can make predictions going forward, which make it a real science.  When it tries to explain the past, it's difficult to gather additional data since behavior doesn't fossilize.  They're forced to use proxies, like Baker & Bellis' cross-species analyses of modern sperm.  This is a problem of every retrospective science, from paleogeology to astrophysics, and we don't consider them pseudosciences. I reserve \"pseudoscience\" for purported sciences which exist in contradiction of data (such as ESP, where controlled tests repeatedly fail to justify the claims) or in the explicit inability to gather data (such as some forms of creationism).  The border between science and pseudoscience is fluid, but the core of evolutionary psychology is well within science. Its practitioners, especially those outside of academia, often wander into pseudoscience.  The experiments justify theories with data, but its easy to extrapolate those theories well beyond what's justified by the data.  When those are falsely presented as conclusions of science, it verges into pseudoscience. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not strong science, and in the public sphere it becomes a form of speculative story-telling.  Keeping that in mind, however, we don't have to call it \"pseudoscience\", and I think it has social value unless we start to take it literally. When people complain about \"pseudoscience\" they might be referring to the public use of a body of theory, not its narrower practice among scientists and academics. I think what matters is not so much whether there are evolutionary psychologists who adhere to a well-defined scientific discipline.  It is the fact that in practice, evolutionary psychology is used by the public at large in a very fuzzy way, and can be used to justify almost any social or psychological idea or prejudice by making up a reasonable-sounding story about how it might enhance \"survival\".  No \"equipment\" and scientific method is needed to play that game. So, although it has some insights to offer, it can be a tool for scientism and perhaps the social Darwinism of our times. On the other hand, what's wrong with a good story? This form of questioning makes it easy for anyone to ask questions about complex topics and receive roughly scientific replies.  I like the way it leads to highly speculative, but science-informed, rationales.  These become the folk-tales of our times. Check out the the many What is the evolutionary advantage of X?  questions on Quora, where X = swearing,  depression, dreaming, emotions, blushing, self-doubt, shame, being upset, and so on, and decide for yourself.

            "answer_text": "No. From looking at questions about evolution in Quora,, the biggest problem is that people really don\u2019t understand how evolution works. When it comes to evolutionary psychology, the situation is even worse. Evolutionary psychology asks the question, is human behavior influenced by our genetic inheritance? The answer is obviously yes. That said, it is extremely difficult to determine how genes effect behavior, but there are plenty of studies that show genetic influence on behavior. One reason is that we can\u2019t experiment on people by controlling their genetics. We have to do correlational studies that link gene frequencies with vague measures of behavior. That\u2019s what gives critics their meat: it\u2019s almost impossible to do rigorous cause and effect science when you can\u2019t control for genetic differences and how to define behavioral outcomes. Nevertheless, scientists are slowly making headway through twin studies, studies of the affects of genetic deficiencies (see Williams syndrome), and other techniques. ",

Evolution is a fact. Facts can\u2019t be invalid, so why even ask that question? The question itself is broken Re: Psychology Ask yourself another Q What else could Psychology actually be, but: Evolutionary? Life, ie Plants and Animals, evolve. (Good luck, trying to stop \u2018em.) Biology evolves. Culture evolves. That\u2019s the universe we live in. In short, if you\u2019re trying to figure out how and why plants and animals (including humanimals) are the way they are, and behave the way they do, then Ev Psych is the only Psychology that even makes sense. Darwin in 1859 (Origin) noted rightly that Psychology would be placed on a new footing once he cracked the basics of evolution (what it is, how it works, and why).

Maybe it\u2019s an evolved dinosaur. Hey look, another bird!) Or, another approach: Has anyone got any better ideas than Ev Psych? If so, we all need it. Hurry up and come up with something better (or, less-worse) than Ev Psych. But: good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "In human behaviour, culture plays undoubtedly a big role, we just need to compare the role of women in Norway and Saudi Arabia, being both female Homo Sapiens having been through almost the same evolution and having almost the same genes. Evolutionary psychology has almost nothing to say here, regarding these differences because they arose from culture, nurture and education, which change much faster than the mutations of genes. Before the Neolithic revolution some 10 thousand years ago, there was no culture in the macro-sociological sense it has today, that is, myths, languages, opinions and behaviours common to many million people (in German the word Kultur means both culture and civilization). Homo Sapiens has approximately 150 thousand years, thus most of our genes were selected in a time period where there was no culture nor social constructs like today\u2019s. However, it is not hard to realise that; in the same manner that the colour white was selected for the polar bear, as such visual trait represented a phenotypic advantage over other individuals, considering that the white colour of the fur provided camouflage and thus higher chances of being successful when hunting; some psychological traits might have also been advantageous in the past, further considering that genes play also partially a role in the development of our brains, more particularly in the limbic system which is present in any mammal. Furthermore a significant amount of psychological evolutionary traits are much older than Homo Sapiens, like fear of heights (vertigo) which is common to every mammal, thus coming from the Mesozoic more than 60 million years ago. As an extra example, all primates have fear of snakes. Therefore fear is undoubtedly an evolutionary psychological trait, as the individuals, throughout different time periods, that presented aversion and repulsive feelings towards heights, snakes, beasts, rats and bees were selected. Or the individuals that presented attracting tasty emotions towards sugar or fat were selected because that presented an advantage, as caloric food was very scarce in the Paleolithic. It is not either hard to admit that sex also plays an important psychological, or at least not purely phenotypic, role in any sexy species. And sexual attraction is undoubtedly a result of the evolution of species. Regarding the social constructs, they do indeed exist, nonetheless ultra feminism has became partially the Church of modern times, rejecting Science using the same ethical, cultural and moral values, Church was giving in the past to say that the civilized Man has nothing to do with wild chimpanzees! Contrary to social sciences, evolutionary psychology is based on solid evidence of evolution through natural selection. The main difference is that, instead of being phenotypic, the traits are purely psychological. Whether lay men use it wisely or evoke it for the most evil acts of racism, sexism or bigotry, it has nothing to do with the Science per se. The knowledge provided by Particle Physics was used to produce the atomic bomb and wipe out 150 thousand lives in Hiroshima; but these ethical oppositions do not convert Particle Physics into a pseudoscience. The usage of Science must have boundaries according to Ethics, but the definition of the prior is totally independent from the latter. ",

Let\u2019s take a look at an area that might be said to build on evolutionary psychology in the popular press, the \u201cpaleo-diet.\u201d This concept is filled with speculations attempting to answer the question, \u201cwhat did primitive humans eat.\u201d Well, the first faulty assumption here is that all primitive humans ate the same things when, in fact, they would have eaten whatever was edible in their environment, prior to the invention of agriculture, which would have varied by season. This is parallel to evolutionary psychology in that the things shaping the minds of early humans would vary from place to place and across time. As a result, the speculations of both diet counselors and evolutionary psychologists depend on the assumptions made about the era, environment, social structure, behavior, and diet of those early humans. While all of science is a web of assumptions made on the strength of experimental results, some areas can readily verify those assumptions. This, largely, is not the case with \u201cevo-psych.,\u201d although practitioners do attempt to follow the general experimental method. ",

Possibly a blend of the two? When we look at the evolution of the brain throughout the animal kingdom we can see that basic human behavior has evolved along with the brain. Behaviors related to the survival of the species are subject to survival pressures. There is a good deal of value in applying the techniques and understanding gained from natural science to social science. ",

Examining how many human relationships you can keep track of, e.g., is suggestive of how large human bands probably were in pre-history (200). Looking at male/female body size ratios to see patterns with apes in mating styles might support claims that serial monogomy with cheating is part of our evolutionary baggage. You can\u2019t rewind or repeat history so claims must be limited in scope to be convincing, but it doesn\u2019t mean none are. ",

No in terms of much research and hard data going into these assertions. Evolutionary psychology is essentially based on highly educated guesses.
