            "answer_text": "There can be atoms and molecules of many gases and vapours present in vacuum. In industrial processes, it is normal to dry all sort of materials and food products under vacuum. So in industry we come across water vapour, oil vapour, sometimes even metal vapour under vacuum. Under high vacuum, even walls of chamber release gases (trace quantities dissolved in them), making it extremely difficult to get really high vacuum for research and scientific development. When we consider interstellar space, which is a high vacuum for most part, has atoms of hydrogen and helium very sparingly spread - may be just a few atoms per square metre. ",

The vacuum of space, the most common vacuum, contains hydrogen and to a lesser extent helium It can also contain, depending on location \u201cdust\u201d which comes down to just about any atom.
