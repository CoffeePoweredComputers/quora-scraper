            "answer_text": "A really fun one to do (granted you have permission from your teacher) is the exploding gummy bear. It's a simple experiment to conduct, in test tube (preferably also in a fume good or and enclosed space where it's difficult for a student to be injured) put some potassium chlorate. Heat it up with a Bunsen burner until it's boiling. Turn the Bunsen burner off and add a gummy bear. I would also recommend that at this point you take a very large step back. I've attached a video of the experiment. It's a lot of fun, and always a blast with the students!! Exploding Gummi Bear and Potassium Chlorate ",

            "answer_text": "My highschool chemistry teacher gave us twelve unknown chemicals and made us identify them, which was kinda fun. We also did a lab using red cabbage as an indicator and had to titrate to figure out what pH it changed colors at. I would suggest looking for introductory college course labs and seeing if you can use them with your class equipment. They\u2019re generally about the same difficulty as highschool labs. For example titrating organe juice to find the citric acid concentration or doing the same but with vinegar. ",
