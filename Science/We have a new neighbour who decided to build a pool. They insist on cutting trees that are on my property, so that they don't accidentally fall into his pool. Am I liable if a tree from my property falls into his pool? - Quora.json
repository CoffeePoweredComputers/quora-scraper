            "answer_text": "I have a little bit of personal experience with falling trees so I will add my hard earned knowledge here. I have a fairly large back yard in a mid sized suburban city in Tennessee, USA. Our back yard butts up to a drainage area, which is an unimproved lot. When an opportunity came along to purchase part of this area we did so, intending to continue to protect it and keep it natural, as the actual land owner was going to be bulldozing a track around the perimeter of the lot for his kids to ride their minibikes/small motorcycles. Sadly, after my purchase he hired a bulldozer crew and instructions were misunderstood, and by the time I saw what was happening, ran through my yard, leaped a fence and flagged down the bulldozer operator, much damage was done. We couldn't do much, it was an accident, but we did now fence in our new addition and began to replant trees. We also now had shared open land with another backyard neighbor so we put additional fencing eight feet away from their fence, with a gate so we could mow and maintain the area, and so their dogs and ours would not be always barking and running at each other. Enter the first tree. During a strong storm a very large and old tree fell. It upended and damaged the home and fence of a neighbor to the rear of our newly acquired lot and damaged about 25\u201330 feet of our new fence. The neighbor\u2019s insurance company repaired her home and all of her fence, but not ours. It was considered an Act of God, so they were not liable, unless there was prior knowledge that the tree was dead/damaged and they had done nothing. Rather than fight, my husband replaced our fence, but irreparable harm was done to our neighborhood relationship. A few years later along comes tree number two from the yard with the adjoining fence and dogs. Another Act of God which destroyed our fence with the gate and several of the trees we were trying to restore to the area.They cleaned up the wood that fell but left our mangled fence. We did not replace it, just removed it. It will be their problem listening to our dogs and theirs barking at each other now. Some of our trees were damaged but remained standing as their insurance denied accountability. Tree number three followed a few years later. It was our tree, one of the ones that had been weakenedby their tree when it fell. It fell onto their fence. I laughed at the karma and removed the tree bits but did not approach them about the fence. God is good. My immediately adjacent neighbor had a tree that was in bad shape and leaning. I did notify them that the direction it was leaning was toward my property and looked like a strong wind would blow it onto one of our out buildings and asked them to cut it back or remove it before it could happen. I took pictures of it from my yard and let them know that if it fell I had evidence of it's poor health for insurance purposes. They did the right thing and removed it, God bless them. There is a much longer saga of my fences, thanks to a man in a stolen truck and a police pursuit through my back yard, but that will have to wait for another day. Good fences make good neighbors. Sometimes trees will fall. Your insurance will only be liable to damage to his property if your trees are in ill health and you know about it and do nothing. Acts of God are on his insurance. ",

            "answer_text": "We have a new neighbor who decided to build a pool. They insist on cutting trees that are on my property, so that they don't accidentally fall in his pool. Am I liable if a tree from my property falls in his pool? My biggest concern, if he\u2019s worried about a tree from your property falling into his pool, is that his pool is too close to the property line. In most bylaws, the pool has to be a certain number of feet away from the property line and there has to be a fence for safety around the pool. I know in our neighborhood that bylaw is 8 feet from the property line, and the fence has to be 6 feet high at least. It would have to be a pretty substantial storm or accident that would take down a tree and put it into his pool. My insurance agent has reliably informed me that unless there is proof of prior knowledge of any rot or other damage which would compromise the integrity of the tree, any accidental felling of the tree would be covered. I know this because my mother-in-law was concerned that my neighbor\u2019s tree was about to fall on my husband\u2019s garage. Had it done so it was large enough to have taken out a corner of the roof and to significantly damage the double door. We contacted our insurance agent and they said that the insurance would not cover the damage because we knew about the rot in the tree prior to any damage occurring. If the tree were to fall we would have to sue the neighbor for damages because they knew about the rot and did nothing to prevent the predictable damage. Their insurance would not cover them, they would be out of pocket for the entire expense. On the other hand, if the damage was caused because of a storm or accident to the tree, it is unpredictable and would, therefore, be covered. (The neighbor, after my mother-in-law threatened her with a lawsuit should the tree damage the garage, did take down the tree.) As others have mentioned, it is more likely that your neighbor simply doesn\u2019t want to clear leaves. If you want to keep the tree, double check with your insurance agent, and check with the local bylaw officer. You never know, he might be planning on putting in a pool that\u2019s entirely illegal and too close to the property line. ",
