            "answer_text": "Indeed there are. In fact there is an entire class of materials called \u201cionic liquids\u201d, which are liquid at room temperature. They are not what you would classically think of as a \u201csalt\u201d (ie, a metal halide). They are typically organic molecules designed so that they don\u2019t \u201cpack\u201d into a nice lattice like a regular salt does. Ionic liquid - Wikipedia They are becoming useful recently as an electrolyte in various battery technologies ",

            "answer_text": "With increase in degree of covalency in the bond the melting point of the \u201cionic compound \u201c decreases..take the eg of HgI. The compound has a degree of ionicity in its bond. But the Hg which has a pseudo noble gas configuration has a strong ionic potential polarising the large iodide ion to increase the covalency of the bond..result: melting point of~260C.. compare that to NaCl which has ~800C. I don't know if there r lower but feel free to comment below..I will be happy to know that compound.. ",
