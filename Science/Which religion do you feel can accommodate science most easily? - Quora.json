            "answer_text": "Evolution is a side issue. The central issue is whether or not a particular religion is compatible with science in general. Both science and individual religions make certain assumptions about reality. The study of what reality is like is called metaphysics. Science assumes that reality exists independent of any consciousness. In other words, reality has primacy over consciousness. One implication of this assumption is that contradictions cannot exist in reality. Some religions assume the opposite. Unless I am mistaken, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and many Christian sects implicitly assume that consciousness has primacy over reality. At least one consciousness\u2014God\u2014exists independent of reality and can change the basic laws of reality as He wishes. He could make the earth and everything in it in 6 days out of nothing. He could even make contradictions exist if He wanted. This belief contradicts the basic metaphysical assumptions of science. Even Zen Buddhism believes that understanding can come from thinking about contradictions. That belief is clearly incompatible with science. There is only one religion that I am aware of that shares the assumptions of science. It believes that reality has primacy over consciousness. In other words this religion believes that reality and its unchanging laws are independent of God himself. For example, this religion believes that God's power comes from his knowledge of reality. This religion is tied to a specific institutional church. What church is that? It is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It's adherents are sometimes called Latter-day Saints (LDS) or Mormons. One of the early leaders of the LDS church, Brigham Young, said,   In these respects we differ from the Christian world, for our religion will not clash with or contradict the facts of science in any particular.  This may come as a surprise to many who view the religion as being mystical. After all they do believe that many events occurred that seem miraculous. But they simply interpret those events as being beyond our currently scientific understanding. Another LDS church leader and author wrote:  Miracles are commonly regarded as occurrences in opposition to the laws of nature. Such a conception is plainly erroneous, for the laws of nature are inviolable. However, as human understanding of these laws is at best but imperfect, events strictly in accordance with natural law may appear contrary thereto. The entire constitution of nature is founded on system and order. [James E. Talmage, The Articles of Faith, 1966, p. 220] Now, I may be wrong that this is the only religion that is compatible with science, but it is the only one of which I am aware. ",

            "answer_text": "Some famous scientists were Christians (Issac Newton comes to mind).  I guess (But it's just an opinion) that Dyanetics \"plays\" science into their religion - and I'm just calling that because I'm being agreeable -  But it's my own personal belief that both religion and science can't really be reconciled, by their very nature.  Simply put, religion is a matter of faith, and  faith is the one thing that is simply not what science is about. granted, the topic of faith has been scientifically studied, but science does not recognize the practice of faith in any part of its practice, other than one must \"have faith\" in science, which is a totally different statement. It may just be me and I'm not trying to argue,  but I wouldn't consider Buddhism to be \"science-compatible\", because it very specifically places belief in Narakas (Hells), Pretas (spirits), Asuras (gods, demi-gods, anti-gods), Devas (spirits, gods, angels) and other such beings. Not to mention rebirth and transmigration of the soul. This is just my own definition, but I see religion to be the realm of mysticism... And that truly isn't a bad thing. There are some things that science can't explain, and that's a very good thing in my oponion. And because the concept of God can't be \"explained\" or diagrammed scientifically, I guess it can be argued that God (or Gods) are, in effect a symbol.  Which intrestingly enough, makes the concept of God much more powerful than if it could be explained scientifically.  Scientific truth comes and goes, but that which can't be explained holds our attention for as long as it can't be explained. ",
