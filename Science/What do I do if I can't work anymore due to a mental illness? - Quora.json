            "answer_text": "Sooner or later most of us will face some crisis in which all appears lost, and dire remedies are considered, remedies that will unintentionally inflict so much pain on people you never thought would care. I once felt so ravaged and useless and depressed and alone in my pain as a result of years of seemingly intractable illness followed by a deep personal crisis, and there was a four day period in which I considered that final option. But I remembered the stories of a nurse I used to know, where she told me of her father\u2019s suicide, and what a terrible emotional blow that was. I resolved not to hurt anyone like that. What was left was the realization that when you hit bottom, and if you don\u2019t lke being there, up is the only direction left to try. The idea that you must be a prodcutive member of society is most likely not an idea that you came up with yourself. It sounds like you were indoctrinated with that one. You will find life more enjoyable if you try to be self-actualized, to live by your own standards rather than those that others set for you. To do that you will need to get to know yourself at a much deeper level than you do now. You are being tormented by the bad habit of self criticism. Explore that critic within in your therapy sessions. Learn how to accept yourself as you are, and don\u2019t put yourself down for not meeting the expectations of your internalized critic. Explore the origins of your self-criticism with your therapist. If you grew up with highly critical people, you will have been trained to criticize yourself. Take some time to get more realistically acquainted with yourself. Make lists of the activities you enjoy, the things you are good at, the things you would like to become good at. Learn more about all your health issues, and dig deeply here. Find out the ways to mitigate those issues, find out what your limitations are, and how you may overcome them or work around them. Give yourself permission to imagine the life you would truly like to live, the person you would lke to become. Don\u2019t let others influence you here. You need no one\u2019s permision to grow into who you truly want to be. Begin taking steps to realize those imaginings, but expect setbacks as you learn the way forward. Setback are teachers. Persist. What kind of livelihoods might there be that is consistent with your vison? Learn about them, reach for them. Learn about compassion and practice it. This can make a huge improvement in your life. A Guide to Cultivating Compassion in Your Life, With 7 Practices ",

            "answer_text": "U.S.A Call 1-800-273-8255 if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself. (National Suicide Hotline) No, If you hurt yourself, you are more likely to \u201copen the door to loved ones that you know to future suicide.\u201d They may think suicide is an acceptable way of solving things. Often, when we lose a job or the ability to do one, due to disability, mental illness or not, we grieve, feel guilty, worthless and unlovable. Depression can often worsen if you have health problems and one can feel like they have \u201cno more\u201d fight or hope inside. We need support until we can hope again. You do not have to be working to be a productive member of society. You can love others and volunteer as much as can when you feel better. Where I live, in Kansas, it is hard to get state help. But other states do give help to people that are 100% disabled, All disabled people can apply for SSDI/SSI. Please be open with your therapist. Sometime the problem is temporary and it will take small steps to get better. I might know someone that went though a situation like yours in America, that lost a mother to suicide to depression when the child was 5 years old. The child was no longer protected and faced abuse. Please stay with us. Edit: add suicide hotline name ",
