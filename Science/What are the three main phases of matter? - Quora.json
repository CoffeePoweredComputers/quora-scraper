Those would be: NeutroniumSolidLiquidSuperfluidGasPlasmaFermionic condensateBose-Einstein condensate\u2026hang on just one moment here  So here\u2019s the thing. Traditional teaching holds that there are three phases, solid, liquid, and gas. We even draw phase diagrams showing which of those three you find at different pressures/temperatures. Like this:  But \u201ctraditional teaching\u201d also tell us that we have a mere five senses, then declines to mention which of those we use to tell if we\u2019re hot, or hungry, or off-balance. Traditional teaching leaves much to be desired. And those phase diagrams? This is the real one:  Yup\u2026 that\u2019s 13 distinct phases of ice alone, all of which are considered a solid. They don\u2019t all float on liquid water either. We\u2019ll also speak of amorphous phases, crystalline phases, semi-crystalline phases, etc. As well as the supercritical fluids and condensates mentioned above, plus the various changes involved as a material cools enough to become superconducting.  TLDR; the very idea of having just three phases is a massive over-simplification. It\u2019s a useful one when educating pre-teens, but it\u2019s a terrible approximation of the real world for any serious scientific or engineering application. ",

            "answer_text": "The question seems - as i read it just now - in part an innuendo to the \u201cthree elements\u201d of ancient greek philosophy and then it woudl have the following background, i would like to mention in short: . If i remember this correctly, they were Earth , as what we call \u201cSolid\u201d or \u201cDust\u201d or \u201cStone\u201d Water, as what we call \u201cLiquid\u201d Air, the invisible \u201cgas\u201d (see for example Long/Sedley \u201cHellenistic Philosophy\u201d ) The fourth element was in their opinion a special case: Fire, that what is hot and bright and moving always in its flames These were called the \u201cFour Elements\u201d, and well, people thought, all things in universe were made of these fundamental \u201celements\u201d, (Another meaning than \u201cChemical elements in the Peridoc System of Elements (PSE) ) except some other things, which i do not mention here. (like \u201cThe void\u201d, or \u201cThe Sayable\u201d it seems too difficiult to explain what they thought it is, now, i never understood complete, what a \u201cvoid\u201d means or if it exists at all\u2026. and it leads to philosophy and metaphysical thoughts of complex higher order questions,which is offtopic here , but just to mention, to show the pathway to other disciplines ) Maybe, the question was really meant physical, and this is then not the background of this question. In this case, excuse me for spontanous answering, without further information. But i think, for purposes of Daily-living, the four-elements-teaching is sufficient for unerstanding of nature for many people, who have not run through a long-years lasting scientific training and furthermore, don\u2019t need it or don\u2019t want it or cannot afford it.
