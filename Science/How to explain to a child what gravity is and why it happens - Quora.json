            "answer_text": "To a 5 year old \u201cGravity is the force, almost like two magnets, that makes different objects pull at each other. So you are pulled to the ground but because you\u2019re small, I can lift you up away from the ground. The car outside is bigger than you so it gets pulled much harder to the ground than you do so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t lift it up like I can lift you. But a crane, which is much stronger than me could lift the car, and so on and so on. Now planets and the sun work the same way, The sun is very, very big and it pulls on all the planets really hard but they\u2019ve got a trick, they never fall right into the sun, instead they just swing around the sun, just like the moon is pulled by the earth but just swings around the earth. That my dear is Gravity. Objects pulling at each other, the bigger one or both objects, the stronger they pull at each other. Now, in the movie Interstellar, they talk about black holes. Well, these happen when a sun, like ours only much much bigger, gets to the point that it\u2019s pulling on its outer layers so strongly that it sucks them and everything in between into a tiny but really heavy ball. It\u2019s the entire huge sun but sucked into this tiny little space, almost like cramming a whole bunch of stuff into a backpack. All your books, lunch, scarf, shoes, whatever all crammed into a small back pack that gets really heavy because it\u2019s got all this stuff in it but it\u2019s only a small backpack. Well when this happens, the gravity is so strong that it starts to pull at anything else that\u2019s nearby. Other planets, moons, spaceships and even light itself. It pulls so hard the even light can\u2019t get away and that\u2019s why we call it a black hole\u201d At that point if the kid is still asking questions, I\u2019d open up a savings account NOW because MIT doesn\u2019t come cheap !!

            "answer_text": "Say, something like this: If lots of children wore bubble-suits with magnets on themThe magnets are bigger, if your bubble is biggerThen, you all get flung around till bonds start to happenEventually some bubble-suit piles start to formSo, in the piles: Little kids would get squeezed out really fast to the topBigger kids get sucked into the center; really fastThings aren\u2019t always perfect: Some kids end up trapped between big kidsSome big kids are trapped just outside the big-kid pileNow if we had of chucked you all out of a rocket ship: Stuck together like thatVery few little kids would ever stop being attracted to the pileThey\u2019d just roll around as a layer of little wispy kids that hardly attract anythingThey never (mostly never) get away from the pileThe Earth is a lot like that pile of kids: If you drop a big kid from the (little kid) outer rim then she\u2019ll smash through little kids till something big stops herYou could be stopped by a big pile of medium sized kids with some big kids trapped here and there among themAnd if you get crazy enough in the big kid pile: You might suddenly fling yourself away to the little kid area.That\u2019s what happens when a hot air balloon goes up. The rest is for your imagination to correlate \u2026 ",
