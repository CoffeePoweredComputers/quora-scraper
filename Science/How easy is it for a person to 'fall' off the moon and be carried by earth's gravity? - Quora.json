A: The \u201cfalling\u201d would have to increase the astronaut\u2019s speed by 3.1 km/s or so. So you probably need a rocket for it. Make it two, just for good measures: one to get to lunar orbit \u2013 let\u2019s call that an Ascent Stage \u2013 and one to get out of the Moon\u2019s sphere of influence. Of course you would need to stop at the other end, but don\u2019t worry: you can use a big rocket for that too; or let the atmosphere brake you using a heat shield and a parachute; or you can do what is sometimes called \u201clithobraking\u201d \u2013 the technical term for \u201chitting the ground hard\u201d.
