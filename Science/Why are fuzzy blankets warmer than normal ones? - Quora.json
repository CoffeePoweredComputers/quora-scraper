            "answer_text": "Fuzzy blankets have fibers that create a lot of space in between them. These spaces trap warm air, keeping you warmer. Fuzzy blankets are made from fabrics such as wool, cotton, and fleece. That's why blankets, such as wool blankets, cotton fleece blankets, and cashmere blankets are the warmest.

            "answer_text": "Blankets are warmer when they transfer less heat from the inside to the outside, feathers, fluffy stuff, fuzzy blankets etc. contain much air (and relatively little other material per given volume) and air is a relative bad heat conductor. This means the fluffier and fuzzier a material is the less heat is conducted through it and the warmer it feels. ",
