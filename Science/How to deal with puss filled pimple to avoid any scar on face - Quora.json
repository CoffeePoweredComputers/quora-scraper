UNBLEMISH Regimen combines cosmetic and active over-the-counter ingredients to penetrate pores and eliminate most acne blemishes. There is 4 steps during the day and 3 at night- unless you add a moisturizer which I would suggest one called Active Hydration from same company. UNBLEMISH ACNE TREATMENT SULFUR WASH Wet skin with lukewarm water. Using your fingertips, gently and evenly massage a quarter-sized amount onto your entire face for 30-60 seconds, avoiding areas around the eyes. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Use once daily and increase to twice daily as tolerated. UNBLEMISH CLARIFYING TONER Apply toner evenly to entire face using a fresh ESSENTIALS Gauze Pad, avoiding the eye area. Do not rinse off. Allow toner to dry. Use once daily and increase to twice daily as tolerated. UNBLEMISH DUAL INTENSIVE ACNE TREATMENT Cleanse skin thoroughly before applying UNBLEMISH Dual Intensive Acne Treatment. Dispense 1-2 pumps from each chamber, blend and apply evenly over the entire face, avoiding the eye area. Do not rinse off. Because excessive drying of the skin may occur, start with one application daily. Gradually increase to twice daily as needed or as directed by a doctor. If dryness or peeling occurs, reduce application to once a day or every other day and apply a moisturizer. If irritation or sensitivity develops, stop use completely and consult your doctor. UNBLEMISH OIL CONTROL LOTION BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 20 SUNSCREEN Apply a generous dime-sized amount evenly over your entire face every morning, avoiding the eye area.

            "answer_text": "Well pimples with pus are the cystic acne. And the reason for them to appear differs from time to time and from person to person. Some may have hormonal imbalances that cause acne to appear on face, some may have hypersensitive skin due to which acne appears. For a long term treatment you should rule out your cause of appearance of acne. But for some cosmetic superficial treatment one can try TEA TREE OIL. It is natural oil without any pharmacological ingredients. Mark that should be pure tea tree oil. It might cause your nose some irritation at first but applying it regularly for a week or so as spot treatment, it can give you remarkable result. You can even mix it with your moisturiser or aloe Vera gel and apply on full face. ",
