            "answer_text": "What you want all solvents to have equivalent properties? Can you name any other class of chemicals in which all representatives of that class had the same properties? This is a strange question. If you are asking how the speed can differ, you are asking a very complicated question. The speed of dissolution is quite a different topic from the extent of dissolution (how much). You also do not specify what is being dissolved in what. In the case of miscible liquids, e.g. ethanol and water, any amount of water will dissolve in any amount of ethanol. (Which you call solute and which solvent is up to you.) In this case the speed of dissolution is controlled solely by how quickly you can mix them. In other cases, there are myriad variables that affect the rate of dissolution (temperature, contact area, etc.) ",
