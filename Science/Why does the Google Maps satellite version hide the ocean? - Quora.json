            "answer_text": "You can always use Google Earth if you want to see the surface of the ocean or the 3D modelling of the sea floor. But since Google has to buy their satellite imagery from those with the satellites, it would be wasteful to spend money on areas that have no land, only featureless surface of the ocean. Which, I\u2019m sure you know, is most of the planet. Including the ocean surface would triple the costs of buying the imagery for Google. ",

This is of course because a few satellite pictures are much cheaper that planes which only photograph small areas at a time. ",
