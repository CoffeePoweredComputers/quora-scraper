            "answer_text": "Consciousness is not a process in the brain but a kind of behavior that, of course, is controlled by the brain like any other behavior. Human consciousness emerges on the interface between three components of animal behavior: communication, play, and the use of tools. These three components interact on the basis of anticipatory behavioral control, which is common for all complex forms of animal life. All three do not exclusively distinguish our close relatives, i.e., primates, but are broadly presented among various species of mammals, birds, and even cephalopods; however, their particular combination in humans is unique. The interaction between communication and play yields symbolic games, most importantly language; the interaction between symbols and tools results in human praxis. Taken together, this gives rise to a mechanism that allows a creature, instead of performing controlling actions overtly, to play forward the corresponding behavioral options in a \u201csecond reality\u201d of objectively (by means of tools) grounded symbolic systems. The theory possesses the following properties: (1) It is anti-reductionist and anti-eliminativist, and yet, human consciousness is considered as a purely natural (biological) phenomenon. (2) It avoids epiphenomenalism and indicates in which conditions human consciousness has evolutionary advantages, and in which it may even be disadvantageous. (3) It allows to easily explain the most typical features of consciousness, such as objectivity, seriality and limited resources, the relationship between consciousness and explicit memory, the feeling of conscious agency, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Reflections on consciousness From the merger of a microscopic sperm and egg in the darkness of the fallopian tube arises an entity that gradually acquires self-awareness and an identity all its own. This embodied consciousness reflects and rejoices, creates and communicates, and engages in countless activities for a brief time-span. Then, after a final breath, its non-physical attributes vanish from the tangible world. No thinking mind can remain unimpressed by this remarkable phenomenon. If anything is a mystery, human consciousness is. Each one of us carries a totality that is more than the sum of our body's material substrate. Not so long ago, many of the atoms and molecules that make up our anatomy at this hour were not part of us. Millions of microorganisms thrive and perish in our saliva and alimentary canal. With all that, there is a subtle self that has been illumining every one of us, something that etches the identity of a separate existence within a hugely interconnected whole. This self has been with us since the first utterance of I and me, and it will be part of us until the dusk and dimness of life when, gradually or suddenly, our individual memories will falter and fade away for good. We cannot deny the biochemical basis in the persistence of personhood. Some day, silicon configurations in plastic casings may acquire feelings and emotions, mimicking the heaves and exhilarations of the human heart. Computers create music today; they may be enjoying it tomorrow, and may be reflecting on life and death the day after. But this is not sufficient proof that there is or is not anything beyond matter and energy in space and time. This metaphysical G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem is at the root of much controversy. From the perspective of science, nature appears to be essentially a tangible manifestation of matter and energy. However, the laws of nature, which organize and sustain it, cannot be located here or there or anywhere. They pervade the span of spread-out space and ceaseless time. One perspective could be that consciousness is implicit in these laws, an intangible principle that breathes order in the universe, and life into inert matter. The Copernican revolution displaced our earth from the center of the universe. Science has been enormously successful in exploring the entire physical stretch of the universe from the far-from-visible microcosm to faint and farthermost specks in the vast expanse. But we will be missing the point if we don't see the role of consciousness in the unfolding of cosmic history. Science has displaced our habitat from center stage, but not dethroned human consciousness from the center of the perceived world. Like invisible air and earth-binding gravity, we take consciousness for granted because it is with us all the time. And science may be right in regarding consciousness as just another among the countless marvelous occurrences in the endless time since the first creative bang. And yet, consciousness deserves more than passing mention in any serious commentary on the universe, for it is consciousness that has lit up the universe with beauty and color, and infused it with meaning and understanding. Just as the eruption of mute matter was the result of what we call the Big Bang, the emergence of consciousness may well be described as the Second Big Bang. Indeed music and mathematics, elliptic orbits and inverse-square laws, mind and measurement were all latent features of the universe until the flicker of consciousness was lit in physical bodies. Could it be that, as some Indic thinkers averred, there is a Cosmic Consciousness which enters into human bodies even as the water of the vast ocean seeps into pots and puddles, cups and carafes? Four centuries of modern science have thrown much light on the physical basis of this uncommon wonder, which may have parallels in other pockets in a universe studded with billions of stars and planetary systems. Some day we may explain consciousness in terms of neurons, microtubules, or other matter-based principles. At least, this is the hope of a great many serious scientists. But, as of now, consciousness continues to be a fantastic anomaly in what seems to be a mindless morass of mass-energy cluttering the cosmos. Until the second half of the twentieth century, science did not inquire into consciousness. The capacity for awareness and experience, for logical analysis and joyful interaction is an intangible component in the fleeting persistence of Homo sapiens. This is the essence of what we call the human spirit. Just as there is more to a flower than soil and tree-branch, so as some perceptive Hindu thinkers affirmed, the spirit may be more than its neural network, heartbeat and vital breath, though these are what create and sustain it. If there is splendor in the perceived world and pattern in its functioning, and if it can all result in the grand experiences of life and thought, then even prior to the advent of humans, there must have been an experiencing principle of a vastly superior order. This Cosmic Experiencer spans the full range in space and time. We are miniature lights, one and all. We have emanated from that primordial splendor, like photons from a galactic core, destined for the terrestrial experience for a brief span on the eternal time line, only to finally re-merge with that from which we sprang. Is this poetic imagery, scientific hypothesis, or perhaps the ultimate Truth? One may not know for certain. If it be poetry, let us remember that poetry and prayer are for the human spirit what the telescope and the microscope are for human eyes. Lenses enable us to discern entities beyond our normal cognition, and profound poetry is a response of the spirit to that which is not fathomed through logic and reason. Poetry brings home to us, indeed it forces us to reckon, the world of experience not in terms of sense data and charts and proofs, but in subtle and holistic ways. It reveals meaning and majesty in the universe, which lie in a realm beyond the plane of rigid rationality. Poetry is mystic experience verbalized. This spiritual vision paints individual consciousness on a cosmic canvas. It recognizes the transience of all of us as separate entities, yet incorporates us into the infinity that encompasses all. It does not rule out the possibility of other manifestations, sublime and subtle, carbon or silicon-based, elsewhere amidst the stellar billions. It recognizes the role of matter, and the limits of the mind, but sees subtle spirit at the core of it all. It does not speak of rewards and punishments in anthropocentric terms, nor of a He-God communicating in local languages. Yet, it regards the religious expressions of humanity as echoes of the Universal Spirit, even as volcanic outbursts reveal submerged forces of far greater magnitude. Ignoring for a moment the tenets of mechanistic-materialist science, and reflecting in the realm of poetic-spiritual visions, it is fair to say that there is something sublime in regarding every conscious being as a spark from a cosmic Whole. It is an elevating thought to be told that we are part of that from which the universe sprang, and in that grand recognition, every fellow human becomes yet another spark from the same source. When such a worldview is internalized, what an outpouring of caring and compassion, love and respect would exude towards others! It is no less interesting in this context to reflect upon the conclusion of the physical sciences that say we are ultimately made up of carbon atoms and the atoms of other heavier elements synthesized in the core of supernovas. This discovery prompted Carl Sagan to pronounce, both poetically and literally, that we are made of star-dust. But even more precisely, all the matter making our bodies emerged from the primordial Big Bang of which cosmologists speak. This, no doubt, is our physical make-up. But aside from the material component of the universe, there is also a spiritual substratum that emerged, through modes we are unable to fully fathom, from that same pristine creative principle. I should point out that what I have written are perspectives that are meaningful, and not incontrovertibly established or experimentally authenticated facts in the framework of science. They describe rather than explain, meditate on rather than measure any aspect of perceived reality.
