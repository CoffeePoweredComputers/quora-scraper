            "answer_text": "A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. A very short distance that we can't physically see but we can measure with instruments. What do we measure in nanometers (nm)? Wavelengths of light in 100s of nm. Transistor dimensions in microprocessors in tens of nm. Viruses a few nm. ",
