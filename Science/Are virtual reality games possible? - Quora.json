            "answer_text": "There is not a device that hijacks your brain directly feeding in data that makes you truly feel in all aspects of your humanity like your are somewhere else with full body control-like in SAO. But it doesn't matter. The combination of a headset like Oculus Rift or Vive with motion controllers like Oculus Touch or the Vive wands already feels like SAO. And there are lots of games to play now with motion controllers if you have a Vive, and an insane amount of games coming soon. Check out the newly released Raw Data for an example of how awesome VR games already exist. ",
