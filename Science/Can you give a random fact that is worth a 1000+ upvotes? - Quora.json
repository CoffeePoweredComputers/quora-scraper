Medals were awarded for artistic competitions during the first four decades of the modern games. One hundred and fifty-one of these medals were awarded between 1912 and 1952. Today, hardly anyone remembers that fact. There was one catch, each artistic entry had to in some way be inspired by and embody the spirit of sport. ",
