            "answer_text": "Just wanted to add a few additional answer given by Mr. Luster <Jonas, if you have never read the book called \"On Food and Cooking: the Science and Lore of the Kitchen\" you need to find yourself a copy, you will love it.  I first saw it advertised in the book reviews of some Chemical Society bulletin, it is a virtual treatise on the chemical reactions that take place in the kitchen.> Okay now that the two science-food geeks have had their man crush moment.... What I wanted to add is there IS a reason recipe directions tell you to \"Pat the Meat dry\"  or \"dredge the meat in flour, cornstarch, rice flour\" or what have you before you place it in the pan of hot oil or deep fryer. It it not so it doesn't splatter.   Since the oil is the cooking medium, any moisture on the surface of the meat will instantly vaporize into steam.  It will be trapped around the meat.  In a pan, the steam can form pockets beneath the item to be cooked and instead of \"frying\" and browing, the item gets steamed.   In deep frying it isn't as critical but still important.  You want the object to brown, that is what frying is all about, the more moist the foodstuff is the longer you have to fry it in order to drive off the surface moisture in order for the browning, or Maillard reaction to take place. The flour is a short cut to drying the meat or other foodstuff.  The Maillard reaction or browning is reduction of sugars and amino acids on the surface creating the intensely flavored \"browning\". Also recipes also tell you not to overcrowd the items placed in the pan for the same reason.  Meats and vegetables give off lots of moisture when cooking.  If items are too crowded, excess water collects in the pan and you do not end up with a browning reaction, but something more like stewing. A dead giveaway is if your \"fried\" meat is gray and not brown and sizzling. Here is a revelation for some cooks.  Try browning mushrooms.  Slice and place mushrooms slices in a hot oiled pan.  Actually brown each side, its time consuming, but the difference in taste will amaze you.  The intensity of the mushroom flavor is trebled. That explains why some dishes call for browning some items before adding in all the ingredients.  Beef stew is one example.  It calls for browning the meat first to intensify the flavor.  You will taste the difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, when we cook single thing the only way you will get it crispy is to remove all of its moisture as in H20 (water) .. bread in your toaster will only brown as the moisture leaves the bread and the surface gets \"burned\". Dry bread left a few days to go slightly stale will toast quicker than fresh bread! Oil heated enough will remove the moisture from whatever is cooked in it  example, if you fry an egg it will cook and gel under \"normal\" heat but if you leave it longer and under a higher temperature it will eventually, dry out, get crispy on the bottom and if left long enough get hard, dry out fully and eventually carbonise. Oil has a high flash point and therefore is a great medium for frying with. It also lubricates as it fries and in deep frying it cooks quicker as the product is fully emerged  in high temperatures. It is important to remember, product cooks from the outside towards the middle, so a chunky chicken leg will take a lot longer to cook than a large flat and thin  escalope. When cooking fries you are trying to eliminate the moisture in the potato and cook the inside thus drying it out and \"burning\" or crisping the outside. Oil is perfect for this, you can see the steam from the fries as they cook! The oil temperature here is way above that of the condensating water vapour and so dries it out. When the steam has left the pan or is subsiding, placing a lid on it during the last 2 or 3 mins of cooking will contain more heat in it and produce a quicker crispier product. Do not stir too much, as stirring anything in a pot or pan reduced its contained heat. Placing a lid on a pan or pot increases the heat and energy within it, so much energy in the form of gas or electric can be saved by a simple lid.!!  Heat is transferred in three basic ways listed below: Conduction is heat transfer through direct contact. When cooking on the stovetop, the heat from the flame or electric grill is applied directly to the frying pan. This means that only the flat surface of the pan is sufficiently hot enough to cook anything and we must flip and toss around the food to cook it properly. It is important to note that most pans are made of metals, like copper, that conduct heat very efficiently and do not melt on the stovetop. Convection is heat transfer through a fluid. The fluid can be liquid or gas and in the case of a convection oven, the fluid we care about is air. An oven is a confined area that gets hot by flames or electric coils. The air inside is warmed to a desired temperature and, as a result, cooks the food from all directions. This method of heat transfer is responsible for pizzas, cakes, and other baked treats! Keep in mind that ovens heat foods from the outside. The inside slowly heats up with time, and it is not uncommon to see food where the outside looks done, but the inside is uncooked. This is very important when preparing a Thanksgiving turkey, and there are special thermometers that measure the temperature of the food in the center of the turkey to show that it is properly cooked. (editor\u2019s note: All ovens cook by convection \u2013 where the hot interior air does the cooking. What appliance manufacturers call \u201cconvection ovens\u201d have an additional heating element and an extra fan to make the air circulation more efficient and effective, boosting the heat transfer from the air to the food, and thus altering the way the food cooks -faster, dryer etc..) Radiation is the transfer of heat using electromagnetic radiation. A microwave oven uses very strong radio waves (a form of electromagnetic radiation), which are very weak and not hot. So how does it work? Microwave ovens work by spinning water, fats, sugars and oils inside the food. This causes friction, which then heats the food and cooks it from the inside. Please do not be confused by the word radiation or electromagnetic radiation. In science, these terms are very general and mean a lot of things. Radiation comes from many sources, some are beneficial and others are harmful. For example, solar radiation from the Sun is responsible for heating the Earth and the light we see is a form of electromagnetic radiation. As you know, heat is very important in the cooking process. Now you have the basic knowledge of heat transfer. ",
