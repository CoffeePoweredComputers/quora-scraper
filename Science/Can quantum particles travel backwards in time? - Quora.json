To larger dynamics I think it is extremely likely or at least as likely as the math suggesting antimatter was possible only to be confirmed decades later in experiments. Transactional interpretation - Wikipedia As much as I respect Professor Brewer, I think we have to trust the math regardless of how counter intuitive it is, and sometimes wait for technology\u2019s ability to do the experiment to confirm the math, not the other way around. I remember asking the now Dean of Physics, why if for every force there was an equal and opposite force, why don't sniper rifles in the 50 caliber variant blow off the shooters shoulder, to which he replied do the math! I had naively confused the conservation of momentum with the conservation of energy with the asymmetrical transfer of energy permitted within the first law, sorry third law for the details/spelling Nasiz. if for motion its E>4=\u2026a whole of weird things become possible, and the world is certainly weird enough that it seems to need dark matter and dark energy The energy and momentum eigenvalues of F1 are \u00afhw and \u00afhk, while the eigenvalues of G1 are \udbc0\udc00\u00afhw and \udbc0\udc00\u00afhk. Therefore, the emission of the composite wave function F1+G1 involves no change in energy or momentum, i.e., no energy or momentum cost. This is to be expected, since the emission process is time-symmetric, and time-symmetric fields should not produce any time-asymmetric loss of energy or momentum the above from : Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics Chapter in Review of Modern Physics \u00b7 July 2009 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-70626-7_223 CITATIONS 159 ",

            "answer_text": "In Feynman diagrams, the antiparticles (like positrons) are shown as propagating backward in time. This is a graphical convenience expressing the fact that the integral equations that Feynman diagrams mathematically represent antiparticles as time-reversed. I have spent my professional career working with antiparticles (positive muons), and I can assure you that they do not \u201ctravel backwards in time\u201d in the laboratory! ",

The catch is that they will be of all time, forward and backwards. This explains how decoherence can appear to enact preemptively in the delayed choice quantum eraser. ",
