Their total momentum after colliding will be the same as their total momentum before colliding. The other responders tell you how to calculate the momentums. But I think your issue was you didn\u2019t think two objects moving in opposite directions could collide. ",

            "answer_text": "The best is to consider a collision in the center mass system in which total momentum (by definition) is equal to zero. Then also the total momentum after the collisions will be null but directions and values of momenta can be different, depending on the details of the collision. How to go from one to another reference system is described for example here: http://denali.phys.uniroma1.it/~puglisi/thesis/node15.html ",
