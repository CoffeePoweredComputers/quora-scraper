            "answer_text": "When we talk of the direction , we take the reference\u2026without reference, talking of direction is irrelevant. When we speak about the rotation of the Earth, we say, it is tilted 23.5 degrees from perpendicular axis of the elliptical path between Earth and the Sun. Now, the question comes..23.5 degrees at what reference\u2026the answer is referencing to the elliptical path which the Earth covers in one year around the sun. The Earth\u2019s rotation axis makes an angle of 66.5 degrees with the plane of its orbit around the Sun or about 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular to the elliptical plane. So, the Sun has been taken as the focal and reference point and the Earth has been taken as the moving body around it. It is bent in that reference only. But if you see the rotation of the Earth from a reference point lying on the locus of the axis of the Earth, you will find no inclination. If you forget the Sun and see the Earth independently in the Universe, it has no tilt. Therefore 23.5 degree inclination is with reference to the Sun and the Earth\u2019s rotational disc and not from the reference from any other point in the space. We belong to Earth and our life sustains on our Solar system. So, we have taken our Sun as the reference and inferred that Earth is inclined. Other planets also have inclinations at various angles. Let us understand the phenomenon of rotation and inclination from a simple example. If you take a highly spinning stone which breaks in various pieces of different sizes but a big portion of it still keeps on rotating and doesn\u2019t fly off., The disintegrated pieces will fly off and keep on rotating as broken pieces. The direction of each broken piece will be different with respect to the remaining big portion as they are disintegrated from original body in all direction like blast pieces. Same thing happened with the solar system. There was a huge rotating mass (condensed gases) which disintegrated in all directions forming planets and the big portion was left as the Sun. The Earth may have disintegrated at 23.5 degrees from its perpendicular path or 66.5 degrees from its horizontal path and so it is inclined at that angle. We must thank this angular disintegration because without our 23.5\u00b0 we wouldn't have seasons or longer nights and shorter days throughout the years. The angle of obliquity also is a major driving factor for weather triggering massive releases of energy during times of tropical revolving storms (hurricanes) which effect the planet's heating and cooling cycle world wide. The world that we have adapted to would be a very different place without our tilt. In general less tilt would mean colder poles and hotter equator and more tilt would have more extreme seasons of hot and cold. In either case the shift in growing seasons and belts would probably cause massive shift in food production, most likely in a bad way ... assuming the plants could survive the change too. Thanks to the GOD who made a tilted earth to sustain a life, otherwise we won\u2019t have been talking to each other on Quora\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "The Earth has a 23.5 Degree axial tilt.  While we are not 100% certain, the consensus is that it has to do with Earth\u2019s formation along with the rest of the planets in the Solar system. We know that the birth of the Sun created a new source of gravity in the young Solar System. The tidal forces between the young sun and the rest of the nebula the Sun was born from created further instability in the gases and dust left in the nebula. This allowed for the steady formation of the planets. After millions of years passed enough matter collided to gain mass and its own gravity and become small versions of planets called planetessimals and protoplanets. These pre-planets collided to create even larger planets. This set the stage for how the Earth approached its final form. It looks like it probably collided with a another proto-planet and in the process it was tilted. Ref - This answer was based on information here Why is the Earth Tilted? - Universe Today ",
