            "answer_text": "You can use the same procedure that you would use for Earth. Unless you wanna be extremely precise, Newton\u00b4s law of universal gravitaiton would suffice. [math]F=GMm/(r^2) [/math] M being Mercury\u00b4s mass, r Mercury\u00b4s radius and G Newton\u00b4s universal gravitation constant. Then, you take the definition of gravitational field, which is the force that would suffer a 1kg mass under the influence of Mercury: [math]g=F/m  [/math] It is easy to see that this would be the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury, since, by using Newton\u00b4s second law: [math]F=ma=mg[/math] and symplifying [math]a=g [/math] (Since the direction of the vectors I used are constant, I considered them as scalars) If you do the calculations, you would get that it is 3.7 [math]m^2/s[/math] on its surface.

            "answer_text": "To calculate that we need an equation for acceleration which is a=F/m a is acceleration in m/s^2, F is force in newtons and m is the mass in kilogram. If we already know the mass of the object then the only information left we need is the force of gravity between the object and Mercury. The equation for the gravitation attraction force between 2 objects is F=(G*m1*m2)/r^2 F is force in newtons, G is the gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of the first object in kilogram, m2 is the mass of the second object in kilogram, r is the distance between the Center of mass of the two objects in meter.
