            "answer_text": "Olivia has covered it pretty well but I\u2019d just like to add that a formula which expresses the simplest, positive integer ratio of the elements in a compound is called the empirical formula. So, technically the empirical formula of H2O2 is indeed HO. However the empirical formula of a compound gives virtually no information about its actual atomic composition or molecular structure. In fact, it is very common for different compounds to have the same empirical formula. For example acetic acid (CH3COOH), glucose (C6H12O6, and formaldehyde (CH2O) all have the empirical formula, CH2O\u2026. sulphur monoxide (SO) and disulphur dioxide (S2O2) both have the empirical formula SO. Because of this, empirical formulae have only limited value in most areas of chemistry. Empirical formulae are really only useful when dealing with substances which are composed entirely of repeating atomic arrangements in a network structure\u2026 for example; ionic crystalline lattices such as NaCl and K2O, covalent networks such as SiO2 and C and certain organic polymers. In these instances the empirical formula is called a formula unit and is used in stoichiometric and crystallographic calculations\u2026 particularly in mineralogy which deals almost exclusively with ionic and covalent network solids.

            "answer_text": "Because of bonds. This is H2O2.  There is a single bond between H and O and between O and O. We can write it this way: H-O-O-H. The -O-O- bonding is the peroxide structure found in other compounds. (When you see acetic acid written as CH3COOH this is not a peroxide bond because the first O is double bonded to the C, which then has a single bond to -OH on one side and a single bond to the CH3 on the other side.) H makes single bonds, O requires two. Thus we get H2O H-O-H HO is either an ion HO- or a radical HO\u2219 where the dot \u2219 represents an unpaired electron, thus seeking a bond. Such radicals react extremely rapidly to get that electron paired to make a bond. The ion and the radical are very different from a chemical substance which is a liquid. ",
