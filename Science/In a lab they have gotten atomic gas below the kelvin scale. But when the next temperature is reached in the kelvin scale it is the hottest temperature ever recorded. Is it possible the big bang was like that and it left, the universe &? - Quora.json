            "answer_text": "Below the Kelvin scale? No. Negative temperature. Yes. There is a difference. Our everyday experience of temperature is one where things are relatively close to thermal equilibrium. In that scenario there is a certain distribution of energy levels called the Boltzmann distribution which essentially describes the temperature as a function of the distribution of energy levels. At thermal equilibrium the population of energy levels will drop steadily the higher in energy you look. In certain spectroscopic experiments, it is possible to make the population of the energy levels inverted, with higher energy levels having higher populations. This is a high energy system but according to. Boltzmann\u2019s statistics, the temperature is negative. We call this the spectroscopic temperature. So a system with a negative spectroscopic temperature is actually a very hot system. ",
