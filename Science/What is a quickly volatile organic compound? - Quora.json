            "answer_text": "Your question is somewhat ambiguous. The answer depends upon what you meant by the question. If you mean what is an organic compound that is a liquid at room temperature but which boils quickly, diethylether which boils at 35C and pentane good examples which boils at 36. Both evaporate quickly. If you meant to include compounds that are only liquid at room temperature when pressurized, good examples are butane which boils at 0C and methyl chloride which boils at -24C. Both of these will boil very quickly if they are at ambient pressure. ",
