            "answer_text": "General Relativity is the worst description of Gravity ever. Newton came closest but he was not that close really.Gravity is about Force, It is not about Energy and it definitely not about the bending of Space Time or even Time Dilation.Gravity is produced due to the Relative Angular Velocities of Particles with Mass, and as such has not just magnitude but also direction. Putting everything into Energy Soup the way Einstein did, is not just mathematically incorrect but it denies the very nature of the phenomenon. Moreover, he simply plagiarised Newton's errors. Newton's Gravitational constant contains an acceleration which was never isolated. It turns up again in GR. Newton never understood that his Gravity was really just a Dipole potential, so the Inverse Square Law is only valid at Macro Scale. Gravity in its pure form works off tangential velocity divided by separation but is better described simply by: Force = Relative Angular Velocity. However, Angular Velocity is a vector, so opposite vectors subtract from one another, and this produces and inverse square law. The best analogy is the Electric Dipole Potential. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity is the property associated with mass . It is the tendency of bodies to attract other bodies with the help of a force called gravitational force. When this force is applied by huge objects like planets ,stars etc it is termed as gravity. We come to know about gravity with the help of sir ISAAC NEWTON. He was the one who explained to the world the concept of gravity. We are not flying and touching the ground unless some external force is applied. This means that some force is acting on our body. This force is called gravity. ",
