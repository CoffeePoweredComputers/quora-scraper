            "answer_text": "Well, in the simplest terms that I can understand, which means you have to dumb down to my level, Sunshine, is that; \u2018Water is made of two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom. This seems like pretty basic chemistry, so why don\u2019t we just smash them together and solve the world\u00ad\u2019s water ills? Theoretically, this is possible, but it would be an extrem\u00adely dangerous process, too. To create water, oxygen and hydrogen atoms must be present. Mixing them together doesn\u2019t help; you\u2019re still left with just separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The orbits of each atom\u2019s electrons must become linked, and to do that we must have a sudden burst of energy to get these shy things to hook up. Since hydrogen is extremely flammable and oxygen supports combustion, it wouldn\u2019t take much to create this force. Pretty much all we need is a spark \u2013 not even a flame \u2013 and boom! we have water. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms\u2019 electrons\u2019 orbits have been conjoined. But we also have an explosion and \u2013 if our experiment was big enough, a deadly one. The ill-fated blimp, the Hindenburg, was filled with hydrogen to keep it afloat. As it approached New Jersey on May 6, 1937, to land after a trans-Atlantic voyage, static electricity (or an act of sabotage, according to some) caused the hydrogen to spark. When mixed with the ambient oxygen in the air, the hydrogen exploded, enveloping the Hindenburg in a ball of fire that completely destroyed the ship within half a minute. There was, however, also a lot of water created by this explosion.\u2019 This example, I think, would be enough to give anyone pause about trying to get oxygen and hydrogen to do the nasty to produce water. But fear not, fellow homo sapien, there are some wonder workers out there that have come up with some interesting and feasible ideas on how to create water \u2013 more about that next wee. For now, and in the foreseeable future, should you require drinking water that doesn\u2019t go boom when you drink it, have a look at our rather nifty range of water coolers; water boilers; water fountains \u2026 (the list goes on). You\u2019re welcome to drop us an e-mail and we\u2019ll be happy to take you through the best water cooler for your requirements. Rather unfortunately, our water coolers are not cut out for scientific water experiments. Just in case you were wondering ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they are present in air but it can't be happened like this\u2026. U know how water is formed? When molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) are combined and allowed to react together, energy is released and the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen can combine to form either water or hydrogen peroxide. These two processes are represented by the two chemical equations shown at right. Chemists use redox half-reactions to describe thermodynamic processes like the ones embodied by such equations. For both of the reactions shown, the hydrogen molecules are oxidized and the oxygen atoms are reduced. Accordingly, each of the reactions below is described by a combination of two half-reactions--one corresponding to a chemical oxidation and another corresponding to a reduction. The redox half-reaction for hydrogen oxidation is relatively simple and is shown on the left side of the scheme below. In this oxidation, a molecule of hydrogen gas is ionized to two electrons and two protons. Writing a half-reaction for oxygen reduction is more complicated, since oxygen can be reduced by either one, two or four electrons, as shown by the square redox scheme to the right, below. In most chemical reactions, molecular oxygen is reduced along the red and blue pathways highlighted in this redox scheme. The complete reduction of O 2 by four electrons (4e - + 4H + , blue horizontal pathway) generates two equivalents of water whereas the corresponding two-electron reduction (2e - + 2H + , red diagonal pathway) yields hydrogen peroxide. Both the two- (G = -0.695 V) and four-electron (G = -1.229 V) reductions of O 2 are energetically downhill, but more than half a volt of energy is squandered in the former reaction. Accordingly, biological processes coupled to O 2 reduction, such as cellular respiration, are highly selective for the complete 4e - + 4H + pathway in order to maximize the energy available for ATP synthesis. The selective reduction of oxygen to water in such biological systems is crucial, not only in order to maximize the energy produced for cellular metabolism but also because hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidant and cytotoxin, which harms living cells. Understood how water is formed so it can't be done like this as u say At last i would say Water is a compound do not considered it as a mixture it can't be just physically mixed and formed rather it is a compound it has to be chemically reacted,then it will be form.
