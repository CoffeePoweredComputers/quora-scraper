            "answer_text": "This question is tricky to answer, because in many cases, electricity doesn't pass directly between neurons at all - instead, it usually helps provoke the release of neurotransmitters, the chemicals that enable neurons to communicate with each other.  Let's break all this craziness down. First, we've got to talk about how neurons maintain and change their electrical charges. Neurons, like all cells in the body, are electrically polarized - in other words, there's a difference in voltage between the inside of the cell and its exterior environment. The resting membrane potential (i.e., the default voltage) for most neurons is around -70 mV. As long as the neuron isn't \"firing,\" it maintains this resting potential by moving ions (positively or negatively charged atoms) in and out of itself.  This movement of ions helps each neuron create its own electrochemical gradient - a difference in the concentration of certain ions, and therefore in voltage, between its interior and exterior. An electrochemical gradient is one way a neuron can store potential energy, and this energy - as you'll soon see - can be unleashed to rapidly \"spike\" the cell's voltage when it \"fires.\" At the most basic level, an electrochemical gradient allows energy to be released because (Important Physics Fact Alert) ions naturally flow \"downhill\" - that is, from more positive charges toward more negative ones. We'll see how this allows a neuron to \"fire\" in just a minute. But first, an explanation of the mechanisms a neuron uses to move ions around is central to an understanding of how neurons change their electrical charges (and these mechanisms are also really cool). Ion channels are the simplest of these mechanisms - they're basically just pores that are sized and shaped exactly right for only one type of ion to pass through them. For a neuron, the most important ions in the world are potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chlorine (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+), and each ion channel accepts only one of these ion species. Here, for example, is one that accepts K+ ions.   Some ion channels, like the one above, are passive, which means they just let their special type of ion pass right on through - but others, called ion pumps, are sort of like powered double doors that open inward or outward only, pumping a certain type of ion into or out of the cell. What powers these pumps, you ask? In most cases, adenosine triphosphate, better known as ATP - whose role in cellular metabolism deserves a whole write-up of its own. Anyway, it's easy to see how these one-directional ion pumps can help a cell bring its internal voltage up or down. Here are some cool animations of sodium and potassium pumps at work: http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072495855/student_view0/chapter2/animation__how_the_sodium_potassium_pump_works.html Now that we've got these basic ideas in place, let's look at a very simplified example: a neuron whose cell membrane is permeable only to potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ions. Most of the time, this neuron has some K+ ions floating around inside it, but it keeps its membrane potential on the negative side by pumping a lot of them out. But when our neuron responds to some chemical or physical trigger - such as receiving a neurotransmitter or being physically touched - some of its Na+ channels open, allowing positively charged Na+ ions to flow into the cell. This Na+ invasion depolarizes the cell membrane - in other words, the interior of the cell becomes less negatively charged as the cell fills up with more and more positively charged Na+ ions. If this depolarization continues past a certain threshold, an action potential is eventually triggered - this means lots of other ion channels (in this case, Na+ channels) suddenly pop open, allowing the neuron to flood with positively charged Na+ ions, which drives its membrane potential way up to a peak.  In this diagram of an action potential, you can see the membrane potential spike that peaks at +40 mV (as you can see, this neuron's resting potential was a little higher than the usual -70 mV). This is what people mean when they talk about a neuron \"firing.\"   But as you can tell from the diagram, the membrane potential doesn't just keep on rising forever - after it hits a peak, it abruptly dips back down. This is because some ion channels are voltage-gated - in other words, they open or close in response to the membrane potential reaching a specific voltage.    In this case, more and more of the neuron's Na+ channels slammed shut as its voltage rose, preventing more Na+ from flowing into the cell - and more and more of its K+ channels popped open, allowing K+ ions to flow from the positively charged interior of the cell to its negatively charged exterior (remember our Important Physics Fact from above?). Then the membrane potential gradually levels off as the open K+ channels allow the neuron to restore its voltage norm. Here's a page with a much more detailed explanation of this example: http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/ap.html Keep in mind (I can't stress this enough) that this is a super-simplified example - in reality, neuron membranes incorporate several types of ion pumps and channels, which can be gated by all sorts of triggers besides just voltage; and their firing patterns are much more complex. But this still gives you a pretty clear idea of what it means for a neuron to \"fire.\" If you're interested in learning more about ion channels and electrical conductance, here's a page with a ton of info on the whole process: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21668/ Now it's time to talk about neurotransmitters, and what all this weird voltage stuff has to do with the ways neurons actually transmit information. So, here's your average neuron:   When this neuron \"fires,\" it passes a change in voltage down its axon (that long skinny \"tail\" insulated by myelin sheaths) and into its axon terminals. It's in these terminals that the action really heats up, so let's take a closer look at one. Enhance!   As you can see, most neurons don't actually touch each other at all - though they do come tantalizingly close.  Now, I should point out that in some special cases, called gap junctions, the neurons' axons are actually connected by clusters of proteins called connexins, which allow all four of the important ion species - and thus, electrical current - to flow directly from one cell to the next. Gap junctions allow ions to flow in both directions, so cells connected by them are said to be electrically coupled. But gap junctions are the exception, not the rule - especially in vertebrate nervous systems. The synapse pictured above is obviously not a gap junction - instead, it's what's known as a chemical synapse. At last, it's time to take a close look at how these work. What we're interested in here are the synaptic vesicles - pay no attention to the mitochondria (OK, if you must know, they make ATP). On the presynaptic side, tiny proteins - too tiny, in fact, to show even in the picture above -  form an active zone, where the vesicles of neurotransmitters will actually be released into the synaptic cleft. When the electrical charge in the axon terminal spikes high enough, these proteins change their shape, allowing the vesicles to drop into the cleft and be received by the postsynaptic neuron - that is, the neuron on the other end of the synapse. Each dendrite (receiving \"branch\") of the postsynaptic neuron has its own equivalent of an active zone: a protein cluster known as a postsynaptic density. As vesicles of neurotransmitters enter the dendrite and release their cargo, the postsynaptic density may respond in a variety of ways - for instance, it might launch chemical reactions that start the production of certain neurotransmitters, or it might open or close certain ion channels to change the neuron's voltage.  It's important to remember that none of these are \"on/off\" effects - the degree to which they happen depends on how much of a given neurotransmitter the postsynaptic neuron receives. Even so, once a neuron depolarizes past its trigger threshold, its voltage will spike, and that neuron will pass the signal down its own axon(s), triggering its own neurotransmitter release...and on and on it goes. Here's a page with a lot more detail on the process of synaptic transmission: http://web.williams.edu/imput/introduction_main.html The connections between multiple axons and dendrites can add even more complexity to this picture: some neurons inhibit the firing of their neighbors, while still others inhibit the inhibitors! Some neurotransmitters have one primary effect, while others trigger chemical cascades that can lead to the manufacture of many more neurotransmitters. This means a synaptic signal may be highly targeted, or diffuse and \"blurry\" - and these effects can be produced in a wide variety of ways, from the level of single ion channels all the way up to the effects of neurotransmitters on cell protein structures. In short, synaptic transmission is a whole lot more complex than electricity flowing through wires - electricity and chemicals both come into play, in all sorts of interrelated ways that can be tough to imagine up here at our macroscopic scale. So the answer to the question is, electricity doesn't transmit information, and neither do chemicals - it's the relationship between the neuron's voltage and its neurotransmitters that makes the job possible.

            "answer_text": "Information is communicated by the spatial and temporal structure of electrical impulses as represented by action potentials [1]. Since action potentials are \"all-or-none\" events, postsynaptic neurons only \"know\" the relative timing of the action potential of an individual neuron, rather than the magnitude of the action potential. With that said, neurons can still transmit a lot of information by both temporal and population codes. By temporal codes, I mean the distribution of interspike intervals, or intervals between each consecutive spike of a neuron. From 20 spikes, you can choose a huge variety of interspike intervals - all that could theoretically represent a different bit of information (although in practice, neurons usually don't carry *that* much information). The simplest temporal codes are used by motor neurons, which just use rate coding, or number of action potentials per second (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_code), to carry information about intensity. What's more important (in the brain, at least) are the population codes (which can represent whether surrounding neurons are synchronized or not). If two nearby neurons frequently fire together (or are frequently correlated with each other), for example, they will often trigger long-term potentiation in the postsynaptic neuron, in which case the information belonging to each presynaptic neuron gets \"associated\" with each other. Also, population codes can use combinatorics to encode more information. If you had 2 neurons that fired in response to certain faces, you could encode up to 4 faces, depending on whether or not they fired at a particular time or not. If you had 10 neurons, you could encode up to 2^10 faces. (see Christof Koch's The Quest for Consciousness - chapter 2) In any case, you often have enough neurons whose firing patterns are correlated with each other, such that their voltage fluctuations can be measured by an EEG (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography). One distinct type of voltage fluctuation, for example, is the alpha wave, as shown below   [1] Also see the book Spikes: http://www.amazon.com/Spikes-Exploring-Neural-Computational-Neuroscience/dp/0262681080 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding ",
