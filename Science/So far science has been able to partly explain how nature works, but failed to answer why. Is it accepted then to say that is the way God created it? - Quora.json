            "answer_text": "(1) The background statement, somewhat reworded: So far science has been able to explain to some extent how nature works, but it has failed to answer the question why. Your meaning is obscure. > What distinction do you draw between why and how? What is the difference between explaining why the sun shines, and explaining how it shines, for example? It comes down to the same thing: the vast mass of the sun gives rise to enormous pressure in the core, which gives rise to enormously high temperatures, which causes hydrogen to fuse to helium, which releases energy, and so forth. That answers both the why question and the how question. You can put it either way. > Science has failed to answer the question why what? You give the reader no indication what you have in mind, and thus you have failed to make a comprehensible statement. I can, nevertheless, guess what you have in mind: You are dissatisfied with explanations in terms of physical cause and effect, such as scientists are wont to give, as in the example above, and demand teleological explanations in addition, that is to say, explanations in terms of conscious purpose. Here is my comment on that: Your demand for teleological explanations, if you do indeed make such a demand, lags far behind the times. It has been discovered\u2014and I would call it one of the most profound discoveries in intellectual history\u2014that nature works by physical cause and effect, and not by conscious purpose. The sun proceeds across the sky because planet Earth rotates on its axis, not because a winged god pulls it around on a golden chain to encourage people to work and rest in turns, or any such theological nonsense. And similarly for anything else in nature that you might care to name, with only one exception: the behavior of natural, physical agents such as humans. They do indeed have purposes, and those purposes, to take a hint from physicist and philosopher David Deutsch, might indeed eventually come to shape the universe on a grand scale. To return to Earth today, the rain does not fall that the flowers might grow. Rather, the flowers grow because the rain falls, and if it ceases to fall, they die. Shake all that teleology out of your head and catch up with the times, already! In human life, purpose beckons in spades, and there is meaning galore, but to all appearances purpose does not rule the universe\u2014or not yet, anyway. (2) The question as I understand it: Does God explain why, that is to say, the purpose behind it all, where science fails to do so? No, for several reasons: > The notion of God the supernatural creator makes no sense, and hence you cannot refer to God to explain anything at all. And even if I am mistaken in that, there is no evidence that God the supernatural creator exists. > There is no question why in the first place, as I have explained, in that nature does not work by conscious purpose, but rather by physical cause and effect. > As a point of theology, even if you allow that the notion of God the supernatural creator makes sense, which it does not, and that God exists, which he does not, what can you say? Only that God in his inscrutable wisdom thought this good, that God in his inscrutable wisdom thought that good, that God in his inscrutable wisdom thought the other good, and so on until you collapse in exhaustion. But that explains precisely nothing. It leaves you just where you started. If you wish to understand nature, you must understand it in its own terms. But the takeaway is simply this: Drop teleology like a hot potato\u2014I mean the attempt to find explanations in terms of conscious purpose! Just forget it. It leads nowhere.  Later addendum: It strikes me that teleology is the true mother of God. As many have remarked, primitive people wanted to understand the world around them and to exert a degree of control, and quite naturally, but erroneously, they attempted to do so in terms of conscious purpose: \u201cThe tree spirit wanted to produce fruit this year to reward our prayers.\u201d God, then, is by no means a random figment of the primitive imagination. Rather, he is a fundamental error of the primitive imagination. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cSo far science has been able to partly explain how nature works, but failed to answer why. Is it accepted then to say that is the way God created it?\u201d Science, in the modern sense, which we can refer to as \u201cmaterialistic science\u201d does not address the question \u201cWhy?\u201d in a philosophical or theological sense. Science does try to answer \u201cwhy\u201d questions such as \u201cWhy is the sky blue?\u201d or \u201cWhy do organisms not reproduce perfectly?\u201d It does not, however, try to ascertain such things as \u201cWhy is there life?\u201d or \u201cWhy do we have consciousness?\u201d other than to describe how these things are an inherent aspect of the universe or are advantageous to our physical survival. It is true, then, that one is free to say \u201cGod willed it so\u201d in answer to such questions, and not feel that this in any way contradicts scientific findings or a scientific attitude. However, such an answer is not a \u201cscientific\u201d answer, within the context of materialistic science. Such an answer belongs instead to \u201cspiritual science.\u201d Following is an explanation of these two kinds of science. Scientific knowledge is the highest attainment upon the human plane, for science is the discoverer of realities. It is of two kinds: material and spiritual. Material science is the investigation of natural phenomena; divine science is the discovery and realization of spiritual verities. The world of humanity must acquire both. A bird has two wings; it cannot fly with one. Material and spiritual science are the two wings of human uplift and attainment. Both are necessary\u2014one the natural, the other supernatural; one material, the other divine. By the divine we mean the discovery of the mysteries of God, the comprehension of spiritual realities, the wisdom of God, inner significances of the heavenly religions and foundation of the law. \u2014The Promulgation of Universal Peace, talk number 53, given on 23 May 1912 . Here is some further discussion of why both are necessary. Now, all questions of morality contained in the spiritual, immutable law of every religion are logically right. If religion were contrary to logical reason then it would cease to be a religion and be merely a tradition. Religion and science are the two wings upon which man\u2019s intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the human soul can progress. It is not possible to fly with one wing alone! Should a man try to fly with the wing of religion alone he would quickly fall into the quagmire of superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing of science alone he would also make no progress, but fall into the despairing slough of materialism. All religions of the present day have fallen into superstitious practices, out of harmony alike with the true principles of the teaching they represent and with the scientific discoveries of the time. Many religious leaders have grown to think that the importance of religion lies mainly in the adherence to a collection of certain dogmas and the practice of rites and ceremonies! Those whose souls they profess to cure are taught to believe likewise, and these cling tenaciously to the outward forms, confusing them with the inward truth. Now, these forms and rituals differ in the various churches and amongst the different sects, and even contradict one another; giving rise to discord, hatred, and disunion. The outcome of all this dissension is the belief of many cultured men that religion and science are contradictory terms, that religion needs no powers of reflection, and should in no wise be regulated by science, but must of necessity be opposed, the one to the other. The unfortunate effect of this is that science has drifted apart from religion, and religion has become a mere blind and more or less apathetic following of the precepts of certain religious teachers, who insist on their own favorite dogmas being accepted even when they are contrary to science. \u2014Paris Talks, talk number 44, given on November 12th, 1911 (emphasis added). For further thoughts on these matters, please see Robert Harris's answer to How could you worship a higher creature and use products of science, such as electricity or Internet, while science denies the existence of higher creatures, aka gods?Robert Harris's answer to The question of God's existence is inherently philosophical. But is it a \"scientific\" question as well? Using Aristotle's conception of Science, Dr. B. Huffling answers in the affirmative. Would you agree?",
