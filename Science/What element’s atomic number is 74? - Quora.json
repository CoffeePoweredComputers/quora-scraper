            "answer_text": "Tungsten, a very interesting transition metal.  The element was originally isolated from wolframite ore and hence dubbed \u201cWolfram\u201d by its discoverers, which is why the chemical symbol for Tungsten is W. Wolframite (derived from the German wolf rahm, \u201cwolf\u2019s foam\u201d) was so named because tin smelters noticed that the presence of the angular cubic clusters of this silvery metal reduced the tin yield, seemingly \u201ceating\u201d the tin like a wolf devours sheep. In most European countries the name Wolfram stuck and was until recently the official name of element 74. In English, however, the element was called Tungsten for some reason (from Swedish tung sten, meaning \u201cheavy stone\u201d) and it was not until 2005 that IUPAC officially dropped the name Wolfram in favor of Tungsten to standardize the periodic table worldwide. The change was heavily disputed. As one of the five refractory metals, Tungsten exhibits extreme resistance to heat and wear (the other refractory metals are niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, and rhenium; they are all clustered together on the periodic table). It has the highest melting point of all known metals at 3422 \u00b0C, as well as the lowest vapor pressure and highest tensile strength. It is the fourth hardest element behind carbon, boron, and chromium. Its density is about 1.7 times that of lead, comparable to the densities of gold and uranium. Tungsten is conductive and extremely durable. It is resistant to corrosion and oxygen (it doesn\u2019t rust or tarnish, though it will often develop a yellowish cast or possibly a rainbow oxide layer upon exposure to air). It is also resistant to alkali, but vulnerable to acids. The element has five stable natural isotopes and at least thirty unstable artificial ones. Although its natural isotopes actually do undergo radioactive decay, their half-lives are on on the order of quintillions of years. Tungsten and its compounds find use in numerous functions. It plays a role in biological systems, making it the heaviest element involved in biochemical reactions. Tungsten compounds are useful as lubricants, pigments, and catalysts in various reactions; the metal itself is a common element in alloys. Tungsten is also used in heating elements, electric lamp filaments, electron tubes, metal evaporators, electrical contacts, x-ray targets, glass-to-metal seals, and various high-temperature applications. The metal\u2019s hardness and density make it an ideal material for penetrating and armor-piercing and projectiles.  ",
