            "answer_text": "The situation you describe is most likely to occur when two miscible liquids are combined in equal volumes (as opposed to equal masses or equal moles). Don\u2019t get too caught up in our convenient definition of a solvent. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper into what the nature of a solvent is. In a solution the solvent molecules would normally be surrounding the solute molecules (a process we call solvation) and creating solvent-solute interactions. So when there is a lot more of one liquid it is cleary \u201csurrounding\u201d and solvating the other on the molecular level so it is the solvent. The nature of these solvation interactions depend on the particular type of intermolecular forces present which, in turn, depend on the molecular structure of the solvent and solute. In a 50/50 mixture neither substance can \u201csurround\u201d the other. In general for a case like this the solvent-solvent and solvent-solute intermolecular forces are very similar and entropy is the main driving force for forming the mixture. Essentially any solvation process here is done equally by both types of molecules, i.e. it is not necessary for one type to surround the other. In such a case you can just take your pick! In fact, I would have no problem with you calling both of them solvents in this case. In rarer cases you could have a very soluble solid and a liquid of equal masses. In that case the liquid would be considered the solvent. Although there are equal masses there would be many more moles of the liquid. The liquid molecules would surround (solvate) the solid molecules and the final solution phase would also be a liquid. ",

            "answer_text": "Who Cares? Careful examination of the phase diagram, if one is available, will give an explanation if the diagram is reasonably noncomplicated. In a two component system there is usually an eutectic point or saturation points; On one side component A is usually the solvent on the other side component B is. If there is compound formation or other nonideal behavior the situation requires more careful analysis. In a simple 2 liquid situation such as ether and water if a small amount of water is added to ether it will dissolve, similarly if ether to water; eventually 2 phases form each being a solution of one in the other. In the case of two entirely miscible liquids such as water ethanol or acetone or acetic acid one would probably have to resort to the freezing phase diagram or lower temperature saturation. One of my favorite solution questions is what happens to the water if rice or oatmeal or pasta are cooked until the water is all absorbed or there is one smooth phase. I think the water is dissolved in the solid. But what happens if large excess of water is used as most do? I would love to see the phase diagram for rice or pasta and water. ",
