            "answer_text": "It is CH4, methane, whose molecule is penta atomic. The number of molecules is the same (one-tenth of Avogadro\u2019s number) in all the three cases as each represents 0.1 mole of the respective compound. NH3 and H2O are respectively tetra atomic and triatomic molecules. So, the number of atoms in equimolar amounts of the compounds decreases in the order CH4 > NH3 > H2O. ",
