            "answer_text": "A small bubble will typically have a higher internal pressure, as the surface tension of the bubble wall will be higher, which itself applies a pressure. There is a process known as sonoluminescence, where sound waves cause bubbles in water (cavities) to collapse in on themselves. As the bubbles collapse down, the pressures and temperatures inside the bubbles soar, generating brief bursts of light. The conditions inside a collapsing bubble were even once thought to be capable of producing nuclear fusion temperatures and pressures, although this has never been confirmed and seems dubious (cold fusion).

            "answer_text": "If the bubbles are at the same depth, then they will have the same internal pressure. So there is no reason deriving from hydrostatic pressure to make them merge. The only plausible mechanism causing them to merge is surface tension. Two bubbles combined will have less surface area than apart, and hence less surface tension, and therefore be in a lower energy state. This would only work for small bubbles, as surface tension is very weak, say a few centimetres across at most. And guess what happens? If you watch a SCUBA diver exhale, within a few feet all the air is in bubbles of maybe 1 cm across at most, quite consistent with this theory. ",
