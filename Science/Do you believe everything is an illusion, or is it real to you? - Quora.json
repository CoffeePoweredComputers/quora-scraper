            "answer_text": "I have walked into the Triumf Cyclotron Project in Vancouver area. When that was a big and the biggest thing going. At that time even FBI and Soviet Russia with KGB had to approve me. (my term was security levels up the ying yang). quite true.  Life is not an illusion. I exist. I have tv and that is big screen yet the need is not to need this. I have blank walls and know the calls to reach into infinity. Then the walls themselves become 3D holograhic on a level you could only acknowledge as real. Yes at times i do need to call this out DREAM. I do not allow false images of fantasty to cover my minds thooughts. Yes i am full epileptic psychic. Not foolish on big time play of foolish humans but devote adequate time to the future of humankind itself. The world itself sets me into motion. I see with an open mind and that to the man of humanity means i do know how to dream a dream. I can sleep with eyes not sleeping and visions will surmount any area to give me value to a new undiscovered plan. These sort of people do appear here at times. Especially when really rotten stuff is going on upon this world. Flip side of the coin. The future time does not require complete destruction. Nor enhancement and to consider coin as even a topic is beyond the call of being human at all. Groceries and rent. Covid19 is what has been what has stalled your life. Perplexed and unending duress. The actions are no and or knot a start or a finish. No please of the pleas knows even the handiness of underhanded . You wait because 4 you; you do not understand what humanity stood for and has somehow not been acknowledged in knowing; the ; not even the human spirit or being to be understood. Being human is a short term stint. ( say thew clergy \u201cgiveme your lands and coins and then die). take a meaning ful memory witrh you.  did that do it. no you can not shake the time lines that easy and not for you possible not even for 69 more years. What controls your life, is fair up to you at this time. Putting a near full stop on an entire civilized planet is more than what you decide to call a miracle. I can mechanize an entire for war. say no more. no covid19 works for naught of anyone. Dare you think that; then; know that invisible beast has traced humanity through time itself. TRACED yes traced. While self assuming and being replete of barely even having clean feet, Why does the sound of sickness make all of you walk away and abandon and deny them all (who surround and then just a few take up with faithful honor just to help the few) 71K in usa have infection today above yesterday the daily count . Some crowd swimmer in the crowd of rally trump loaded with covid19 swam over top of them all. no mask and covid19 swimmer being passed around. Next time find that one with a jugular vein cut. Another trump henchman perhaps. but someone paid his pocket anyway. ((the notation is his death count already happens)). OR just dare to kiss ; a caringly hug or kiss something by being intimate with trump. down stomach i still have class. Read the others and find your own self following. Your own life your mother granted to you, do not be with the shackles that society says is pretty bangles and baubles. beg or not in begin ",

            "answer_text": "Illusion is defined as:\u201d a deceptive appearance or impression\u201d and \u201ca false idea or belief.\u201d I can perceive the reality of the illusion better than the illusion of reality. I do not remember his name, but the Tibetan who wrote the book called \u201cThe Tibetan book of the Dead\u201d described in it when he was around 10 years old, the lama that he was with gave him a slap in the chest, and the physical world transformed into energies interacting as patterns. It was an initiation for him to be able to perceive matter closer to its fundamental structure. The Tibetans spent 1000 years developing their sensitivity to another dimension of reality. I know everything is an illusion because of my perception of time and my memories of the last 70 years. The natural ways of nature have been destroyed and replaced with houses and cars. I am responsible for these changes and now I see the error of my thinking. I built houses for 40 years thinking that I was serving human development and individual families. That has turned out to be a big illusion. The last five years has opened up the world of energy, light and love which is all intelligently designed at its natural level. Atoms also carry the burden of consciousness and responsibility. 2020 is a year of action and also one of time. I have been feeling time moving at a very fast pace, especially as some very big events have just taken place and possibly no more than 10,000 people know about them. It is time to awaken to who we are and become aware of our own unique consciousness. I think we are moving very quickly into the shift of consciousness as planet earth prepares for her actions. By 2030 a mini ice age must begin so that she can renew her oceans and the creatures that live in them. At the same time mankind must give up on his crude and polluting technologies ",
