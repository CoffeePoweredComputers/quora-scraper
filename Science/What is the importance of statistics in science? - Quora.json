            "answer_text": "we use statistics when the number of cases that can occur are really large. so large that it would be impractical or impossible to get every sample. so we use statistics to allow us to estimate results and perhaps predict the probability of them happening in the future. In order for a scientist to make an objective judgment as to whether or not a particular hypothesis can be established by a set of collected data, an objective method for either accepting, or rejecting, that hypothesis must be used. This is why, when collating these results, it is essential that statistics are included to ascertain the level or degree of accuracy in the hypothesis. All measurements contain some uncertainty and error, and statistical Methods help us quantify and characterize this uncertainty. This helps explain why scientists often speak in qualified statements. For example, no seismologist who studies earthquakes would be willing to tell you exactly when an earthquake is going to occur; instead, the US Geological Survey issues statements like this: There is a 62% probability of at least one magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake in the 3-decade interval 2003-2032 within the San Francisco Bay Region. This may sound ambiguous, but it is in fact a very precise, mathematically-derived description of how confident seismologists are that a major earthquake will occur, and open reporting of error and uncertainty is a hallmark of quality scientific research. Today, science and statistical analyses have become so intertwined that many scientific disciplines have developed their own subsets of statistical techniques and terminology. For example, the field of biostatistics involves the application of specific statistical techniques to disciplines in biology such as population genetics, epidemology and public health. The field of geostatistics has evolved to develop specialized spatial analysis techniques that help geologists map the location of petroleum and mineral deposits; these spatial analysis techniques have also helped Starbuck's determine the ideal distribution of coffee shops based on maximizing the number of customers visiting each store. Scientific research rarely leads to absolute certainty. There is some degree of uncertainty in all conclusions, and statistics allow us to discuss that uncertainty. Statistical methods are used in all areas of science. The module explores the difference between (a) proving that something is true and (b) measuring the probability of getting a certain result. It explains how common words like significant, control, and random have a different meaning in the field of statistics than in everyday life. ",

            "answer_text": "As Ernest Rutherford put it, \u201cIf your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.\u201d Although some early mathematicians studying probability tried to apply it to science, it had very little effect. Scientists did not average multiple observations, they had taken the observations themselves and knew which ones to trust. They continued to study things until they were confident of the truth, they didn\u2019t set critical values and compute significance levels. The famous early examples of probabilistic investigations, like Graunt\u2019s work on mortality and Mendel\u2019s work on inheritance, appear to report data and analyze it mathematically; but upon closer observation they reported computed results based on theory confirmed in their minds by the data, not raw data. Statistics first came into science when astronomy moved from human observation to study of photographic plates. Instead of experts observing directly, people with less training reviewed thousands of plates. Statistics was not a part of the science itself, it was used for industrial control of the work of large numbers of semi-trusted people. Something similar happened in physics when first assistants and later computers were brought in to analyze accelerator data. The mathematics of probability is important for genetics, statistical thermodynamics and subatomic physics, but this is not statistics in the sense of mathematical analysis of noisy data. There are fields that rely heavily on statistics, such as medicine, economics and sociology. But even in these fields, statistics are important for managing the field\u2014for determining what articles get published or what drugs get approved\u2014not for finding truth. ",
