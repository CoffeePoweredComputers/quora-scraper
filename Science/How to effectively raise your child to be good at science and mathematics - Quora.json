In due time he will be reading to you. About age 4 get him into wooden boat or airplane models, the kind where he measures and cuts the materials himself. Anything using a ruler. I was doing chemistry experiments at age 4 using my brother\u2019s chemistry set. My only problem was I couldn\u2019t figure out how to pronounce phenolphthalein. I would suggest that science and math are not the best fields. Story telling skill will increase a person\u2019s earning potential more than any other detail. ",

            "answer_text": "My very first lesson to accomplish this question was taught to me by my son - when he was at the why stage. Early on young children enter that somewhat annoying phase of asking \u201cWhy \u2026? (insert everything and anything). So I think to myself that I will give him a complete scientific answer and always tell him the truth so it will overload his little brain and he will stop asking me, \u201cWhy?\u201d So we are driving down the road and my son at that age asked me, \u201cWhy is there thunder?\u201d I go into a full scientific explanation to include a clap of my hands to simulate the thunder. Then I say, \u201cSo, why is there thunder?\u201d He repeated it back to me verbatim to include the clap for the thunder. That is when I realized that there is no way to overload their little brains at the why stage. After that day, I looked forward to his why questions instead of dreading them. How do you effectively raise your child to be good at science and mathematics? Tell them everything about what they want to know. ",
