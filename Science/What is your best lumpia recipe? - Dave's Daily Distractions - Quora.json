            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not quite sure if this is my best lumpia recipe, but it is a decent one. But to understand this answer, you\u2019ll need to read my answer for this post: Terry Lo's answer to How many pounds of pulled pork do I need for 50 people?  (from Recipe Tin Eats) To summarize, I answered the question for enough for 50 people as roughly ONE POUND PER PERSON. The idea is that in such a large group, there\u2019s bound to be quite a few big eaters, a few small ones and a decent amount of people who\u2019ll probably eat close to a pound. And best of all, there might be some leftovers which would enjoy the remaining pulled pork in all sorts of different ways. One of the ways I suggested were Pulled Pork Egg Rolls.  (from the Meatwave)  Soooo\u2026 in the comments of that answer, Dave, our host for this space Dave's Daily Distractions, asked me for a recipe that takes advantage of all that lovely pulled pork, ideally in a Malaysian or Philippines cuisine style. Soooo\u2026 lumpia (aka filipino egg rolls) was the game of the day, and I just happened to know a recipe, taught to me by a great Filipino guy I used to know (who unfortunately got deported due to him being defrauded by a corrupt immigration consultant). Soooo\u2026 this recipe is going to assume that you have about 6 pounds of pulled pork left over after a BBQ, or make 6 pounds worth. I have a few recipes for pulled pork, but in this case, I\u2019ll just add it as an ingredient. Other than that, Lumpia are REALLY small as fried rolls go, and I was taught how to make this in LARGE batches. So here\u2019s my adaptation of Pulled Pork Lumpia, and enjoy!  From the comments of my answer to Dave: Ah, Lumpia style. Sure, I already have the recipe in mind, taught to me by a great Filipino guy I knew who unfortunately got deported back to Manila. Now I\u2019m making a few changes to accommodate the pulled pork (assuming you made it the way you liked it). This would be fun and keep you in snacks for days. Pulled Pork Lumpia Enough for about 100 rolls  (from Life\u2019s Ambrosia) INGREDIENTS 6 lb pulled pork3 cups carrots (minced)3 cups onions (minced)2 cups green onions (minced)2 cups sweet chili2 tbsp chicken base (better than bullion comes to mind)Two 50-count packages lumpia wrappers or egg roll wrappers1 eggPinch all-purpose flourOil, for fryingINSTRUCTIONS Mix carrots, onions, green onions, sweet chile and chicken base. Sautee it all on medium low heat until carrots are soft. Set aside and let it cool.Beat the egg together with the flour in a small bowl.Mix the pork belly with the veggies.Roll pork belly mix into lumpia wrappers and seal with egg wash.Bring oil to 325 degrees F in a deep-fryer or heat oil in a pan.Pan- or deep-fry lumpias until their internal temperature is 155 degrees F, about 7 minutes. Drain.Serve with whatever sauce you like.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- SPECIAL OPTION EXTRA INGREDIENT ONE MORE 50-count packages of lumpia wrappers or egg roll wrappersGreen bean vermicelli / aka cellophane noodles ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION (to give it more of a Vietnamese style to it) Before making the veggie mix, cut a pack of the vermicelli in HALF and put it in a bowl. Pour hot water to cover the noodles and let it sit for 1/2 hourDrain the water, sautee the noodles with the veggies. (the noodles might break up, let it).Follow the rest as per the original instructions except you\u2019re now making about 150 lumpia.",
