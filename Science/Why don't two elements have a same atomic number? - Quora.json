            "answer_text": "Then they would have been the same element, wouldn't they? It's the definition of elements, different elements have different atomic number. Each element has its own specific property,BUT certain elements have similar properties, like elements in the same family. The atomic number is associated to the element's composition for one atom, in which the atomic number = number of protons in the atom with a neutral charge. ",

They have the same atomic number because the number of protons inside their nuclei remains the same. The difference in their mass number is due to the difference in their number of neutrons. ",
