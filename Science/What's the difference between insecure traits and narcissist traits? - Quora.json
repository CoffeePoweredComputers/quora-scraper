            "answer_text": "They both, in most of the cases, has the same root: INSECURITY. But there are quite many differences: The insecure traits are possessed by the dude that feels a loser, worthless and conciously inferior to everybody around him, that consideres he is just useless.So, as a manifestation it might look quite sad. But definitely this is not case with a narcissist. He has insecurities, but he do not worship anyone unless that person has some enormous and admirable results. He consideres himself a god, perfect, the best, his insecurities are covered by some disdainful, haughty, arrogant & snobbish behaviour, holding contempt for almost everybody around them, to the rest being indifferent.He do not accept to be treated like a shit and will kill you if he can, while the other will kiss your ass because it is mentally collapsed, he will see everyone around him as being better, worthy, while he do not deserve even to exist (strange, I know).The Narcissist might afford some callous treatment only as means to an end, a method of manipulation, but not because he consideres you superior to him, or because is shy, or afraid.So, this is basically the difference between those 2. One is really devoid of any trace of self-esteem, while the other tried to fight a little, if it makes sense. Also in manifestation they look quite different. There is a difference between the shy guy that shits on him when he sees a girl, and the Narcissist that, well, he may shits himself too as the former, but at least he tries \u201cto stay in positions\u201d, and act overly-confident to compensate the insecurities while the first sadly is lost.

Narcissistic traits is from one\u2019s character and personality that are developed from similar dynamics of self doubt, but more from a heightened false belief that they are entitled while the external people and variables owe them what they demand as in immediate gratification or replacement through another. Narcissist often lack the capability to feel empathy with a consciousness of potential wronging another person to get what they need from them. ",
