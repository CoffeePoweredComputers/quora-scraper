            "answer_text": "These are rules I live by when it comes to researching anything on politics. Never use a source beyond a left or right center bias. The only exceptions to this rule is for the sake of showing multiple arguments of differing views, or for showing something out of normal. For example, let\u2019s say a left leaning source supports gun rights. If you are arguing for gun rights, and you argue \u201ceven this usually left leaning source agrees with me on this\u201d, it is acceptable. Never use a new source for the primary source. Not unless you just need a quick, yet accurate and trustworthy source of statistics. Even then, see if you can find a better, more trustworthy source. Always be on the look out for trustworthy sources you can use. For example, when I talk about economic issues, I like to use investopedia, and the balance for good facts, that have little to no political motivation. I also use pew research, and http://usnews.com sometimes. Gallup Research is also trustworthy. Be sure you find sources that you know are trustworthy. If you think the source is politically motivated, displays irrelevant information, or does not enough, do not use that source at all. When you all of that, then you may form a political opinion. If you can\u2019t back up what you are saying in any way, then don\u2019t espouse it. Be willing to admit when you are wrong. Don\u2019t ignore the opposing view point of they provide a statistic or a source. Instead, review it and come to your own conclusion. If they fail to back up what they are saying by using logic, a source of some kind, or the source provides irrelevant information and is not backed by logic, the argument fails. Become as unemotional as possible. While I don\u2019t entirely agree with the \u201closs your cool, lose the argument\u201d concept, it will hurt your credibility, as well as degrade your argument much faster. Be on the look out for fallacies they might provide in their argument to degrade their argument further. Even though fallacies are pretty much unavoidable to a degree, you can at least limit yourself by trying to not do too many of them yourself, and pointing them out when you see them. Keep your bias to yourself. Conceive that you might be wrong. If not saying you should think you are always wrong, but keep that possibility in mind. That\u2019s about what I do. I might be missing a few thing. :) ",
