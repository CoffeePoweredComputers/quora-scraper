            "answer_text": "There are two definitions of free: Free as in free speechFree as in free beerThe difference between the two is discussed extensively in The Cathedral and the Bazaar, an essay about free software, which was modeled in an idealized view of research. Scientific research is not free as in beer; it costs money to conduct. That one is easy. Scientific research should be free as in speech. In practice, science usually is free in that anyone can contribute (you don\u2019t need special affiliation or permission), and anyone can read articles and apply the knowledge; it isn\u2019t licensed or restricted. Some research isn\u2019t free for three reasons: Articles are paywalled by the publisher (note that the researchers get nothing out of this; not one penny, ever)Some published research describes things protected by patents or other IP, which requires a license for useSome scientific research is not published because it\u2019s either a trade secret or classified by the governmentMost of the time, the articles are available (you can always email the author), even if it\u2019s not as fast as \u201cinstant\u201d, and published research about IP-protected work is somewhat rare. As for trade secret or classified work, that\u2019s often done in a scientifically rigorous manner, but most people don\u2019t call it science because it hasn\u2019t been contributed to the larger body of knowledge that comprises a science.

            "answer_text": "There are more than a couple of ways to interpret the question. Some results are only reported in papers behind paywalls. Definitely not free. The archive: arXiv.org e-Print archive is a good place to find papers reporting scientific research for free.Choosing ones area of research is influenced by many factors. Only a lucky few are free to choose.Factors influencing choice of a subject: Institution. Corporate research priorities depend to some extent on their relevance to the business. University research may depend on its value in the eyes of potential sponsors.Sponsor. Money for research depends on the source of funds and the preferences of whomever controls the pursestrings.Peer respect Some research may taint the researcher based on what the scientific community considers pseudo-science. Lay estimates of the likelihood of success may enter into the equation.",
