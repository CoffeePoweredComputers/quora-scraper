            "answer_text": "With the unaided eye, on a really dark night with no Moon and a clear sky overhead, you can see about 2,500 stars at any given moment in time. Maybe a few more if the horizon isn\u2019t too hazy.  The Yale Bright Star Catalog of 9,096 stars lists all of those in the heavens visible with the naked eye from anywhere on Earth at any time of the year - in total. There are a few other things visible up there which are not included in that catalogue listing. The BSC contains 9110 objects, of which 9096 are stars (14 objects catalogued in the original compilation of 1908 are novae or extragalactic objects that have been retained to preserve the numbering, but most of their data are omitted), while the remarks section is slightly larger than the main catalog. The present edition of the compilation includes many new data and the remarks section has been enlarged considerably. (from the accompanying readme file: http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.readme)All of the stars in the Yale BSC are within our own Milky Way galaxy, and those are the only stars we can see with the naked eye, with very few exceptions. According to one article I found (quoting from the Hipparcos catalogue of stars): \"The farthest star we can see with our naked eye is V762 Cas in Cassiopeia at 16,308 light-years away. Its brightness is magnitude 5.8 or just above the 6th magnitude limit.\" http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2010/10/02/how-to-see-the-farthest-thing-you-can-see/ - How to find the Andromeda galaxy in the sky with your naked eye (it\u2019s 2.5 million light years away, and we can\u2019t see any of the individual stars at that distance, even when using the Hubble) We can\u2019t see it now, but the star SN 1885A was visible to the naked eye (at a distance of 2.6 million light years) almost 130 years ago.  Stars within 50 light years - a listing sourced from the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997) This is every star brighter than magnitude 6.5 within 50 light years, so all of these stars can be seen with the naked eye although most of them are quite faint. This list contains every G-type star within 50 light years. The Sun seen from a distance of 50 light years would be a magnitude 5.8 star, so it also would be a faint point of light barely visible with the naked eye. 3D stellar environment of the Sun - a simple online program which allows an interactive view of all visible stars (6.5 magnitude and brighter) either up to 15 light years distant, or up to 35 light years distant. (courtesy J.-M. Malherbe, Observatoire de Paris)  The Local Group refers to all Galaxies within 5 million light years. There are many, many, many stars within our own Milky Way galaxy (diameter ~100,000 light years) that we can\u2019t see with our most powerful of telescopes. The Milky Way contains between 200 and 400 billion stars and at least 100 billion planets. (see The Universe within 5 million Light Years) Supernovae (including those visible from distant galaxies) have a limited life-time of days or weeks. There are so few, let\u2019s just leave them out, shall we? You asked about stars, not supernova and black holes and galaxies). The Hubble Space Telescope can see individual stars in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), which appears to us to be 2.54 million light years away.
