            "answer_text": "The question itself is interesting to answer. So I'm going to tell my thoughts about the future of Smartphones mainly Mobile Devices. I am currently using a Lumia smartphone and I always get the feeling that this phone is not meant for the current generation; but it is for the future\u2026 It has a lot of functions that a daily user would not use now because it is not simply needed now!. And that's the fact about it. Many people (including myself) speculate this theory. and since I still use the device( and also use the device at its fullest), I'm sure that the future of Mobile computing would be dominated by Windows Just like the PC market. Even though Microsoft's aim of putting their mobile OS in the hands of the public has already failed so many times, With the advent of Windows 10 and Andromeda OS( just a speculation\u2026), The future of Mobile Computing( as I would like to call it!) May bring a bright future for us users\u2026 Now lets talk about the hardware of the New devices( In the future that is\u2026) The bezel-less display is now becoming a trend and the manufacturer's ultimate goal of producing a completely bezel-less display is now becoming a reality. The question is WHAT IS NEXT? According to the trend of the Smartphone market, we could imagine foldable devices making a comeback\u2026 ultra portable wearables like smartwatches( not like the ones that are seen now) and Highly powerful and power efficient PCs\u2026 Its all just imaginations of the human mind but what can we do? our thoughts are( we are) biased by our past experiences. P.S. I am a windows fan and now you knew it!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Here I explained the future of the mobile technology and to know more visit this article. How will the mobile of the future We tell you how the mobile of the future will be built with flexible materials and self-repairing screens  How will the mobile of the future. Since the introduction of the first smartphone a decade ago, the technologies applied in the preparation of the same have advanced enormously but not as much as in other areas. Probably, we are reaching the limit of the possibilities that mobile phones have and we are walking towards a new way of communicating. However, it is already known that the mobile phones of the immediate future will be flexible and will have self-repairing screens . Physical aspect of the mobile of the future By 2018 mobile screens will be flexible because they will be created with transparent silver instead of glass, which implies greater resistance. The experiment has been taking place for years in different research units of universities and centers around the world. They were already exhibited at technology fairs and conferences but have not yet been launched on the mass market. At the same time, flexible screens are intended to be self-repairing , an aspiration that is being tested empirically and could become a reality for the public by the year 2020. The idea is that the smartphone fixes its own damages beyond fissures or scratches, ensuring self-recycling .Up to now, the mobile phone has repaired its damage in less than a day, attracting the molecules to join together, eliminating the signs of deterioration. For now, only the curved and borderless screens are commercialized, which take advantage of the entire front face of the device. Internal characteristics of the mobile of the futureThe interactive applications of Siri's style on Apple devices will not require you to touch the screen to fulfill your orders and your answers will reach a higher level of accuracy. They will be able to process the human voice in a wide range of tones, acquiring more volumes of words with which they will interact and allow them to better receive your orders.Instead of telling your mobile what to do, he will do it for you by identifying your needs and reacting to them. The purpose is that you do not have to resort to another site to obtain all the information you require, being even more intuitive than it currently is. The level of response will merge with the augmented reality generating the illusion of a virtual assistant who participates in your life on the physical plane.The wireless novelties are already being installed in the market as the Apple Air Pods to listen to music with wireless headphones. Within a short time, the battery will also be charged wirelessly which is a pending account of mass-sold smartphones. The load will replenish faster without losing power, but expanding the possibilities when you do not have a cable nearby. ",
