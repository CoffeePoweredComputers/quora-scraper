One could call the big bang the origin of all living organisms, OR you might call the first living creature the origin or the first human or all four grandpas and grammas or Mom and Pop or just Mom or the Ground of all Being or \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. well it gets complicated and divisive after that. That is just people and grounds of being but you might mean one celled critters or maybe a virus. Give us some clues and anyway, why do you ask? ",

            "answer_text": "As to the material, the origin of living organism was probably preexisting atoms and molecules. As to the direct cause, i.e. that which brought together the elements in such a way to create life, this is still an open question in science. Abiogenesis is the idea that life, on earth at least, arose directly from purely natural causes (as opposed to aliens or God). ",
