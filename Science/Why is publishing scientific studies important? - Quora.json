            "answer_text": "The publishing of studies is good for science.  Peer review by other scientists may find flaws in the methods used or the conclusions drawn.  It gives others an opportunity to repeat the test to confirm the findings or dispute them.  It might inspire other types of experiments.  It offers scientists in different fields information which might improve their research as well. Peer review is a powerful part of the scientific method also because other researchers might seek to collaborate with the author. All of these improve our techniques and provide for more rapid discoveries to add to the body of scientific knowledge.  The historical value to future experimenters is important as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Most scientists believe that a major goal of their research is to contribute to the sum of human knowledge and to provide the basis for future studies and possible practical applications. Nearly all successful research studies generate more questions to study. Publication is a major instrument for distributing the results of your research to scientific community as well as industry, general public, etc. This distribution helps assure that ones work add to the sum of human knowledge.
