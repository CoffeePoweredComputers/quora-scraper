Leaflets bearing axis is a continuation of petiole or a branch of midrib. 4. Leaflets occur in two rows. 5. A joint is not present between the leaflet and its axis. Difference # Palmate Compound Leaves: 1. The leaf resembles the palm of hand. 2. Leaflets are attached to a common point. 3. Leaflet bearing point represents the tip of petiole. 4.
