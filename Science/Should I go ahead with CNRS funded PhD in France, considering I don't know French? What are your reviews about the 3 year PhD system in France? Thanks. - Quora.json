            "answer_text": "I have made my PhD in France and have been the supervisor of some PhD students, and among them some who were not speaking French at the beginning. Unless your field is intrinsically linked with French language (Law, French literature, French history\u2026) it\u2019s not compulsory to speak French. The Dissertation can be written in English. You will be required to give a summary in French but you can make it done by someone else. In exact sciences (maths, physics, biology, chemistry etc\u2026), in economics, or in management, it\u2019s not a problem to make the PhD in English. The real problem is to find a supervisor, knowing that the offer of supervisors is limited and even more limited if you don\u2019t speak French. To make a PhD is hard, much harder than you think. The French system \u201cdissertation only\u201d is even harder because you\u2019re alone with your research. At least if you have a CNRS grant you will not have to worry for the money. ",

CNRS is the French equivalent to US MIT or Cal-Tech or Lawrence Livermore, etc etc. If they consider sponsoring your doctorate in France, well, they must consider you a highly capable person as they don\u2019t sponsor anyone : CNRS is THE big thing when it comes to science in France, it\u2019s Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (National Centre for Scientific Research\u2026 As you see, the English words are similar). Then, as any doctorate thesis comes with a study that has never been done before, any experience is unique, your thesis will reflect what you will input with the help of your thesis director\u2026 ",
