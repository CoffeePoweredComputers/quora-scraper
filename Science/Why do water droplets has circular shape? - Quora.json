            "answer_text": "It is because of surface tension. Surface (exposed to atmospheric air) of the liquid behaves like a streched membrane. Surface tension is a property of liquid due to which it tends to decrease (minimise) its surface area. For a given volume, sphere has minimum surface area. Thats why water drops have spherical (not circular) shape. Think of balloon. Its a streched membrane. It represents the streched surface if water. ",

            "answer_text": "Surface tension is responsible for the shape of liquid droplets. Although easily deformed, droplets of water tend to be pulled into a spherical shape by the cohesive forces of the surface layer. In the absence of other forces, including gravity, drops of virtually all liquids would be approximately spherical. ",
