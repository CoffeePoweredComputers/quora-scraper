            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean. I would say that the Earth would be colliding with the star, rather than the star colliding with Earth, but as long as you regard collision as a commutative relationship, then this is a quibble. Earth is far more likely to have collided with the (expanding) sun first. As for \u201center our solar system\u201d, you need to define \u201center\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201csolar system\u201d. It\u2019s not going to be yours anymore by the time another start \u201centers\u201d, and given that stars as a matter of course have their own stellar systems that \u201center\u201d is a little suspect. You can define a stellar system as being the orbital plane of planets around a star, or as the larger scale structures of various masses moving predominantly under solar gravitational influence, or the ionizing radiation sphere produced by a star that excludes and mitigates certain kinds of cosmic radiation. For all of these systems, the approach of another star will disrupt them in ways that make it difficult to give an unambiguous answer to the question of one star entering the other star\u2019s system. It is an eventual certainly that the Solar system (for any of these definitions) will eventually be disrupted by proximity to another object that could be classified in stellar terms. But I guess we also need to look at the definition of \u201cstar\u201d too. If the remains of the solar system are getting sucked into a supermassive black hole along with the remains of other stellar systems, does that count or not? And then there are Hollywood stars. They must collide with the Earth all the time, right? ",

            "answer_text": "Extremely remote chance . If you look at the distance between our star (sun) and the closest Star to us  Proxima Centauri for instance , 4.24 light years away , in that gap would fit 30,000,000 suns , and that's our closest star !  the Apollo spacecraft at its fastest , 7 miles per second would take 112,000 years to get there .  The Milky Way for all intents and purposes is mostly empty space , nothing ! except dark matter of course , but that only acts gravitation-ally so is no worry. If that doesn't give you some idea how really empty the universe is in reality  how about if the sun was 1 meter diameter , earth would be the size of a pea 110 meters away and  Proxima Centauri would be the size of a beachball and 30,000 meters away   . Our solar system is really just made up of the Sun , Jupiter and Saturn and some mots of dust (earth) .  In fact a whole another galaxy could collide with the Milky way , as Andromeda will in 4 Billion Years , and pass straight on through  and it is extremely unlikely that any two stars from the merging galaxies would collide.
