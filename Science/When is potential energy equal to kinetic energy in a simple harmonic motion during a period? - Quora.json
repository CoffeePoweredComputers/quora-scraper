            "answer_text": "Since we\u2019re talking about energy it\u2019s nicer to refer to the displacement instead of the time (when). So use the formula F(x)=-kx, and integrate it with respect to distance, which gives you the energy as a function of distance. Say you displace it one unit, then release it. The potential energy is equal to kinetic energy (because energy is conserved), when it is displaced [math]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt(2)}[/math] from the equilibrium point, which is about 0.71 units. If you want to know when, I\u2019d say \u201cWhen you do your own homework.\u201d ",
