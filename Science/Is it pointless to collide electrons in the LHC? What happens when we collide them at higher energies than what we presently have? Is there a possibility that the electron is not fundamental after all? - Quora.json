            "answer_text": "It actually has already been done before. Sort of. Before LHC CERN\u2019s largest accelerator was called LEP and it was colliding electrons with positrons at maximal energy of about 100 GeV per beam. When the discovery potential of that accelerator has been exhausted, LEP was dismantled and replaced with the LHC, built in the same tunnel that previously hosted LEP. You may ask why LEP has so much lower beam energy than the LHC. This is caused by much lower mass of the electron, than that of a proton. Electrons at the same energy move with velocities closer to the light speed, and, as a result, radiate much stronger when orbiting in a magnetic field (so called synchrotron radiation). The maximal LEP energy was set by the rate at which we could replenish energy lost by electrons to synchrotron radiation. In proton synchrotrons, like the LHC, with present technology, the limiting factor is strength of the magnetic field that we can produce to keep the protons in orbit. Synchrotron radiation by protons is not a problem at present energies. And, as others have noticed, you can\u2019t easily accelerate electrons in a synchrotron designed for protons. So you can\u2019t fill electrons in the LHC without significant modifications to it. And even if you could, you would not get energy higher than LEP was able to deliver. ",

            "answer_text": "Re colliding electrons in the LHC: \u201cpointless\u201d is not the right word. It would be, for all practical purposes, impossible. Protons are ~1800 times more massive than electrons. The LHC is designed to contain and accelerate protons, which, when they are bent around the loop by magnetic fields, lose much less energy. Trying to push electrons around the LHC would be like trying to hold the Kentucky Derby at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Even if a few horses made it around the track, you wouldn\u2019t learn anything about either horses or automobiles. So in that sense, yes, it would be pointless. The way to accelerate electrons is to use a linear accelerator, for example SLAC: SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory - Wikipedia Re what will happen when we collide electrons at higher energies, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to find out: International Linear Collider - Wikipedia Re whether the electron is fundamental, at the moment theory says that\u2019s the case. Theory further says it should be a dimensionless point but that would mean (also according to theory) an infinite self-energy. So that\u2019s an issue. But so far all experiments tell us that it doesn\u2019t decay into anything simpler. So all the evidence says it\u2019s fundamental. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not pointless, it\u2019s impossible. Electrons at 7TeV wouldn\u2019t even make it through the first bending magnet. They would loose so much energy through synchrotron radiation that they would be bent too much and end up in the vacuum chamber. Just for perspective, in the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP), at the maximum engergy of 104 GeV, electrons would lose almost 3GeV per turn due to synchrotron radiation. ",
