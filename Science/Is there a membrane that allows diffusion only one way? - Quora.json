            "answer_text": "No, not as such. It would violate the laws of thermodynamics. That is, if such a hypothetical membrane separated an isolated system into compartments A and B, blocking diffusion to B but not to A, all particles would move to A due to random fluctuation and not be allowed back. In other words, an initially mixed system would become separated without the expenditure of energy. Decrease of entropy. Living cells use one-way transport over membranes to separate particles, but use specialized proteins that expend energy. Conversely, ATP synthase creates chemical energy by allowing particles to diffuse across a membrane in the other direction. In the same vein: one-way glass does not exist, either. It would similarly separate a system\u2019s heat on both sides through radiation. (Police interrogations use half-reflective, half-transparent glass and a well-lit room, so that reflection from the interrogation room itself outshines the light coming in from the other, darker side.)

            "answer_text": "As Emily Czinege says, a one way membrane would violate the laws of physics but you can get a system that produces that effect. This is important for the maple syrup industry which needs to remove excess water from sap to produce syrup. In this setup, water moves away from the sap and never back. Imagine a container divided in two by a membrane that allows water to pass but not bigger molecules like sugar. Put raw maple sap on one side and nothing on the other. The water will flow out leaving concentrated sugar behind. The net flow of water is one-way, away from the sap. The process is called Reverse Osmosis and can also be used to obtain salt-free water from the ocean.  Reverse Osmosis ",
