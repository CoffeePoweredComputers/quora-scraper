            "answer_text": "A nucleus with \u201cm\u201d protons and \u201cn\u201d neutrons (note that \u201cm\u201d and \u201cn\u201d may be the same number) transitions to a nucleus with \u201cm-1\u201d protons and \u201cn+1\u201d neutrons. A positron and an electron neutrino are emitted and they share whatever energy is released by the transition. This process is commonly considered as \u201ca proton converting into a neutron\u201d, however I would encourage you to only consider it at the nucleon count level. \u201cPositron Emission Tomography\u201d should actually be called \u201cPositron-Electron Annihilation Tomography\u201d (PEAT) since it is the annihilation of the emitted positron with an electron that produces the photons that are used to tomographically produce an image. When a positron and an electron mutually annihilate, one of several things can happen. Either an even number of photons can be produced, preferentially 2, or an odd number of photons (greater than or equal to 3, but preferentially 3) can be produced. It is only the case where 2 photons are produced that is useful in PET, since the pair of photons must equally share the energy of 1.022MeV (their mass equivalent), that is 511keV each, and those two photons theoretically traverse in opposite directions. I say \u201ctheoretically\u201d because, due to conservation of momentum, they may not be at exactly 180 degrees to each-other, but \u201cpretty close\u201d to it. Once these two photons are detected \u201csimultaneously\u201d, computer software can \u201cback-track\u201d to where the annihilation occurred, presumably the tumor. ",

            "answer_text": "At the time positron emission, also called positive beta decay (\u03b2+-decay), a proton found in parent nucleus decay into neutron in daughter nucleus. Then nucleus emits a neutrino and positron which is positive particle but different from each other in charge. It was first observed by Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie in 1934.
