Because it has been less than 4 weeks since the first test was released (March 3), and barely a week since several more came on the market. The next generation, a quick test requiring just one drop of blood, is due to be released in two or three days, with full production expected a week after that. There is only so fast you can develop, test and manufacture an antibody test. I hadn't been expecting any to be available before midsummer and have been amazed at the speed with which they have been appearing. ",
