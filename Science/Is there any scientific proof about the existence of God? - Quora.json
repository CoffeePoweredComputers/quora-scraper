            "answer_text": "Scientific? No, and there will never be either. Don\u2019t misunderstand me here. I am not speaking to the likelihood (or lack thereof) of any supernatural beings on a scientific basis. In fact, I am not really talking about religion at all. I am talking about science. We\u2019ll get back to God in a moment.  The basic thing you have to understand about science is that it doesn\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d things the way that virtually any non-scientist seems to imply on a regular basis that it does. In fact, when I see the word \u201cproof\u201d used in a scientific topic, my first reaction is to check to see if the speaker is actually a scientist. Most often they are not. Most of the scientists I know are incredibly reluctant to use that word. What science does, all it really does, is keep accurate records of what has happened. Seriously, that\u2019s it. We call this data \u201cexperiments\u201d and use the results to create theories.  Let me give you an example. One of the best-agreed upon scientific \u2018proofs\u2019 is the existence of gravity, which scientists refer to as Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation. This theory says that objects are attracted towards each other on the basis of their mass and the distance between them, given by the equation below:  The reason we believe this is because things fall, and because scientists have spent centuries (no, that\u2019s not an exaggeration) watching and carefully measuring falling things. The better part of a century before Newton formulated (or stole, depending on who you ask) the Law of Universal Gravitation, Galileo Galilei disproved Aristotle\u2019s thousand-year old hypothesis that heavier objects fall faster than light objects  by dropping two objects of different mass from the leaning tower. Later, he made a series of experiments by rolling balls of varying masses down inclines. His work became the foundation for Newton\u2019s work a century later. And it wasn\u2019t until nearly a hundred years after Newton that a scientist named Cavendish demonstrated the pull of gravity in a lab, by hanging heavy masses at the end of a wire and seeing how the wire twisted:  That is two centuries of scientists doing simple experiments, measuring the outcomes, and leaving the record for posterity, to come up with a single scientific law!   Now, why am I bringing all this up? Well, to illustrate a simple but critically important point: Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation is NOT a proof. At no point did anyone ever \u201cprove\u201d that all objects are attracted to one another on the basis of mass. What Newton did -ALL Newton did- was come up with an equation to describe \u201cwhat objects in fact do.\u201d Basically, he just graphed all the existing data, and found it led to a neat curve. He isn\u2019t claiming that there\u2019s a mystical Force which pulls all things together, only that all the objects we\u2019ve so far observed, tend to be attracted towards one another in a consistent fashion. If, tomorrow, we discovered a new object, which did not in fact do \u201cwhat objects do,\u201d then tomorrow, we would immediately begin work on a new theory. In point of fact, this has already happened! At the end of the 19th century, astronomers began to notice that the planet Mercury:  did not, in fact, follow an orbit accurate to what Newton\u2019s law predicted, but deviated slightly from it. Attempts were made to find another planetary object whose gravitational field interfered with Mercury\u2019s trajectory, but none was ever found. It was taken for granted that, eventually, we\u2019d discover a relatively small dark object that was messing with Mercury\u2019s orbit. Then, in the mid 20th century, Albert Einstein came up with the Theory of General Relativity, and it explained, among other things, the flaw in Mercury\u2019s orbit. As it so happens, Newton was wrong about \u201cwhat objects in fact do.\u201d There was more to the story than that. Since then, we\u2019ve made many attempts to test the new theory, including sending clocks into space at relativistic speeds. Thus far, the Theory of General Relativity holds. But only for now. If tomorrow, we find a data point which does not sit neatly on the line, then it will be time to come up with a new theory. In other words, people think the question scientists are trying to answer is \u201cwhy do objects do what they do?\u201d It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s \u201cwhat do objects do?\u201d  But what does all this have to do with God? Thank you for your patience thus far; I\u2019ll be happy to get to the point now. Which is: If scientists are more interested in \u201cwhat\u201d than \u201cwhy,\u201d it should be obvious that science will never really be able to prove (or disprove, or even understand) God. Because God, if he exists, will not follow the rule for \u201cwhat objects do\u201d If God truly is a sentient being, not merely an anthropomorphization of \u2018mother nature\u2019 or some such, he will not follow any equations. He will have will, and understanding, and decision-making capacity. He will not fit the pattern. In fact, he will not be a \u2018what,\u2019 at all, but a \u2018who\u2019. You\u2019d be far better off asking a psychologist than a scientist for any explanation of his behavior. If tomorrow, an astronomer pointed his telescope to a section of space and saw this:  It is not at all obvious what science would do about it. Or rather, there are exactly two things science would do, neither of which is helpful for proving (or disproving) God. Either we would say: Yes, I can think of such-and-such an equation which could lead to the appearance of a gigantic disembodied hand.In which case, there\u2019s no need to invoke God at all, it would just be another instance of \u201cBig Hand Theory.\u201dOr we would say: No, we do not have any theory for how such a thing could exist.In which case, it would simply join a tremendously long list of unexplained phenomena in need of a scientific explanation.But \u201cit was God\u201d will never really come into the discussion. Why? Because the purpose of science, to discover what objects do, is not helped by that explanation. Maybe it is just another equation in need of solving. Maybe it was a one-time fluke. Maybe the astronomer lost his marbles. Maybe it\u2019s a freak chance being anthromorphized by human observers. Or maybe it is God. But if it is God, expect scientists to be the first to give up on it. So what? All that means is that someone else (the fact that the someone happens to be God is irrelevant) interfered with your experiment. The only thing to do then (aside from privately and on your own time converting to a new religion), is to sigh, set the experiment back up, and hope nobody else walks in front of your telescope. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm personally an agnostic who's open to the possibility of there being a  God as \"revealed\" in the Bible. I simply see no scientific evidence of  His existence.There is no scientific proof the God of the Bible, Torah, or Koran exists. There is, however, a ton of scientific evidence for design without naming the designer UNLESS one arbitrarily excludes that possibility from the realm of science before investigating.  I say \"arbitrarily\" because there is no scientific reason for doing so. Scientists and philosophers of science have tried to define exactly what is and isn't science for decades. Doing so is called making a demarcation argument and they have long since been abandoned because no one can draw a precise line which sets the limits of what is and is not science. Those who demand design be excluded are doing exactly that and there is NO scientific reason for doing so. There are only philosophical and/or ideological reasons. From there, those hundreds (if not thousands) of things we see which lead us to the conclusion they were designed are either a staggeringly improbable set of coincidences OR actual evidence of design. Atheist scientist Richard Dawkins (and most others like him) claim nature only gives the appearance of design. It's all a very intricate, elaborate illusion based on random mutation, natural selection, and long periods of time.  I won't even try to get into the reasons I reject that notion for either the origin of life or common ancestry. I will simply offer a number of books written by scientists who are also proponents of intelligent design. Nature's Destiny by Michael DentonDarwin's Doubt by Stephen C. MeyerSignature in the Cell by Stephen C. Meyer Darwin's Black Box by Michael BeheThe Edge of Evolution by Michael Behe In my opinion, neo-Darwinism is THE most scientifically unsupported theory ever to reach \"paradigm status.\" The claim it has been \"rigorously tested and proven for over 150 years.\" In reality, there are HUGE gaps in all of the areas of evidence and yet those gaps are papered over with huge amounts of faith and ignored! They are explained with tropes like \"we'll find the evidence someday\" or the use of \"just so\" stories such as, \"Well, we don't know HOW it happened, but it just did somehow.\" It is zealously defended by the ruling priesthood which admits to dissenters to its ranks. To me, that isn't science, that's fundamentalism. ",
