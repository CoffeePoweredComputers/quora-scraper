            "answer_text": "We try to make them much more than they are. They are not magic. Fisher intended to analyze the data from a study to see if a conclusion of a difference was defensible. Any descriptive analysis will be certain to find a difference between treatments. The question was whether the difference was reasonably explained as just the kind of difference you would get by the random flip-flopping of numbers when there was no treatment difference, or was the difference difficult to explain if there was no real treatment difference. Fisher developed a mathematical foundation for methods for comparing the mean difference to amount of unpredictability in the data for a given treatment. To give credibility to saying that the difference was unexpectedly large, given the range of the data, Fisher had to determine the probability distribution of the ratio of difference to variability. He did so. Since the probabilities were very time consuming to calculate, Fisher picked certain percentiles such as .05 and,010 For people who want to come to a hard conclusion from a study, the 0.05 percentile became the arbiter of the study. This had the appearance of using objective methods and \u201cgood science \u201c. In fact that was never the intent. Instead, the statistical results were to be just another tool for reaching conclusions, Instead they have become the \u201ctruth finders\u201d. To answer your question, pvalues are such a confusing mess because we assume they have magical powers for providing us with \u201cthe truth \u201c. ",
