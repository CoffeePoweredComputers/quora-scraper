            "answer_text": "Yes, an object can have both kinetic and potential energy. A plane in flight has kinetic energy due to its velocity, and has potential energy due to its height. A stone vertically throw up is another example. Its kinetic energy gradually gets converted to potential energy as it goes up, and again the reverse as it comes down. You will several examples nature and daily life if you just look around, most common being the birds you see around. ",

The rocket is an example The engines accelerate the rocket - kinetic energy is increasing It\u2019s direction is upward, away from the earth - it\u2019s potential energy is increasing This energy, of course, comes from the chemical energy of the fuel.
