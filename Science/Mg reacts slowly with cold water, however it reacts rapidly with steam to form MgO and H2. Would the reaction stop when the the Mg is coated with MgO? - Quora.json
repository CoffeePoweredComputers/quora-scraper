            "answer_text": "It's hard to say off hand, but I suspect it would keep going. Oxide layers usually have some degree of porosity, which steam can get through to react with the metal underneath. Water may be too viscous to get through the pores, but steam probably still would. Now, as the oxide layer built up thicker and thicker, it would take longer for steam to get through to the surface, and the reaction would slow. So a big enough chunk of magnesium would take a very long time to react completely. On the other hand, a strip or wire of magnesium would probably react completely and very quickly. Of course, it's hard to say for sure without an experiment. Looks like a job for science! ",
