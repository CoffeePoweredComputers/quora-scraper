            "answer_text": "Science doesn\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d much of anything\u2026.. Leave that to the mathematicians. Science deals with the observable and testable, and offers the best possible explanation of how things work. In regards to your question, there is no evidence whatever of an \u201cintelligent world\u201d that would somehow \u201crule the universe\u201d. If anyone is ruling us, they haven\u2019t bothered to tell us about it. As to the \u201ctheory of everything\u201d\u2026. Again, people misunderstand this. The \u201cGrand Unified Theory\u201d is just the attempt to theoretically reconcile the four forces of the universe\u2026.. Electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. At present, we can reconcile Electromagnetism and the nuclear forces, but not Gravity. But that\u2019s all it is\u2026 Not \u201cEveryhting\u201d\u2026. Just the four forces. ",

We see no logical or rational reasons to contemplate this line of inquiry. Therefore, no scientists are pursuing these ideas until, and if, compelling reasons materialise. Sorry, we just have to live with this current chaotic, non-predestined universe :):) ",

            "answer_text": "Cant control a universe in any way that could relate to a human life. Information propagates too slowly for any kind of centralized universal overseers to receive and react to real time events happening billions of light years away. Which is the flaw in all the theorized deities and creators that make or designed the universe, and also \u201clord\u201d over it. There is no physics which facilitates any of that being possible. ",
