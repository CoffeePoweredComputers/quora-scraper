            "answer_text": "BLACK HOLES What the common term \" BLACK HOLE \" is referring to is a \" HOLE \" at the center of a Galaxy which has a gravitation intensity so strong that nothing can escape. That is wrong. At the center of Galaxies the \" CORE STAR (S) \" do not emit enough light be seen against the brightness of it's surroundings. I prefer to call them \" GALACTIC CORE STARS \". Thy are not black at any time of their existence. There may also be circumstances where the galactic core is a formation with no firm boundaries, just a jumble of gravity, energy, and matter be pulled in all directions by the gravitational forces surrounding it. Some people have related the look and formation of Galaxies to \" TORNADO\u2019S, HURRICANES, CYCLONES \" with a \" CALM EYE \" at their center. They conclude that the \" CALM EYE \" they think lies at the core of Galaxies to be a \" BLACK HOLE \". However, Galaxies are based on gravitation, and there is \" NO \" calm eye at their core. Carbon and iron comprise the major portion of a star's surface after has used up all or most of it's available fuel. \" MOST \" of the electromagnetic spectrum would be absorbed, and not be reflected or radiated from most of the surface. However, every type of energy known and matter has been detected being ejected from the poles. There may also be circumstances where the galactic core is a formation with no firm boundaries, just a jumble of gravity, energy, and matter be pulled in all directions by the gravitational forces surrounding it. The \" HOTTER \" something gets, the greater is the intensity of energy. Like a carbon filament in a light bulb - ( i.e. it glows. ) - taking into account the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The gravitational intensity at the core of galaxy's would \" NOT \" be strong enough to retain all of the energy types being generated - keep in mind gravity is the weakest of the forces. The energies surrounding a \" CORE STAR (S) \" at the center of galaxies would have an energy buildup extending millions of miles. That is far beyond gravity's ability to retain it - ( i.e. the energy escapes. ). Back to the color of a Galaxy Core Star (s) - the color would be bright and probably white or close to it depending on it's composition, but not black. http://www.creationoftheuniverse.org/ For more info on how the process started.

            "answer_text": "Maybe, we can't adequately model what happens in a black hole so it's not really possible to answer. It also depends on what you mean by \u201cinside a black hole\u201d. I interpret that to mean the space beyond the event horizon, but the space just beyond the event horizon isn't really any different from the space just outside of the event horizon. Space gets weirder the further in you go and, when you get to the very centre, our models completely fail. That's what's meant by the term \u201csingularity\u201d, a failure of the mathematical models we use to describe the Universe, it's not an actual, physical thing. People, including me, will talk about the singularity as if it was a physical thing because most of us understand that it's shorthand for \u201cthe point at the centre of a black hole where our mathematical models of the Universe fail\u201d. That the models fail in that regime suggest that they're incomplete and their results have diverged from reality at some point before the point they fail completely. It's sort of like how, if your car's engine suddenly seizes up and you skid to a stop, the problem with the engine actually existed long before it failed completely (there was likely a \u201ccheck engine\u201d light that you ignored). The models are not, however, completely wrong, in fact, they have been extensively tested and agree with reality as much as we've been able to determine so far. ",
