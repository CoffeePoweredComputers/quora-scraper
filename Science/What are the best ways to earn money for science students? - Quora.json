            "answer_text": "Since you have specifically mentioned that you are a science student, I presume you would want to do some work which is associated with science. Hence here is my pick 1. Helping students for projects and other technical activities.  Yes, there is always a market for this among the majority of the Indian Students. By helping them or creating them a project out of your science learning,  it would be really helpful for them and you can see some money too. To know how much to charge walk into a couple of project centres spread across all educational hubs and know the rates. Give a 25 percent discount and there you go !  2. Tutions Again sticking with science you can start to take Tutions for students in school level upto bachelor's level. This might seem to be a boring job, but the scope for this job is ever increasing. I have even heard a lady from Chennai taking Tutions for 5th class boy in Qatar. So its you to decide on going online or offline.  3. Share market  I think you know what this is all about. But be aware, you are never gonna be a millionaire by investing in shares, and this belief will one day make you a millionaire. 4. Content Writing  Get in touch with content writers and blog writing companies. Apply for a technical blogger freelancing opportunity. If you have good writing skills, your purse will surely start ringing.  I hope my idea would be helpful for you. ",

I think if you are good at writing then content writing is one, affiliate sales is another, it just needs one to be creative to match his available time and the work he wants to do. ",
