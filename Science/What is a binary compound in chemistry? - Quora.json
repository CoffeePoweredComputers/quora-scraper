            "answer_text": "In chemistry, a binary compound is something consisting of precisely two elements. An element is a type of substance that can't be further divided into simpler substances through chemical methods. Any of those boxes on a periodic table of elements represent an element. A few examples of chemical elements are hydrogen, oxygen, and iron. This means that a binary compound will be composed of two different chemical elements. In a binary compound, there may be only one of each element. We see this with sodium chloride (salt) NaCl, which has one sodium (Na) and one chlorine (Cl). Still, we see some binary compounds that may have more than one of each element, like nitrous oxide N 2 O that has two nitrogen (N) and one oxygen (O). N 2 O is also called laughing gas, and you'll probably encounter it if you ever have to make a trip to the dentist to get your wisdom teeth removed. From acids to salts, binary compounds are always nearby. ",
