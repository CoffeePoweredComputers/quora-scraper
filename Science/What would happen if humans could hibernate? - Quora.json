            "answer_text": "Humans do hibernate. It\u2019s just that they kind of ignore it and try to pull through it regardless. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) - Symptoms and causes Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird how the symptoms of hibernation coincide with the symptoms of SAD? Losing interest in activities you once enjoyedHaving low energyFeeling sluggish or agitatedOversleepingAppetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydratesWeight gainTiredness or low energyNobody ever told mother nature that the industrial revolution destroyed autumn. We all have to go to work 5 days a week 12 months a year and being sluggish and depressed is only an inconvenience to the global military industrial complex. It doesn\u2019t help us survive the winter by hibernating in a society that wants products all year long. Because of the way the people work, people feel like we\u2019ve been working all year since, like, forever, but I assure you, when most people farmed, you used to just stay in, stoke the fire and gossip.

            "answer_text": "If we hibernated then like other hibernating animals we would have accelerated our all activities such as producing crops, completing housing projects, school sessions, producing offsprings etc. during non-hibernating period. We would have eaten too much before ubdergoing hibernation, and probably died of obesity or heart related illnesses or maybe not due to different kind of adaptations. Our progress and development would have happened in phases. We might have gone through almost stand still phase, during hibernation, and accelerated phase during active time. ",

The forest would be plenty of trees and floods and mud slides could be alleviated. The electricity and energy crisis would not happen. Men would not think of waging wars. The politicians would not exercise corruption for six months. A lot better world if we could hibernate. ",
