            "answer_text": "YES! Yes! Yes! You say you are not good at math. Well, maybe you aren't \u2014-YET\u2014but you almost certainly think this because your school experiences so far hasn't been very wonderful, or you have this idea that being \u201cgood\u201d at math and science is like being tall or being short. Being a genius at math \u2014 well, that's probably mostly like being tall. So maybe you'll never be a Gauss or a Ramanujan. Being good at math\u2014 well, that's different. You can almost certainly become good at it if you allow yourself to be. You are probably like the overwhelming majority of normally bright people who have to learn it, using a process called \u201cinstruction\u201d, aided and directed by \u201cteachers\u201d, and accomplished by \u201csolving problems.\u201d It takes effort and diligence. You can't cram it in at the last minute, and you have to keep using what you learned before. With a good teacher, a decent curriculum, and above all doing enough problem sets\u2014 doing them every day, not climbing a whole mountain in a day but climbing it little by little, one day of homework at a time\u2014 you will find that what you learn will start to grow exponentially. The more you learn the more times you'll find a new math idea surprises you when you understand it, and then again when you use it to learn something else. And when you do get to the mountaintop\u2014 the view there is incomparable. And there will be higher mountains to climb after that. And you will never climb them all. But that is OK. You can be a good climber even if you never try to climb K2. You are at the age where your brain is at its most powerful in terms of suppleness and at the beginning of the decade where increasing knowledge and sophistication will be able to take fullest advantage of its power. Frankly your brain works better than mine \u2014 mine is 60 years old, and although I can still use it, it doesn't leap and run and dance like it did in my twenties. Your biggest problem right now is probably your own insecurities and the mistake that only people who find a task inherently easy can ever hope to do well at it. Look: IT IS OK TO FIND IT HARD. It is hard! But you can learn it\u2026 There is no reason, though, to make it any harder than necessary, and here I think our educational system is often not only bad but actually perverse. Of course, if you don't want to work at it, then yes, spend your time playing video games or hanging out with your friends or eating potato chips or whatever else you find easy to do right off the bat. And if that's your life and it's for you, go for it. But if you don't work on the math and science now, and wait until you are 30 or so, it's going to be a lot lot harder, and you'll miss out on that wonderful exhilarating experience of feeling your mind bloom underneath you, and really really seeing, for yourself, what it maybe felt like to Newton when he realized how to calculate how something could change in an instant, and why the planets curve through space the way they do, and how energy never goes away but only changes shape.
