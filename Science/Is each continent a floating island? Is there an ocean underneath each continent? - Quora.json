            "answer_text": "In a sense the answer is yes although the correct answer is that although the earth's crust is solid with large liquid oceans the continents rest on large plates which in turn rest on the outer core. The boundaries of the plates move very slowly and so over a long period of time individual parts of the continents move relative to each other. As an example India is slowly moving North and the Himalayan mountain range has been formed by this movement. This movement is measured in millimetres per year.
