            "answer_text": "The work done is in the moving parts possessed the energy that is kinetic energy it he kinetic energy can be Express the particle possessed through it virtually motion When the particle across to each other then the temperature increased therefore the increasing in velocity of the particle that why the cause of kinetic energyWhen the particle collapsed with the wall of vessels the it increased its momentum a d pressure therefore it also increased in velocity of the particles therefore it is also caused of kinetic energyI hope this topic will you useful for your concerns topics Thanks you ",

            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy of an object is the half of the product of the mass of the object and square of it's velocity. Now the change in potential energy can be said as kinetic energy. Here potential energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its position. ",
