            "answer_text": "The essence of Darwinian evolution and natural selection is that species change over time as a result of random mutations in the heritable physical and behavioral traits and those changes which are better adaptable in a given environment are transmitted in the species across generations. Over a period of time, changes in a number of traits pile up in a given species to such an extent that they differ from the parent species altogether thus appearing as a new species. The genetic differences in that new species will be so remarkable that they can no longer pair up with the parent species. This encompasses the essence of origin of species and it represents macroevolution. Thus, a species, by definition, is represented by a group of similar organisms which are capable of exchanging genes by mating to give birth to fertile individuals to continue its progeny. For example, a horse and donkey are different species and will not mate normally \u2013 and, even if they are made to mate, they give birth to mules which are sterile and are incapable of continuing progeny. Microevolution represents a change in the gene frequency in a given species in a relatively short period of time, and these changes are so small that they do not give rise to a new species. Perhaps the best example we may observe in nature is the \u2018evolutionary\u2019 change that occur in dogs around the world: Every dog from a Pomeranian to German Shepard to bulldog to mongrels belong to the same species and so can interbreed effectively, but we have seen newer and newer varieties of dogs (naturally bred as in mongrels, or artificially bred as in purebred dogs) which appear different from parent but are capable of mating with each other effectively. Another example is that of Bt cotton in which microevolution was induced artificially (by introducing genes of Bacillus thuringiensis) so that it has genes which can produce endotoxins to combat pathogens. Now we have a way too many such examples of \u2018genetically modified\u2019 organisms in the recent decades with the advent of recombinant DNA technology! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMicro-evolution\u201d is the minimum corporal transformation that becomes perceptible and apparent, being a manifestation of a \u201cgenetic micro-change\u201d. As you would have noticed already, we have reserved the term \u201cevolution\u201d for the domain of physical expression of a genetic change. In this terminology, the \u201cgenetic change\u201d would bring about \u201cphysical evolution\u201d. The contrary \u2013 i.e. saying that genetic evolution would bring about physical change \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be proper. A \u201cminimal physical transformation\u201d implying \u201cgenetic micro-change\u201d could be in the form of a type of \u201cmeme\u201d. Is meme really a part of the evolutionary process? What is evolution? What is the mechanism of evolution? How dose meme become a micro-evolution? Are all memes evolutionary? Aren\u2019t there contrary types of memes? Let\u2019s answer them in steps. Firstly, let\u2019s think over what evolution is. Evolution as a corporal transformation should raise the \u201coverall ability\u201d of the body. Why? Ability would include all instances of abilities \u2013 emotional, intellectual and physical. Physical abilities would include: (i) metabolic abilities for internal maintenance and management of the body and (ii) proactive abilities. Locomotion and manipulation could be examples of the latter type of corporal abilities. Physical abilities are activated by intellectual abilities and the latter, in turn, are initiated by emotional abilities. Intuition, intention etc would also pass for emotional abilities. Thus, a physical change to be acquired has to be emotionally commensurable. The first requirement of emotion would be its own amelioration. That is basically the amelioration of personal ability in general (overall amelioration). That is how evolutionary physical transformation would be concomitant with increase in overall ability. Will this physical transformation beautify the entity or organism? Is beauty a criterion of evolution? Let\u2019s settle this issue. A cube can\u2019t roll on the ground much even if thrown forcefully. You can say that it is less able in the aspect of maintaining its momentum while meeting surface friction. A sphere can roll on the ground very well. With respect to that particular ability, the sphere may be deemed to be more evolved. Would the evolved shape be more beautiful? The logic is simple. If evolution has to be commensurable to emotion, the evolved status would be aesthetically higher from emotional viewpoint. Aesthetics would be the function of emotion. What would be the state of body economy i.e. economy of corporal organization? Is it related to aesthetics? Apparently, roundness is relatable to both body economy and aesthetics through emotion\u2019s \u201crequisition of ability\u201d. Organization means physical economization. So, we come to a point when ability, body economy and body aesthetics become concomitant and collateral. We shall now move on to other corporal attributes. Would the internal maintenance and management of body, i.e. body metabolism, call for moment-to-moment deliberation or would it call for automation? If you ruminate a little over the complexity of body, you will know that moment-to-moment deliberation isn\u2019t just possible in metabolic matters. Automation would have to be there at the first opportunity. This is a functional imperative. What about the building up of body complexity and its continuity? Shouldn\u2019t there be an arrangement for \u201cheritability of body\u201d? Yes, heritability is another personal imperative. Metabolic automation and heritability together call for \u201cgenetics\u201d. Genes would be minimal-sized consolidated memories and controls. As such, these would be basically emotion-bits with subjectivity instilled into them. Future would be created inside the genetics. It would be created as \u201cpotential forms\u201d named \u201cgoal\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d which will be turned into reality by individual\u2019s proactiveness and a supporting metabolism. The body would be in the meantime transformed to suit the goal-facilitating acts. The forwardly process will begin with a genetic change. When small, it may be described as \u201cgenetic micro-change\u201d. It could involve only few dna-s. But that\u2019s the most difficult thing to achieve. It needs \u201crealization\u201d. Just as to add your height to a tree\u2019s, you would have to stand upon its tip, a gene-changing realization would call for peak-thinking or critical thinking on a relevant issue. That \u201crealization\u201d begotten of critical and relevant thinking dents genetics and that it is the ultimate cause of corporal evolution is yet to be fully appreciated. Most of the modern-looking world is still busy in regressive thinking that would take \u201cforced adaptation\u201d as the cause of evolution. \u201cIntuitive goal-designing\u201d, \u201cemotive adaptation\u201d and the consequential \u201cascending evolution\u201d may be paraphrased as \u201cintentional evolution\u201d or \u201ctranscendental evolution\u201d or \u201cdream evolution\u201d. Forced adaptation brings about corporal distortion. Contrary to ascending evolution, it is \u201ccrawling adaptation\u201d. Once you know the cause of evolution, you soon become aware of the fact that every small new realization would trigger inside your genetics a genetic micro-change. If the realization is sustained through commensurable proactive acts, the genetic micro-change sustains and begins to influence metabolism and physique. As we have noted earlier, a \u201cmeme\u201d may be seen as an instance of micro-evolution provided it isn\u2019t a behavioral, cultural and corporal distortion. Automated utterance of \u201cthank you\u201d, having been a product of the realization of the idea of \u201cgratitude\u201d, will pass for a micro-evolution. Automated utterance of a dirty slang as a mark of blind intolerance, i.e. as a mark of non-realization, will pass for a corporal micro-distortion. ",
