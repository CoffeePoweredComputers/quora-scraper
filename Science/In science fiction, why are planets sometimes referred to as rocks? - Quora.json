            "answer_text": "Because they are.  (Mercury, a rather hot rock of metals and silicate) Planets aren\u2019t really all that special when you think about it. They\u2019re a bunch of stuff which, if they\u2019re big enough, start to collapse into themselves under their own gravity, and therefore become spherical. Since ancient times we\u2019ve known there was stuff in the sky - the sun and the moon are pretty obvious on a day-to-day basis. Observers also noticed a couple of other things - things like Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn which were first thought of as wandering stars.  (The Nebra Sky disc, a bronze-age representation of the objects in the sky) Even back BCE they knew that the Sun was different from those other objects, but it wasn\u2019t until Copernicus (1473\u20131543) that it started to be realized that the Moon was different than Mars or Saturn. Then Galileo started discovering objects that seemed to orbit around Jupiter. Other astronomers discovered objects orbiting Saturn and Uranus and all of the sudden we had upwards of 16 planets. Some of them were rather big - Ganymede is about as voluminous as Mercury. 16 was a bitunruly, and in the 1700s it was decided that in order to be a planet an object had to orbit a star (and not, another planet).  (Galileo looking at Europa from Europe) So at that point, when we thought of a planet, we thought of a thing that orbits the Sun. In the 1800s we started discovering a bunch more rocks orbiting the sun - objects like Ceres. By 1855 we had discovered 15 objects in what we now know as the asteroid belt, lumping them together saving us from having 22 planets. By 1930 we had discovered Pluto and had the 9 planet system you probably grew up with. Sure there were a couple almost planets - Chiron was discovered and then called a Centaur; Charon was discovered and lumped in as part of a \u201cbinary planet\u201d with Pluto. Life was good. And then we kept on discovering stuff. Most devastatingly (to my childhood conception of the solar system) - the 2005 discovery of Eris.  (Eris and Dysnomia as captured by the Hubble Space Telescope) Eris orbits the sun. It\u2019s big - bigger than Pluto. It isn\u2019t in the asteroid belt. So, it must be a planet, right? The same team discovered Makemake (which is big enough to have its own moon), and another discovered Haumea. We were back on the path towards having 15+ planets.  (Haumea, which appears to spin so fast it distorts it\u2019s own shape) A line had to be drawn in the sand. The International Astronomical Union met and decided to make a few definitions: (1) A \u201cplanet\u201d is a celestial body that: (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. (2) A \"dwarf planet\" is a celestial body that: (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape (c) has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite. (3) All other objects, except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as \"Small Solar System Bodies\". This was, of course, the decision that removed Pluto from the list of planets. It no longer qualified.  (Unless, of course, you believe Pluto\u2019s re-designation as a dwarf planet to be a conspiracy because Pluto has been shrinking) What you\u2019ll notice is that there isn\u2019t some magical component that planets have to differentiate them from moons. It\u2019s not that planets have oceans, and moons don\u2019t; or that planets are made from dirt while asteroids are made from rock. They\u2019re made from the same stuff, just different amounts of it and with different trajectories. At the end of the day they\u2019re all just rocks. Which is why sci fi characters, proving that they\u2019ve been around the block, refer to planets as such. ",

            "answer_text": "Like how the Earth is sometimes called \u201cThe third rock from the sun?\u201d Hey! Cool name, someone oughtta make a TV show called that. Oh\u2026wait. LOL But seriously, yeah, there are basically two types of planets, smaller, denser, rocky, or terrestrial planet's, like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars\u2026and then those larger, lighter, less-dense \u201cgas giants\" such as Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Those rocky planets tend to orbit closer to their star, or Sun, while the gas giants are found further out in much larger orbits. The gravity pull from the Sun plays a huge part in determining a planet's composition or makeup. Makes sense if you think about it: closer in mean a more gravitational pull, which helps those planets \u201caccrete\" or cohese, while a more distant orbit means less contraction and thus more favorable conditions for non-accretion and lighter, more gaseous planets. So it's not just science fiction where the term \u201crock\" is used. It's just a sort of colloquial, or slang term that's steeped in real science. ",
