            "answer_text": "1. Combination (Synthesis) reaction A combination reaction, also known as a synthesis reaction, is a reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a single new substance. Combination reactions can also be called synthesis reactions .The general form of a combination reaction is: A + B \u2192 AB One combination reaction is two elements combining to form a compound. Solid sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas to product solid sodium chloride. 2Na(s)+Cl2(g)\u21922NaCl(s) 2. Decomposition reaction A decomposition reaction is a reaction in which a compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. The general form of a decomposition reaction is: AB \u2192 A + B Most decomposition reactions require an input of energy in the form of heat, light, or electricity. Binary compounds are compounds composed of just two elements. The simplest kind of decomposition reaction is when a binary compound decomposes into its elements. Mercury (II) oxide, a red solid, decomposes when heated to produce mercury and oxygen gas. 2HgO(s)\u21922Hg(l)+O2(g) A reaction is also considered to be a decomposition reaction even when one or more of the products is still a compound. A metal carbonate decomposes into a metal oxide and carbon dioxide gas. For example, calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. CaCO3(s)\u2192CaO(s)+CO2(g) 3. Displacement reaction A single-replacement reaction is a reaction in which one element replaces a similar element in a compound. The general form of a single-replacement (also called single-displacement) reaction is: A + BC \u2192 AC + B In this general reaction, element A is a metal and replaces element B, also a metal, in the compound. When the element that is doing the replacing is a nonmetal, it must replace another nonmetal in a compound, and the general equation becomes: Y + XZ \u2192 XY + Z Y is a nonmetal and replaces the nonmetal Z in the compound with X. Magnesium is a more reactive metal than copper. When a strip of magnesium metal is placed in an aqueous solution of copper (II) nitrate, it replaces the copper. The products of the reaction are aqueous magnesium nitrate and solid copper metal. Mg(s)+Cu(NO3)2(aq)\u2192Mg(NO3)2(aq)+Cu(s) 4. Double displacement reaction A double-replacement reaction is a reaction in which the positive and negative ions of two ionic compounds exchange places to form two new compounds. The general form of a double-replacement (also called double-displacement) reaction is: AB + CD \u2192 AD + CB In this reaction, A and C are positively-charged cations, while B and D are negatively-charged anions. Double-replacement reactions generally occur between substances in aqueous solution. In order for a reaction to occur, one of the products is usually a solid precipitate, a gas, or a molecular compound such as water. A precipitate forms in a double-replacement reaction when the cations from one of the reactants combine with the anions from the other reactant to form an insoluble ionic compound. When aqueous solutions of potassium iodide and lead (II) nitrate are mixed, the following reaction occurs. 2KI(aq)+Pb(NO3)2(aq)\u21922KNO3(aq)+PbI2(s) 5. Combustion reaction A combustion reaction is a reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. Combustion reactions must involve O2 as one reactant. The combustion of hydrogen gas produces water vapor (see figure below). 2H2(g)+O2(g)+2H2O(g) Notice that this reaction also qualifies as a combination reaction. Many combustion reactions occur with a hydrocarbon, a compound made up solely of carbon and hydrogen. The products of the combustion of hydrocarbons are always carbon dioxide and water. Many hydrocarbons are used as fuel because their combustion releases very large amount of heat energy. Propane (C3H8) is a gaseous hydrocarbon that is commonly used as the fuel source in gas grills. C3H8(g)+5O2(g)\u21923CO2(g)+4H2O(g) ",

            "answer_text": "There are five types of chemical reactions:  Combination/Synthesis Reactions: two or more substances combine to form a new compound       (A+X->AX). Includes, but is not limited to, the reactions of elements with Oxygen and Sulfur; the reactions of metals with Halogens; and Synthesis reactions with Oxides.Decomposition Reactions: a single compund undergoes a reaction that produces two or more singular substances (AX->A+X).Single Replacement Reactions: when a substance in a compund is replaced by a substance outside of the compound (A+BX->B+AX). Possible replacements include: metals by another metal; Hydrogen in water by metal; Hydrogen in an acid by a metal; and Halogens by more active Halogens.Double Replacement Reactions: when ions of two compounds exchange places in aqueous solutions to form two new compunds (AX+BY->AY+BX). One of the compounds formed is usually a precipitate, an insoluble gas that bubbles out of the solution, or a molecular compound (usually water).Combustion Reactions: when reactive elements  combine with oxygen, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of light and heat (e.g. the burnin of wood, natural gas, and gasoline). The formula begins with \"hydrocarbon + Oxygen -> [products]\"",
