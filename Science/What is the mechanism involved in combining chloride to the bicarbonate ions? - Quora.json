            "answer_text": "I assume this question refers to the practice of adding sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride to some purified bottled water products, primarily for taste. The chloride and bicarbonate to not chemically react in water under normal conditions. Chemical reactions in water solution can be verified if there is a gas produced, a color change, exothermic or endothermic heat transfer (not the physical processes of melting or freezing), or a solid precipitated from the solution. The water becomes a mixture of sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, and chloride ions when these salts are added, without a chemical reaction involved. ",
