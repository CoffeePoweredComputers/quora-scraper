            "answer_text": "Stated another way, no two particles (or wave packets if you are using quantum field theory) can occupy the same state. It applies only to spin 1/2 particles (aka Fermions). Bosons (spin 1, e.g. photons) can superpose and occupy the same space at the same energy level. The exact reason for this is not clear to me, though I\u2019ve read explanations. Another point that is mysterious is that there is not an obvious way to calculate a force from this, but physicists have some trick procedure to do it. The Pauli exclusion has to be overcome to collapse a neutron star to a black hole. I wonder if it is really over come or new energy states appear under pressure? Someone please give a simple explanation. Thx. ",
