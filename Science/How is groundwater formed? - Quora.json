            "answer_text": "Groundwater forms when water from the surface seeps into the ground. This process is called recharge. The water is able to move underground through the rock and soil due to connected pore spaces. These pore spaces can be tiny spaces within particles in the rock or soil, fractures in the bedrock, or dissolved cavities in limestone, like caves. During recharge, water is pulled downward into the earth by gravity through two zones. The upper zone, called the zone of aeration, is where a mixture of water and air fills the pore spaces. Below the zone of aeration is the zone of saturation, where the pore spaces are completely filled by water. The upper boundary of the zone of saturation is known as the water table. When rain falls or snow melts, some of the water evaporates, some is transpired by plants, some flows overland and collects in streams, and some infiltrates into the pores or cracks of the soil and rocks. The first water that enters the soil replaces water that has been evaporated or used by plants during a preceding dry period. Between the land surface and the aquifer water is a zone that hydrologists call the unsaturated zone. In this unsaturated zone, there usually is at least a little water, mostly in smaller openings of the soil and rock; the larger openings usually contain air instead of water. After a significant rain, the zone may be almost saturated; after a long dry spell, it may be almost dry. Some water is held in the unsaturated zone by molecular attraction, and it will not flow toward or enter a well. Similar forces hold enough water in a wet towel to make it feel damp after it has stopped dripping.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ultimately, groundwater comes from the rain. It is often not the rain that is falling locally and soaking into the ground although that could contribute in areas like where I live that has lots of cracked limestone, which is very porous, right at the surface. In many places, the clay is pretty impervious to infiltrated water so the ground water has to come from rain that fell many hundreds of kilometres away, like in the mountains. That means it may take hundreds and thousands of years for the water to migrate through the ground to where it is now. ",
