            "answer_text": "You can be certain it's not. When physicists first began studying the structure of atoms, the Bohr Model was popular. It treated electrons like planets and the nucleus as the Sun. And it worked well for hydrogen - and nothing else. Even with hydrogen there were problems. First, physicists had to postulate that electrons orbited at set distances and no others, unlike planets. Second, if you force electrons into a curving path, they emit radiation. The electrons should lose energy and spiral into the nucleus. And physicists had to postulate that, for some reason, they didn\u2019t. Forget you ever heard about the planetary model. It\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s a shame it worked so well for hydrogen because we still have terms like orbit and spin. At least, when physicists talk about quarks having flavor, color and charm, there\u2019s no danger of people thinking they literally taste like chocolate, are blue, or flirt. Electrons form orbitals around the nucleus. These are wave-like structures, like this:  There are lots of illustrations of orbitals by themselves. Here\u2019s an attempt to show what they all look like in an atom. This is argon. There\u2019s an inner orbital with just two electrons, another with a spherical orbital with two electrons, then three lobes, each with two electrons, then an outer shell that repeats the structure again. So where are the electrons? Everywhere in the orbital, all the time. How can they all be in the same place? Picture a concert hall. Where are the violin notes? Everywhere in the hall, all the time. Where are the trumpet notes? Everywhere in the hall, all the time. Where are the flute notes? Everywhere in the hall, all the time. All at the same time. The planetary model of electrons around an atom is exactly analogous to imagining little visible notes drifting through the air from the orchestra to your ear. So there is no empty space in atoms. Also, there\u2019s something called Pauli Exclusion that prevents particles from occupying the same space if they have identical quantum properties. Try to pass one atom through another, and Pauli Exclusion won\u2019t let you make two identical orbitals overlap. Why? For the moment, it just is. Time has been described as God\u2019s way of keeping everything from happening all at once. Pauli Exclusion can be considered God\u2019s way of keeping everything from happening all in the same place. ",
