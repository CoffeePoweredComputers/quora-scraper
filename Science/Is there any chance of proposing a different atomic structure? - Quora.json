            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a chance but the probability of proposing a different atomic structure is very very small. If a better version of the prevailing atomic structure is proposed, then there is a chance of proposing a different atomic structure. The probability is less as the prevailing atomic structure satisfies most of the theories preposted by scientists, but nothing is impossible and even the prevailing atomic structure is drawn by assumptions and assumptions may be wrong. In future if anybody find a microscope which is capable of viewing atom there may be a big change in field of chemistry if the prevailing atomic structure differs from the original structure. Nothing is impossible and anything can happen in future so there is a chance for anything to happen in future. ",

            "answer_text": "Far to far. It does not seem to be. And even those days , new elements were discovered , decade by decade and there were many elements whose properties were known. Some elements properties were matching each other. There was some relation. So, there was an urge to arrange these elements in a systematic form so that reading there physical and chemical properties get easy. For this many scientists came front , like Mendeleev, Moseley , Lavoisier, Newlands , D\u00f6bereiner , Lother Meyer, Glenn T, to attempt the formation of periodic table. But Mosley's periodic law was very much accepted, better and correct form of Mendeleev's law. Then after according to atomic number and electronic configuration the modern periodic law states. This atomic structure was too correct and reliable , and efficient and able to understand many physical and chemical properties of different elements. Now, tell me can this law be changed. Never. No better law or structure or periodic table can anyone get than this. This is final and Ultimate. This is not gonna change anymore. Hope you understood!! Thank you. ",
