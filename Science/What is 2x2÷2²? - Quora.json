            "answer_text": "Answer: 1 How/Why? Order of operations dictates that we solve equations by addressing Parentheses\u2021, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, then Addition/Subtraction in that order\u2020. This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS. So let\u2019s take this step-by-step. Original equation:Operations in equationMultiplication/DivisionExponentsSince Exponents come first in PEMDAS, we start there.We can now rewrite the equation replacing  with :Next up is Multiplication and Division. Since we have both present in the problem, we move left to right.Part I: Updated equation: Part II: And thus we get our answer of .If you want to see it all together\u2026 \u2020If there are multiple occurrences of an operation in an equation, we move from left to right in those occurrences until we\u2019re ready to move on to the next operation in the order.) \u2021Brackets is more accurate (and is often seen) but for now let\u2019s just leave it at parentheses. In the case of brackets, the order of operations is abbreviated as BEMDAS. ",
