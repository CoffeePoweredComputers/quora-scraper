            "answer_text": "It depends on the university and the country. In England, a PhD is typically awarded for a thesis and oral examination of the thesis, usually followed by implementation of corrections to the thesis, the requirements for which are specified during or just after the oral exam. It's often done soon after a Masters, which is done soon after a Bachelors, so a fairly large proportion of PhDs are awarded at the start of one's academic career. Whereas a DSc is awarded for a portfolio of work, (in some cases submitted together with an over-arching critique of that portfolio), and thus is more likely to be awarded later in an academic's career. Nominally, a PhD is a doctorate in philosophy, but is typically awarded for pretty much any subject. There are some who argue that philosophy of knowledge always form part of these studies, regardless of the subject. I occasionally use this line to try to inspire students, myself. A DSc is a doctorate in science, and is not awarded for literature, law, divinity, or music, each of which has its own dedicated higher doctorate. The DSc is a higher doctorate than a PhD, in England. In some other countries, they're equivalent. Both get the honorific title doctor. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read the three answers for this question, and they pretty much provided the differentiation between the two degrees. Here is my take in answering the question. In simple term, there are two major types of doctorate, academic research or professional. A doctor of philosophy, Ph.D., or in England D. Phil, is in my thinking the highest level of research doctoral degree. In addition to demonstratable innovation in a specific field, other required skills are in research methodologies, statistics, history of science, etc. In the old days, candidate for a Ph.D. Must be fluent in a foreign language so that this person could peruse books and journals in other languages to further his or her study. In recent years, the language requirement is replaced in a large number of universities. I differentiate a research doctorate, Ph.D., compared to professional doctorates such as DSW, MD, DMD, etc. that are specific to some type of clinical or practical applications. ",
