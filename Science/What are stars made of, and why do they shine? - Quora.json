            "answer_text": "As mentioned stars form from dust and gas, but importantly this is an electrical process. Electricity provides the energy to ionise the hydrogen gas. This is a separation of positive and negative particles which is referred to as a plasma. Plasma discharges are well known phenomena although on Earth we rarely see more than sparks and lightning. This is a disadvantage to astronomers trying to understand the universe. They tend to avoid talking about plasma, instead the old Newtonian apple dropping gravity is force fit into all their theories. However there are researchers who looked faithfully at plasma and it's strange properties. The Plasma Universe, also known as the Electric Universe, sees every object in space as electrically connected, by plasma.[1] Galaxies are all interconnected by wispy plasma filaments which are effectively electric conductors. Stars are plasma z-pinches within the galactic power distribution network. So stars are made of plasma and shine because of the electricity that ionises them.[2] Footnotes[1] The Electric Universe Heresy - The Secular Heretic[2] Holy Moly! - The Thunderbolts Project\u2122",

            "answer_text": "Stars are mostly made up of light gases like Hydrogen & Helium. I think by shine you mean twinkling. Actually they do not twinkle. Several impurities are their on the way between the viewer\u2019s eyes & the star. So due to these impurities refraction is caused which makes us believe that the STAR IS TWINKLING. Hope it helps. Merci. ",
