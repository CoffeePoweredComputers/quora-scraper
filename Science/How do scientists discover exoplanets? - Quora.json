            "answer_text": "Over 3,500 exoplanets have been discovered so far, over 2000 of which are found by the Kepler Space Telescope, launched in 2009. Besides exoplanets, we have found rouge planets, sub-brown dwarfs and even exocomets. More than 97% of the exoplanets are detected by indirect methods. This means we don\u2019t exactly look for the exoplanet, we observe the impact it might have on, say the luminosity of the star, or the \u2018wobble\u2019 of a star due to the gravity of the exoplanet. Primarily, there are two indirect detection technique that have proved to be effective: Radial velocityAlso known as Doppler spectroscopy, this method relies on the fact that a star \u2018wobbles\u2019 or moves around in a small circle or ellipse, due to the gravity of its companion. It is important to note that planets do not orbit the star, rather they orbit the center of mass of the planetary system. These movements change the normal light spectrum of the star. If the star shifts towards Earth, its spectrum is slightly blue-shifted, whereas if it shifts away from Earth, the spectrum gets red-shifted. If these shifts are regular and periodic, it can be said that a body is in orbit around the star. The following GIF explains this in a concise manner:  AN exaggerated version of detection using radial velocity. Source: Giphy 2. Transit photometry This method is simple and elegant. You have a star emitting light. If a planet passes in front of the star, the light is dimmed. If the dimming of the light is regular and periodic, it is almost certainly an exoplanet. Discovery of several famous planetary systems, including the TRAPPIST system were done using this method.  Transit photometry. Source: The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia Unsurprisingly, machine learning plays a monumental role in the discovery of exoplanets using this method. Searching for periodic dims in brightness of a star can be expressed mathematically. An advantage of this method is that we can learn a lot about the planetary system by analyzing the dips in brightness. The dimming of the star\u2019s light is directly proportional to the size of the planet. As we accurately know the mass of the star, we can deduce the size of the planet easily.  I believe learning about this is important not only because it is interesting, but because it also gives us an idea of how insignificant we are in the universe. 3,621 exoplanets so far. Just imagine. There could be thousands of civilizations out there, doing the same thing that we are doing. Maybe their spacecrafts have found us yet and classified our planet as \u2018habitable\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Discovery Methods How have the currently known exoplanets been discovered? There are various methods and to get on the confirmed list, a planet needs to be observed with at least two methods.  Exoplanet discoveries by year and method: Radial velocity (blue), transit (green), direct imaging (red), microlensing (orange). Credits: Public Domain Radial velocity method A planet always revolves around a star (there are a few exceptions to this: Rogue planet) or rather the planets and the star revolves around each other in a two-body system. With the majority of the mass in the star we often simplify it to the planet revolving around the star. Nevertheless, since it actually is a two-body system with the two bodies revolving around each other, it means they have a common center of mass, which they are both orbiting and it is not the same as the center of the star.   Left: Two-body system with + as the center of mass which the planet and star are orbiting. Hence a planet will make its host star \u201cWobble\u201d (Public Doman Image). Right: The Doppler shift in light waves from a star that gets wobbled by an orbiting planet (Credits: NASA) This also means that the host star will have a slight orbital movement and a movement back and forth from our point of view in case one or more planets revolve around it. The movement will create a doppler shift in the starlight wavelengths reaching us. While the star is moving away from us, the wavelengths will be \u201credshifted\u201d since they are longer. While it\u2019s moving towards us, the wavelengths will be \u201cblueshifted\u201d since they get shorter. Measuring that movement of the host star is what we call the radial velocity method (we measure the movement in a velocity unit). This is how most of the exoplanets were discovered at the beginning of our exoplanet discovery journey, and is what can be seen as the red marks in the first plot in this article. The extent of this movement depends on the mass of the planet relative to the mass of the star. The more massive the planet compared to its host star the larger the movement of the star will be. If we take our own Solar system as an example, then the effect of Earth only moves our Sun 0.1 m/s over a period of one year, while the effect of Jupiter moves our sun 12.4 m/s over a period of 12 years (the orbital period of Jupiter). So you see, to be able to discover small planets, you need to be able to measure really, really small movements. This requires very sensitive instruments. Hence most of the first discovered planets where massive gas giants where the effects were bigger and easier to measure. The first official discovered exoplanet was 51 Pegasi b discovered in 1995, although there have been uncertain discoveries already in 1992. 51 Pegasi b is a Hot Jupiter orbiting so close to the star 51 Pegasi, that its orbital period is only about 4 days. Transit Method We can measure the light intensity from a star by measuring the flux: How much light passes through each square unit of our detector. When there is a planet transiting in front of the star, the light flux will fall since the planet is blocking a small fraction of the starlight. The flux will be highest just before the occultation of the planet behind the star since we\u2019ll have both the intensity of the starlight and the intensity of the reflected light from the planetary dayside (since the star-planet system is so far away, we cannot know which fraction is from the star and which is from the planet \u2014 all we can measure is the combined star-planet flux). If we see periodic highs and lows when measuring the light intensity from the star we might expect that the star has a planet orbiting it.  Flux light measured from a star-planet system depending on the position of the planet. Credits: Public Domain Of course, only planets that have an orbit plan that crosses our view line can be detected this way. Planets closer to the star will also have a higher effect since they will block more light. This is seen in the very first figure, where planets discovered by the transit method first are mostly planets with smaller separation. Also, you might have noticed that there was a huge amount of planets discovered by this method in 2014. This was the year that the scientist behind the Kepler telescope (K2 at that point) discovered a quicker way to confirm exoplanets, and discovered 715 new planets including smaller, Earth-size planets. Combing the transit method with spectroscopy we are able to do some estimates of the planetary atmosphere compositions. Specific molecules in the atmosphere have different absorptions and emission lines, which will be visible in the spectrum, where light from the star will partially pass through the planet's atmosphere. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds and therefor more missions are planned to gather more detailed information about planetary atmospheres.  Measuring the atmosphere composition by transit method and spectroscopy looking at absorption lines. Getting information from various telescopes working in different wavelength ranges might be necessary. Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech Imaging Methods Most planets have been discovered by the radial velocity or the transit method first. However, as we get more sensitive cameras, we have also been able to discover planets by direct imaging, that is directly photographing the planet. Only a few planets have been discovered like this, the first one in 2004.  First direct image of an exoplanet orbiting a brown dwarf 2M1207, taken in 2004. Credits: ESO Only large exoplanets with a large separation from the star can be discovered by this method so far. Microlensing The microlensing method takes advantage of the bending of light by gravity when passing by a high-mass object according to Einstein's relativity theory. The idea is, that when a star is passing in front of some other distant object, the gravity of the star will bend and magnify the light from the object behind. If the star has a planet orbiting, there will be a difference in how the light from the behind object is received \u2014 there will be a slight extra \u201cdip\u201d in the brightness of the magnified object behind the star. This is a one-time observation per specific object constellation since stars and objects will move relative to each other in the sky. Furthermore, we need certain conditions, such as just the right positions often in a short observation time-window, which is probably why not more planetary objects are discovered by this method.  What the future brings New telescopes and space missions are under construction and the search for Earth-like planets and maybe possible life outside our solar system is under rapid development. Most of our current exoplanets are discovered by the Hubble, Spitzer, and Kepler/K2 telescopes. \u201cHubble is the most important telescope in history after Galileo\u2019s first telescope. \u201c\u2014 Sandra Faber TESS is NASA's newest telescope in space, launched in 2018, searching for planets using the transit methods in an area 400 times larger than the Kepler telescope. They expect to find 30,000 more exoplanets in the two-year period that the mission will run.  Planned missions CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite) is ESAs upcoming space mission. It\u2019s planned to launch later this year (2019) and will be focusing on the more in-depth characterization of small Earth-Neptune size planets and their atmospheres. While we are already able to do some estimates of the planetary atmospheres using the transit method combined with spectroscopy of the measured light, CHEOPS will give us even more information about important molecules like carbon dioxide and methane, which emit light in the infrared spectrum. The ultimate goal would be to find a planet with a similar atmosphere to that of Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope is announced to be launched soon, hopefully in 2021, although the launch has already been rescheduled quite a few times. The JWST or just Webb Telescope will be able to do more detailed planetary atmosphere measurements. Just like CHEIOS, it will operate in the infrared wavelengths. Besides the planetary atmospheres, the JWST will study every phase of the history of our universe. \u201cIt will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.\u201d \u2014 About JWST/NASA. PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) space telescope is planned to be launch by ESA in 2026, with the primary focus on the discovery and investigation of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. The goal is to find habitable planets where liquid water can exist. ARIEL space telescope is planned to launch also by ESA in 2028 with the goal of observing around 1,000 already discovered exoplanets for further studying and characterizing the planets\u2019 chemical composition and thermal structures. We live in an exciting time! ",

Down side only about 1% of solar system are aligned correctly for this to work 2: Radial velocity: Planets make a star wobble. This can be seen as a change in wavelength in a star\u2019s spectra. This works for almost all planetary systems but it\u2019s really hard and takes 4m or 8m class telescopes, 3: Lensing. Detecting the double brightening when a star and then the planet creates a gravitational lens. Really hard, Been proven to work but has never had a first detection 4: Astrometry. Observing a star over decades and seeing how it moves. If it doesn\u2019t move is a straight line, you\u2019ve got a planet! Only works with nearby stars with big planets. No idea why anybody would use this! 5: Direct imaging. Build a massive telescope with adaptive optics , put in an occulting disk to block out the star and you can see the planet. This has been done, which I think is pretty amazing. ",
