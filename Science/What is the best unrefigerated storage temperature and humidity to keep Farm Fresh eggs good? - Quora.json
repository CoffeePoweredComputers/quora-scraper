            "answer_text": "\u201cStraight from the chicken.\u201d Unwashed is best. Industrial product of eggs in many places reduces the lifespan of the egg. Unwashed eggs to not need to be refrigerated! I don\u2019t even have a refrigerator since I am against using electricity for heating or cooling.\u201cWould eggs last longer the colder it is?\u201d Yes, generally colder is better.\u201cShould they be kept in Egg Stasis so they don't die and spoil?\u201d At room temperature , the egg can be in stasis for around 10 days before the zygote dies.\u201cDoes it matter if it is fertilized or not?\u201d I don\u2019t think it would.The way to test this would see to be: Take freshly laid eggs and place them in a location without direct sunlight. The spaceWrite down a description of the space. Temperature and humidity are important. Record the temperature of the space at a few times of the day to get a general idea. Record the humidity a couple times a day to get an idea of its range. Test eggsEach egg is it's own experiment. The eggs don't have to be tested all at once. Place Farm Fresh eggs on a tray. Date each one with a non-toxic marker? Wax pencil? After some days have gone by, pull an egg out and put it in water. If it floats, then mark down how many days old it is and whether it was good or bad. Don't reuse the egg since putting it in water can cause it to start to go bad. Try testing with older and older eggs keeping good records. Put this data in a spreadsheet and you can generate a scatter graph of how long it takes eggs to go bad at that humidity and temperature. By combining data from many locations we can see what the optimal temperature and humidity is to keep eggs without them going bad. ",
