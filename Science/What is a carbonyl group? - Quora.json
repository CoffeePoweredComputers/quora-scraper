            "answer_text": "In chemistry , A carbonyl group is a chemically organic functional group composed of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom --> [C=O] The simplest carbonyl groups are aldehydes and ketones usually attached to another carbon compound. These structures can be found in many aromatic compounds contributing to smell and taste. Source : The Carbonyl Group Also : The term carbonyl refers to the carbonyl functional group which is a divalent group consisting of a carbon atom with a double-bond to oxygen, C=O. Carbonyl also may refer to a compound formed by a metal with carbon monoxide (=CO). Bivalent radical CO is found in ketones, acids, and aldehydes. Many of the molecules involved in the senses of smell and taste involve aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups. The C=O entity is the carbonyl group, while a molecule that contains the group is called a carbonyl compound. Also Known As: carbonyl group, carbonyl functional group Carbonyl Example The metal compound nickel carbonate, [math]\\displaystyle Ni(CO)_4[/math], contains the CO carbonyl group.  Source : Carbonyl Definition in Chemistry The definition is similar in biology : Carbonyl group a group in which an oxygen atom is double-bonded to a carbon atom: O=C. The carbon atom then has two additional bonds to attach to the rest of the molecule. Organic molecules containing a carbonyl group are a very important, major group of compounds studied in the field of organic chemistry. Source : Carbonyl group - Biology-Online Dictionary ",

            "answer_text": "Carbonyl group, in organic chemistry, a divalent chemical unit consisting of a carbon (C) and an oxygen (O) atom connected by a double bond. The group is a constituent of carboxylic acids, esters, anhydrides, acyl halides, amides, and quinones, and it is the characteristic functional group (reactive group) of aldehydes and ketones. Carboxylic acids (and their derivatives), aldehydes, ketones, and quinones are also known collectively as carbonyl compounds. Because of a difference in the electron affinities of the carbon and oxygen atoms, the electron pairs that constitute the double bond are held closer to the oxygen atom than to the carbon atom; the electron-rich oxygen atom acquires a negative charge and the electron-deficient carbon atom a positive charge. Thus, molecules containing the carbonyl group are polar. Compounds containing a carbonyl group have higher melting and boiling points than hydrocarbons containing the same number of carbon atoms and are more soluble in polar solvents such as water. The carbonyl group can enter into a variety of chemical reactions; nucleophilic reagents (electron-rich reagents) are attracted to the carbon atom, whereas electrophilic reagents (electron-seeking reagents) are attracted to the oxygen atom. Aldehydes and ketones contain carbonyl groups attached to alkyl or aryl groups and a hydrogen atom or both. These groups have little effect on the electron distribution in the carbonyl group; thus, the properties of aldehydes and ketones are determined by the behaviour of the carbonyl group. In carboxylic acids and their derivatives, the carbonyl group is attached to one of the halogen atoms or to groups containing atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. These atoms do affect the carbonyl group, forming a new functional group with distinctive properties. For more information, you can also watch the below video.  ",
