            "answer_text": "condenser is an important component of any refrigeration system. In a typical refrigerant condenser, the refrigerant enters the condenser in a superheated state. It is first de-superheated and then condensed by rejecting heat to an external medium. The refrigerant may leave the condenser as a saturated or a sub-cooled liquid, depending upon the temperature of the external medium and design of the condenser. Now u may found the above definition hard to understand. so in simple words, it is that ugly wire system which we see at the back of refrigerator. the main purpose of it is to gt away with the heat which the refrigerant has accumulated while cooling ur stuff in fridge\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Condenser is an equipment which is used many industries to carry condensation of vapours. For example,in a thermal power plant condenser is used to condense the cooled steam leaving from the turbine. Condenser uses cooled water to condense the vapours. Cooled water is produced in a cooling tower and is pumped to condenser. When vapours are brought in contact with cooled water, temperature of vapours gets reduced as a result vapours gets condensed.
