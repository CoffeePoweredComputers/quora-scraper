            "answer_text": "The answer costs a lifetime of study. There are so many ways but they all depend on the material in question. Scanning electron microscope with X-ray energy dispersive detector is a start. Wavelength dispersive is better and that I also called microprobe. There is also Auger spectroscopy of contaminants on surfaces. Notice it is all big equipment and mostly X-ray. There are many more but it depends on how pure you want to go. Many methods destroy the sample. The above do not. How much more answer requires more data. ",

            "answer_text": "Apart from using high tech equipment true purity is difficult, but a trained eye will give a reasonable indication and would come from the shape , depth of colour and in the case of clear quartz its translucency . These three would give a fair indication of the quality and the high tech would be able to determine the best . Diamond cutters have an exceptional eye for quality having to make the best of gemstones to get the best out of the mineral and the best price when cut . ",
