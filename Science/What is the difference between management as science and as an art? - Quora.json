            "answer_text": "I would say it is similar to the way in which practicing medicine is both a science and an art. There is a great deal of knowledge required to do a good job, but without honing the art of observation, of pattern recognition, and above all, the art of working with actual human beings, then the medical practitioner can only do so much. The same is true of the manager. People are not machines, therefore anyone who works with people in any sphere must learn not only the facts, but also how to understand people, how to communicate with others, and how to motivate people to take positive actions.
