            "answer_text": "Mass attracts mass. This is a property of the universe which we call gravity. The earth is a significantly massive object, which means anything near the earth with mass (including water molecules) will tend to move toward it under the influence of gravity. Many people are confused by this. 1) If mass attracts mass, then why does water fall right off of my basketball when I dump a pitcher over it? 2) Why doesn\u2019t my little brother\u2019s head clonk into me whenever we stand next to each other? And 3) how is it that earth\u2019s gravity can hold down 353,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water, but can\u2019t keep a fruit fly on the ground or keep me from raising my arm over my head? The answer can be found in \u201cNewton's law of universal gravitation [which] states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\u201d (-Wikipedia)So the force of attraction is based in part on the product (meaning the multiplication) of their masses. So working backwards from question 3) let\u2019s consider the mass of the earth multiplied by the mass of 353,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water. Now let\u2019s consider the mass of the earth multiplied by the mass of a 1 milligram fruit fly. That\u2019s considerably different, which means the effect of gravity is considerably diminished for a fruit fly, or an arm, compared to an ocean. Which is why a fruit fly is able to make use of its tiny muscles and wings to swim around in the relatively dense air above it (it can\u2019t fly in a vacuum though. Wings won\u2019t help it then.) Gravity is also why we have evolved our relatively powerful musculoskeletal systems as well, which allow us to reach above our heads to pick apples, or swat fruit flies.Question 2) Your little brother weighs 80 lbs. You weigh 150 lbs. This is not enough mass to noticeably cause attraction, especially in organisms all but glued down to a planet of trillions and trillions of tons, supporting themselves vertically with constantly hard-working muscles and bones. If you put two people close together in freefall or deep space away from other objects, and ask them to hold still, you will eventually see that they bump into each other under the influence of their relatively weak gravity.Question 1) A basketball weighs 20 ounces. The earth the basketball is sitting upon weighs approximately a gazillion tons. Let\u2019s consider which mass would have more influence on the water that is poured over the basketball. If we consider carefully, we are likely to conclude that the earth will win that contest and the water will slide right off of the basketball and onto the earth.This is an inconvenient truth for those who support the flat earth hypothesis because gravity cannot coexist with a flat earth. Gravity loves to make balls of anything with significant mass. Indeed, you will not find anything of significant mass and density in the universe that is not spherical or roughly so. If gravity existed, and you lived on a giant coin-shaped disk with the mass of the earth, it would have to be made of a substance of inconceivable rigidity to prevent it melting and collapsing in on itself from its own mass to form a ball. But even if it was, you would find that if you stood near the edge of it, you would slide in (on what would feel like a very long, steep incline) toward the center of mass, which would be the center of the disk. But not just you. So would everyone and everything else. So you would end up with a big hemispherical bulge of molten rock and debris and water and people and plants and animals in the middle of your disk, with a nice shiny undestructium surface at the edges. It wouldn\u2019t stay flat. And it wouldn\u2019t be pretty to see. But, you may ask, couldn\u2019t this whole \u201cup and down\u201d business be accounted for by some other force? What about buoyancy and density. Things rise and fall in an atmosphere, or a body of water based on how dense they are relative to the surrounding media. A lead ingot will sink to the bottom of an ocean and a balloon will float on its surface. This is a great question! Things do do those things! But the thing is, things do those things because of gravity. It is the engine that drives buoyancy. Consider this: 1a) A balloon released from the bottom of the ocean will rise to the surface (it will likely pop due to the vast changes in pressure, but let\u2019s just say it gets much larger) because it is less dense than the water around it. Once it is at the surface it will stop and float there on top of the water, unless it is filled with hydrogen or helium, in which case it will rise until it reaches a place in the atmosphere where the air is less dense than it is. 2a) If you place a lead ingot on the ocean\u2019s surface and let go, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. But now let\u2019s further consider these things: 1a) If the balloon pops or increases in volume as it rises, this means that there is a gradient of pressure in the ocean: meaning the water is more dense, more compressed at depth. But\u2026why? Because of the weight of the water on top of it. As the amount of weight lessens, so lessens the amount of pressure. But what is weight? Weight is the amount of force that gravitation exerts on an object or substance, which as we\u2019ve seen is related to how massive the object or substance is. So a gradient of pressure, or density is to be expected from gravity. 2a) We know why the helium balloon floats away from the ocean instead of sinking. The pressure, or density of the air is less than the ocean, so it moves into the less dense medium. But what about a lead ingot placed on the ocean\u2019s surface? If it sinks only because it is more dense than the surrounding water, and not because it it drawn through the water by gravitation, then why doesn\u2019t the lead ingot travel through the air like the balloon? If it\u2019s only based on density, the air is much less dense than the water. Traveling through the more energetically expensive water (which gets more and more dense, harder and harder to move through as it goes) rather than traveling easily through the air just doesn\u2019t make sense without gravity, which also explains why the balloon stops at a certain height when it reaches a level at which gravity can exert the same force on it as the surrounding air. Also, it\u2019s fairly easy to use a vacuum chamber to demonstrate that density and buoyancy are not responsible for things falling:  So gravity is what creates buoyancy. It creates layers of water and air and pressure gradients within them. It\u2019s why a balloon pops when released from the bottom of the ocean, and why you can\u2019t breathe at 30,000 feet. Gravity is why water (and everything else) tends to stick to the earth. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf Earth is in a round shape how is the ocean water still staying on Earth rather than slipping into the space? If you see a globe on your table\u201d The details sentence is missing something, so I\u2019ll answer this question: If you see a globe on your table, and you put water on it, the water will run across the globe and then leave the globe and hit the ground. On Earth, how is the ocean water still staying on Earth rather than slipping into the space? With the globe, if you put your finger on any point on the globe, you can find a tangent plane to the surface of the globe at that point. If you haven\u2019t learned tangent planes yet, think of a sheet of paper that is stiff and hold it to the globe with one finger pressing the sheet of paper to the globe. That sheet of paper is the tangent plane. Now, you can imagine a gravity vector that points in the direction of the force of gravity from that point. If your kitchen is like mine, the gravity vectors at every point are directed towards the floor. When you let something go in a gravitational field and it is not blocked by other things, it will start to move in the direction of the gravity vector. Depending on where your point is on the globe, the gravity vector might be pointing to the inside of the globe. For a waterproof globe, the water isn\u2019t going in that direction. However if you project the gravity vector onto the tangent plane, you can have a vector that is on the tangent plane and points to where the water would go. If this is a typical globe and your finger is on the Southern tip of Africa, the gravity vector is straight from that point to the ground. Put water there and it will fall to the floor. If your finger is on Norway, the gravity vector is into the globe, but the projection of the gravity vector is on the tangent plane and points in the direction of Denmark. So, when you put water on your globe at Norway, it heads to Denmark, then Germany, etc. and when it gets to somewhere lower (depending on your globe\u2019s construction and orientation, the water falls to the floor. OK, now do the same thing for the Earth. Standing somewhere on Earth, you imagine a tangent plane - or for the Earth, since it is almost flat, just imagine a few meters of flat all around you. The gravity vector everywhere on Earth (aside from some very small wiggles) points to the center of the Earth. As you know from geometry, a vector from a point on the surface of a sphere to the center of the sphere is perpendicular to a tangent plane on the surface of the sphere. So, no matter where you are on Earth, the gravity vector is pointing straight into the globe and since the projection of a perpendicular vector onto a tangent plane is zero, there is no tangential gravitational force on the water. It only goes down! I guess the key difference is that for the Earth, the gravity vector is towards the center everywhere, whereas for a globe in your kitchen the gravity vector is towards the floor.
