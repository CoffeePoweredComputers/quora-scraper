            "answer_text": "No, AI is about much more. The best way to think about it is to see AI as a set of problems (how do we make machines that behave like humans) and deep learning as one approach (certainly not the only one) to tackling them. There are many other problems that are part of AI. For example, symbolic reasoning (e.g. \u201cis Donald Trump taller than Obama\u201d or \u201cwho has right of way at this intersection given the rules\u201d) is an entire subfield that deep learning really hasn\u2019t tackled. For that, there are entirely different approaches (either Probabilistic or logical) and systems for making logical deductions. ",

Different components of intelligence are:  Source[2] Artificial Intelligence (AI) pertains to algorithms and techniques that can act like a human when performing cognitive functions (e.g. decision making). Analogous to learning, machine learning (ML) is one of the components of an AI system. And deep learning is one way of doing ML.
