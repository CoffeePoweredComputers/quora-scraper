            "answer_text": "The effects are uncertain. Most of the effects would be fairly subtle in the short term, since mosquitoes aren\u2019t a sole food source for most things that eat them. But there would be impacts, since they are a very easy insect to hunt, as flying insects go (the larva are also hilariously inept). If a species is force to transition from a food source that is very easy to hunt to one that is relatively difficult, the energy loss makes a great difference in how large a population of prey is necessary for a given predation level. One would expect to see the numbers of insect predators in most affected ecosystems drop fairly significantly. Removing an easy prey insect makes the learning curve for young predators much sharper, amplifying the effect. Overall, ecosystems would stabilize by having higher populations of similar insects which turned mucky water (and bits of high-quality protein snagged somewhere) into meals for larger animals. Which insect species would dominate would depend on the specific environment\u2026whatever it was, it would surely be considered a pest in its own right. Populations of insect predators wouldn\u2019t recover to previous levels, unless the replacement insect was similarly easy to hunt. The higher energy cost of hunting something that is better at evading predation can\u2019t be overcome except by having a more favorable ratio of available prey. There would probably be local ecosystems where these small changes would spiral out of control and lead to an ecological collapse. Such a response may even be widespread, it\u2019s not easy to tell for sure. Nor is the picture as simple as painted here. The microbes that take advantage of standing water can have all kinds of impacts, such as on soil fertility. It\u2019s really impossible to even guess what might happen at that largely invisible level. As great a nuisance as mosquitoes can be as disease vectors (and as a direct pest themselves), it\u2019s probably easier to deal with them than what might replace them. And where nothing manages to replace them, the consequences could be dire. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all it is impossible. Even if that happens it will happen after the extinction of human. Surprised? Yes, mosquitoes are more tolerant than human and more frequently undergo gene modifications to adapt to the external change. Mosquitoes don't have too many fans. Their bites are itchy, they spread disease, and their numbers swell rapidly. Lets assume they vanished. What will happen? It will be a great LOSS. Yes, you heard it right. Only about a hundred - less than a hundred species transmit those horrible diseases that you've referred to out of thousands of species that live on every continent except Antarctica. you know, it's only the females that take a blood meal from their hosts (she need blood as a protein source for egg development) and often those hosts have nothing to do with humans. So there are mosquitoes that feed on snakes, frogs, birds. Only less than a hundred are a problem for humans. The immature stage(wrigglers or larva) of mosquitoes live in water and can be fed upon by fish and other aquatic predatory insects. Adult Mosquitoes are food for predatory terrestrial insects and birds. Mosquitoes themselves are good pollinators since the males visit flowers to feed on nectar. Certainly mosquitoes are pollinating quite many species. Mosquitoes are the main food item of some species of bat which are also responsible for pollination services. Lastly i will say many people have made careers out them which is their biggest contribution. ",

            "answer_text": "There are about 3,500 species of mosquitoes out of which around 200 mosquitoes causes harm to human beings( ONLY FEMALE MOSQUITOES BITE HUMANS). Although it is considered as deadliest disease causing agent, it also has positive role in the environment to certain extent. Let us see its positive role in the environment.. Mosquito larvae for their survival feed on certain algae present in the water and convert them into tissues of their own body. When fishes feed on larvae, its become nutritious packed food for the them playing a role in aquatic food chain.Mosquitoes serve as nutritious food for birds, bats and spiders. Thus it indirectly play a role in increased species diversity which is very vital for maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.Medical Discoveries.When we are bitten by a mosquito, we often do not feel the bite because the mosquito anesthetizes us with its mouth(saliva). Some of these anesthetic properties of mosquito saliva have been studied and incorporated in synthetic forms into local and topical anesthetics people to numb a patient undergoing medical treatment.Only the females of some mosquito species need blood to get the proteins necessary to lay eggs. For the most part, male and female adult mosquitoes depend on nectar for energy. So when collecting nectars, the pollen get attached to its body and transfered to other plants helping in pollination. Thus here it acts as a POLLINATOR. Ex: Arctic bog orchids. So mosquitoes do serve some important function in our environment without which would affect our ecosystem. What would be possible ecosystem impact if mosquitoes suddenly vanishes? According to some ecologists, the loss of mosquitoes would harm most ecosystems. Others believe that other organisms would step in and assume mosquitos\u2019 role as food sources and pollinators. VANISHING (TO BE PRECISE \u2018ERADICATION\u2019) OF MOSQUITO IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, UNLESS DESTROYING THE WORLD. The good part of their vanishing.. So many diseases would disappear, so many people would get a good night\u2019s sleep without inhaling chemicals, and so much money that is now being spent on mosquito coils, bednets and medicines would be saved, so many hospital beds would be freed up.

Those swallows that we see in the late evening darting this way and that around the water\u2019s edge? They\u2019re catching mosquitoes. The bats that take their place just as darkness falls? They eat lots of mosquitoes too. The frogs you hear singing on early summer nights. Yep, mosquitoes are part of their diet as well. Fewer frogs? Well, herons eat frogs. So do egrets and other wading birds. Big fish will eat frogs and they really like tadpoles too. What eats the big fish? Well, people for one. So do all kinds of birds, otters, mink and so on. In short, everything in nature is interconnected. You can\u2019t kill of an entire species and not have some repercussions. Kill a few individuals - no problem. Even kill thousands of individuals with some species and it won\u2019t be noticed. But if you kill off all of them, then the results are unforeseen - but there will. be. downsides. That\u2019s a guarantee. You can probably see it best with the relationship between rabbits and the predators that catch them, especially lynx. The cat\u2019s and rabbit\u2019s populations go up and down in synch with each other. More rabbits, more lynx. Fewer rabbits, fewer lynx. (Also wolves, foxes, hawks and other animals that eat them.) If all the rabbits disappeared, the lynx might disappear too. But if all the lynx were killed off, then rabbits might overpopulate and eat all the new shoots of plants. There\u2019s be more wolves, more foxes, who knows? Mosquitoes are a pain. I hate them. But I wouldn\u2019t want to see them all disappear. I like the swallows, the otters, the herons, and all the other things whose existence depends on whole or on part on them. ",

But just what would happen if we all woke up tomorrow in a world that was completely empty of mosquitoes? I googled it out and I found this. If mosquitoes went extinct: Mosquito larvae are very important in aquatic ecology. Many other insects and small fish feed on them and the loss of that food source would cause their numbers to decline as well. Anything that feeds on them, such as game fish, raptorial birds, etc. would in turn suffer too. Mosquitoes can be wiped out but the ecological damage that would be necessary (draining swamps/wetlands, applying pesticides over wide areas), along with strict regulatory enforcement, would make eradication not worth it unless there was a very serious public health emergency.

Many animals use them as a food source, in all stages of the mosquito\u2019s life cycle. Many small fish eat the larvae as a primary food source, as do numerous insects. Some birds, bats, dragonflies and spiders eat substantial amts. of adult mosquitos. Life is a delicate balance. Remove one component and others suffer. Even something as lowly as a mosquito. This is all the result of eons of evolution. Look how human activities have affected other lifeforms. We kill off the wolf and cougar populations and deer become a nuisance as there are not enough natural predators to keep their numbers in check. We introduce rabbits to Australia and they eat everything in sight leaving little for the indigenous species to survive on. We clear forests for either wood or to make room for growing crops disrupting entire ecosystems. The list goes on and on. Frankly, I think the animal kingdom can\u2019t wait for us to kill ourselves out so that things can go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. So, to answer the question, for any existing species to go extinct, even mosquitos would be an eventual disaster. ",

If you were to only erradicate this species (or maybe only the biting species) I think there is a good possibility that some other species might expand their ecological niche and take over their ecological role without the catastrophic cascades of extinctions and ecological collapse that the other answers foresee. (Note that it is by no means certain that this niche expansion will occur though). However, my bigger question will be how you will go about eradicating only mosquitoes or only specific species of mosquitoes without eradicating a host of other species as well? I do not think it is likely or maybe even possible to eradicate only biting mosquitoes without killing a large number of other beneficial species as well. The only way I can think of, is if you somehow poisoned the blood of all people in mosquito areas (and probably the blood of all other potential animal hosts, as well)... I don't think this is really achievable. ",

That could disrupt the food chain of the animals that eat birds, fish and frogs, which could effect the population of the higher animals. The idea that humans have that you can eradicate a long standing species without harm is a lesson that most humans have not learned. Almost everything that lives on this planet consumes food that is made by or is another species. If you break the chain, you cause problems such as wiping out other species that depend on the initial one killed off, or you let loose a harmful species that was controlled by the existence of the species that was wiped out. Example, if you got rid of the cats, the mouse and rat populations would expand because the cats are natural hunters of the rats and mice. ",

Certain diseases, like Malaria and the Zika virus would just about vanish, and, of course, we would not have any swollen, itchy lumps on us. These lumps are actually because of the numbing juice the mosquito injects. This decreases the victim's chances of noticing it and swatting it. After the mosquito is satisfied, it flies away and the juice 'inflates' the tissue, and irritates it. Female mosquitoes are the only ones that suck blood. Males consume nectar. Females do too, but that is only for food. The blood is to give her nutrients to grow eggs. Because of this, they play a role in pollination. They are the main diet of bats and some birds, frogs, and spiders. Fun fact: They do not have the best vision, but are attracted to mammals by C0\u2082 (Carbon Dioxide) gas during an animal's exhalation. ",

Many birds, bats, amphibians, fish, spiders and other insects feed on mosquitoes, but many mosquito-control specialists say they usually do not eat enough mosquitoes to control them, let alone to make the loss of mosquitoes crucial to whether the predators survive. In-depth studies have found that mosquitoes form at most 3 percent of the voracious purple martin\u2019s diet, according to the American Mosquito Control Association. A survey of scientists on mosquito eradication, published in 2010 by the journal Nature, concluded by quoting the head of the association, who said that eradication would be a \u201chiccup\u201d for the environments where mosquitoes are active and that \u201csomething better or worse would take over.\u201d\u2014C.

They are noisy, they don\u2019t let you sleep, they behave like drunk houseflies and they spread some very deadly diseases among human beings. But would nature have let mosquitoes live without any reason? Absolutely not. There are 3,500 named species of mosquito, of which only a couple of hundred bite or bother humans. They live on almost every continent and habitat, and serve important functions in numerous ecosystems. I have written about this exact question on my blog: Mosquitoes: A necessary evil. Do check it out. I\u2019m sure this will answer your question. Some scientists do agree that extermination of just the disease causing mosquitoes would not cause major ecological imbalance. Mosquitoes occupy a particular niche in the ecosystem that can easily be filled by other insects. There will be some damage, but it expected to be short term. I hope this helps. Cheers! ",

The goal in pest management is not necessarily eradication but population control. Mosquitoes may serve a vital purpose we don't fully understand yet like ensuring there's competition and pressure on potential pest species. Truth is, most pest species were not that originally but the alterations of their ecosystems and subsequent removal of predators and competition (whether intentionally or not) led to the surge in their population and adaptation to the altered environment and behold a pest is born.

I do know that if mosquitoes disappeared suddenly the flies, gnats, small sweat bees (the Halictidae family), horse flies and other annoying insects would still make summer evenings a miserable time, maybe without all the itching though, without some chemical intervention on the part of humans. Most humans would not notice the extinction of the species until long after it happened. ",

I suspect food webs would be affected, especially in hot and humid environments where mosquito populations are dense. The map below suggests mosquito population sizes are small in Canada and some other places. Here in the southern U.S., mosquitoes are abundant (that's an understatement). I think ecosystems here would be noticeably changed. If another insect evolved to take advantage of the mosquitoe\u2019s ecological niche, I think they'd look and behave a LOT like mosquitoes. They're very specialized. I think we will go extinct before they do.  Map source: CDC: Global Distribution of Potentially Important Malaria Vectors, 2012. ",

Mosquitoes have killed about 500 million people in past 100 years (the last official figure I saw was in 1990 and then it was 350 million since the start of the 20th century).

Not just locals, but tourists that go to mosquito infested places which are declared \u2018malarial\u2019 because more than 5% of the population carry the parasite. My son Elon contracted malaria after a four day visit to a \u2018luxury\u2019 game lodge in South Africa.

The rest feed on plants and pollinate flowers. Mosquitoes are an important food source for other animals, including birds, bats, frogs, arthropods, amphibians, and fish. So obviously, it would cause very serious ecological damage and millions of people would die, and ecosystems would collapse. Just killing Eurasian tree sparrows in China led to the Chinese Great famine which killed 15 to 40 million people, so 3,500 species and an entire family of important insects going globally extinct would be exponentially worse.
