            "answer_text": "Ammonium hydroxide is actually a solution of ammonia NH3 in water. Your question doesn't entirely make sense so I'll tell you a bit about ammonia solutions. NH3 dissolves in water to 35% by weight ~300g/liter at 15C. This is about 18 Molar. It reacts with waterNH3 + H2O = NH4+ + OH- Keq = [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] = 1.8x10^-5 A one molar solution is about .42% ionized Work it out {I think the 1.42% in the Wikipedia site is a typo] ",

            "answer_text": "I read less into this question than others. I am looking at this question like \u2018I have a concentrated solution of ammonium hydroxide that I wish to dilute. Should water be added to the ammonium hydroxide solution or the other way around.\u2019 If the question was with respect to an acid (e.g., HCl or acetic acid), the answer would be to add the acid to water, not the water to the acid. The reason is the dissolution of water into a concentrated solution of acid can be quite exothermic causing boiling, spattering, and a generally hazardous set of conditions. While adding acid to water is still exothermic, it is spread out and any spattering that occurs tends to be of the less hazardous water than concentrated acid. So, the same situation can occur with diluting a strong base. Just like acid, you should add the concentrated solution of base to water and not water to the concentrated solution of base. ",

            "answer_text": "Ammonium hydroxide is a pretty weak base so it will not dissociate completely in water. So: NH4OH(aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 NH4+ + OH- In simple equilibrium chemistry, water can be omitted as it is liquid. Only aqueous solutions are important. NH4OH(aq) \u2192 NH4+ + OH- You can solve the concentration using Kb Kb = [prod] / [react] Kb = ([NH4+] [OH-]) / [NH4OH] Hope this answers your question. ",
