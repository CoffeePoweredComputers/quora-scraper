            "answer_text": "as you say, something must be applying force. gravity, whatever,  gravity or weight is what we experience. that really  is most common; strings pull and rods push, human or animal muscles through complicated mechanisms provide the force. Friction opposes motion when we try to move something. No push no opposing friction! if a force moves a distance that is WORK or energy the natural state of things is continued velocity (momentum) unless acted on by a force . this was the ASSUMPTION by Galileo and Newton.  F = m A is the useful formula. the other major force in the universe is electro=magnetic between atoms and two nuclear forces that hold the atoms together. there may be more we do no know. the ancient greeks thought the natural state was at rest. and for good reason, if a horse stopped pulling the cart , the cart stopped  (do to friction) they explained and arrow by arrow pushes air out of the way, air ruches around behind and pushes the arrow forward. WRONG but reasonable ",

            "answer_text": "The two basic forces we generally experience in our everyday lives are gravity and electromagnetism. Gravity only tends to be significant when you are relatively near to something very large. This is the force that pulls us towards the Earth and keeps the Earth revolving around the sun. Electromagnetism accounts for almost all of the other pushes and pulls we experience. When you push on a box, the electrons in your hand repel the electrons in the box; this creates both the force that moves the box and the force you feel as the box pushes back at you. Friction is caused by similar electromagnetic interactions between the atoms in the box and the atoms in the floor. ",
