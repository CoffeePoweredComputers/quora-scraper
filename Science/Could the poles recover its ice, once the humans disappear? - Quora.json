            "answer_text": "Climate is cyclical regardless of what humans do. You may have heard of dinosaurs in Antarctica: they were not living on top of ice fields at -50 degrees. There simply wasn\u2019t any ice at either pole at the end of the cretaceous period (65M years ago). Antarctica didn\u2019t start to freeze over until about 35M years ago and didn\u2019t reach its current state until 10\u201314M years ago. The Arctic polar ice is even less stable and was entirely absent during the Eemian interglacial only 130000 years ago before expanding to cover most of North America and Northern Europe during the last glacial period. We are currently in another interglacial, but a cooler one than the Eemian since the Arctic ice is still there. Obviously none of the above changes had anything to do with humans. So, there are two fairly strong predictions one can make: In the short term (several dozens of millenia) the interglacial will end and a full glaciation of the northern hemisphere will return with obvious catastrophic consequences.In the medium term (several dozens of millions of years) it is likely that the himalayan weathering CO2 sink will stop distorting the climate and cretaceous conditions will return eliminating all ice at both poles.In the ultra-short term (decades) global warming is a problem for us and other species, but over a 100000 year timeframe we\u2019re going to have to decide if we sacrifice North America and Europe entirely (with knock on climatic effects elsewhere) or else avert glaciation with some serious greenhouse engineering, involving deliberate CO2 and methane release on a vast scale. Either way the second eventuality will arise. Once India stops mountain building in Asia both polar ice caps are probably going to melt. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the poles would recover its ice, but probably after a long period of time, and it coming back wont have much to do with humans. Let me tell you something, climate change is very normal. The Earth has gone through 7 recorded galacial changes throughout its young lifetime. While humans do play a role in the play of global warming, it\u2019s only a medium amount. Most climate changes is due to a slight change in the Earths orbit. While we do play a large contributing factor to climate change, with or without humans it will happen anyway. Go to NASA\u2019s webpage on Climate Change, what it is and how we affect it. https://climate.nasa.gov/ ",

Of course, a species can go extinct, but that always happens. The Earth was created for we humans so that we could learn to love each other, and help each other, and to eventually create a Golden Age. Without humans, why does any of this matter? Once the Sun burns our, all will be gone. Unless we have immortal souls that will continue their growth toward God even if our universe ceases to exist. ",
