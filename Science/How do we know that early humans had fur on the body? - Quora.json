            "answer_text": "Look at your own body, your head and everywhere - Hairy: Some human (being of the APE class primate/mammal club) are more hairy than another human - What you are calling \u201cfur\u201d could be called \u201cHAIR\u201d\u2026 often the terms are interchangeable\u2026 to an extent. The chemistry of hair/fur is tough and does not breakdown easily and decompose as you may notice when your sink gets plugged up with hair/fur off you or your pet. The skin of things may decompose and dehydrate - but hair/fur hangs around if not too exposed to harsh elements\u2026 acids or if you burn it becomes charcoal. I am no expert on hair/fur - but aware of the kinds of \u201cCoats\u201d structure varies in the animal kingdom of hairy/furry things. And seem the main purpose is to help regulate body temperature and protect skin in various conditions of exposure\u2026 Well, feathers (Fowl common), or skin scales (reptiles common) like hair/fur sort of play the same seeming role in species adaptation mysteries of chance happenstance in the way things evolved over time. - BUT, I DO NOT THINK you would likely get a experts agreement that HUMANKIND WERE ALL ONE HAIR/FUR (IF YOU LIKE, per se) FITS ALL\u2026 As One of the constants in the variables of human genetic variables of features even within a specific close net group or inter-group breeding IS THAT hair character TYPE can be any character in a group be its nature to be straight, wavy, curly, and so on not fixed to one, but randomly any mix. Just how furry or hairy where any actual class of \u201cHUMAN APE\u201d - not a transitional state of primate legacy back to rodents\u2026 Don\u2019t know\u2026 BUT I DO KNOW SOME HUMAN WHO are hairy or hairless degrees of RATS.
