            "answer_text": "Unpredictability. So if I give you a sequence of numbers and you have no way to predict what the next number in the sequence will be - then the sequence is random. A single number cannot ever be random. 13\u2026ok\u2026not random. But: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 \u2026the \u201813\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem very random because you could have predicted it with almost complete certainty. On the other hand: 143, 12, 93, 246, 82, 45, 13\u2026then the \u201813\u2019 does seem random because you had no way to predict it. But randomness is often in the eye of the beholder. Consider: 60, 60, 24, 7, 12, 52\u2026 \u2026can you have predict the next number? If I say: 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, 12 months in a year, 52 weeks in a year\u2026I bet you\u2019d have a good chance of guessing that 365 was the next number\u2026even though the sequence is mathematically very weird and the choices I made in constructing the sequence were kinda arbitrary. I didn\u2019t mention the number of days in a lunar month for example and I used 12 calendar months rather than 13 lunar months as the 5th number. So even though you couldn\u2019t deduce the next number with certainty - I bet if you had to draw up a short list of possible next number, 365 would be on your list. So this sequence (which probably passes every mathematical test for randomness) doesn\u2019t fit with our human definition of \u201cunpredictability\u201d because we have a pretty decent chance of predicting it. There are mathematical tests of randomness - but they are all a bit suspect for this exact reason. Suppose we had a TRUE random number generator - and it came out with 100 consecutive 3\u2019s - we\u2019d suspect that it was broken. But in truth, there is no reason why 100 consecutive 3\u2019s couldn\u2019t come out of a truly random process\u2026and in fact, if you waited long enough - you\u2019d expect to see that happening. So defining a solid mathematical test for randomness is a patchy affair at best. But \u201cunpredictability\u201d is a good one\u2026it\u2019s just hard to apply in practice. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a deep philosophical question that no-one has fully been able to answer. We could say that randomness is lack of predictability. But predictability by whom, and under what circumstances? There is controversy over whether \u201ctrue\u201d randomness can exist. Many people reason that if something happens in the universe, it must have been caused by other things. We might not know what those other things are, and we might not have uncovered laws that show how they behave. But in principal, it is argued, we could have uncovered such laws and made necessary measurements and predicted the occurrence of the thing that happened \u201crandomly\u201d. But is this always true? The behaviour of tiny particles, governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, has so far defied all attempts at definite prediction. Quantum mechanics itself is a statistical theory, allowing for randomness. Do we really know what is meant by \u201cin principal\u201d in my earlier paragraph here? Do we really understand cause and effect? If we have a set of numbers that are \u201crandomly distributed\u201d, we mean that we can\u2019t find any pattern in them. Real figures drawn from the real world may often look random, but will often show signs of pattern, at least statistically. Sets of measurements of most real things tend to follow Benford's law, for example, which basically says that numbers start with \u201c1\u201d surprisingly often. \u201cPatterns\u201d like this found in data that is not fully random, are of interest to computer scientists, because any pattern in data, or any kind of divergence from complete unpredictability, may be used to compress data. If we\u2019ve got a large set of random-looking six-digit numbers, say, but we notice that they start with \u201c1\u201d more often than you\u2019d expect, you could just assume that they start with \u201c1\u201d and only mention what they really do start with if it\u2019s not \u201c1\u201d. This gets bit more complicated than it first seems, for various reasons that become clear when you start to think about it practically, but in the end even Benford\u2019s law can be used to compress data. See: Minimum description length - Wikipedia \u201cNot completely random\u201d implies \u201cat least somewhat predictable\u201d. And this implies that we could generate the data at least partly algorithmically without having to write out all the numbers or symbols in advance. But this doesn\u2019t always clearly represent compression. The world\u2019s most powerful image compression algorithm, LenPeg, compresses images to just one bit. But it only works with one particular image. The Lena image is completely non-random \u2026. but only if you already know what it should look like. A compression algorithm that was incredibly good at compressing data but was itself a program that occupied most of your computer, would not be much use. Considerations like this have led some people to ask whether randomness (or entropy, which can loosely be considered a measure of disorder) is actually subjective. It certainly doesn\u2019t seem subjective when you\u2019re calculating it with an equation from things you\u2019ve measured. But does our perception of disorder depend on a vast plethora of other things that are really anything but random? A random-looking set of numbers might even be totally non-random in reality. The digits of pi look random, but we know that they can be generated by an algorithm. They are not random at all. But if we didn\u2019t know the algorithm and we didn\u2019t know that we\u2019re looking at pi, we\u2019d think that they are random. If we say that the universe incorporates truly random elements, it seems as though we\u2019re saying that things can happen that could not be predicted by applying a set of mathematical rules to some set of data representing measurements that have previously been made on things that exist in this universe. But if we\u2019re faced with some set of numbers representing something that happened, we can never be sure that there is no pattern in them. We can only be sure that there is a pattern, if we find that pattern. The Halting problem in effect shows us that there\u2019s no way to find out if our attempts to find predictability within a set of numbers will ever work; our attempts might go on forever fruitlessly, and there would be no way to find that out in advance.

Random behavior is frequently called chance behavior. A card game may only seem like random behavior or very unpredictable but it's not. The average sucker can\u2019t predict what the next hand in a card game will be but you can if you cheat with a dishonest dealer or by having a sophisticated electronic device which keeps track of the cards in the deck and relays that information to you electronically to your ear. Yes, card shuffling is predictable and not really random behavior in the true sense of the word. You only can't predict the cards position if you don't have sufficient information or an adequate sensing device. I predict that technology will soon make card playing obsolete and everyone will be able to predict the next card in a card game with an electronic device. That will take all the fun out of card playing and there will be fewer gambling suckers on the face of this precious endangered planet. Air molecules colliding, certain rare accidents, and lottery wins are truer examples of random behavior or actions. ",

            "answer_text": "There are technical definitions of randomness that depend on being able to repeat an experiment infinitely many times.  For those, randomness is something that occurs at a limit.  Since they depend on an ideal that cannot achieved, let's pass them by. Let's take as our paradigm of randomness the flipping of a coin.  Ignoring anomalous outcomes like the universe ending before the coin lands, we know there are two possible outcomes, Heads or Tails.  The outcome is random.  It's random even if we only flip it once. What do we mean by that?  It means we don't know.  Even in a controlled experiment where we have a precise mechanical instrument to do the flipping, and a nice flat surface for the coin to land on, we can't predict what's going to happen.  With a precise mechanical instrument we might be able to predict better than a 50-50 chance, but it would still be random with some other predicted probability p of Heads and 1 \u2013 p of Tails. Is that all randomness is\u2014lack of knowledge and inability to make precise predictions? That's enough.  You don't have to go further to explain randomness.   You may have some information and be able to quantify the randomness with probabilities.  For example, the probability of tossing a 5 on a standard die is 1/6.  But it's still random.  You still can't predict when a 5 will come up.  There's a lot more you can say with probabilities, for example, the average number of tosses to get an outcome of 5 is 6.  Nonetheless, the individual outcomes are still unpredictable. Note that it means what's random to one person isn't necessarily random to another.  When you've written down a number between 1 and 10 on a piece of paper, you know what it is.  It's not random to you.  But to me, since I don't have the same information as you do, it's random. Randomness is a feature of lack of knowledge.  We use probability and statistics to quantify it and make predictions and decisions to the best of our ability. ",

This means that the flow parameters, though crisply known initially become unpredictable and vary even in seemingly identical environm,ent. . The motion is Brownian motion. For example, when a particle is thrown up with some initial velocity, its velocity (speed) at any tim ein its flight is determinable thru the equations governing its motion. Biut in random motion this cannot be done. At best one can say that the velocity would be this much with this amount of probability. We can only gain knowledge of probabilities and correlations but not exact values. Such motion or event is random. A famous example is the walkof a completely drunk sailor. It is called Brownian motion.Personally after working for a long time in Turbulence and Magneto hydrodyanamic dyanamo problem with a cambridge prof. Moffat, I realized randomnesss is after all due to lack of knowledge of all the parameters affecting the phenomenon. A coin is tossed and it may b ehead sor tails; the out come is said to b erandom because identical throws result in different outcomes. Here is my first objection. Two throws can not b eidentical. If a singl eperson throws the coin repeatedly, there has to be  atime gap between successivethrows. His hand would b etired and in any case will not b ein the same condition as in the earlier throw. The speed of the wind would be cahanging. The earth itself is not in th esame position. Thus hoping for IDENTICAL conditions is unreasonable optimism.I concluded that Probability is good mathematical technique but absolutely false concept.

One \u2018random\u2019 sequence the computer generated was 1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9. To you and I that will not appear random since it lists the numbers in order from smallest on the left to largest on the right. However it was random according to program used by the computer. The usual criteria for determining randomness is to avoid any repeatable or predictable results. This may seem simple but most humans when asked to create a random list of numbers subconsciously introduce non random order to there answers.Programming a computer is better. Even if only because it generates more possible solutions that need to be checked. However computer programmers must constantly seek programs that are more secure (random) in order to out smart the criminals who also have access to computers. That is a subject in of itself. i am sure you can find google searches that discuss this in greater detail. You may also want to google \u2018randomness\u2019 for a more detailed account of the meaning of random and how it is generated. ",

Random events are individually unpredictable, but the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events (or \"trials\") are frequently predictable.     For example, when throwing two dice and counting the total, a sum of 7 will randomly occur twice as often as 4, but the outcome of any particular roll of the dice is unpredictable. Lets take another simple example. Consider an unbiased coin i.e. the coin is having head and tail on each side. If we toss the coin, then this event can be rightly termed as a random event. No-one can't predict correctly the outcome. It may be a head or a tail. But out of a number of tosses, the number of heads will be sufficiently equal to number of tails. The closeness increases when the number of samples is sufficiently high. There the concept of probability rises.     So in a nutshell, where randomness simply refers to situations where the certainty of the outcome is at issue, applies to concepts of chance, probability. In these situations, randomness implies a measure of uncertainty, and notions of haphazardness are irrelevant. ",

            "answer_text": "In daily life the term \u201crandom\u201d is often used to describe actions (or the the results thereof) performed in a superficial, unplanned, or inattentive way. A correct mathematical definition of randomness refers to infinite sequences for which there is no finite description (a formula, a computer program,\u2026). This has an interesting consequence: descriptions (either in linguistic form, or in mathematical language) borrow from a finite stock of words or symbols. Hence the number of sequences that can be built by finite descriptions is at most countable. The number of sequences involving at least two distinct symbols (say: 0, 1) is uncountably infinite (Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument). Cantor's diagonal argument - Wikipedia Ergo: under reasonable mathematical conditions (I think of ZFC) randomness exists in this mathematics. ",

            "answer_text": "Randomness is the proportionality of probabilities between your possible outcomes of occurring. If possible outcomes have the exact same probability of occurring than randomness is achieved to it\u2019s fullest extent. The more disproportional are the probabilities of the outcomes the lesser the \u201crandomness\u201d and the more predictable the outcome frequencies. I\u2019m using the word \u201clesser\u201d because randomness is a relative concept. There is no such thing as something that is random or something that is not random. Randomness is not a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d. Randomness is a \u201cmore\u201d or a \u201cless\u201d. When measuring randomness you are measuring the proportionality of probabilities between your possible outcomes of occurring. Since true randomness is impossible to replicate, most outcome distribution types are more convergent compared to the most likely random outcome distribution types. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows if true randomness exists. We certainly know that pseudo-randomness exists. Pseudo-randomness can be human generated or generated by nature. What do I mean? Pseudo-randomness is merely a phenomena that seems to be random, but is not actually random. A pseudo-random event is theoretically predictable (with enough information). So what is objectively random then? Something that is said to be truly random is intrinsically unpredictable (no matter how much information we have) AND not caused, not determined. Even theoretically, it is not predictable. Thus far science has not definitely found any truly random events. Quantum mechanics, after 100 years, has reached absolutely no consensus if underlying reality is random or deterministic. It\u2019s an entirely open question, a question that will likely never be solved. We just don\u2019t know. As for the overwhelming majority of science, we have immense evidence that support physical determinism. I hope this helps. ",
