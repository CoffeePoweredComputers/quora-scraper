            "answer_text": "All quanta (i.e. all \u201cparticles\u201d) are waves, or disturbances, in a fundamental quantum field. For example, a photon is a wave in the universal electromagnetic field, and an electron is a wave in the universal electron positron field. A material quantum, such as an electron, quark, proton, or atom, is a \u201cmatter wave\u201d in a corresponding universal quantum field (the e-p field, a quark field, etc.).

            "answer_text": "Over the course of our evolution we have built up a set of concepts and ideas that help us navigate the world. In particular, we have concepts of \u201cpoint particles\u201d and \u201cwaves.\u201d Quantum theory involves the world of the very small, which is far outside our day-to-day intuition and experience. Under certain conditions, quantum entities behave like particles, and under other conditions they behave like waves. We normally think of matter as consisting of particles, and things like light, sound, and so on consisting of waves. Here we can think of matter as \u201canything that has mass.\u201d Most of the time, in our day-to-day experience, matter does behave like point particles and light does behave like waves. However ultimately these things are built of quantum entities, which can behave like either depending on the conditions you\u2019re created. A matter wave is simply a collection of matter (with mass) that is currently exhibiting wave-like attributes, because you\u2019ve set up experimental conditions that make those attributes manifest.
