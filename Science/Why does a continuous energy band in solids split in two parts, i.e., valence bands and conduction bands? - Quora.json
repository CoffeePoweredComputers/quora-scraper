            "answer_text": "In solid-state physics, the valence band & conduction band are the bands closest to the Fermi level & thus determine the electrical conductivity of the solid. In non-metals, the valence band is the highest range of electron energies in which electrons are normally present at absolute zero temperature, while the conduction band is the lowest range of vacant electronic states. On a graph of the electronic band structure of such a material, the valence band is located below the Fermi level, while the conduction band is located above it. This distinction is meaningless in metals because conduction occurs in one or more partially filled bands, taking on the properties of both the valence and conduction bands. (bands overlap in metals) For more details check this TED video from 1:50minute  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjaAxUO6-Uw&feature=youtu.be Please do Support by \u201cupvote\u201ding if you are satisfied with answer ",

            "answer_text": "Let us consider an example of a system consisting of carbon atoms (like Graphene) having electronic configuration as 1s_2 2s_2 2p_2, these all are filled orbitals, but there are empty orbitals too like 3s, 3p 3d and so on. When large no. of atoms are brought closer to each other, then the wave functions of different orbitals overlap and forms a continum which is known as a band. Now the continum formed by the overlapping of filled orbitals like 1s_2 2s_2 2p_2 (in our case) would lead to valence band, while the continum formed by the overlapping of empty orbitals like 3s 3p 3d is known as Conduction band.
