            "answer_text": "What gives any particular element its properties is the number of protons in the atoms of that element, and the number of protons is the atomic number. As soon as any protons are added or lost, that changes the properties of the atom and thus changes the properties of the element, making it into a different element altogether. Let\u2019s take hydrogen as an example, being the most abundant element in the universe. Hydrogen has one proton, so it\u2019s atomic number is 1. As soon as you add a second proton to that first proton, the properties immediately change, and you no longer have hydrogen, you now have a helium atom at atomic number 2. Adding another proton to those two will change the properties again, giving you a lithium atom. So, to answer your question, no. The atomic number of a particular specific element can never change, because the atomic number is the number of protons in that atom, and as soon as the number of protons change, the element itself is changed. All carbon atoms will always have an atomic number of 6 because all carbon atoms will always have 6 protons, just as all hydrogen atoms will always have an atomic number of 1. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It happens every day. One example is the preparation of certain isotopes used in medical imaging. Certain elements \u201c A \u201c are bombarded with protons \u201cp\u201d and then they emit a neutron \u201cn\u201d in a process abbreviated as (p,n). The product \u201cB\u201d is a new element in which a neutron has been replaced by a proton. The nuclear reaction is represented as A(p,n)B, where the atomic number of A has been increased by one, producing B. One of the neutrons of A has been replaced by a proton, but the atomic weight has not been changed. In the examples that follow, the atomic weight of the elements is indicated as a prefix: 68Zn(p,n)68Ga An isotope of zinc being transformed into an isotope of Gallium. 18O(p,n)18F Oxygen isotope to Fluorine isotope. 64Ni(p,n)64Cu Nickel isotope to a Copper isotope These transformations, as well as many others, are done with \u201cbaby cyclotrons\u201d in nuclear laboratories and hospitals all over the world.

            "answer_text": "No.  The atomic number defines the element.   The atomic number is the number of protons and the number of protons IS that element.    Next to the number of protons, every atom has neutrons. Even when the number of neutrons differs, the element stays the same, therefore, the mass of different atoms of the same element can be different, but not what defines the element.  An atom with one proton is always hydrogen whether you have no neutrons or 1 or 2.    Two protons in an atom define Helium.   BUT the atomic number of an ATOM can change.  Just bombard it with particles or if it has an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons, then the atomic number can change if you force it to take more protons/neutrons   --or if it spontaneously decays into another element.
