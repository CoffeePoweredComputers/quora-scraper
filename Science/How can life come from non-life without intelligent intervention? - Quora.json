            "answer_text": "The most basic fact about physical and chemical reactions is that, when conditions are \u2018right\u2019, those reactions necessarily take place. They have no choice but to react when the ingredients and conditions facilitate the reaction. OK. The reactions automatically take place under the right conditions. The Earth offered infinite locations where the ingredients were present and the conditions favorable, so the inanimate chemicals did what they had to do and reaced with one another. Out of this infinity of reactions, some were of the type that eventually led to the formation of large molecules that had the power to self-replicate. You have to remember three things: 1. these reactions had to happen,I 2. the world is a very large place with an infinity of opportunities for reactions to occur and 3. these reactions happened every day for millions of years. There was plenty of time for the right sequence of reactions to convert inanimate chemical elements into the larger forms that we call living. The process of life arising from inert chemicals was, given the right conditions, enough places and enough time, absolutely inevitable. There is no reason to invoke an imaginary supernatural entity (which is a terrible way to explain anything) in this natural but slow process. ",

Just try to get a grip on the size and complexity of the universe. If you think you\u2019ve got it, you stopped short. As amazing as life is, it could be cosmically common. Time and space are vast. They are beyond any true appreciation a human can muster. Our lives are too short. If we as a race live and evolve for 100 million years we might make a dent in a decent understanding but maybe not. We are so very, very far apart from other objects in the solar system let alone interstellar travels\u2026our information is going to be limited. Oh well, we\u2019ve got a big 2 million years under our belt. One 50th of the figure I just gave. Perhaps try to comprehend our own evolution, brief as it is. It\u2019s scale might seem to make sense to you. Myself, I\u2019m still working on the scale of the learning that fits into a single lifetime. I\u2019m humbled by how hard it is to stuff enough in to be satisfied with the effort. Backsliding is so easy and progress is so hard. Good luck friends! ",

Which came first. Everything in this world behaves similarly, even creator and creation too. To understand it one has to understand what is life without knowing and feeling of that knowledge. Everything has originated from nothing. Life is an individual journey to know this nothingness. In the emptiness of our own nature our world exists which everyone has to figure out. You cannot rely on someone elses experience or knowledge, they are just ways and need to reach the end of it on his own. life cannot begin without life but what and who can create nothing. Nothing or emptiness is natural, only thing that arise in this nothingness is knowing of this nothingness. This knowing is awareness. Feeling and awareness unions to create in this unfulfilled nature a world and being. Knowledge and knowing grows together as experiences and when journey ends what remains is empty experiences. In that emptiness our empty identity remains as unknown. In short life has no beginning and no end. In nothingness everything appears and in nothingness everything disappears. ",

It\u2019s going to be hard to settle this question, since we don\u2019t really expect there to still be evidence left of 4 billion years old chemical reactions.

There are three options, with three interesting problems: Random If you believe this you have to accept that inanimate matter can produce consciousness. This is called the hard problem in academic circles: David Chalmers Thinks the Hard Problem Is Really Hard The case for morality also becomes one of pure practicality. You only need to be careful about the things you think other people might see and react to, because your consciousness ceases to exist when your body does. God If God created life then you have to wrestle with the problem of how someone who loves you created the suffering we see in the world (and no, it\u2019s not a fair test). This is a well known problem and is called theodicy. If this is your world view you need to be careful about every thing you do, even the stuff you might get away with during this life time, because he\u2019s watching. You will also be tempted to blame God when things go wrong, and hope that they will forgive you. Cause and Effect This view sees consciousness as being distinct from a physical body. It is based on the idea that everything comes from something similar prior to it, so consciousness would come from a previous moment of consciousness. The mind is the primary driver for what you experience. The problem here is that you have to accept that there is no first cause, consciousness would extend back infinitely in time. It is a world view associated with Buddhists and Hindus. The case for morality here is exactly the same as in the Christian world view \u2014 you need to be careful about everything you think, say, or do because you are carrying your actions in your mind stream and they will affect how you perceive the world at some future date. But it is all on you to create what you want for your future. I hope this helps. Let me know what your thoughts are! ",
