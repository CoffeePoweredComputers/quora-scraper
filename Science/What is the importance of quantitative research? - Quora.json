            "answer_text": "Quantitative Research is a systematic approach to collect data through sampling method like online polls, online surveys, Questionnaires etc. Quantitative Research is generally used in the field of community health, marketing, sociology,economics, psychology, demographics, gender studies, political science. The objective of Quantitative Research is to employ mathematical theories in relation to phenomena. Quantitative Research is a methods to measure variables, analyse them and report among the studied variables through a numerical system. The objective is to understand, analyse, describe and give a prediction of a product or service. Quantitative Research will predict about products and services , can make the people understand the dynamics of changes to do in their products or services respectively. The questions about the research study are defined and all its aspects are designed , so that the data collected is reliable and accurate. The quantitative Research uses different tools to gather numerical data that is in the form of statistics and numbers are arranged in non-textual manner like figures , charts and tables. The Importance of Quantitative Research is that it helps tremendous help in studying samples and populations. It discusses detailed relevant questions like, where is the data come from, gap in the data, how robust is it and what are the exclusions in the data research. it is vital to describe the process of selection and describes the methods and tools that are being used by the researcher to collect the data. The quantitative research identifies variables that are being measured , gives a detailed description about applicable methods that is used in obtaining relevant data, notes down important criteria about the fact that the data was already in existence or the researcher has collected of its own. The importance of quantitative research is that it helps to describe the process or method for both processing and analyzing the data in detail, specific tools used for studying the research objective etc. In a quantitative method , the findings of research is written in a precise form that is entirely objective. The non-textual elements like graphs, charts, tables are there to give the overall description of available results. It also clarifies important points , so that the readers can understand the data in proper manner, as it was intend by. ",

            "answer_text": "Principally quantitative research provides objective numbers as opposed to subjective opinions. It is of course more complicated than that, though. This is for two reasons mainly. Firstly quantitative research can be misleading if not done right. This will often happen when outliers in the dataset aren\u2019t taken into account or correlation is wrongly assumed to be correlation, ie. independent and dependent variables are wrongly identified. The second point is often connected to the first. If quantitative research isn\u2019t backed by qualitative understanding incorrect assumptions about causation can be made. For example let\u2019s say two ethnic groups inhabit territory AB. A war breaks out, is inconclusive and it is split into A and B. Then a treaty is reached whereby people belonging to the A ethnic group left on the B side can freely move to A territory for two years. In year 3 a quantitative researcher looks at a town (Alpha) in A. Alpha\u2019s population has grown fast because of people using the treaty to cross the border. Quantitative research might lead one to conclude that the population growth in Years 1 and 2 will continue, but qualitative research will show that with the end of the treaty period the immigration will stop. In this case a qualitative understanding will better identify the causative factors. That said, the opposite can also be true. Election polling is a good example. People who are qualitative in their approach look at the polls and assume that they say the candidate with 51% in the polls will win. A quantitative approach would say 51\u201349 in the polls is a dead heat given a 3% margin of error. A real world example of this difference is the US presidential election of 2016 and the French presidential election of 2017. The polls were wrong in both, but most people seem to view them as performing worse in the US than France. In reality the opposite is true. Polling was less than 2% off in the US election, but that 2% made the difference in the outcome and meant Trump won instead of Clinton. Polling was off by far more in France, but it underestimated the size of Macron\u2019s victory over Le Pen. Because the polling error in France didn\u2019t change the outcome, qualitative approaches would say it was less wrong. But polling is quantitative and such an approach shows 2017 polling in France was much worse than 2016 polling in the US. What all of this means is that proper understanding of the real world requires both qualitative and quantitative research and understanding. ",
