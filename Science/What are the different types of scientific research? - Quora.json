            "answer_text": "This can be answered only in general terms, since research is carried out in most venues of human endeavors. I will answer with some vague general examples of matters that need to be cleared up. The Literature Search This is done by looking up in books and journals all that is known about a subject. Object Oriented Exploration Imagine Queen Isabella saying to Christopher Columbus \u201cSail across the ocean. Find new lands. Look for gold and bring it all back. If natives live there, convert them to Catholicism.\u201d Columbus didn\u2019t find much gold, but he brought back a lot of information that was, in the long run, much more valuable. Serendipity When you do diligent research, you may not get what you want, but you will invariably find some interesting things that no one has ever seen before. A wise research manager will recognize that new information discovered in this way gives you a secret key to a lock that no one else even knows about. Find a Solution to this Problem The problem might be a latch that wears out too quickly, or an epidemic disease for which no therapy or treatments are available, or an exploding population that threatens to bring down the empire. When No Information at is known at all about a Subject This is the sort of question like \u201cWhat do you do next when you have no idea what to do next\u201d. Problems like this give research a bad name, because the workers are just scrounging around in the dark, looking for a lead. And most of their efforts are fruitless. This is also the type of thing that makes the worker very famous and rich if they find anything. Detective Work Some people have developed ( through experience ) an ability to know where to look for the answer to a problem. Frequently it may involve the equivalent of canvassing the neighborhood, or staking out a suspect, or taking a closer look at similar crimes on the block, or doing a back ground check on all the people involved. When Buckets of False Information is conveyed by Partys with Self Interest Here at least you know where to start : you can investigate each of the allegations and find which one \u2014 if any \u2014 contains a grain of truth. Experimental, Observational and Theoretical Research You go out and test some conjectures with lab experiments, like in chemistry. You just observe the phenomena carefully and look for trends, like in astronomy or animal behavior. You adapt existing theories that explain other phenomena to explain YOUR phenomena, like in unusual electrical or quantum mechanical events. Planning a Research Approach to the Problem There are schools where they teach you how to use classical, modern and speculative methods of research, for all the kinds of the difficult situations listed above. Send one of your boys to that school, or find the people who have this training and hire them as consultants. As you see, this could be time consuming and expensive. And you should have also gathered by this time that much research does not yield the results desired. The problem is not hopeless however. After all, The Russians had music schools where they taught the student how to create new melodies. If they can teach creativity in Art schools, they can surely teach research techniques ( applicable to the situations listed above ) in our graduate schools, which is exactly what they do there. ",

But put simply (which is always dangerous!), scientific research uses techniques that produce verifiable data, and uses agreed ways of analysing the data to create testable theories. These theories are then tested in further research. Some of these theories become sufficiently strong that they lead to usable pieces of understanding. On rare occasions they seem so strong they get called \u2018laws\u2019. ",
