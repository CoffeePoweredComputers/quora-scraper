            "answer_text": "DEFINITIONS -- THE UNIVERSE There is only \u201c ONE \u201c Universe, and has always been here, and is infinite. You can not expand infinite, change, or reduce it. OUR FORMATION \u201c OUR \u201c formation is all of the Galaxies around us - to make it simple. There could be any number formations like ours, or only one - \u201c OURS \u201c which could be part of another or several other formations like ours. During the expansion of OUR FORMATION - ( The electromagnetic spectrum has accelerated at the speed of light sense it\u2019s developed, and continues to the present. Matter has been expanding at a much slower rates. ) - The \"GRAVITATIONAL PULL\" from the FREE FORM GRAVITY, ENERGY, and MATTER that extends far beyond the present location of our galaxies is pulling the galaxies outward, and to be clear, the electromagnetic spectrum and matter are moving in all directions. OUTWARD ACCELERATION of the GALAXIES During the expansion of OUR FORMATION - ( The electromagnetic spectrum has accelerated at the speed of light sense it's developed, and continues to the present. Matter has been expanding at a much slower rates. ) - The \" GRAVITATIONAL PULL \" from the FREE FORM GRAVITY, ENERGY, and MATTER that extends far beyond the present location of our galaxies is pulling the galaxies outward, and to be clear, the electromagnetic spectrum and matter are moving in all directions. Our formation will reduce its acceleration rate as the gravity pulling us outward thins and loses strength. Our formation will continue to move outward even after the gravitational pull becomes negligible due to the momentum attained. There after the velocity would remain constant because there is no resistance, and will be equal to very small percentage of the speed of light. If you did get to the edge of \u201c OUR FORMATION \u201c, the light you would be emitting would extend our formation at the speed of light in fount of you, so you can never get to the edge. There was never a Big Bang, the beginning our formation began with a little \u201c UMPH \u201c. TIME There is \u201c NO \u201c space-time if that\u2019s what you are referring to. 1. GRAVITY works just fine be itself. 2. TIME and EXISTENCE -- \" TIME \" is just a measurement. It is constant wherever you are. The accuracy of the instrument you use will be influenced by gravity, centrifugal force, heat, and a few other variables. There is no \" TIME DIMENSION \". There is no possibility of \" TIME TRAVEL \". All that exists, does so in the present \" INDIVISIBLE \" moment. There is \u201c NO \u201c space-time, gravity works just fine by itself. Time is space-times Achilles' heel. The mind can interpret it\u2019s surroundings and interchanges with the environment in different ways at different times depending on the \u201c STRESS \u201c levels - as one example. Therefore, realization of time can very. http://www.aslodge.com/time http://www.creationoftheuniverse.org/ - How it all got started. By Robert Evan Howard / aslodge. com ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, I had no idea that someone could come up with a statement that the Universe expands an contracts every billion years. Come on Charles. Stop smoking the good stuff. The questions is all messed up. It should have stated: Is the Universe expanding or contracting. And the correct answer is that it is expanding and doing so at an accelerating pace. No need to go into the details. But at the current rate, when the last star goes Supernova in about 100 trillion years, the universe will have expanded to something in the range of 10e+35 light years. And it may be much more based on how much longer the accelerated expansions lasts. To put this in perspective, the current universe is 93 billion light years across. To equate this to 10e+35, imagine this. There are approximately 3 x 10e+26 drops of water on our planet, including he oceans, lakes, rivers, toilet bowls, water heaters, swimming pools and bottles water at the supermarkets. That is a lot of drops. Now line those drops up next to each other. At 1/4 inch per drop, it takes 7.5 million drop to make 1 mile, So all those drops would add up to 4 x 10e+17 miles. That amounts to 65,000 light years, or about from here to the other side of the Milky Way We are not done :) For 10e+35 drops, the line of water drops would extend to 6.5 x 10e+14 light years: 65-trillion light years (650,000,000,000,000) ! And remember, we\u2019re only talking water drops. now look at 10e+35 light years \u2026 Yes numbers get mind boggling when you start realizing the size of things in the universe today and in the future.
