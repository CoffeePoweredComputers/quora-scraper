            "answer_text": " I sure this topic will be around for some time. In California, there are signs posted stating don\u2019t use cell phone while pumping gas. Yet, almost overtime I am at a pump, someone is talking on their cell phone. There is some history behind this. Others have stated that gasoline tanks have exploded while a person was pumping gas in their car. There is no hard information to support this episode of events. However, experts say a static charge might ignite gas vapors which may start a fire. A fact is mobile phones should not be used around materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes, chemicals, dust, solvents. Mobile phones should be turned off before entering an area where other materials that generate flammable fumes. Petroleum Equipment Institute says that static electricity discharge is a major culprit for fires at the gas pump. Wireless phones never caused ignition or explosion at a station anywhere in the world. However, a ringing cell phone does produce static electricity (due to lithium battery). FCC says it is theoretically possible for a spark from a cell phone battery to ignite gas vapor, but the threat is remote. Following a few rules will reduce risks: Turn off engine to your vehicleDon\u2019t re-enter your vehicle while refuelingDon\u2019t smoke around the pumpsAlthough I have never seen this at a gas station, I don\u2019t want to be there if it happens.

            "answer_text": "Sometimes if you forgot to turn off your phone, and put it in your pocket, you can feel your phone is getting hotter and hotter, or you talk on your cell phone for a long time or maybe about an hour, your phone is getting hot. Some people said cell phones caught on fire a few times while people were talking, but I have never heard of that news report. For precaution reason, some gas stations put warning signs at the pumps, telling people to turn off engines and don\u2019t use cell phone while pumping gas. Turning off engine is a safety precaution too, some people were on daydream, they forgot the gas nozzle was still sticking in the gas tank inlet, they were sitting inside the cars, talking on cell phones, suddenly they remembered they had to do something right away, so they shifted in gear and drove away without taking the nozzles off their cars, gasoline was spilt all over at the gas pump. That is why from now on, everybody has to turn off car engine and cell phone. ",
