            "answer_text": "If a charged particle is accelerated from rest then its KE will be qV. Electrical energy supplied e work domne by electric field on charged particle is E=qV ( V is the potentioal difference and this is measured in Joules/Coulomb (ofen called volts). q is the charge of the particle measured in joules. For many partciles like electrons/proptons with a single charge, the value of q is 1.6 x 10^-19 C - this value is a fundamental constant- and given the symbol \u2018e\u2019. So for paricles with a single (+ or -) charge the energy is eV. When work is done on a particle like a free electron or proton, the only energy it can gain is kinetic. These simple particles cant do anything else besides move. So all the work done goes to make it move faster/ gain KE. This is not the cas if the particle is not free/ subject to fields etc because then there is the possibility of changes in potential energy. ",
