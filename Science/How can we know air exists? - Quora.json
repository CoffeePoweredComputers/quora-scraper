            "answer_text": "Fill a bucket about halfway with water. Take an \u201cempty\u201d glass. Place the glass upside down over the bucket, and slowly push it down into the water. You will notice the water doesn\u2019t fill the glass, that is because it is actually not empty, but full of something, this something is what we call \u201cair\u201d. So there is a very simple proof of its existence, but it doesn\u2019t tell us much about it. As you push the glass down, you\u2019ll observe a couple interesting things, related to some properties of gases and liquids (air and water, in this case). You might realize how, as the air in the glass and the water in the bucket push against each other, the air compresses and decreases in volume, allowing a small amount of water to enter the glass, yet, when you pull the glass back up, the air retains its original volume, pushing the water back out. There are many observations that can be made through this small experiment, but that\u2019s not what the question is about. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How can we know air exists? We can\u2019t, obviously, because it is invisible. We just have to infer its existence by the effect it has on the world and take it on faith that air exists since there\u2019s just no possible way to detect it directly. Just like God, am I right?  Seriously, this is one of the lamest analogies for God that has ever been devised, since we can actually directly detect air and even see it under certain conditions. And yes, given the topics associated with this question, I am assuming the purpose was to make an analogy with God just like all the other times theists have tried to compare an unseen God with air: Barry Goldberg's answer to \"You can't see the air but you know that it's around.\u201d What do atheists think of this argument?
