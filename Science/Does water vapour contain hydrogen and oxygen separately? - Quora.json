            "answer_text": "No, water vapours are the H2O molecules which have such large distances and low intermolecular forces between them such that they take up the gaseous form. But, as Wayne Peltier has pointed it out, H2O molecules in vapour can decompose into Hydrogen and Oxygen only at very high temperatures like 2200 Celsius and above. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Water is a molecule. Molecules stay unchanged in solid, liquid and vapor phases. The only things that change are the inter-molecular interactions. Chemical bonds are too energetic. There are other (larger molecule) compounds that are unstable when heated; these fall apart before they can be vaporized. Water molecules are stable up to very high temperatures, way higher than the boiling temperature. ",
