            "answer_text": "INTRODUCTION: My answer here was to a similar question which has been merged into this question. That other question had question comments that made it obvious that it was about electron affinity rather than electronegativity. Unfortunately those comments were not transferred. There are plenty of answers here that discuss fluorine\u2019s electronegativity, so I will leave my answer as it was, dealing with the related topic of electron affinity. ANSWER: Fluorine\u2019s electron affinity is something that chemistry students sometimes ask about, but they don\u2019t always get a satisfactory answer! In fact, it\u2019s hard to explain properly without discussing atomic orbitals as described by the mathematics of quantum mechanics. In simple terms, the \u201cnew\u201d electron is attracted to the positive nucleus, but repelled by other electrons. So, it\u2019s a sort of \u201cbattle\u201d between the attraction of the nucleus and repulsion by the electrons. It turns out that the nucleus \u201cwins\u201d, in this case. The small size of the atom is important in making the effect of the nucleus more significant. Hence fluorine has a high electron affinity (for the first electron to be added). Only chlorine has a higher electron affinity. It just so happens that there is one orbital in a fluorine atom that is suitable for a new electron to occupy. That\u2019s often called the octet rule \u2014 a reference to the number of electrons (eight) in the outer \u201cshell\u201d. It\u2019s not a perfect rule, but it often works. Here\u2019s the Wikipedia article about the octet rule. It does discuss the explanation based on quantum mechanics, but without going into the mathematics: Octet rule - Wikipedia This is also useful: electron affinity You are really asking about electron affinity rather than electronegativity. However, the two things are closely related. The details are a bit complicated. For example, chlorine has a slightly higher electron affinity than fluorine, but fluorine is the most electronegative atom. Here\u2019s a page that discusses the theory in more detail, but still manages to avoid any really difficult mathematics: Origin of Octet Rule ",

            "answer_text": "Stock answer is, all halogens are general assholes. They gave 7 electrons on their outermost (valence) shell. This, for some reason, makes them very eager to get 8. Fluorine is the smallest of halogens. This mean there are fewer layers of electrons between fluorine\u2019s valence shell and nucleus. With few electrons to shield the nucleus, the pull of the nucleus at the valence shell is extra strong. Fluorine is the king asshole. Chlorine is the next baddest halogen, but it is larger and there are a lot more electrons in between the nucleus and the valence shell. The long answer would be; why would having 7 electrons in valence shell make you an asshole? That answer would be quite long, and most people would be surprised that you ask such weird questions. So stick to the dogma: You need 8 electrons in valence shell to become stable. ",
