            "answer_text": "No, hydrogen peroxide isn\u2019t a cure for cirrhotic live. Four percent of hydrogen peroxide mixed with muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) that a volume of 53 to 58%, it will dissolve gold plating Among other applications, hydrogen peroxide is used as a disinfectant. It is used to treat inflammation of the gums and to disinfectant (drinking) water. It is also used to combat excessive microbial growth in water systems and cooling towers. ... This increases the amount of oxygen in water. H202 is also used to kill bacteria, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, viruses, fungi, ringworm and more. Disinfectant cleaner with powerful surfactant-(mixed with detergents) that effectively cleans while it disinfects and disinfects while it cleans. Effective Against a Broad Spectrum of difficult to kill Pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is most commonly used to remove pollutants from waste water and from air. It contests bacterial growth (for example bio fouling in water systems) H-O-O-H has one extra oxygen atom than water H-H-O or H20 It is really a strong oxidizer and one time it was used in rocket fuel. H2O2 explode on the Russian submarine Kiss causing a fire in the engine room. The fire set in a series of exploding torpedo\u2019s. ",

Wounds used to be irrigated with H2O2 but studies found the tissue damage not worth it. The whole ingestion (or injection) of peroxide thing is a pile of poop. Also beware of ozone (O3) therapy another faddish oxygen delivery nostrum that refuses to go away. ",
