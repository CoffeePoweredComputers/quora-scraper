            "answer_text": "Although the Earth's magnetic field resembles that of a bar magnet we must find another explanation for the field's origin. Permanent magnets cannot exist at the temperatures found in the Earth's core. We also know that the Earth has had a magnetic field for hundreds of millions of years. We cannot, however, simply attribute the existence of the present geomagnetic field to some event in the distant past. Magnetic fields decay, and we can show that the existing geomagnetic field would disappear in about 15,000 years unless there were a mechanism to continually regenerate it. Many mechanisms have been postulated to explain how the magnetic field is generated, but the only one that is now considered plausible is analogous to a dynamo, or generator - a devise for converting mechanical energy to electrical energy. To understand how a dynamo would work in the context of the Earth, we need to understand the physical conditions in the Earth's interior. The Earth is composed of layers: a thin outer crust, a silicate mantle, an outer core and an inner core. Both temperature and pressure increase with depth within the Earth. The temperature at the core mantle boundary is roughly 4800\u00b0 C, hot enough for the outer core to exist in a liquid state. The inner core, however, is solid because of increased pressure. The core is composed primarily of iron, with a small percentage of lighter elements. The outer core is in constant motion, due both to the Earth's rotation and to convection. The convection is driven by the upward motion of the light elements as the heavier elements freeze onto the inner core.  Earth's interior The actual process by which the magnetic field is produced in this environment is extremely complex, and many of the parameters required for a complete solution of the mathematical equations describing the problem are poorly known. However, the basic concepts are not difficult. For magnetic field generation to occur several conditions must be met: there must be a conducting fluid;there must be enough energy to cause the fluid to move with sufficient speed and with the appropriate flow pattern;there must be a \"seed\" magnetic field.All these conditions are met in the outer core. Molten iron is a good conductor. There is sufficient energy to drive convection, and the convective motion, coupled with the Earth's rotation, produce the appropriate flow pattern. Even before the Earth's magnetic field was first formed magnetic fields were present in the form of the sun's magnetic field. Once the process is going, the existing field acts as the seed field. As a stream of molten iron passes through the existing magnetic field, an electric current is generated through a process called magnetic induction. The newly created electric field will in turn create a magnetic field. Given the right relationship between the magnetic field and the fluid flow, the generated magnetic field can reinforces the initial magnetic field. As long as there is sufficient fluid motion in the outer core, the process will continue. To completely describe how the geomagnetic field is generated it is necessary to solve simultaneous equations describing the electromagnetic and thermal conditions in the Earth's core list ten such equations. These include Maxwell's equations which describe the interaction between magnetic fields and electric currents, the Navier-Stokes equation which describes the fluid motion in the outer core, and equations describing the gravity potential, the heat flow, and many other parameters. Each equation is, in turn, dependent on the boundary conditions and the initial conductions chosen. These are often poorly known. A good deal of physical insight is gained by examining the magnetic induction equation. \u2202B\u20d7 \u2202t=\u2207x(v\u20d7 xB)+1\u03c3\u03bc\u22072B\u20d7 [math]\u2202B\u2192\u2202t=\u2207x(v\u2192xB)+1\u03c3\u2062\u03bc\u2062\u22072B\u2192[/math] B is the magnetic field vector, v is a velocity vector, t is time, F is the conductivity and \u03bc is the magnetic permeability (equal to \u03bc0) in this case. The first term on the right-hand side represents the interaction between the magnetic field and a moving conductor, which causes build-up (or breakdown) of the magnetic field. The second term on the right-hand side is the diffusion term. If the velocity is zero, the first term on the right-hand-side disappears. The remaining terms tell us that in the absence of a moving conductor the magnetic field will die away exponentially. The time constant is about 15,000 years. We can set the second term equal to zero by assuming that the fluid is a perfect conductor (\u03c3 = \u221e). Under these conditions, magnetic field lines become \"frozen\" into the conducting fluid, always moving with it. This behaviour of the field lines is important in explaining the mechanism by which the magnetic field is generated. Two other concepts must be described at this point: poloidal fields and toroidal fields. A poloidal field is one which has a radial component. This is the type of field with which we are all familiar since dipole fields are poloidal. A toroidal field, on the other hand, is ring or donut shaped, with no radial component. In the Earth, toroidal fields are confined to the core and are not detectible at the Earth's surface. Nevertheless they play an important role in the production of the magnetic field.  Poloidal field (left) and toroidal field (right) Suppose that the core rotates with an angular velocity that depends on its radius. Consider what will happen to a poloidal field whose field lines are \"frozen in\" so that they move along with the fluid. If the fluid is moving more slowly in the upper part of the outer core, those field lines will be left behind compared to field lines closer to the centre. Eventually, after a complete circuit, two toroidal loops will be formed, as shown in the diagram. This is called the \u03c9-effect - a mechanism by which poloidal fields are converted to toroidal fields.  \u03c9-effect Now consider a field line from a toroidal field, frozen into a rising convective cell. The field line will be pulled along with the cell. Since the Earth is rotating, the Coriolis force will cause the upwelling fluid to rotate counterclockwise (in the northern hemisphere). The field line will be twisted along with the fluid, and after a quarter turn, a poloidal magnetic loop is produced. This process is called the \u03b1-effect - a mechanism by which toroidal fields are converted to poloidal fields. The poloidal loops can merge to produce a large poloidal field.  \u03b1-effect Various methods have been proposed by which the \u03b1-effect and the \u03c9-effect can generate the Earth's magnetic field. These go by the acronyms \u03b1\u03c9, \u03b12, \u03b12,\u03c9. In the \u03b1\u03c9 dynamo, the motion of the fluid, associated with differential rotation of the outer core, through the poloidal field lines give rise to a toroidal field in the outer core. The twisting of toroidal field lines frozen in upwelling fluid, gives rise, in turn, to poloidal fields which can reinforce the original poloidal field. To maintain a steady-state magnetic field ( \u2202B\u20d7 \u2202t=0[math]\u2202B\u2192\u2202t=0[/math] ) the rate at which the field is generated by the \u03b1\u03c9-effect must equal the rate of diffusion. If they are not equal, the field will either grow or decay, which is probably the normal situation. my blog :akhilesXPERIENCE ",

            "answer_text": "The standard model posits a dynamo at the center of the earth produces the magnetic field though this is highly speculative and untested. And has no basis in the observed electromagnetic connection which are the primary energy conduits which light and heat the earth. I also suspect we might have two mag fields as the sun does tho the second has yet to be discovered. The solar system is an electromagnetic circuit transfering energy from the sun to the planets and back again. This energy is transfered via Birkeland Currents and the solar wind in the form of electrons and protons. The electrons are captured by the magnetosphere and are funneled into the poles in the form of field aligned currents. It is well understood that electric currents produce magnetic fields and i suspect something of this nature is what produces Earths. These field aligned currents at the poles are not the only example of an electric circuit on earth. There is also the equatorial electro jet as well as proton drift from the ionosphere down to negative earth charging air molecules on the way producing a high pressure system. It should be noted that the alleged dynamo has never been observed. Through an earthquake induced sonar method they have observed a core as dense as lead, but is it lead. There have also been other interpretations suggesting a less dense core(not a hollow core as some suggest). In the end any honest person will say we dont really know what produces earth\u2019s magnetosphere. I favor the electric hypothesis over the dynamo as the former has a basis in observation, whereas the latter is born of a paradigm. ",
