            "answer_text": "It kills them through pulmonary edema. 1 molecule of Phosgene breaks down with water to from 2 molecules of hydrochloric acid and 1 molecule of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide isn't really that big of a problem, it's the hydrochloric acid that burns the lungs. The reaction is very similar to chlorine gas where CL2 + H2O forms HCL and HOCL acids. So both Phosgene and chlorine kill and damage eyes and mucous membranes through HCl acid formation. Phosgene is 4.25 kg/m3 wheras chlorine is 2.89 kg/ m3. So Phosgene being denser will lie in low places longer (trench warfare) and since it produces 2 moles of HCL it is almost twice as effective as chlorine, because HCL is a stronger acid than HOCL. Phosgene is also supposed to have a pleasant odor, so soldiers may not immediately recognize they are being poisoned. My grandfather was in WWII and said they were exposed to it in training and it smelled like freshly mowed grass. Chlorine on the other hand has an immediate acidic choking smell, which immediately alerts the soldier to it's presence and gives them time to put on a gas mask. ",
