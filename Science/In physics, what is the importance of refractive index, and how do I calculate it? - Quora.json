            "answer_text": "The refractive index [math]n[/math] of a material is the factor by which an electromagnetic wave slows down inside of that material compared to the speed of light [math]c_0[/math] in vacuum. Given these parameters, the speed of a wave [math]v[/math] is [math]v = \\frac{c_0}{n}[/math] If you dig deep enough, you will even find that refractive index can be a complex number to not only describe the speed but also the decay of a wave due to absorption loss. Refractive index is important because when the speed of wave changes, the direction of the wave can also change. This is called refraction. Lenses are based on refraction along with many other devices and they are all designed via the refractive index. If you aim to calculate the refractive index, you will need to calculate that from measurements. Ellipsometry is probably the most popular method for doing so. Here you measure reflection from a thin film of some material and you are able to calculate refractive index and even thickness of thin films from the reflection measurements. Ellipsometry - Wikipedia Like Werbok said, refractive index is usually the thing that is given to you and then you calculate other things from it. Here are some examples of common equations using refractive index. Wave \u2014 The equation for a wave propagating in the [math]+z[/math] direction is [math]\\vec{E} = \\vec{P} \\cos \\left( \\omega t - k_0 n z \\right)[/math]., where [math]\\vec{P}[/math] is the polarization vector, [math]\\omega[/math] is the radial frequency, [math]t[/math] is time, [math]k_0 = 2 \\pi / \\lambda_0[/math] is the free space wave number, [math]\\lambda_0[/math] is the free space wavelength, [math]n[/math] is refractive index, and [math]z[/math] is position. Snell\u2019s Law \u2014 When a wave passes from one material into another and it changes speed, the wave can change directions. This is called refraction and is described by Snell\u2019s Law, [math]n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2[/math]. [math]n_1[/math] is the refractive index of the first medium, [math]\\theta_1[/math] is the angle of the wave in the first medium, [math]n_2[/math] is the refractive index of the second medium, and [math]\\theta_2[/math] is the angle of the wave in the second medium.  Reflectance \u2014 The reflectance [math]R[/math] is the fraction of power reflected from an interface between two materials having different refractive index. [math]R = |(n_1 - n_2)/(n_1 + n_2)|^2[/math].  Lens Maker\u2019s Formula \u2014 This equation is used to design a lens. It relates the curvatures, [math]R_1[/math] and [math]R_2[/math], of the lens and refractive index [math]n[/math] of the lens to the focal length [math]f[/math]. [math]\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)[/math] If you want to learn more about these topics, I recommend the videos under Topic 3 here: EE3321 EMF | EM Lab and Topic 3 here: Applied EM | EM Lab ",

            "answer_text": "The refractive index of optical materials is the main property used for all geometric optical design of optical instruments. Microscopes, telescopes, eyeglasses, contact lenses, magnifiers and minifiers of all kinds are designed around the refractive index of materials. The refractive index is also commonly used to measure to concentration of solutions, such as the amount of alcohol in wine or beer, and the health of flooded lead-acid batteries. I suppose it may be theoretically possible to calculate the refractive index of a material as an exercise or test of some theory of material science. However, the usual way is to determine a material\u2019s refractive index is to measure it directly with an instrument known unsurprisingly as a refractometer. Note that this property varies significantly with the wavelength of light used. ",
