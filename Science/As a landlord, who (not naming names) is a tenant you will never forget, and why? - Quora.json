            "answer_text": "from Mrs. George Johnson . . . THIS IS EASY WITHOUT ME TAKING A BREATH. My Tenant who I inherited when my mother passed away and mom gave me the building. The Tenant was always late paying the rent; she had 3 kids and I thought that was OK but I came to pick up the rent \u201cunannounced\u201d once just to check on my property and a man answered the door. He opened it and said, \u201cWhatever you are selling, I\u2019m not interested and leave my property and don\u2019t come back because I don\u2019t like any solicitations.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026you live here and he said, \u201cYES and slammed the door in my face.\u201d I went home and drafted a \u201c30 day\u201d notice to leave and stated in the letter why she was being evicted. Being a \u201cNEW\u201d Landlord, I had not learned the \u201cins and out\u201d of the game (yes it is a business but a GAME as well that if you don\u2019t know it in some STATES\u2026you will get burned and I got scorched and continue to read why). THE CITY OF CHICAGO, DOES NOT ALLOW EVICTIONS IN THE WINTER IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OF A MINOR CHILD (repeat offender know this game). It was October when I gave my Tenant the notice for eviction; we had a court date, we went to court and she asked the Judge for a continuance twice stating it would be traumatic for her 3 children who were all minors (a statement that gave me the clue she had done this before) and it was granted. We are now in the first week of December and the Judge ruled in my favor. Happy as can be I was set to evict her but you have to deliver the notice to the Sheriff at this point. The Sheriff Department said, \u201cWe will resume evictions in March of next year.\u201d I said what? The Sheriff Department enlightened me as to Chicago policy & procedures on evictions and further stated that the city does about 400 evictions a week and if you come back in March we can\u2019t get to you until about a month later if you are the first in line and that is about the second week of April. Happiness turned to tears (my Tenant, her 3 children and boyfriend stayed in my home for seven (7) months and did not pay one cent in rent (that was $3,500.00 of rent loss out of my pocket that did not included the utilities that I paid \u2014water, electric & heat). It did not stop there, in April right before they left, my neighbor told me that she witnessed my Tenant\u2019s boyfriend get on the roof of the building and drill holes REALLY fast and before calling the police\u2026he was down in about 15 minutes. The inspector I hired verified that a drill was used to drill several holes in the roof which when it rained, damaged the inside of my building and the water turned into mole and the inspector noticed the toilet would not flush and there was no water. He said a construction grade cement had been poured down each toilet. These were tenants from hell that cost me thousands of dollars and I spent enough money on them and recouping from this nightmare and THIS WAS THE GOOD PART OF IT, THE REALLY BAD THINGS they did is not enough room to state. Thereafter, have to hire an attorney and detective to locate them (this became a criminal matter), its as if they disappeared off the face of the earth and because of what happened to me here is FREE advice to the next generation before you rent: MAKE SURE ANY & ALL UTILITIES ARE IN YOUR TENANTS NAME (NOT YOURS), INCLUDE A \u201cMONITARY PENALTY\u201d FOR A RENTAL VIOLATION AND ONLY EXECUSE IT \u201cONCE\u201d AND STIPULATE \u201cANY & ALL\u201d CONCERNS THAT \u201cBAD TENANTS\u201d HAVE DONE IN THE PAST DOWN TO A \u201cSTIPULATION CLAUSE\u201d IN YOUR LEASE AGREEMENT. Also, if it is a month-to-month or Lease, put CORE stipulation clauses there with monetary damages. If the tenant won\u2019t sign it, then DO NOT RENT to them. Last, weed out the creeps and charge an application fee. GOOD LUCK TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF LANDLORDS, this experience will save & help all of you. ",

            "answer_text": "I had renovated my smaller home in 2014 following a lack of electricity which caused me severe damages. The plumbing\u2019s new piece had been badly installed by one of my neighbor who claimed plumber\u2019s skills .I decided to take the smaller home and rent the bigger home. I had an elderly couple, in their late seventies who came to visit and filled me an application. Immediately, I went to the Rental Board for verification, if these tenants had previous rental issues with other landlords. They no longer worked ,therefore, difficult to find much information on them. I found nothing , but my intuition spoke volume. Within a week they came back and signed the lease. They included a clause of \u201cfamily residence\u201d which in my 25 years experience, it had never been used. Now, I was on high alert and gave my file to my lawyer friend to look in Court\u2019s records. There ,we found hundreds of judgements against both the couple for fraud. Also ,the judgment of the previous landlord who lost $64,000 with them not paying rent for almost three years. I contacted the previous attorney and I got the full scoop. I laid low waiting!. They paid for 7 months, late but paid. Then, they started to miss, I jumped in the ring at the Rental Board. They paid , then he bragged to my neighbor that he would stay for two years plus rent free. I went back to the rental Board. He concocted a scheme pretending that water fell from the ceiling and he slipped and broke his head. Now he was suing me and the Insurance company. The judge of previous landlord had made a mistake by not correcting the previous alias name he had used, changing and \u2018S\u201d for a \u2018t\u201d. That was the reason I could not find them at first. The judge must have been fired because I took the tapes of the court and proved negligence on her part. My present male judge was sharp and understood the whole ordeal, and evicted them out of my house immediately. I lost several months rent, but a judicial case followed where the insurance company, paid off my tenants several thousands of dollars out of fear of being stuck in Court\u2019s litigation for several years with these professional crooks. Hearing that they were getting money, I decided I would not cooperate with the insurance, if I was was not paid completely myself.. I was fit to be tied by such a crooked system. Imagine paying for fraud artists as such. I am glad that I insisted at least I recuperated my losses. As for the female judge, who made the errors, she was either fired or quit. But I found her in the Small Claims Court while working on another case. She was waiting for me with a\u201d lantern and a brick.\u201d She was spewing revenge. That will be another. chapter in Philomena\u2019s follies! Do be patient! ",

            "answer_text": "Over the years many tenants became unforgettable: a couple for positive reasons. M was a young man (showed up on a bike and looked more the part of a paper boy) who came to see two of my houses. Nice guy with a good income and a \u2018graduate \u2018 of the Prince of Darkness (landlord who revelled in sharp practise) so I knew the rent would be timely. M had a request. I rented him a house with a large backyard. He wanted to build a fence to keep his kids out of the alley. I bought the supplies and he built a good fence. He constructed a double gate that stayed strong and square for 18 years. He became very popular in the neighbourhood (baked bread and people followed their noses). When he moved away, people missed him. Later, he returned with a different wife to see a property and his ex wife showed up to see another place. I would have rented to them both. I asked M about his ex and later his ex about M. T was 19 when he applied for a house I managed. Essentially a native kid, but he had a good job and a wife and child - was paying all the bills at home and told me if he was paying, he might as well get his own place. My only reservation was his extreme youth, but he seemed to have a good head on his shoulders and would certainly outgrow being 19. I rented to him and a few months later he lost his job (seasonal work). He told me immediately and promised to pay the rent. He kept his word. He\u2019d get odd jobs and every time he had money, he phoned me. At the end of two years, he owed $50. He once told me he was looking at apartments and no one would rent to him. He saw my ad for a three bedroom house and figured he\u2019d call and take a look - but never expected me to rent it to him. K made the list because of his profession. He paid the rent on time and in full and turned out he ran a small business out of the house. Yawn, right? Well, he sold drugs. He was the easiest eviction in my career. Three days after I posted the fourteen day notice of substantial breach, his friends moved out all of his stuff. J was one of my last tenants and she was a waste of space - unstable too. She conned Catholic Social Services - or tried to - by withholding funds she was given to pay the rent. Nice little scam she had going. She did so many stupid things but I will mention two . She told people she owned the house. I discovered this when I was there to fix the roof. A woman was walking down the sidewalk and, pointing at my house, yelled \u201cWhere\u2019s the owner?\u201d Me: That would be me W: No, she\u2019s blonde I shot her a text, demanding to know why she was telling people she owned the house. Was she trying to steal it? Was she planning on renting it to someone? Her reply was what\u2019s the difference? When she moved in, she received a water bill (billed every two months) that included time when the house was vacant. I agreed to let her use $200 of the rent to pay that bill. Idiot girl decided to try and scam CSS by receiving the full amount of the rent and withholding $200. I would write partial payment on the memo line of the CSS receipt and tell her the rest was due before the end of the month with late fees included. She would nod ( a whatever nod). She would later call me and yell, telling me we had agreed to reduced rent. I reminded her of the circumstances of that $200. I also reminded her that I told her the rest of the rent was due. Oh, no. Would I go to CSS and tell them she paid all the rent? - Ah, no. Not lying for you. JD he was a real piece of work. Wrecked my house, fixed a lawnmower in the living room causing a near permanent oil stain in the carpet, underlay and pine floor. Cleaning the carpet didn\u2019t work - neither did replacing it. He once told me I did not own my house - my mother did. He also accused my father of embezzling. He paid rent sporadically and when I told him what he owed, he told me if I was going to be that way, he\u2019d leave! Promises, promises. ",

            "answer_text": "First there was Anastasia, then Garfield, and now Cheeto. Yes, I am talking about cats! These cats have for some reason come to be castaways at a property of mine. Thankfully not all at once. The property is a duplex and a house, Anastasia wandered on to the property and decided she liked the tenants in the front duplex, much to their chagrin. They liked her but were allergic to her fur. She had the kindest eyes and a strange manor to climb into your lap, sit up on her hind legs and pat you with her paw on your shoulder. Clearly she had secrets she wanted to tell. The tenants persuaded me that since a hurricane (Irma) was coming, I must take her in. So I did. She was sweet, she did not make my other two cats mad. She immediately knew to sleep right by my side the whole while the storm was raging. By morning, I was now showing signs of allergies to her short-grey tabby fur. It is important to mention here that I am VERY allergic to dogs. My lips swell, my eyes swell, my throat starts to swell. I really don\u2019t know what would happen if I just went beyond the half-an-hour that it takes for these reactions. Guessing, it can\u2019t be good. I put Anastasia in my garage since there were power lines down and such, due to Irma. At the time, I was lucky and got power back quick. I brought over friends to feed them, their power was out. AND I brought out Anastasia. We all suffered the same swelling, except the other two were NOT allergic to a dogs/cat previously. I let her out the next day. The neighbor adopted her. For this I am grateful. She was SOOOO sweet but, I am not sure I could have gotten past my allergies. Next\u2026Garfield. My tenants got themselves in a LOT of trouble with social services. I guess it was over drugs. They had to give their kids to their grandparents and take hospitality jobs at the hotels by the beach. They moved from my house to a hotel room. Except Garfield the cat was still at my rental house. Orange tabby on top, white on the bottom, sadly sat in the yard for a week waiting for his family to come back. I contacted them and offered to take their last load of things and the cat to their room. This would be in my truck and for FREE. At least Garfield could be reunited! Now I have Cheeto wandering the property, a total orange tabby. His family said that he was just \u201cdropped off\u201d by one of their friends. He needed to be fixed, I offered to take him. Somewhere along the way he was fixed. The family moved away. Cheeto was always outside. He is sooo sweet. Comes right up with all the purs and love you would expect from your own cat. Not sure what I am going to do. For now my tenants feed him outside. You can\u2019t ever forget the cats! ~stay well~ ",

            "answer_text": "The most memorable tenant I had made me quit. I didn\u2019t rent to this lady (we\u2019ll call her B) at all. She moved in with my tenant, just before he was to move out, without my ever having met her. My actual tenant was moving because his lease was up and I needed the apartment for my mother. Before he moved he apparently let his gf move in with him without asking me. When he moved, he left her there. When I discovered B on my property, and in possession of keys, she gave me a sob story about how he (we\u2019ll call him O)hadn\u2019t told her that the lease was up and he was moving. According to B, O had snuck out in the middle of the night and had stolen all of her money. B told me that, when O moved into my apartment, he had left her pregnant and living in the woods. I felt really sorry for her so, when she told me that she had no money and no place to go, I felt sorry for her and told her she could stay for a month. This was September and my mom would be here in October. My rental is on the property on which I live, and I have cameras all around my house, so I could plainly see that B never left my apartment to go to work or look for a place to live. October came and so did my mom. Not only did B not move, but she allowed a new man to move in behind my back (or so she thought it was behind my back) and had her 10 year old daughter there on weekends. Meanwhile, O warned me that she was going to be a problem for me, without ever apologizing for leaving me with his problem. When my mom arrived, I reminded B that I needed my property back and that I\u2019d been carrying her for a month now. A task I couldn\u2019t really afford. B told me that she had some money coming in \u201ca few days\u201d and would be out of my hair. For the entire month of October, B gave me nothing but excuses and sob stories. Her daughter needed surgery, her grandpa was dying, etcetera. Meanwhile, I\u2019m footing the utilities for B, her daughter, and her new \u201cman\u201d (who hides whenever he sees me) and my mom is stuck sleeping in my great room. Throughout October she kept telling me that she had money coming \u201cany day now\u201d. On November 1st, I posted a 30 day notice to vacate on her door. Her answer to that was to start having loud parties that disturbed my family, and to bang on my walls whenever the mood struck. On December 1st I filed for eviction. Her answer to that was to start a catering service from (my) home and double my power bill. She also answered the summons with nothing but lies. She claimed that had actually been paying me rent and included copies of 3 forged receipts. I wasn\u2019t evicting her for non payment, I was evicting her for personal use of property, but her lies held up the process. Rather than simply signing the writ, the judge wanted a hearing. While waiting for the hearing, B pulled every trick in the deadbeat tenant handbook. She called the health department and reported mold. Of course, the health department reported that the only mold he found was caused by the tenant. Then, desperate to stay and live off of my family, she called code enforcement and building services hoping that, by chance, the apartment was \u201cillegal\u201d (she called it my illegal apartment). There was nothing \u201cillegal\u201d about my apartment but, as it turned out, there was an un permitted addition added to my house 20 years before I bought it and I\u2019m required to bring everything up to code. So, the hearing date arrives (in the middle of January) and we both show up in front of the judge. The judge didn\u2019t want to hear any of her excuses, so I honestly don\u2019t know why she set the hearing. The judge asked me when I wanted her gone. I had another moment of pity (yea I know \ud83d\ude44) and gave her until the end of January. On February 1st she still hadn\u2019t left so I had to get the sheriff\u2019s department to come and serve her 24 hours notice. During that 24 hours she stole the oven, the refrigerator, a television, all of the dishes, and several pieces of furniture. I saw her stealing my stuff on camera and called the police. They wouldn\u2019t do anything except watch her roll my refrigerator (in a dolly) to her friends next door. I\u2019ll never forget that B \ud83d\ude03. ",

Every once in a while, they\u2019d email me to check in on me and him. They moved out a few years ago, and I actually got a call from them a few months ago! I was so happy they called me, and were surprised I remembered them!!@The tenant who would send me a card every month, wishing me a Happy Spring or Happy Labor Day!The tenant who sent me a sympathy card after my mom passed away.The tenants who have kids that have Autism diagnosis\u2019s. We relate on a level that not everyone understands.The tenants who always smile and treat us with respect and dignity.Now, the \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cnightmare\u201d tenants: Tenants who don\u2019t let us what\u2019s going on when they haven\u2019t paid their rent and then get mad when we ask for their rent and the tenant I literally have to email EVERY MONTH to remind them to pay rent.Tenants who we've had to evict.ESPECIALLY the tenants who leave behind their properties FULL of stuff OR that cause damage to a property after they\u2019ve been told they\u2019re being evicted. I\u2019ll give you some advice, the money that is used to haul off your stuff or fix the damages isn\u2019t coming out of my pocket, or the owners pocket, but the tenants pocket.The tenants who threaten to take us to court.Most of them are empty threats, but we have had to go to court several times. I\u2019ve been doing this job for 7 years at this point. My boss (aka my mother in law) has been doing property management for over 30 years. Everything that we do is to the letter of the law. We have only lost ONE court case, and that was because our lawyer didn\u2019t know the law (I know, we fired that firm after that incident.)Tenants who cause issues (such as: clogging up toilets, breaking appliances, not calling in leaks or major emergencies) and then threaten to break their lease over those issues.Tenants who do work on their rental property without approval OR knowledge of what they are doing. Such as, the tenant who decided to change out a fuse in a breaker box and burned the house down. He proceeded to go BACK into the remains of the house to switch the bad fuse he put in so it wouldn\u2019t come back to bite him (we had pictures of the box before he tampered with it.)",

            "answer_text": "I had some of the most wonderful tenants who more than made up for the \u201cbad\u201d ones. My very favorite tenant was an inspiring black lady with 3 young children. Her husband had cheated on her so she chose to leave him and their 4 bedroom home. Her dignity was more important to her than the security of a nice home and income. She and her children would have been eligible for help through Section 8 housing and food stamps/EBT card. She was too proud to accept any of this help, choosing to set a good example before her 3 children. She took on 2 jobs and somehow always had a smile on her face and never did I hear a complaint come out of her mouth. She was always pleasant and calm when I talked to her. She believed in God and lived the life of a Christian. She kept a spotless apartment, which isn\u2019t easy with young children. If she needed a repair, she would always apologize as if she was causing me an inconvenience. She was such a pleasure to have as a tenant. I considered her my friend. I more than respected her, I looked up to her. She was wise, kind, and respectful to all the other tenants. She taught her children to be quiet as they passed the apartments of other tenants. I can\u2019t say enough good about her and wished every tenant had her morals and high standards. She didn\u2019t let her \u201cdown\u201d circumstances stand in the way of her worth. She could have given up and accepted all the bad things that had undeservingly happened to her. She held her head high. I aspire to be more like her. It wasn\u2019t about money or what possessions she had, she had something very special inside her that pushed her forward in life, earning respect from those who had the pleasure of knowing her. She could have easily fallen apart when considering the position she was in, but I have all faith that she is doing just fine and excelling greatly in life. I am pretty sure her children have grown up to be fine people with her as a role model. This was about 20 years ago and I often think about her with fondness. I would love to know how she is doing currently, but I have no doubt that she has made it just fine in life. I lost touch years ago after I sold the apartments and i truly wish I had stayed in touch with her over the years. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, I have a goodie for you LOL! Annie Get Your Gun One older feisty lady I had for a tenant with a corner unit on the ground level, planted a lovely garden. Her garden kept expanding (which I allowed as their was ample space for it). It became rather impressive. Fellow tenants would ask for seeds and clippings to start plants on their patios. It was her thing and what made her happiest. BUT, everyone knew not to get on her bad side and no one did as she was well-liked and respected\u2026.. One day however, an ornery fella crossed her path and made a total nuisance of himself; and when he all but destroyed her garden, he ended up on the wrong side of a gun! I was in the office that afternoon when I heard 2 gun shots come from across the property. I went to investigate. And there she was still holding her Smith & Wesson, wearing her sun visor and a tee shirt that read \u201cI am well adjusted\u201d. I kid you not. \u201cI nailed that son of bitch!\u201d She says to me. \u201cWHO?\u201d! I asked (seeing no one). She said \u201chim - right over there\u201d\u2014 pointing to the right end corner of her garden. That unfortunate fella was a MOLE! \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious?!\u201d I said, after stammering for a response LOL! No sooner the cops come rolling in - 3 cruisers in all! I explained what happened and the officers, while somewhat annoyed got a good chuckle out of the old lady\u2019s brazen murder of a MOLE in broad daylight. The officer in-charge asked for her gun permit. He said there would be no charges if I did not want to press any, because the discharge of the firearm was on private property and no one was injured. (This was in Tennessee). The following day, our company called me to inquire and ask for an incident report after a tenant had called them to complain I told them that it the shots came from the apartment complex next to our property (it was known to be rough). Yes, I lied and covered for the lady, as surely, the Regional Manager would have directed me to evict her She never have me or anyone any trouble and was a good payer and always on time. She kept her place immaculate. I just did not feel it would be right to displace her and bring hardship upon her. The matter was dropped and there were no further incidents with her. That happened in 2007, sadly, she passed in 2014 from cancer, I learned. I will never forget her for as long I live! She was truly one-of-a-kind! ",

            "answer_text": "Joey, along with his wife and 2 elementary age kids, moved into one of our properties about 20 years ago. Six months later his wife ran off with another man leaving him a single father. He had moved here from out of state to take a job as the head football coach for a local high school, but with the help of some neighbors with the kids, he was able to manage\u2026.. at least until he had a heart attack that put him in the hospital for over a month. As he had no local relatives, my wife and I took their children into our home for that month he was in the hospital. He wasn\u2019t strong enough to go back to work for almost a year afterwards during which time we waived his rent. He has since remarried and purchased his own home, but our maintenance crew still refers to the property as \u201cJoey\u2019s old house\u201d. ",

The unit next to theirs become vacant and less than a month later, their daughter moved in with her husband and newborn baby. Within 3 days of them moving in, she emails me a 15-page email detailing everything that is wrong with the property. Mind you, I\u2019m no slumlord. This is actually a pretty high-end building. I normally totally renovate all of my units when getting a new tenant so the new tenant will get brand-new carpeting, usually brand-new appliances (or very close to brand-new), the works. Her email had a lot of pretty petty things. For example, one of her complaints is that there was a bit of dust in one of the forced-air heating ducts. We\u2019re not talking mold, we\u2019re talking a bit of dust. I sent in a cleaning crew to literally run vacuums through the entire length of the heating ducts. She complained about a paint-chip on the tub, so I sent someone out to refinish it. That wasn\u2019t good enough, she wanted a brand-new tub. 99% of people would have seen nothing wrong with this place. From what I can tell, she was being insanely overprotective of the baby. ",

            "answer_text": "We owned a 3 family rental property. We rented the first and second floor apartments out, we lived on the 3rd floor. Each apartment was directly under each other. Our 2nd floor apartment was vacant my husband spoke with a realtor about the vacancy. One of the women who worked for my husband\u2019s company took an interest in our apartment. My husband was so hungry in getting another tenant he told our realtor not to bother with a credit check, or a background check. Rent is due, she claims her father has it, the rent is 10 days late. She then brings into the apartment her girlfriend who has 3 small children without telling us. The kids take a bath every night. The second months rent only gave us 1/2 of it. I call my realtor tell him I am evicting her. She has too many people in the apartment without our permission, she is either late with the payment, or does not pay it in full. Before she finally leaves the apartment she pours grease down the bathtub drain. This grease is used to grease cars with. We had to call the plumber out to snake the drain, and use solvent to unclog the pipes. This procedure was for the first and second floor bathrooms. I was so happy to see the sheriff remove her things. She did not get her security deposit back, because of the drainage problems she caused. ",

Took months and months to evict her and she ruined a newly renovated apartment completely After I finally got her out, she started sleeping with the guy in the next unit and \u2018 lived\u2019 there instead of the unit she was evicted from. it was hell, the feeling of not being able to get rid of someone who cost you thousands of dollars and didn\u2019t respect your building. They eventually both left after he was arrested a few times on premise for domestic abuse ( and she was beating him up lol ) ",

One person was surprised to find that he was responsible for the entire rent once his roommate moved out\u2026 pretty funny actually. When he whined that he was not having any luck with finding a new roommate, I told him, \u201cyou know that now you owe the entire rent amount, right?\u201d His reaction, \u201cI am?!\u201d He started looking for a roommate much harder after that. The other tenants were more recent: they had more reasons for why they couldn\u2019t pay their rent on time. They were just plain awful. Now, as we have been cleaning the property and doing some reno, we have found several empty liquor bottles which leads me to believe one was an alcoholic. Sad, really. Now why would you need to know this? ",

One time a father with three young boys moved out of one after his wife had deserted them. They left piles of everything and anything all over the house and carport. For years I couldn't drink cool aide with crackers around. And couldn't eat crackers if cool aide was around. Because I had to help clean up the carport. Ehich had crackers and cool aide on and or in most of the piles. Which included clothes, toys, house hold stuff and trash. ",
