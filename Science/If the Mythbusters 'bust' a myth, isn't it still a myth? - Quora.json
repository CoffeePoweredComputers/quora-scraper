            "answer_text": "What you are saying is correct, but it's just a matter of definitions.  You are defining the words \"bust\" and \"myth\" in different ways than mythbusters is using them. In the context that mythbusters is using them, I might define the words as follows: - A myth is a widely held, yet untested, belief or claim.- To bust something means to break up or put an end to, e.g. an attempt to bust the union.  (Source: The Free Dictionary) Therefore, when mythbusters delcares a myth busted, they are putting an end to an untested claim by proving it false.  And when they declare it confirmed, they are confirming a previously untested belief or claim. Conversely, you are taking \"myth\" to mean a false but widely held belief, and you are taking \"bust\" to mean prove false.  In which case, your analysis is correct. It's just a matter of semantics.
