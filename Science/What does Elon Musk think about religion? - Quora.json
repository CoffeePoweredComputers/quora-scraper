            "answer_text": "Elon believes (correctly) that the risk of a future human extinction event approaches certainty over a very short period of time that can be estimated to be in the hundreds of years or less.  Elon believes we are in a race against catastrophe; humans are special and must be protected; one way to reduce extinction probabilities for humans is to establish populations on other planets and moons. There are only 165 or so rocky (solid) bodies in the solar system with enough gravity that humans can walk on them. Places where large populations can survive are fewer than five and could be as few as absolute zero. Mars has special problems for human survival that must be solved. It has no protection from high energy radiation and cosmic rays. It lacks a magnetosphere and the atmospheric gases like nitrogen and oxygen that are opaque to harmful rays and particles. Elon believes these problems will be solved and that the risk of extinction can be reduced if we establish vigorous colonies there. He has hope where most informed people do not. My hope is that we can avoid extinction on the earth, but our volatile climate and frequent ice ages are difficult to overcome. We also have new and unusual risks associated with our technologies \u2014biological, nuclear, AI, totalitarianism, resource depletion, and runaway climate change. Natural risks include asteroid strikes, super nova irradiation, and volcanism. These natural risks are likely to be the same (or larger) on other bodies in the solar system as they are on Earth. Two human-like species are known to have gone extinct in the geological record. (Some anthropologists say it\u2019s three.) Human populations experienced a near extinction event 70,000 years ago when the total population collapsed to less than 4,000 individuals. I do not know what Elon Musk thinks about organized religion. I see religion as a brake on the tendency of humans to kill each other, which history teaches has sometimes been effective and at other times has not. Sometimes strongly held religious beliefs lead to war. On one thing humans agree: they love to fight. RISK ",

            "answer_text": "Quoting from his wikipedia page: When asked whether he believed \"there was some kind of destiny involved\" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than \"just physics\", Musk responded: Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: \"Where does the master intelligence come from?\" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements. Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although previously admitted to praying before an important Falcon 1 launch, asking \"any entities that [were] listening\" to \"bless [the] launch\". When asked whether he believed \"religion and science could co-exist\", Musk replied \"probably not\" He had also mentioned in an interview that he hadn\u2019t prayed even when he almost died of malaria. It kind of feels like his views have moved more and more towards being agnostic with time. In any case, his religious views are not the priority topics for any of his interviewers. Hard to find sources on this. Elon Musk - Wikipedia  ",
