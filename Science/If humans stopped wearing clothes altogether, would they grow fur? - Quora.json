            "answer_text": "It would have to be selected for by the environment. The agent of selection would be weather. So, are we wishing away all technology too? (Heating, AC). Yes? Then without that and assuming that the remaining humans were too dumb to make new clothing, then in the cold regions they\u2019d all die, very, very quickly without time to adapt. The humans in the tropical regions would be just fine. So the population of humanity would drop to just a few million people living in the tropics because even places like Southern Florida get cold in winter and since these surviving humans aren\u2019t even smart enough to fashion clothing, they won\u2019t be smart enough to build houses. The remaining humans in the tropics wouldn\u2019t be selected for fur since, well, it\u2019s fucking HOT down there. They would be selected for darker skin to deal with the bright sun. They\u2019d look a lot like people in the Amazon, Congo and Indonesia. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans (our species) are very competitive, and very adaptable. There is no way that humans would stop wearing clothes altogether unless they figured out how to create exactly the environment each individual wanted, and made it so each could have their own way. This would NOT result in more hair or fur. However, even if our species stopped wearing \u201cclothes\u201d they would start doing other things to individualize themselves. Fashion is not about clothes, they are just the tool. If it wasn\u2019t clothes, it would be ribbons, and feathers, and paint, or any other way to create the \u201cindividual\u201d that they want others to perceive. So no, removing clothes would not change who humans are. It would just change the tools they would use to create their own \u201cimage.\u201d ",
