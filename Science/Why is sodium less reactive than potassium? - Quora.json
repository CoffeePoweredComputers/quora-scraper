            "answer_text": "Both sodium and potassium belong to the same group. They both have only one electon in their outermost shell. But they belong to different periods. Sodium has 3 shells while potassium has 5. As the distance between the valence electron and the nucleus is more in potassium. It experience lesser pull by the nucleus and so can give away the valence electron very easily as compared to sodium which experience a greater pull from the nucleus. Thus potassium is more reactive. Reactivity increases on moving down the group. ",

            "answer_text": "All right there is something known as the activity series of metals  It is a list of metals placed chronologically according to there reactiveness. Here potassium is more reactive than sodium. Reactivity of an element depends on the number of electrons in the outermost shell 0f it\u2019s atom.But if we take a look at sodium and potassium we find that both of the element\u2019s atoms have only one valence electron(same nu. of electrons). SO WHAT KEEPS POTASSIUM STAY AHEAD OF SODIUM IN REACTIVITY IS IT\u2019S TENDENCY TO LOSE ELECTRONS. SODIUM ATOM HAS ONLY 3 SHELLS(orbits)  WHILE POTASSIUM HAS 4 SHELLS(orbits)  BECAUSE THE VALENCE ELECTRONS OF POTASSIUM LIE FARTHER FROM THE NUCLEUS COMPARED TO VALENCE ELECTRONS OF SODIUM THEY HAVE A GREATER PROBABILITY OF GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE SHELL. THEREFORE POTASSIUM CAN DONATE ITS ELECTRON FASTER THAN SODIUM FOR WHICH IT IS SAID TO HAVE GREATER REACTIVITY. ",
