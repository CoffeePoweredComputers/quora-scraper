            "answer_text": "The main reason is that the brain is constantly active even when you think it is not, i.e. the brain generates continuous spontaneous activity in the absence of sensory stimulation (why our brain has evolved to be in a state of constant flux and requiring so much energy is another question).    The brain's cells (neurons and glia) require oxygen to generate ATP for energy. Neurons constantly receive synaptic input and require energy to maintain their ionic concentration gradients. Recall that a single neuron weakly connects to about 10,000 other neurons, and when it fires an action potential, it causes depolarizations in the postsynaptic terminal. That one single action potential is going to likely cost 10,000 other neurons a little bit of energy even if they themselves do not  fire action potentials. The brain has millions of spikes at any given moment so you can see how the resultant depolarization costs would add up. In addition action potentials themselves and glutamate cycling (happening at 90% of the brain's synapses) is also costly in terms of energy.  There is an energetic price to pay for the brain to be able to quickly process sensory activity and act on it. It must constantly \"waste\" energy so that it is extremely sensitive to outside information. See this 2002 PNAS article by Marcus Raichle and Debra Gusnard.Appraising the brain's energy budget A fun exercise would be to look up why the turtle's brain requires relatively low oxygen compared to other brains.
