            "answer_text": "Hi Dountio, you asked for my comments on this question: First, I am not sure what you mean by \u201csustained\u201d\u2026 Is this a physical product that needs production facilities, logistics etc. to be made, sold and services? Is this a digital product that needs platform maintenance, bug fixes etc\u2026 a bit more detail would be very helpful. Second, how do you define the maturity of a product in your case? Sales growth around 0%, margins around 0%, no real innovations any more? Sales churn? Again, a bit more detail would be very helpful. Once you get more specifics, I am gladly providing perspective.
