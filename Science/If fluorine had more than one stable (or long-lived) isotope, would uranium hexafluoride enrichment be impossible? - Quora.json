            "answer_text": "Wow, good question. Take the case of 50% F18 and 50% F19. The distributions of U235 and U238 based compounds would overlap and a couple of percent of the U235 based hexafluoride would be 9 AMU heavier than the lightest U238 based hexafluoride. You\u2019d have to run the statistics, but for generating low enriched uranium it might not be too bad. Gaseous diffusion is a statistical process and the U235 based compounds are still, on average, 3 AMU lighter than the U238 based compounds. At any rate, I think you could work something out, perhaps with more steps in the process, but it might be 2+ times more expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent question, since U-238 and U-235 differ by only three mass units, while there are six fluorides in UF6. Yes, it would work, but only if you used a single, pure isotope of fluorine. If fluorine had more than one stable isotope, using just one of them would increase the cost of the process a fair bit. I\u2019m not sure that it would increase it unreasonably, given that gas centrifuges are already very expensive. ",
