            "answer_text": "Hooboy. The Planck length is\u2026 hard to describe, at least in relatable terms. This is mostly because it is so inconceivably tiny, that any attempt at comparison falls flat. To show why, let\u2019s go through a few attempts at comparisons. For reference, the Planck length is [math]~1.6*10^{-36} [/math]meters. First, let\u2019s try taking the solar system and blowing it up to the size of the observable universe. The solar system is about [math]1.[/math][math]45*10^{13}[/math] meters in radius, and the universe clocks in at [math]8.8 * 10^{26}[/math] meters, so this would stretch the Planck length out to\u2026 [math]9.7*10^{-23}[/math], or about a billionth the size of an electron. Well, that didn\u2019t get us anywhere. Let\u2019s try just stretching the Earth out to the size of the universe. With the earth at [math]6.3*10^{6}[/math]m, that brings us to just a tenth the size of an electron, or [math]2.23*10^{-16}[/math]m. Still not great, but we\u2019re getting there. Let\u2019s try one last thing. You may have heard the famous comparison \u201cif an atom was the size of a football field, the nucleus would be the width of one blade of grass.\u201d In this comparison, the Planck length would be\u2026 even smaller than it was in our first comparison, where the solar system became the universe. But how about we take that one step further. What if instead of taking an atom and making it a football field, we take an football field and make it the size of the entire observable universe? Since we\u2019re using radii, the football field comes in at 50m. Plugging in our values, if we blow up a regulation-size football field to the size of the entire observable universe, the planck length becomes\u2026 the size of an atom. The Planck length is small.

            "answer_text": "Planck length is a fundamental space-time length which could be thought of as the length of the smallest unit of space in the \u201cfabric of space\u201d. It is by calculation 1.616 times 10 to the power -35 m. It is is derived from Planck\u2019s constant, and speed of light and Newton\u2019s universal gravitational constant G. It is a fundamental length of the smallest space unit(can be extended to planck\u2019s area or volume also). It is about 10 to the power 20 times smaller than the diameter of a proton!!!! The concept is being used in string theory now, where it could be the space length containing a \u201cstring\u201d or possibly a much smaller string(yet unknown), or a collection of much smaller strings(yet unknown), than containing the calculated length of a said \u201cstring\u201d only which is much larger, in the order of 10^-33(10 to the power -33/about 100 times the planck\u2019s length). Overall Planck length has been reasonably well defined. What is more universally made use of is Planck\u2019s constant. It is in the order of 10^-34 or 10 to the power -34. The exact value of planck\u2019s constant is 6.626 times 10 to the power -34 m^2kg/s(or Joule.s). You can have some idea of what it is when you look at the Planck-Einstein energy equation for a photon: E=hf, where E stands for energy of the photon, f stands for the frequency of light, and h is planck\u2019s universal constant. So solving for h gives you h=E/f, which has the dimension of J.s, or joule.second. Please note that recent advances in superstring theory predict that a string\u2019s length(in considerstion) is in the order of 10 to the power -33, roughly about 10 times bigger than planck\u2019s unviersal constant\u2019s dimension, and 100 times bigger than the calculated planck length. The latter may suggest existence of much smaller and more fundamental \u2018strings\u2019 than what has been postulated to exist\u2026 Kaiser T, MD (Life long physics, math, cosmology, and science proponent).
