            "answer_text": "Erection, sexual desire, depression, or concentration, and memory are just some aspects in which testosterone plays a very important role. In addition to being essential in male sexuality, it fulfills other functions of great relevance, such as maintaining bone density, levels of red blood cells, and a feeling of well-being. We offer you some tips so that, if you have exceeded thirty, you continue to be like a bull. 1-lose weight The kilos do not help in any way. Take them off, too, to be more virile, since, according to repeated Endocrine Society's studies, overweight men are more likely to have low testosterone levels. And to avoid this, there are only two formulas: take care of your diet and exercise more. Forget about sugars! The levels of this male hormone decrease after ingesting it. When it comes to food and drink, you have to reduce or eliminate them. Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption. Maintain a healthy eating rhythm: vegetables, fruits, healthy fats ... Stick with these foods: oysters, eggs, beef, garlic, and broccoli. They are the ones referred to as \"promoters\" of testosterone production. Put on your sneakers and get your strength to go to the gym. The sacrifice will be rewarded with better health and an undeniable physical improvement by hardening and reducing, an attraction that is sure to be multiplied by the consequent improvement of self-esteem. 2-High intensity exercises and strength training High-intensity exercise increases testosterone levels and preventing its deterioration. There are different formulas that can help you raise this hormone. But, be careful, always supervise with your doctor that it is not counterproductive: Peak Fitness Warm-up and stretch (as always; this is a must before any workout).Exercise as fast and with as much weight as possible in 30-second sessions.Rest and do breathing exercises for about 90 seconds. Once this minute and a half are up, repeat the process six or seven times.Strength training Increase the weight and reduce the number of repetitions with weights or bars, for example.Focus on exercises that target the most muscles, such as deadlifts or squats.Weight training Keep a slow pace when doing the sessions. By slowing down the movement, the workout becomes a high-intensity exercise. And for those who have urine leaks, the trick: work the upper body.3-Zinc, a good ally Zinc is important for the production of testosterone. Meat and fish are foods rich in it. It is also found in raw milk, raw cheese, beans, and yogurt or kefir made from raw milk. 4-Reduce stress When a man suffers or is stressed, his body releases high levels of the hormone cortisol, an element that blocks the effects of testosterone. Emotional intelligence, meditation, yoga, knowing how to laugh at yourself, sleep, and rest well, a positive visualization of your life ... are some of the techniques to improve it. 5-Sexual stimuli A simple erection raises testosterone levels. When you stimulate yourself sexually the levels of this important hormone skyrocket: do it. And on the contrary, not getting sexually aroused for long periods of time lowers its levels in the blood and it will become increasingly difficult for you to stimulate yourself. Look for eroticism: there are a thousand ways. Enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to boost your testosterone levels naturally and instantly are good balanced diet and food. What you eat has a major impact on testosterone as well as other hormone levels. I recommend eating a lot of protein, healthy fat and clean carbs. But please, you must pay attention to your long-term calorie intake, while diet should be great balanced. Need lots fruits and vegetables as additional components. Protein Can help maintain healthy levels and aid in fat loss, which is also associated with your testosterone. Clean Carbs I mean complex carbs and low-to-no-sugar carbs. Get your carbs from tubers, whole grains, and vegetables. Healthy Fat Low fat diets plummet testosterone levels. Increase your intake of saturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids. I recommend to use coconut oil or olive oil. To increase testosterone levels, it's also recommended to: don't drink alcohol and stop smoking cigarettesmore sports activity (gym, run, bike etc)have more sextake cold showersavoid large amounts of processed carbohydratessupplement with vitamin Dsupplement with magnesiumuse probiotics and fish oilWhat else should you eat? avocado - there are many other nutrients (vitamin K, copper, folate, vitamin B6, potassium, vitamin E, and vitamin C)eggs - contain healthy fat, protein, and practically every vitaminproducts containing zinc - for example: legumes, seeds, nuts, dairy foods, whole grains, dark chocolate, oysters and seafood.",
