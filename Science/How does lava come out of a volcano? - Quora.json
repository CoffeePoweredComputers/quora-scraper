            "answer_text": "In general there are three kinds of volcanoes, based on the kind of magma that builds them, and most particularly, its gas content. The kind we are addressing in this question is the most explosive one, the cinder cone.  British Columbia\u2019s Kostal Cone, a typically steep-sided cinder cone volcano. With a cinder cone volcano, the source magma is high in water and dissolved gases. When this magma nears the surface and the pressure on it drops, the gases and steam come out of solution so quickly that they blow the suddenly sudsy magma right out of the shaft.  When a champagne bottle is opened, the cork flies out with explosive force. Why? Because the champagne is full of dissolved gas (carbon dioxide, in this case) that comes out of solution and returns to gas form almost instantly, when the pressure is relieved. This is the same mechanism that causes lava to explode from a volcano shaft. In either case, you could put an eye out with that thing! The process is a bit like the rush of gas when a shaken-up soda or, worse, a champagne bottle is opened (see picture above). The magma flies through the air, hardening around the bubbles, and forming a light-coloured and extremely lightweight material.  Pumice is a spongy volcanic stone so light that usually can float on water. The most heavily spongy pieces will become waterlogged and eventually sink! This kind of volcano tends to be formed from silicate materials, of which continental crust is made.  Pumice can be used as a means of removing thickened skin on the feet, resulting in softer skin. Beauty products from a volcano - who knew?? A shield volcano, in contrast, is made from fluid lava flows. This kind of lava has little gas in solution, so it simply flows out and forms a wide, broad dome of a mountain shaped rather like a warrior\u2019s shield. The source of magma for a shield volcano is basaltic magma, the kind that comes from oceanic crust. The Hawaiian volcanoes are an example of the non-explosive kinds of volcanoes.  Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa, or \u201cLong Mountain,\u201d burbles out basaltic lava like water from an artesian well. Measured from the base several miles beneath the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Loa is the tallest volcano in the world, yet is still broad for its mass. The third kind of volcano is a stratovolcano, made up of many layers, or strata. The most common species of volcano, this type is associated with subduction zones, at which an oceanic plate typically dives under a lighter continental plate and begins to melt at a depth of 40 or 50 miles. The resulting basaltic magma must then rise up through the silicate crust above it, and the lava that emerges may be by turns explosive or fluid - hence the varied layers over time.  Mount Rainier, a beautiful stratovolcano, overlooks the city of Seattle in Washington State. One of the most interesting stones born in volcanoes, by the way, is the round pebble or stone known as an \u201cApache tear.\u201d These nodules appear black, but when held to the light, are usually a dark amber colour. They separate out from a certain kind of silicate lava when it cools rapidly and can be dug from the surrounding softer material.  Apache tears are the gemstones of the volcano. They are made of a volcanic glass known as obsidian, and are often tumbled to a high polish in a rock tumbler. ",

            "answer_text": "Deep within the earth is an area of liquid rock in an area called the mantle. This liquid rock gets pushed into areas called magma chambers closer to the surface. The magma chamber is an area of less dense rock that melts, cracks and becomes full of molten rock called Lava. Lava is liquid rock, but it isn\u2019t nearly as hot as the mantle is. Sometimes the magma chamber is full and it begins to get more of the earths mantle pushing up into it. This causes pressure from below so the lava rises to any open area it can. Other times just the friction of pressure can cause the temperature in the magma chamber to rise and regardless, it begins to expand and move towards the earths surface. During this movement, the rocky surface can crack and the lava finds a way to escape. It can be on flat land (new volcano) or it can be where a volcano already exists. ",
