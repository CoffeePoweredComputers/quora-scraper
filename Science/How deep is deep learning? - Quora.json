So deep that the chances are it will be lost in The Great Himalayas. :) :) :) :) :) :) The answer is subjective by nature. In reality it depends on the models you are trying to build and the amount of data you are about to train. If data is in millions and you are using neural networks(NN) to train them. Then probably you will need more hidden layers for computation which in a way is expensive as it will consume more resources. For example for computer vision you will need the classifier to detect the type of object. The object can be a rock, a billboard, a vehicle, a tree in sideways etc. Now you need multiple outputs from the NNs you built. Again, You need more hidden layers and nodes in those layers. The reason is to have a reasonable amount of features for correct classification. Edit:- The above one is just one case. There are other applications of deep learning too which require substantial effort for achieving better results. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the objective of your application. For a simple handwritten digits recognition network could have 3 layers up to 150 layers neural net designed by Microsoft to win the 2015 Imagenet competition. Deep mind\u2019s Alphago only consists of 13 layers with different design of architectures. In my opinion,it totally depends on the design of the neural network to achieve your goal. ",
