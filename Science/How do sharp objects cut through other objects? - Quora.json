            "answer_text": "Being sharp doesn't enable an object to cut through other things. Cutting through other objects means that your sharp object must have the structural integrity to not break while slicing through another object. For eg. You can't just cut diamond with a stainless steel knife, simply because diamond is much harder. If your sharp object is in fact harder and not fragile then it's all about pressure. Because the area of contact is very less, even a small amount of force creates enormous pressure that forces the molecular bonds apart and you can slice through other objects. ",
