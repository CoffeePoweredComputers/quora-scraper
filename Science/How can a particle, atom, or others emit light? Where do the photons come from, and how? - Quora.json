            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know. We know a lot about the process, we can successfully predict when it will occur, and we can write our energy balance equations, but really, the details about where a photon comes from would earn you a Nobel prize if you could fully explain it. For example, this is an image of a match:  The photons are emitted from the hot gases above the combustion zone. What we say is happening is that the hot gases (like CO2) are cooling and reducing their energy. By conservation of energy, that energy must leave the gas in some form, and the form mother nature has selected is that of a photon. (And, by nice coincidence for carbon-based fires, that photon has the same frequency as the ones from the sun, so our eyes can detect it and send a signal to our brain, which then converts the photon into a bit of yellow color in our minds.) But was the photon a pre-existing particle inside the CO2 molecule waiting to break free? No, at least, that is not how we model it. It was just a massless particle (which in itself is hard to understand) that popped into being. How? Again, we don\u2019t know. But it is analogous to particles and anti-particles in deep space that we see just popping into existence and then annihilating with each other and vanishing again (see the paragraph below). At this very, very small scale, really weird stuff occurs. We know the impact at our scale - we see the light from a match flame - and we can write the equations to predict the observations at our scale, but go deep enough into it, and our knowledge faulters. Which is why there are so many scientists trying to understand this stuff. A good discussion of other things popping into and out of existence can be found at What keeps space empty? From that link: Vacuum energy (also called vacuum fluctuations or zero-point energy) is a sea of particles and antiparticles flashing briefly into and out of existence. Vacuum energy has a very real effect because it weakens, or screens, electric fields. Vacuum fluctuations are not some exotic, untested, theoretical artifact. Rather, vacuum fluctuations are fundamental to many everyday phenomena. Lasers, like the one in your DVD machine, crucially depend on the existence of vacuum fluctuations. A laser beam is created when you set up a material properly so that you get a chain reaction of coherent light emissions. This chain reaction is started by vacuum fluctuations. ",

            "answer_text": "Light is electromagnetic energy propagating in QFT\u2019s fundamental electromagnetic field. The fundamental electromagnetic field is the three-dimensional lattice structure of is quanta, the photons, which behave as harmonic quantum oscillators as they absorb and transfer the energy in a wave-pattern.  Photons don\u2019t get emitted by electrons at all and ligh-waves don not travel. Electrons of the light source transfer energy to the photons of the EM field. The electromagnetic energy/radiation propagates as the photons of the fundamental electromagnetic absorb and transfer the energy in the form of angular momentum to each other in a wave-like pattern.
