            "answer_text": "Who is the greatest scientist of the world? Greatest, considering the quality and importance of the science they did, or their personal ability to do science? By the importance of the science, I would say Watson and Creek (genetics), Darwin (anthropology), Einstein (atomic power), Tesla (electric power).  But according to their personal scientific talent, I would nominate ex aequo DaVinci and Einstein.  Not Newton, because although his scientific and mathematical prowess are legendary, we might say, personally he was kind of intellectual freak, dabbling in occultism, especially alchemy, to the point that the economist John Maynard Keynes (Lord Keynes) regarded him as borderline between scientist and magician. What is clear, anyway, is that he blatantly betrayed the spirit of the scientific method. At least, let\u2019s hope, in predicting that the world could end as early as 2060. (Heads up, millennials, never said no one told you!)  Nevertheless, he shared with Einstein and DaVinci an extraordinarily broad scope of interests and abilities. DaVinci was as much, or more, of an artists as of a scientists or engineer, and Einstein was a great thinker, philosopher and humanist, as attested by a panoply of quotations no other scientist\u2014or, maybe, philosopher\u2014can boast of, within or without science. So, when people ask who will be the next Einstein, my answer is\u2014anticipating the more problematic question \u201cWho will be the greatest scientist in the world?\u201d\u2014, I don\u2019t know, but they will have a comprehensive view of science exceeding the conventional limits in an original, unprecedented way. Thinking out of the box on steroids, in common parlance. Unfortunately, just about everyone in science is confined to the materialistic box. (1) In my opinion, no one can be a really great scientist by being just a scientist. (2) (1) They used to be confined to the rational box\u2014by \u2018rational\u2019 meaning that the human mind can conceive of it\u2014 , so they couldn\u2019t wrap their minds around Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. They finally came to terms with it, but now they won\u2019t go beyond the material world. Their loss! They can still win a Nobel prize, I guess, but that will be all.
