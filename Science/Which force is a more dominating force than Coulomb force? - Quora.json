            "answer_text": "Other answers are close but fail to explain what the Strong Nuclear Force actually is. The Strong Nuclear Force is the attractive force between the L field of positive charges and other immediately adjacent positive charges. The L field is an intense e-m field immediately surrounding every charge, a property of the inductive effects of a moving charge, and associated moving e and m and e-m fields. A positive L field and its positive charge comprise a proton, negative L field and charge an electron. The L field of a proton is 1836 times the magnitude of the electron, thus predominates in subatomic forces. The electron has other important roles to play. At approx 10^-15 metres separation two protons, and neutrons, will be balanced in a stable relationship in a nucleus between the Coulomb Force and the L force, what we erroneously think as a (undescribed) Strong Nuclear Force. At 10^-11 and 10^-10 metres, a balance between Coulomb and L forces provides molecular and phase stability. i.e. Inter and intra molecular. At stellar distances the L force predominates to provide what we call Gravity. Thus the four fundamental forces are essentially the same thing. The force relationship between a charge and its L field provides what we call inertia, when an external force is exerted upon a charge or its field, causing acceleration. Neither Coulomb or L forces are linear, at 10^-15, 10^-11 and 10^-10 metres they exhibit steep peaks. Incidentally, the L field , being a waveform, exists at c, so a photon emitted from an electron L field will depart at c, which answers that question. The L field is the basis of the elusive New Physics. ",

            "answer_text": "The electromagnetic force deals with repulsion and attraction based on charge. It is, unquestionably, an extremely powerful force. A tiny magnet can beat the entire gravitational force of the earth. What is more, this force becomes stronger you get closer to where it originates from, as is the case with any force that obeys the inverse square law. With all that in mind, let\u2019s consider a single atom of Iron-56. Think about the nucleus of the atom. It is impossibly small, only 1/20,000th the size of the entire atom. Squeezed together inside that atom are 26 protons and 30 neutrons. But those protons squeezed together are a problem. Remember, Coulomb\u2019s law states that two like charges will repel and that the closer those charges are to each other, the greater that repulsive charge will be. We have here 26 like charges squeezed together in the space of a four femtometer radius sphere. Why doesn\u2019t the atom just explode? The reason is the strong nuclear force. This is the force that binds together the atom. It is - as far as we currently know - the strongest force in the universe. ",
