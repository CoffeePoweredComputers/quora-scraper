            "answer_text": "How can we make our world gear up to reverse climate change? There are two main drivers behind the change required for corrective action regarding the environment. The first is public opinion and awareness, this influences politicians since they rely on this to stay in power. If the majority of people are genuinely concerned about climate change, and are prepared to vote accordingly, then the leaders will take appropriate steps such as stopping fossil fuel subsidies, encouraging renewable energy and strengthening environmental protection legislation. All these things will accelerate the transition process. The second, and by far the most influential force is that of economics. Economics dictates that the cheapest energy source will dominate in the market unless some other even stronger influence comes into play. We are now in the position of seeing renewable energy undercut traditional energy sources on a level field for price, and investors are seeing this too. This is the best news we can hope for since it provides a sound basis for rapid and even exponential growth in the expansion of such plants. Even better is the reality that as more money is invested into renewable energy, the prices will fall even more, allowing us to maintain this exponential growth until the market is saturated. Traditional plants such as coal will simply be too expensive to run compared to a plant that can be quickly and cheaply installed, and has no fuel bill. ",

            "answer_text": "Hurray, the climate denialist crackpots are out in force I see. We can't reverse it. We can slow it down. The damage that's already done is going to be with us for many generations. We know the following Humans are responsible for the vast majority of CO2 above that which can be sunk via the carbon cycle. (There's a guy on one of the other comments claiming 3%. He's lying to you) Further we are hitting the oceans limit for sinking CO2. More concerning, the arctic permafrost is starting to thaw, this represents a *massive* amplification. Earlier models predicted this would start in another 70 years. That was wrong, it's started already. Last time it melted was the Permian extinction event that almost ended life on earth due to that melt off raising temps by about 10C. We *might* be able to geo engineer a solution to the melt off by building water aerosol barges. But unless we rapidly shut down the CO2 industries we have to accept a world much harder to survive in. Scientists have been warning us without wavering for 150 years that excessive CO2 will cause a \"greenhouse\" effect. CO2s infrared spectrum is fundamental physics and there is unanimous agreement that humans are the principal cause of this. The debate on that fact ended 50 years ago. Yes you'll hear trolls and ignorants claiming otherwise. They are wrong. Don't debate them, ignore them. And lobby your government to listen to the scientists before it's too late. ",
