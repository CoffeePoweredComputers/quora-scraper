            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve thought a lot about this. Too much, really. I am going to offer the best logical process I can think of that says simulation hypothesis is, in fact, false. So the answer, technically, is no. Here\u2019s why. When you decide to simulate an entire universe to perfection, you actually need a computer the size of the universe. This is because each particle takes a lot of calculations to describe perfectly, and the interactions even between atoms quickly grow to be massively complex.  But to simulate so many atoms\u2026 that is quite something. It\u2019s easier simply to let the particles exist independently outside of a computer. If we keep scaling down and finding that the particles at the bottom are truly complex objects made of more complex objects with complex rules (quantum mechanics) then simulation hypothesis as we know it is impossible. To accurately simulate that many particles is impossible without a computer the size of the universe. In VR, this is similar. However, I\u2019d like to point something out that took me a few hours to realize and made me delete a lot of this answer: Dreams.  When we dream, we think that the dream is perfectly real. We act similarly in dreams to how we would in real life. Dreams are a bit like our own personal simulation, and they fill me with wonder when I experience them. Creating dream worlds in VR would do the exact same thing. Your brain isn\u2019t simulating millions of atoms. Your brain is only simulating imagery, even if it is vivid imagery at that. The imagery in dreams isn\u2019t very detailed, however. If you look at your hand and see the tiny lines across them, then you aren\u2019t dreaming. In fact, this is a proven way to figure out whether you\u2019re dreaming. So the probabilities are in your favor. According to what we currently know, there is little chance that we are truly living in a simulation, because if we\u2019re in a simulation, then the people simulating us are in a simulation. And that means that there must be an increasingly powerful computer to simulate all these computers doing the simulations. Conclusion? You are real. So I\u2019d like you to look really carefully at your hand. See the lines that show you that you are (probably) real. Take a microscope and look at tiny cells. Look around you. See how beautiful and how detailed the world truly is. You\u2019re alive. You\u2019re real. And that\u2026 is a beautiful thing. ",

The amassed team of Industry professionals from a wide-array of fields ensures that the technological collaboration and strategic partnerships are always directed toward attainment of Sensorium\u2019s most relevant contribution to the virtual reality landscape\u2014to make it fully social. As the \u201cnext step\u201d in social networking, famous artists, gamers, businesses and the public in general, will find Sensorium\u2019s content hub, called the Sensorium Galaxy, to be one of the most dynamic and industry-evolving technological events in the last decade. Whether it be going to a virtual concert of a favorite pop star with friends on Music planet, enjoying the dances of talented choreographers on Motion Planet or just hanging out with friends at a famous virtual night club on Ibiza, the Sensorium Galaxy will be the virtual MUST-BE place in the very near future. I mean if its going to be realistic then that would be a great achievement but of course once we achieve it it should be done with moderation. Addiction can also be an issue here if that happens and yeah the grip of whats real and what is not. ",

            "answer_text": "You can do that already. You can trick people into thinking that photographs or videos are actual reality.     People in movie theaters often forget that they're watching a movie and scream when scary things happen.  A couple of months ago, I tried the HTC Vive TheBlu experience -- the one where a whale swims past you -- and it was awesome. I was totally caught up in it, and they had a few others that would catch you up, as well. My point is that if you're deliberately trying to trick people, or people are happy to suspend disbelief, that you can do it now. But most of us have enough situational awareness to know that the music we're listening to on the stereo isn't REALLY being played by a live band, just out of sight -- even though it might sounds like it does. We know that the train coming at us on the movie screen isn't a real train.  So, when we step into a virtual environment, we will know we've done it. Because we put on the headset, or threw the switch, or selected the app. Because we know that the world isn't really filled with zombies chasing us, because there are pop-up menus, visual special effects, a sound track, etc... etc... It's a common trope in storytelling that someone can't tell fiction from reality. Stories about people falling in love with their reflections in the water date back thousands of years. Don Quixote was all about a guy who starting thinking that knights and dragons were real because he read so many books. We've got paintings coming to life, mannequins coming to life, video games coming to life. Invariably, the fictional thing, whatever it is, either kills people or saves them by crossing over the border into reality.  And don't get me started on all the movies where people interact with animated characters. (Which reminds me -- I haven't seen the latest Smurfs movie yet!) Now, if we can also figure out a way to temporarily wipe our memories -- so we don't remember all the cues that indicate that we've stepped into a virtual world -- then it can be interesting. Maybe we're all living in a virtual reality now... and it's just one giant video game... or a reality TV show.   ",

            "answer_text": "When VR gets able to cross the uncanny valley I guess; one of the challenges lies when avatars can behave like humans without being strange/horrible. It has been long since professionals got able to render super photorealistic 3D scenes out of modeling and animation tools: they can create a mount, a river, or a house, as well as various physical and chemical effects that are almost indistinguishable from reality, though fidelity of such models still have incremental improvements enabled by hardware and algorithmic advances. Leading Head Mounted Display(HMD) producers such as Oculus have also achieved noteworthy breakthrough such as dynamic focal plane, which would significantly boost fidelity and virtual comfort to watch VR contents. But, as VR users might have all noticed, human characters in VR, especially the faces, are still very cartoonish. That\u2019s not because professionals are not able to model one that\u2019s photorealistic. Check the example below, which represents how real modeler are actually able to make virtual humans:  The reason why such human models are not yet adopted in popular social VR platforms or VR games is that technology is not quite there where we can apply animation to these models so that they can have complicated facial expressions that live humans would have. A normal human has 43 facial muscles that enable her to show 10k+ distinct facial expressions, more than 3K of them being emotionally meaningful. On the other hand, we also have incredible ability to detect emotions based on subtle changes in facial expressions. Our minds learn about how facial expressions might imply slightly different emotions from different people. Without some substantial breakthrough in both model animation and expression detection on human faces, we would be no where near achieving behavioral realism for human characters. When a character has high visual realism (its appearance look like real humans) but is without behavioral realism (it doesn\u2019t act like humans and deliver human emotions) that matches, it inevitably becomes weird and scary and falls into the uncanny valley.  To avoid it, VR developers had to sacrifice visual realism altogether and go for cartoonish characters.   Current efforts to help VR cross the uncanny valley center around developing hardwares and algorithms to detect and decode facial expressions on humans and reflect them on avatars in real time. Computing and neuroscience company MindMaze proposed a way last year. It announced the new MindMaze Mask, which is a ring of electrodes headset producers can install into their products. The mask detects a user\u2019s facial expressions based on which parts of her facial skin is touching the detectors and with how much pressure they are touched, and then have the avatar reproduce one of 10 facial expressions based on these data. This is quite a promising and exciting design and hopefully would be welcomed by headset producers, although VR still has a long way to go until avatars can convey complex emotions that humans embrace.

            "answer_text": "We have for years, although I think this is a semantics issue. VR works the way it does because you DO think it\u2019s real. You think what you are in is real. It doesn\u2019t matter if it actually looks real; in the back of your mind you know you\u2019re not in it, but you think what you look at is real. I think this isn\u2019t what you meant though, I think you meant a way that you can actually not know you\u2019re in VR, even in the back of your mind, as opposed to seeing the VR world as real (which I did last night with Fallout4 VR). It will be a LONG time until we can do this. This has been answered quite a few times. Check out \u201cSAO\u201d or Sword Art Online here on Quora - people REALLY want to be able to go into SAO. I was in Fallout4 VR last night, it was great. The UI could use a little work though. Check out these answers: John Gwinner's answer to What are the closest current implementations of VR technology similar to that seen in Black Mirror episodes San Junipero and USS Callister? The main issue with VR being 100% indistinguishable is that we have at least 11 senses; fooling ALL of them, as opposed to the most important once, is not so easy. That table you lean on that\u2019s in the sun? You can feel the temperature of the marble on the inside of your stomach with your internal senses. VR would have to replicate every single thing to be totally indistinguishable. When you move, run, jump, and the like, your inner ear knows the difference between that and when the scene moves in VR; that\u2019s why you get sick. So, to make VR indistinguishable from reality, you've got to cut the connection from your brain to every part of your body and replace that with different sensations. That\u2019s a tall order. I\u2019m not sure it would ever be practical. It is also useless, to stretch a point; VR seems real, even when you know it\u2019s not. The best use of making VR seem completely real is locomotion and haptics. I like my Virtuix Omni, but it\u2019s not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination. I would like to be able to reach out and feel things, and rest my arm on that virtual table. (The Pip-boy gets really heavy in Fallout VR). ",

Current Oculus rift CV1 has 2k pixels on the screen. It is 2 times the pixels of DK2 and about 4 times the pixels of DK1. But it is still pretty low in VR. To have the best visual perception, we will need the pixel equivalent to retina display on tablets. So the VR display should be at least 4x or 8x of the ppi of retina Tablet. With this display, you could as much details on the object as you can see in real world.Reduce the display latency. The latency plays a major role of letting people sick, especially in a quick changing environment. We need reduce the latency of your start tuning your head to the new image arrive the eyes to 50ms or lower so people will feel the environment is real and solid.Better rendering technology. We have great rendering technology today, but they are too slow. That's why we can only use them in the movies and not the games. The VR will need the real time rendering of 90 frames per second, where we can only use low-poly meshes and low resolution textures.All the improvement will need more powerful GPUs and bigger video memory. We will also need to have better bandwidth on HDMI.  Hope that day will come early. ",

            "answer_text": "We'll get there...  ...eventually.  Rough guess:  a minimum of 25 years. The gating factors will be the depth and quality of the information that's fed into our senses, and getting rid of \"real\" input. Obviously, the visuals and sound have to be indistinguishable from reality, and I'd say we're less than a decade away on that front.  The biggest blocking factor facing us today is tactile feedback:  when I reach out and grab something, can I feel it?  When I lean against a wall, does it push back?  There are already people working on these things, with varying degrees of success.  Keep in mind that true tactile feedback is dangerous, because any system capable of pushing back on your hand to simulate a wall is probably also capable of breaking the bones in your hand (or worse).  However, that's a safety systems issue, and not a \"fool me into believing it's real\" issue. The second issue is why it'll take 25+ years:  eliminating \"real\" input from our bodies will require that we intercept nerve impulses, preventing them from getting to the spinal column and brain, and replacing those impulses when needed.  If I'm supposed to be flying, then why do I feel the couch pressing against my rear end?  If I'm supposed to be running, then why can't I feel my legs moving? To the best of my knowledge, nobody is directly working on a solution to the second issue.  There have been a few successful experiments with \"bionic\" eyes, ears, limbs, etc., but the technology for doing that without invasive surgery is far beyond anything we have today, and is likely to remain so for decades.  Of course, if we can take over control of a human's nervous system, then we won't need VR headsets or headphones either. Jack in!  (google:  Neuromancer by William Gibson) ",

A lot of VR experiences that have been demoed and shown still don't get quite close enough to invoke in most people the absolutely earth shattering feeling that is true presence. Though some feel it more easily than others. I would say it's not quite the same as being caught up in a movie or really engrossed in a video game played on a TV. The first time for me that it happened was when I was at the first Oculus Connect two years ago and tried a demo that had my head position tracked in space, and went through a reel of experiences where I could sit and walk in a small enclosed space. One of the experiences of myself with the appearance of a floating masquerade mask in front of a mirror. Not for the entirety of looking at myself in the mirror did I feel absolutely present, but for about 15 seconds I really felt like I was in the room with the mirror and definitely not in a hotel convention hall.
