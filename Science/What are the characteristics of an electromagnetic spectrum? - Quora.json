            "answer_text": "The \u201cspectrum\u201d just means electromagnetic waves over some range (i.e. spectrum) of frequencies. The frequency is simply how quickly the waves oscillate. Other than this, all frequencies are electromagnetic waves so they are all governed by the same physics. The waves themselves have an amplitude, a polarization, a frequency, and a direction. When the waves interact with materials, the difference frequencies can behave differently. Fundamentally, this is simply be cause each frequency has a wavelength and how a wave behaves depends entirely on how big an object is relative to the wavelength. If you want to learn more about electromagnetic waves, watch the series of short videos under Topic 6 here: Electromagnetic Field Theory - EMPossible ",
