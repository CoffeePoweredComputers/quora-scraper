            "answer_text": "A conceptual view of static vs current. A \u201cpool\u201d is what we call non-moving water. A \u201criver\u201d is what we call water in motion. Static electricity is the pool, analogously, and current is the river. Without gravity (potential difference), water won\u2019t flow. Similarly, without voltage (potential difference) charge will not move. Static charge is actually a misnomer and this analogy breaks down when we get to what electrical potential really is. Current is a form of spatial motion. For all forms of spatial motion, there exists the necessary component of a pressure difference that must tend towards equilibrium. High pressure seeks a lower pressure region. In like manner, low pressure seeks to be filled by higher pressure. This pressure difference is the fundamental mechanism for ALL micro/macrocosmic motion. Without pressure imbalance, there can be no motion. Whether by inertial pressure, scalar pressure, dielectric pressure, thermal pressure, etc. The concept of \u201cstatic\u201d charge means, fundamentally, a voltage potential (pressure) with no charge to \u201cpush\u201d (i.e. discharge). When we build a static charge from friction, we are essentially building increasing voltage. Then when we make contact with a grounded conductor, that pressure then has a path of least resistance (i.e. an open valve in a pressurized pipe system) and the small electrical arc seen and felt during static discharge is the \u201cpath\u201d charge is taking. So potential difference (voltage [i.e. dielectric pressure]) is potential energy. Current is the loss of that energy when charge is in-circuit during discharge. For those that would critique this view, understand that this is merely a conceptual view. But it accurately describes the behavior of electrical current, voltage, and static charge. ",

            "answer_text": "Current is the flow of charges and is calculated by the rate of flow of charges in a given time. So this is called as the current. But as the word static refers the charges are at the state of rest i.e they do not move. But why is it called static electricity? If the charges move they are called current. Considering the analogies like getting electrocuted from carpets, charged metals, circuit boards etc. In all these analogies the charges remain static i.e they do not move. Their total charge is the algebraic sum of each of the charges in the system. But when we touch a system that is charged, We are at a lower potential than the system is at. Hence inorder to balance the natures equilibrium, the charges move from the system to our body i.e a current flows through us. This is reason we get a spike when we touch charged bodies. Hence this is called Static electricity ( charges are static unless they are in contact with some lower potential body). This is the reason why it is necessary to discharge circuit boards by earthing them to avoid a shock, it is due to static electricity. Hope this answers your question ;) ",
