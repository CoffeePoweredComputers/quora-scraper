            "answer_text": "Ethics \u2014 moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity. As an observer that puts a lot of stock in David Hume\u2019s thinking, I would have to say that it is. The following passage is difficult to put into perspective if you don\u2019t read the section it is in (\u201cMoral Distinctions Not Derived From Reason\u201d) but it supports ethics as a practical science and the whole discussion is very helpful: \u201cIf morality had naturally no influence on human passions and actions, it were in vain to take such pains to inculcate it; and nothing would be more fruitless than that multitude of rules and precepts, with which all moralists abound. Philosophy is commonly divided into speculative and practical; and as morality is always comprehended under the latter division, it is supposed to influence our passions and actions, and to go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the understanding. \u201d His use of \u201ccalm and indolent\u201d is very deliberate I believe. It stresses his view that reason, judgements of the understanding, has no power of influence over our passions and actions. It is feelings that are morals that have sway over passions and actions \u2014 passions and feelings are active and reason is passive; reason does or works upon, whatever is demanded by passions and feelings. Nature had to have a means of influencing our passions and actions and it is feelings that can do this and not reason. When you observe a reasonable human being that is upset with passionate behavior of another and so moved to help in some way, some wrongdoing done that needs correcting, it is not his reason that is responsible for his help but his feelings. Feelings take control of the mind and it then reasons how to help. The only thing that has saved humanity from a miserable \u201cdog eat dog\u201d existence is feelings that are morals \u2014 \u201cthe moral sentiments,\u201d Hume\u2019s terminology. This is a very productive way to view Adam Smith; his reason was most definitely controlled by his feelings. His was a most complicated mind moral sentiments wise. The only way to read Adam Smith is with this understanding that he was moved by feelings that the others simply did not have, the very feelings that nature [intended] to be cultivated were cultivated in Smith.

            "answer_text": "Most sciences are practical, in the sense that they test theories by experiment, observation and experience. Some (I am thinking of theoretical physics) are much less so, but even they look for evidence - a practical exercise. Ethics, as a discipline or academic department/faculty/course, is a branch of philosophy - which borders on some social sciences (eg. psychology) but, if its theories are subject to practical testing, becomes a science. The question, then, becomes: can ethical theories be tested in the world, and not merely in logic or speculation? I can think of no examples; and so do not consider ethics to be a (practical) science. ",
