            "answer_text": "Basically igneous Rocks form from magma. As magma cool inside the crust it forms Rick's like gabbro, diorite, and granite. If it erupts onto the surface, we call it lava and it gets names like basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. Note that gabbro/ granite/rhyolite are essentially the same rock compositionally, but due to cooling rates, they have different textures. Sedimentary rocks form as igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks break down. The smaller pieces if rock can be squeezed back into rock with time, pressure, and cement to hold all the grains together. Metamorphic rocks are forms from igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic rocks that have experienced high temperature and pressure after their initial formation. This can occur from tectonic activity such as mountain building events or plate subduction. It can also occur when an magma in the crust intrudes rock already there, and the heat from the magma plus the pressure it exerts on the rocks around it can deform and metamorphose those rocks it intrudes. These are all related by the rock cycle.  ",

            "answer_text": "As a matter of introduction, all rocks (which is a broad term to describe all massive stones, laterally and vertically extensive that contains at least one mineral) are primarily originated from magma. A magma is a molten rock or melt that contains several minerals ( which means, it contains several elements and compounds) which originates from the mantle (usually, the upper mantle and less commonly, at depths or earth layers not deeper than the lower mantle). In the subsurface, beneath the earth, our feet, several processes (such as plate tectonics) occur which leads to the eruption of magma either on land (continents), which we are most familiar with, or in the waters (oceans). Wherever, the magma finds itself, it cools down (remember magma is very hot because it is a rock melt) on getting to the surface and crystallises to form solid rocks which are usually hard and tough in texture, when we feel them. These types of rocks are known as Magmatic rocks or Igneous or Primary rocks. Examples are granite, basalt, granodiorite, diorite, syenite and others. As time passes, these primary rocks weather (or break down) due to erosion by liquid water (most prominent agents), ice, air. Sometimes, they break down by biological activities (by plants when they tap, through their roots, minerals from rocks) and human activities. Weathered rocks are being transported by water, ice or wind into natural bowls known as sedimentary basins (regions of low elevations or depressions compared to the general elevations above sea level of adjacent area). These weathered rocks are deposited or accumulated in the basins, they consolidate (form a large mass) which are called sedimentary rocks. Examples are sandstone, shale, mudstone, claystone, limestone some sedimentary rocks are accumulations of precipitated minerals in the basin; they are practically not transported. Such sedimentary rocks are common in marine environments such as oceans and seas. Examples are phosphate, coomon salt (brine, NaCl), gypsum, certain limestones (such as sparite, micrite) and others. Be it either sedimentary or igneous rocks, when subjected to changing temperature and pressure can alter the minerals in the former (pre-exisitng rocks) to form new rocks. New rocks formed from the obliteration of pre-existing rocks are known as metamorphic rocks. Examples are quartzite (derived from sandstone), gneiss (derived from either shale or granite), amphibolite (derived from basalt) and others. However metamorphic rock can be derived from a former metamorphic rock. For instance, gneiss is derived from schist (a metamorphic rock). Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "The three main types, or classes, of rock are sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous . Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth's surfaceand within bodies of water. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles (detritus) to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, the sediment was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of denudation. Sedimentation may also occur as minerals precipitate from water solution or shells of aquatic creatures settle out of suspension. Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means \"change in form\".The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 \u00b0C) and pressure (150 megapascals )(1,500 bar) causing profound physical and/or chemical change. The protolith may be a sedimentary, an igneous, or even an existing type of metamorphic rock. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to assume you mean igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks here. Igneous rocks are formed by either slow or fast cooling of molten rock\u2014the slower the cooling, the bigger the crystals. Sedimentary rocks are formed by bits of other rocks (or organisms, in the case of limestone) being broken off, transported, deposited, and cemented, usually by precipitation of a cement from water. And metamorphic rocks are formed when other rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or even other metamorphic rocks) are altered by heat, pressure, or both heat and pressure. ",
