            "answer_text": "What about the nanobot being designed to use motion with the water in our body's. I mean come on humans are almost 80 percent water!!. The nano could recycle and recycle over and over going as long as it would need to carry out the task. Just a thought..also of course you wouldn't use propellers at that small scale you would need to use a forced jet like reusing the water molecules because we all know that molecules vibrating causes heat and force if used correctly to my understanding use that and apply it. If I had the equipment myself to make them I'd take it step further in all honesty. I think if we can defeat each of these problems wed be one step closer to the feat of searching for billions on DNA with a nanobot. I could be wrong but that's glory of science is trial and error will always help with the next step closer to success. ",

            "answer_text": "Really hard; there a number of reasons but the major problem that I'm familiar with is how to move the robot. You cannot just shrink a robot to the nanoscale and expect it to work the same way. As a robot shrinks the relative importance of forces changes; fluid forces and electrostatic forces become overwhelmed by surface tension and  viscosity. This means that tiny propellors, for example, become useless. Instead nano-bots have to rely on thing like self-generated chemical gradients to generate motion. Developing nanobots that move using entirely different physical principles is a major challenge. If we cannot yet move nanorobots in a controlled way then getting them to perform complex tasks like finding a desired DNA sequence amongst billions of discrete DNA sequences, capturing that sequence, then repairing that sequence is naturally very difficult.
