            "answer_text": "Everything is either a solid, a liquid, or a gas. Air is a mixture of gasses. The composition of this mixture is nitrogen (78%), oxygen (about 21%), and argon  almost 1%). Other molecules are present in the atmosphere as well, but in very small quantities. Water vapor is also present in varying concentrations. ",

In parts of the world where sulfur-containing fossil fuels are still burned, there may be sulfur dioxide in the air as well. ",
