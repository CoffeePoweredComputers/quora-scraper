            "answer_text": "Short answer: light that reflects once inside the raindrops forms the primary rainbow. Light that reflects twice (not three times) makes the secondary rainbow; when both are seen, it is sometimes called a double rainbow. And light that reflects three times makes the tertiary rainbow, but it is very faint and close to the sun. And on, and on, \u2026 Longer answer: A raindrop acts much like the parabolic mirror in a flashlight. It actually spreads the light everywhere within a cone, as in the picture below. But it is much brighter in a the outermost part of this cone. But the width of the cone is different for each color.  In the primary rainbow, the beam is aimed back at the sun (to the left in the picture) and is about 40\u00b0 wide. So you see the outer rings about 40\u00b0 from the anti-solar point (the shadow of your head). The cone for the secondary rainbow, because it is caused by two reflections, is aimed in the same direction as the original sunlight. But since it is about 130\u00b0 wide, it is seen 180\u00b0-130\u00b0=50\u00b0 from the anti-solar point. It is much less bright, and twice as wide to boot, so it isn\u2019t always seen.  The tertiary rainbow is also aimed back at the sun, but is 220\u00b0 wide. So it is seen 40\u00b0 from the sun. ",

            "answer_text": "So in a \u201csingle\u201d rainbow, light from the sun (which is behind the observer) bounces off of the back side of a raindrop and back into our eyes. In a \u201cdouble\u201d rainbow, some of the light bounces off of the back of the raindrop - then off of the inside of the front of the drop - and then off the back AGAIN to come back to our eyes. Those two extra reflections each absorb light - so the double rainbow is a lot dimmer. In truth, all rainbows are double, triple, quadruple and more - but each additional reflection makes those extra rainbows so dim that they are almost impossible to see. There is ALWAYS a double rainbow - it\u2019s just too faint to see most of the time. ",
