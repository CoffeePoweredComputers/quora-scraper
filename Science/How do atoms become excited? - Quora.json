            "answer_text": "Atoms become excited when electrons go from the ground state to an orbital level requiring more energy to exist there. This happens through some energy absorbtion whether that be heat, electricity or light. Heat. When I was a kid, I would go camping a lot. When I did I would probably eat more marshmallows then most people in a life time. However that's besides the point, after I would get done roasting them I'd stick my metal marshmallow roaster in the fire and it would glow red. This is done by the excitation of the metallic atoms and the electrons constantly rising and falling from the ground state to an excited state over and over again. It takes more overall energy to excited atoms with heat than other things. Electricity. Electricity does it because, while electricity travels through the crystalline lattice, the electrons experience what's called electrical resistance. What this means basically is that the material isn't a perfect conductor or a superconductor and the electrons are bouncing off the atoms in the lattice creating vibrations and the process described above occurs. Light. Light is an electromagnetic wave and often times if the photon collides with an electron it will be absorbed. If enough photons collide with a give material it will excited the atoms and the electrons absorbing the photons will emit light. ",
