            "answer_text": "I think you mean spherical cells vs flattened cells, maybe? The diffusion rate of things from the environment toward the inside of the cell, to be distributed throughout the cells depends on the ratio of cell surface to the cell volume. The most \u201cefficient\u201d shape of an object with regard to the amount of surface compared to the volume of what is inside the object is a sphere. Or in the 2D world, a circle. Any change from a sphere will create more surface area per volume. Since diffusion depends on the surface interface of the cell to the environment, diffusion will be faster with any shape besides the sphere because it has a larger surface for the volume of the cell. So the flat cell diffuses faster. ",
