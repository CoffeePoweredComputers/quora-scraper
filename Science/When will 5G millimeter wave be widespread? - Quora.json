            "answer_text": "If by widespread you mean ubiquitous, the answer is probably never. If you mean widely available in areas where it makes sense, probably in a year or two. The point is that the millimeter wave portion of the 5G spectrum doesn\u2019t penetrate \u201cstuff\u201d worth a damn. A 5G access point right outside a building doesn\u2019t guarantee availability inside that same building. On the other hand, millimeter wave 5G is capable of handling huge amounts of bandwidth and is beautifully suited for providing cellular access in sports arenas, concert venues, and similar places where hundreds or thousands of people are all trying to use their cell phones and where there is no intervening structure between the access point(s) and the users.
