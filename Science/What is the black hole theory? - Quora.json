            "answer_text": "A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out. It simply means that even if we will travel at the speed of light to escape from black hole then also we can't get success. HOW DO BLACK HOLES FORM ? Stellar black holes form when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself. This collapse also causes a supernova, or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassiveblack holes formed at the same time as the galaxy they are in.  One more question will occur\u2026\u2026. If black holes are \u201cBlack,\u201dHow Do Scientists Know They Are There A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light into the middle of the black hole. But scientist can see how the strong strong Gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole.Scientists can study stars to find out if they are flying around,or orbiting,a black hole. The Theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform space time to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally detectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime predict that Event Horizon emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a Kelvin for black hole of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.  HOW DO BLACK HOLES GET ENERGY? These objects can gain energy from the black hole, as they fall into the potential well they heat up and radiate (often in the X-ray region of the spectrum). So black holes have gravitational energy from their mass. A black hole could also have charge, but this is rare in the universe which is largely neutral. Many black holes probably rotate, and these also have rotational energy.  This is what , you have asked ",

            "answer_text": "The main theory for the existence of a black hole is based on Newton\u2019s law of gravity that objects attract objects\u2026. Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. So based on Newton\u2019s gravity a black hole has to be an object with a very large mass, millions or billions times bigger than our sun. The main problems for the explaining black holes are 1 We can't see them 2 They occupy a small space retaliative to their mass 3 Dust, gas and stars can orbit very close without being destroyed 4 There are small black holes and super massive black holes, but no medium sized black holes So our standard explanation is that gravity is so powerful that it collapses the mass into a tiny object, trapping light and anything else that gets pulled into its event horizon. So that seems to be the one and only theory based on the number of replies to this post\u2026. So here is theory number two! Black hole theory number two starts back with rewriting Newton\u2019s law of gravity. Let's say that Newton was wrong and that particles don\u2019t attract other particles. We can suggest a new law of gravity Liquid Gravity's law of universal gravitation states -that every particle continuously produces negative pressure within the universal medium. -that the primary negative pressure accumulates around objects. -that excess negative pressure accumulates at the center of object clusters to form gravitational wells. -that a gravitational well will attract objects together, -that gravitational force on an object is produced by the pressure differential between the opposite sides of the object which pushes an object in the direction of a gravitational well. -that gravitational pressure is reduced by the square of its distance from the center of the gravitational well. -that gravitational wells exist within bigger gravitational wells -that the density of gravitational wells control the speed of light, time and distance. -that gravity strength increases over time due to the gradual accumulation of negative pressure within a gravitational well. So with our new theory of gravity we can redefine our black hole and how it works. The first thing is that gravity is the result of accumulated negative pressure rather than force between two objects, which simply means we don\u2019t need a super massive object, we just need a big galaxy that is producing a lot of excess gravity. We see from the formation of early nebula galaxies that there are no gravitational structures, rather an exploded dust clouds with stars beginning to form within dust clusters. Over vast time scales we see fully developed galaxies that have evolved into spiral formations. The process between the two stages is a slow accumulation of negative pressure, where dust and gas accumulates to form form stars and grow into solar systems, then solar clusters. The accumulating pressure pushes toward the center of the solar clusters which begins a rotating action which increases in velocity as pressure builds towards the center of the gravity well. The increasing pressure pulls solar clusters together, but also increases their rotation speed around the center, This increase of rotation prevents galaxies just collapsing into the center and maintains large stars in orbit around an empty center point. The super massive Black hole is the vortex at the center of a galaxy that has formed at the point where the accumulated pressure and spinning action produces a vortex funnel that spins the high negative pressure back out into space. The vortex are the jets that are visible when matter or gas get caught up into the vortex funnel and become illuminated as they are ejected back out into the edge of the galaxy. The power of the super massive black hole is not produced by the black hole eating stars ad collapsing matter, but as a result all the force from every object within the galaxy pushing into the center. Small black holes form completely different, when a star decides to explode it sends all it matter out into space, leaving an empty gravitational well, which maintains its gravitational structure, with orbiting planets thinking that the star still exists\u2026 Newton Thought that objects attract objects where as Einstein better describes gravity as Objects bending space and space moving objects. A black hole is just empty space that has been bent by objects, and now pushes objects around. ",
