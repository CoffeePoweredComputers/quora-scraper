            "answer_text": "A light bulb emits spontaneous radiation. A laser emits stimulated emission thus the acronym Light Amplification Stimulated by Emission of Radiation. Both a light bulb and a laser can emit light in a visible range but the process by which they do so are quite different. Believe it or not, the reason a light bulb works is in, it\u2019s own right, almost as complicated a process as a laser. There are several types, yet for our examples let\u2019s go with the good old fashioned incandescent light bulb. The reason an incandescent light bulb is so bright is because the filament in which electrical current passes through burn incredibly hot. It must also remain in a vacuum or inert gas to prevent the filament from oxidizing lest the material chemically react causing it to \u201cburn out\u201d. Despite the brightness (about 15 lumens per watt) less than 5% of the filament produces light as energy. The rest is converted into thermal energy. The reason I say that a light bulb producing spontaneous emission is almost as complicated as a laser is because it cannot be explained by the classical electromagnetic theory. It is, by and large, a quantum process. This process involves exciting atoms within the filament form a ground state to a higher energy state. As the atoms become more and more excited they thy to conserve their energy by dropping back to as near the ground state as electromagnetically possible and emit photons( the light you see) and the process begins anew for that atom. As long as the material is in a vacuum and as long as a current passes though the medium(filament), then these atoms will remain in constant flux. While the process is a long one on the atomic scale, we tend to perceive it as instantaneous. The photons themselves, apart from the system, travel instantaneously at the speed of light. There is no acceleration because they were accelerated AT the speed of light to begin with. If you imagine the quantum process as someone pulling the plunger back on a pinball machine and holing it momentarily, then you can see the ball atop the plunger at rest. However as soon as the plunger is released, all of the stored energy in the spring is instantly released and the ball already moving as fast as it can move. So the short answer is when you flick on a light switch light is moving at ~186,000 miles a second instantly. The process to get the light to move took a little longer, even if you were not able to observe it. ",

            "answer_text": "It is mass which requires an application of momentum to increase its velocity relative to its context. A photon is massless. It is pure momentum and does not require \u2018acceleration\u2019 to be at its max velocity when it is emitted from an electron. The absorption and emission of momentum from matter is not well understood and we really have no clue to Gravity other than to describe it Contrary to some opinions, Gravity does not propagate at the speed of light because it would be required that matter be created fresh in order to generate such a field to measure. Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light but they are not Gravity per se but perturbations in a universal gravitational field composed of all of the mass in our Universe because the Gravitational field of any single particle of mass is infinite, albeit declining in intensity by the inverse square law with distance. The Gravitational asymptote never reaches zero. I believe that when our primitive instruments become more sensitive, we will find an entire spectrum of such Gravitational perturbations constantly washing past us in all directions. Remember, this is not only the present, it is also the past and the future and if we look at the past carefully, we will have much less faith in some of the things we believe to be true today and know that the picture will almost certainly appear very different in a hundred years time. There is no way we could have predicted today in 1918. Sadly, our civilization will reach its end within the next two generations if not our whole genepool and those of most of the other macrofauna on our planet due to our massive overgrowth of our support system. For all that we think we understand, we are still primitive monkeys in our collective behaviors. Can our understanding of this Universe be any more sophisticated than our cannibalistic mass murders which, for 6000 years of recorded history and way long before that, have become almost ritualistic and mindlessly automatic and accepted as \u2018necessary\u2019 by the majority of our kind? How bright can we really be? And, while pontificating like this, I might add that the only way to live your life is to do the best you can to become your own AUTHORITY in as wide a way as you have the capacity for. Human Authority has one major flaw. It is an habitual liar for its own benefit. And the human world of the average Human is just one new Santa Claus after another. The thing we call Human Knowledge has many of these. Beware. They speak in the tones of certainty which, in the past, only religion had the cojones to try to pull off on us. Authority. Expert. Hang them. Mentor. Guide. Sanctify them. And figure it out for yourself. You\u2019ll be happier. ",
