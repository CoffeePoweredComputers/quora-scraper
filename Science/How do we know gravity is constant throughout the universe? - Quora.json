You asked about \u201cthroughout the universe.\u201d The universal law of gravitation has not changed because of GR and its \u201ccurved space-time\u201d theory. Mass attracts mass, directly with how much mass in each body (or galaxy or massive system) and inversely with the distance between masses (squared.) There is no limit. It just diminishes with distance. How do we know that? By observing gravitational effects on all scales ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. There are spots all over Earth where gravity goes haywire, that trees grow in spirals, birds fly around to avoid, walking a straight path is exhausting while walking up a steep incline is a breeze, balls bounce off the ground at sharp angles, and dogs flip out when you forcibly bring them into the area. And water flows up the incline of a long narrow trench. ",
