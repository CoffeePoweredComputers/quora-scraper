            "answer_text": "There is \u201c NO \u201c space/time. Plane old gravity works just fine. TIME and EXISTENCE Time is just a \u201c MEASUREMENT \u201c. It is constant wherever you are. The accuracy of the instrument you use will be influenced by gravity, centrifugal force, heat, and a few other variables. Time in not a \u201c FORCE \u201c. There is no time \u201c DIMENSION \u201c. There is no possibility of time \u201c TRAVEL \u201c. All that exists, does so in the present \" INDIVISIBLE \" moment. A very high energy laser beam has it\u2019s own gravitational quality, and would interact accordingly with all things near it. GRAVITY IN GENERAL - THE UNIVERSE AND PARTS THERE OF. Copyright \u00a9 7-24-98 / VAu 436-388 / Robert Evan Howard The UNIVERSE is comprised of Gravity in Oscillating Densities // U = G O D I could have used other words, but the acronym ( U=G O D ) was just too compelling - from free form gravity to energy to matter, and back again. Like a pendulum. As the original gravitational formation grew, it became denser and denser at it\u2019s core because gravity only attracts. Eventually the core became dense enough to create base energy, then complex energy, then base matter, and finally complex matter. As everything breaks down, the process is reversed - complex matter, to base matter, to complex energy, to base energy, finally back to free form gravity, then back again. This is why everything attracts to everything else in proportion to it\u2019s mass density. Gravity and light ( LENSING ) all things attract each other, that is why you can see something behind a star - the light is pulled toward the star thus it\u2019s path is curved. If you had stars well placed, light could be pulled into a circle trajectory. There are \u201c NO \u201c gravitational waves. Any device trying to detect such things would detect gravity from passing satellites, movement from the earths core, passing cosmic dust clouds, planet movements, plains, clouds, flocks of birds, and even migrating schools of fish. Free form gravity can not be mechanically separated from the energy or matter of which it is apart. Energy and matter share their free form gravity if close. Free form gravity will attract to it\u2019s self forming a spherical shape if left to it\u2019s self like in our formation between galaxy clusters where as the free form gravity has a greater attraction to it\u2019s self than it has with it\u2019s energy or matter part. Free form gravity will be assimilated or shared by by the free form gravity of any energy or matter it comes in contact with. http://www.creationoftheuniverse.org/ For more info on how the process started.

            "answer_text": "(Thanks to Pranav Prabhu for requesting this answer.) [Disclaimer: I\u2019m an undergrad, not an expert. I\u2019ll answer within my best knowledge.] Yes, it does curve space time - photons of light carry energy, and in relativity we consider mass and energy to be essentially equivalent, referring to \u201cmass-energy\u201d as one quantity. Photons, therefore, do cause some bending of spacetime near to them, just as an object with mass would. However, this effect is ridiculously tiny for any kind of laser beam we could actually create. It takes a lot of mass/energy to curve spacetime enough to cause noticeable effects. Think about how much energy there is in your body according to [math]E = mc^2[/math]! And you can\u2019t cause any noticeable effects due to the curvature of spacetime with your presence, even with all that energy! So although technically yes, it would \u201cattract\u201d nearby objects, the same goes for your body, or your computer, or a pencil. It\u2019s only \u201ctechnically\u201d; the effects are minuscule. ",
