            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never heard the term Dry Star. I can only imagine it has something to do with the amount of hydrogen present but that\u2019s only a guess. A google search didn\u2019t return any relevant results. If you can provide more info, that would help. Polar stars are those that appear to be near the northern or south celestial pole. The most noteworthy is Polaris, which appears to be less than a degree from the north celestial pole, at least for now. Due to the wobble in the earth\u2019s axis, it changes over time. You can consider other stars that are in that general region of the sky to be polar stars. Similarly in the southern hemisphere, the closest naked-eye-visible star to the south celestial pole is sigma octans, which is a bit further from the pole than is Polaris, but, again, there\u2019s other stars in that part of the sky that could be considered polar stars, though not \u201cthe\u201d pole star.
