First, does this look like a flat surface to you?  If not, why? Where is the curvature? The right side is the same height as the left side and you can draw a straight line between the two extremes. The texture of the material only looks like it might be curving away because of the principle of vanishing point. The trouble with your idea of how the curvature should appear is that you\u2019re thinking it should be visible along a left-to-right vector. You\u2019re expecting the far left and right of your peripheral vision to show a horizon curving downward. As anyone with the most cursory knowledge of geometry will tell you, this would only be the case if you were standing on a cylinder rather than a sphere. We also exist in 3 dimensional space rather than on a 2 dimensional plane. By the way, the horizon from before is a cylinder. If you were small enough to stand on it, this would be your view if you looked left or right relative to the first view.  If we regard the ends of the cylinder as poles North and South, the longitudinal lines will be perfectly straight apart from that sharp turn at the pole when it all flattens out. Meanwhile, lines of latitude will be circles. If you were to lay down a long plank of wood on the ground and turn it to be parallel to the lines of latitude, the ends of the plank would be off the ground, right? If you were to turn it to be parallel to the lines of longitude, those ends would now be touching the ground, wouldn't they? The distance between the ends of the plank and the ground changes when you rotate it relative to the horizon. Let's trade our cylindrical surface for a flat one. The ends of the plank are touching the ground East to West, and are still touching the ground North to South. The ends of the plank are the same distance to the ground no matter the orientation. Now let's have some real fun. Put the plank on a curved surface. The ends of the plank are off the ground as you'd expect, and that's the case no matter how you rotate it along that central pivot point. The ends of the plank are the same distance to the ground no matter the orientation. Exactly like on the flat surface. This is why observing the horizon from the surface is not going to reveal curvature whether you're on a sphere or a disc. You won't see the curvature left to right in your field of view because all points on that horizon are the same distance from you. Why would you be able to see farther along a longitudinal line compared to a latitudinal one or vice versa? That was pretty intense, wasn't it? It's okay. Look, it's getting late. How about we watch the moon rise? \u2026 Isn't this pleasant? You know some people say the moon looks bigger near the horizon than when it's straight overhead. Weird, huh? I mean, it looks the same size to me, but shouldn't it get smaller? ",

            "answer_text": "See, the problem here isn\u2019t the curve. It is that YOU as a Human, are FAR too tiny to be able to observe the curvature. So I tell all the flatties on Quora to go to Chicago [not Michigan like the flatties always do] and look across the lake towards Michigan. Water is all you will be able to see. Pay for the elevator ride to go to the top of the Sears Tower [Fuc Willis] and you will See the state of Michigan there, across the Great Lake. In that respect, you are seeing a Demonstration of the curvature, even if you can\u2019t really perceive it. Now the Flatties always go to the beach in southern Michigan and try to come up with all kinds of nonsense \u201cmath\u201d that explains that since you see [tops of] the skyscrapers of Chicago across the 50 mile wide lake, there is no curvature. What can I say, you just can't fix stupid even with duct tape, bailing wire and Gorilla Glue! ",
