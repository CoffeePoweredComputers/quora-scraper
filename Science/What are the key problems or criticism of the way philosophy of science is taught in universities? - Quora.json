            "answer_text": "Philosophy of science is taught almost exclusively from a materialist or naturalist perspective. Ir provides a justification for that paradigm, but rarely any substantive criticisms of that way of thinking or evaluating reality. Unfortunately, Thomas Kuhns work points to the possibility of other paradigms for thinking about knowledge. Its important to keep an open mind in this regard. Second, it doesn\u2019t seem to be taught in terms of the strengths and limits of science. For instance, in understanding Michael Jordan or Lebron James or Shaq, or any great player, I need to understanding their strengths and weaknesses. Even Ben Franklin noted the value of comparing advantages and disadvantages. What can science tell us? What can\u2019t it tell us? What sources of knowledge can inform us best in those areas? Remember, Phil Jackson plans didn\u2019t give the ball to Jordan in the Bull\u2019s playbook. He relied on others\u2014where their strengths were. Third, part of the purpose of the philosophy of science is to clarify the assumptions of science, and perhaps even the results of those limits. Fourth, types of problems and types of knowledge is a helpful way to think about how we can better think critically and identify the strengths of other disciplines. Nathan Ketsdever's answer to What are the most common forms of epistemology? It seems to be taught with almost no recognition that many of our problems as a society are multi-dimensional, and so science alone is an insufficient method. Not to mention, the other disciplines bring something to the table. Otherwise engineers may come into discussions with other people thinking the only consideration is engineering. But not every problem is a problem of science or engineering. Engineering certainly has its place, but understanding human problems and issues of meaning, purpose, and ethics forces one to look beyond the realm of science for answers. ",
