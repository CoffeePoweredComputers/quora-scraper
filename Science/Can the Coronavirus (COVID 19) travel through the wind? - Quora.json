            "answer_text": "I expect many widely promulgated beliefs about COVID-19 to bite the dust before too long, among them the two-metre danger zone. Hate anecdotal evidence? Here\u2019s my take on windborne transmission, but it\u2019s not even evidence, it\u2019s just an anecdote. I was carefully avoiding coronavirus trouble since January. Then on St Patrick\u2019s Day I biked over to the liquor store after supper. Out of would-be prudence I waited till just before closing time, expecting the store to be emptier. There was a homeless man sitting in the doorway of a closed cafe adjacent to the store around four or five metres away from the locking ring where I got off my bike. As I got the lock out of my bag, a store employee appeared at the door and locked it, a couple of minutes early. Dismayed, I began putting my lock back in the bag just as the guy sitting down began coughing his lungs out. Seldom have I wanted to get out of anywhere as fast, which was exactly why I clumsily dumped all kinds of ID and other cards out of my bag onto the sidewalk. It must have taken me ten seconds to pick them all up, but it of course seemed like thirty. All the while the guy hacked as loudly and as unrestrainedly as possible, not covering his mouth. He was pale, sweaty, and sick-looking. The wind was moving slightly, about as much as the air conditioning in a mall. It seemed to be drifting from the direction of the sick guy. It then occurred to me that he\u2019d been sitting there coughing for hours, including right up till the moment I appeared. I tried to hold my breath but couldn\u2019t avoid inhaling just as I got my feet on the pedals. I shot the guy a dirty look and sped off to a different store. Sure enough, three days later I felt a fever come over me as I lounged at home doing very little. Other symptoms followed, and I\u2019m still battling the illness weeks later. To my shame, I had a two-pack of good 3M masks at home, purchased last fall for wearing while using my circular saw. It was still sealed, as I was waiting for the confirmed cases in my city to pass one in 100,000 before wearing them. I haven\u2019t often felt like such a dumbass. Maybe it\u2019s anecdotal evidence after all. Who can say? ",

            "answer_text": "Ashley Owens asks if COVID-19 can transfer through the wind, which should be asked by everyone. No one seems to question a six-foot rule, but that is based on air transmission of a tiny virus, which must be suspended in liquid from cough or sneeze. More recently the concern escalated enough to recommend face covering, and another concern about a \u201cpink eye\u201d noted in about 30% of patients. Basically it is in the air. Wind is just moving air, which is how it gets to us. Water is not just a stream, spray, mist, or aerosol, it gets as small as a molecule of H2O. That molecule is a gas. The smallest water can get as liquid as we know it is a six molecule hexamer. It\u2019s size is about 0.5 nanometers, which happens to be about the size of the smallest virus. When it is cold outside you see your breath, which is the saturated warm air from your lungs condensing in the cold air. This condensation happens when we don\u2019t see it in room air, and that can contain virus, carried in the wind. Room air is not still, it is constantly stirred up, more with HVAC heating and in airplanes, which exchanges air 5-6 times an hour. Wind should be a concern and then some. Whenever you smell anything, remember that there is a molecule that landed inside your nose. The dry virus physically looks like a pollen particle, but smaller by magniturdes and more likely to stay aerodynamically suspended in the wind ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you, my friend, for asking me to reply to this extremely precise question. Good Evening. The National Institute of Health has recommended all people wear a mask, when entering any building open to the public. The reason for this health advisory is understandable. The Covid-19 virus is almost exclusively an airborne virus. In an enclosed building, were we to inhale sufficient quantities of the coronavirus antigen, we would ourselves, become infected. We must also be mindful Italian doctors detected viable antigens of the virus, in an enclosed room of an infected patient, who was only\u2026breathing\u2026thirty (30) feet away from the patient. Here, in 6the United States, we were able to capture viable antigens of the coronavirus\u2026sixteen and a half (16 1/2) feet from a patient who wasn\u2019t coughing, or sneezing\u2026just breathing. However, you asked about \u201cwindy\u201d conditions. I believe, should we observe social distancing (two meters/six feet), from any person, simply because we are in an \u201copen air\u201d setting, instead of an enclosed building, we run minimal chance of being infected\u2026even with airborne antigens. If we are six feet apart from another person, and it\u2019s windy enough to blow the sugar right out of a cup of coffee\u2026I think it would be impossible for us to become infected. I hope you remain healthy, my friend, and enjoy a pleasant Evening. ",

In winter much longer than in summer. Wind influences the local air flow so wind can influence who gets infected on the local level. I absolutely cannot imagine that it is stable enough to travel from village to town or from city to city through the wind (but unless someone measures that we cannot be entirely sure). I am really sure, however, that the authors of the following paper made a huge mistake by publishing a WRONG POSTULATE (luckily they don\u2019t claim that it is true, just a postulate) that viruses even can travel across oceans by wind (it\u2019s about the flu virus but if they were right, it could be applied to the Covid-19 virus, too): Impact of atmospheric dispersion and transport of viral aerosols on the epidemiology of influenza - PubMed They overlooked the fact that viruses can have a seasonal effect which comprises BOTH, the infectivity AND the virulence/deadliness (IFR) of a virus and hence can \u201cpop up\u201d out of \u201cnowhere\u201d when it gets cold.

That is the reason for social distancing. It is to provide enough space between you and someone else if they cough or sneeze. It isn't an air born virus that lingers on the air like the measles virus that can. It has to have biomatter from an infected human to spread. Once the biomatter dries out it dies. ",

However, it is very unlikely that you will catch it when it is flying around in the wind. The water droplets / particles have to settle down in your nose or mouth for the virus to be able to infect you and multiply. That is why mask mandates are enforced in closed spaces and outside in the open only when you are in a crowded place where distancing cannot be ensured. ",
