            "answer_text": "This answer will be a little long but I think you\u2019ll understand by the end of it (alternately you can just watch the video in the end) Throw a ball up in the air. You have imparted initial Kinetic Energy (KE) right at the beginning. Observe the ball move up. As the ball moves up, you see the velocity of the ball is reducing since the force of gravity is acting against it. In Physics, we say that this force of gravity is doing negative work on the ball. The ball has now reached the top, its velocity is zero. Basically force of gravity has done enough negative work to reduce the velocity to zero and therefore its KE has also becomes zero. Let\u2019s say this total work done by gravity in upward journey is W1 (it would be a negative sign e.g. -4J or -10J) But what has happened to the initial KE. The KE of the ball keeps reducing as it moves up but another form of energy keeps increasing. This other form of energy is Potential Energy (PE). Thus the PE at start is zero and keeps increasing till all KE has converted to PE by the time it reaches the top of the flight. The gravitational force that did negative work on the ball and decreased its KE has in the process increased the PE of the ball. Thus negative work (W1) has resulted in positive change in PE. According to work KE theorem, Delta KE = W1 \u2014\u2014\u2014- Eq. 1 but since Mechanical energy has to be conserved Delta PE + Delta KE = 0 \u2014\u2014\u2014- Eq. 2 Use Eq. 1 to substitute Delta KE as W1 in equation 2, we get Delta PE + W1 = 0 or Delta PE = - W1 As an example, if work done is say -10 J and the change in PE is from say PE (initial) = 0 J to PE (final) = 10 J, then- Delta PE = -W or PE (final) - PE (initial) = -W or 10 J - 0 J = - (-10 J) 10 J = 10J Enroll into 8 Lesson Free Course : How to study physics faster ",

            "answer_text": "The motivation for the convention is in the name: \"potential\" energy. It's conceptually energy that is yet to be, or at least yet to be visible. When the force does some work on a particle, kinetic energy appears. Now compared to elastic collisions, which you've probably studied earlier, this is a bit of a mystery, because there kinetic energy is conserved: passed from particle to particle but not created or destroyed. But then you notice that, especially with gravity, you often get pairs of things orbiting, with the kinetic energy coming and going as the distance between them changes. So you figure the energy is merely being hidden, and you start an account for it. And when the force does some work, you debit the potential column and credit the kinetic column and say that energy as a whole is conserved.  And amazingly, this often works. It didn't have to work - you could have had force fields that went round in circles, so that by sending a particle around the same circle you could let the force do work on it and increase its kinetic energy all day, making the bank account metaphor look pretty unrealistic. And in more advanced physics you do encounter force fields that run in loops, albeit only transiently. (Loopy electric fields are created by changing magnetic fields, but you can't keep increasing the magnetic field indefinitely.) But two of the most common and important fields, gravitational and electrostatic, are conservative, which means that no matter how you move a particle from point A to point B in three dimensions, the same work is done, and if you move it back to A the net work is zero. So the bank account model works very well: you have a \"potential\" account that pays out purely according to the position of the particle in the field. ",
