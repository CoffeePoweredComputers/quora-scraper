            "answer_text": "to me, the word \u2018better\u2019 in your question is not appropriate all temperature scales are equally good or bad it is more convenient to have a system in which the starting point is zero (the kelvin scale) rather than working in a system where you will have to routinely handle negative numbers (the Celsius scale) a more serious issue arises when you do algebra for thermodynamics. all calculations there are done in the language of \u201cabsolute temperature\u201d where otherwise you will have to work with t+273 ",

            "answer_text": "Only in physical calculations is the Kelvin scale better and it does depends on which scale you\u2019re accustomed to. If you never learned about Celcius and only knew Kelvin, then you would say that ice freezes at 273deg K, rather than 0deg C. The Celcius scale\u2019s only advantage is that we are used to it and it\u2019s zero point is defined at the freezing point of water on Earth at sea level. ",
