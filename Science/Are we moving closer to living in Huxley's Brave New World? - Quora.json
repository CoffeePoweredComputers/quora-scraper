            "answer_text": "There certainly many interesting parallels. The entire divisions that currently exist due to wealth and literacy (whether it is technological or simple reading) could easily be transposed onto BNW's Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon types. More than ever, nepotism has stratified certain domains like Hollywood, politics and corporate America. Although most likely not intended, the whole notion of \u201chypnopaedic\u201d (sleep-teaching) certainly describes what passes for learning in a lot of public schools. The similarity between soma and television needs no explanation. How modern television inappropriately acquaints young children with sexuality mirrors much of BNW as well. Much as with today's sexually liberated youth, one of the book's characters is teased about staying with one partner for an interminable four months. The shock and dismay at seeing visible aged people at the Savage Reservation in New Mexico is already somewhat commonplace with respect to how signs of age are widely regarded as ugly or disfiguring. The popularity of cosmetic plastic surgery, especially in some Asian countries\u2014in many cases having nothing to do with age\u2014are also a manifestation of this overemphasis upon external appearances. The Director's shame over having biologically fathered a son finds comparisons in more recent attempts to portray the nuclear family as an outdated social fixture. While not entirely comparable, the ongoing introduction of artificial insemination, embryo implantation and other in vivo or in utero surgical methods demonstrate a similar divergence from traditional biological reproduction versus the technologically facilitated cloning of BNW. This same unknown biological offspring (i.e., grown child) being brought back from the New Mexican Reservation and becoming somewhat of a celebrity has numerous parallels, be it in the way that New World \"savages\" like Pocahontas were such objects of curiosity in colonial era England or how aboriginal art forms currently are favored as being more \"authentic\" or \"original\" by many modern art critics. Inverted definitions abound such as with the so-called \"Hospital for Dying\"\u2014as opposed to one dedicated to saving lives\u2014just as Politically Correct speech can often engender similarly awkward malapropisms (e.g., a short person being \"vertically challenged\"). Liberalism's ongoing fascination with Big Government, especially in the form of One World Government, is given its head and the World State\u2019s policies in BNW are criticized as being dehumanizing, much as persistent concerns about massively centralized government continue to be. BNW's sacrifice of art, science, and religion for the sake of social stability can also be seen in modern day attacks upon free and Constitutionally protected expression in order to avoid hurting the feelings of others. Given the above, yes, we are \"moving closer to living in Huxley's Brave New World\". ",

That lesbians are being unfair or bigots if they don\u2019t have sex with biological men in dresses. This is termed \u2018the cotton ceiling\u2019. That heterosexual men really should have sex with their homosexual friends, you\u2019re being unfair by not sharing. That a good man lets his wife cheat because it is liberating for her. The rash of articles on how you\u2019re being bad and mean if you don\u2019t have sex with fat people or those you\u2019re otherwise not attracted to, you privileged bully. We\u2019ve gone from \u201cdon\u2019t have sex unless in marriage\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t be monogamous, you have to have sex with everyone or you\u2019re hurting them\u201d.
