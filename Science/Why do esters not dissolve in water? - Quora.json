            "answer_text": "Esters can form hydrogen bonds through their oxygen atoms to the hydrogen atoms of water molecules. As a result, esters are slightly soluble in water. However, because esters do not have a hydrogen atom to form a hydrogen bond to an oxygen atom of water, they are less soluble than carboxylic acids. ",
