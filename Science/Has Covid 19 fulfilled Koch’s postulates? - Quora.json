            "answer_text": "Interesting question just now as I was reading the tests being done on a potential vaccine. It has now been injected into humans as the first test of safety. But the most important and difficult test is to determine if it is also effective. That test has now been done when the vaccine was injected into monkeys, a typical experimental animal, and after an appropriate period, the monkeys were injected with the virus and apparently they did not show symptoms. My problem is it did not occur to the story teller to also talk about a control group, so I assume these monkeys were also tested first for susceptibility to the virus, and that that test was composed of viruses recovered from a COVID-19 patient.. As I put this report together, and add my conjectures, it means that a sample of a suspected pathogen was taken from a diseased person, injected into a susceptible animal, and that animal showed the symptoms of the disease, and the pathogen was then recovered. My conjecture does not take me so far as to assume that this recovered sample was then tested in another susceptible animal. So\u2026 while a straightforward demonstration of Koch\u2019s postulates was not in this report, there is sufficient information from this report coupled with everything else we have learned to conclude that the basic elements of those postulates were satisfied. Certainly I cannot imagine any virologist who would seriously question if this SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 ",
