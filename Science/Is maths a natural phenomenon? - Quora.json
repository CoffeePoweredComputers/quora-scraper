            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Consider teaching a child to count using a set of blocks and you develop the positive integers. \u201cMommy, what\u2019s the next number? Daddy, what\u2019s the biggest number?\u201d Get your children sharing blocks and you\u2019ll get into addition and subtraction. \u201cMommy, John has three blocks and I have four and when I count them all we have seven! Daddy, I had five blocks and I gave two to Susan and now I only have three left!\u201d When taught right, kids like to be able to figure things out and answer questions. Want fractions? Try bringing out water and glasses or piles of sand. Multiplication and division? Teach them to cook and how to scale up (multiplication) or scale down (division) recipes. When you teach them to drive, remember to include the fact that changing the velocity (vector) of a car involves acceleration, so they negotiate Dead Man\u2019s curve without a problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. Man in his humble way has striven to discover mathematics but only very slowly.  The whole universe, since it began, has been governed by mathematics. The gravitation of celestial bodies, which  orbit other bodies in space has followed a strict set of laws, only very recently discovered by man.  Pythagoras discovered that the square on the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the squares on the other two sides, but it had been true since the universe began 13.7 billion years ago or whatever period the universe is deemed to  have existed. Mathematicians  continue to make discoveries.  Man compiles the language to describe or model the natural phenomena and this  language of mathematics is man\u2019s contribution to the universe. ",
