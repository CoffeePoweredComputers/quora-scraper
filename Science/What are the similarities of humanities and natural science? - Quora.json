            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll riff on this \u2014 The Humanities use Natural Science as an inescapable foundation. This is summarized in one pithy statement by Aristotle: \u201cArt is an imitation of Life.\u201d The Humanities (i.e. Aesthetics, Ethics, Economics, Politics, Rhetoric, Poetry, Music, Literature, Fine and Performing Arts, Theater, Art Criticism, History) presume the existence of Humanity. Humanity \u2014 as Aristotle showed \u2014 is inevitably bound up with Nature and the four main drives of life: (1) to eat; (2) to sleep; (3) to procreate; and (4) to defend. These must be fulfilled before the community can exist \u2014 and the community must exist before the Humanities can develop. There was a hunting tribe with a chief before there was cave painting. Now \u2014 what about Science Fiction, Fantasy, and so forth, which are Anti-Natural? Aristotle\u2019s observation remains true \u2014 because there is such a thing as Negative Imitation. Just doing the Opposite of what one observes others doing. This is no more creative than the brilliant imitation of Life that we see in Shakespeare for example. Again \u2014 Nature exists first, in all its complexity. Then Humanity appears. Then the many Arts of the Humanities appear. That\u2019s the Order. Somebody must know how to make paint, before there can be painting. Somebody must know how strings, reeds, wood and brass vibrate, before there can be music. But, doesn\u2019t Religion transcend Nature? No \u2014 Religion only goes to the Source of Nature \u2014 the Creator \u2014 with recognition, gratitude, ritual and meditation. In most forms it doesn\u2019t abandon Nature. (\u201cFor God so loved the World\u2026\u201d Some forms of Religion like Gnosticism, Monasticism, etc. do try to \u201cleave the body\u201d and \u201cdeny the senses\u201d but that was always an unending struggle \u2014 more of a dream than a genuine attainment.) Anyway \u2014 the Humanities all presume that some Natural Science must exist first, in some form or other. There\u2019s my riff. ",
