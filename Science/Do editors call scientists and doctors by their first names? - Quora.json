            "answer_text": "When we were producing 50 books a year, many of them by scientists and physicians, we worked closely with authors on their books for major publishers. In general, we addressed them by their first names while working with them, both in emails and in phone conversations. There\u2019s still an aura of importance when someone is doing a book for a publisher with a famous name. In the early 1990s we worked on a book by a physician who was then Dean of the Harvard Medical School. The publisher was Addison Wesley. It was amazing how quickly we were able to get this guy on the phone to talk about his book. I sometimes imagined what it might have been like to be one of his patients who wanted to talk to him. But U.S. business culture is very informal. When Wall Street financiers use phrases like \u201ccock blocking\u201d and call the president \u201cDon\u201d it should be no surprise that scientists and doctors are also called by their first names.

As an editor myself, I adopt the same approach. Using a title is polite if you don\u2019t really know your correspondent and they have not introduced themselves by their first name. Using a first name is, in my culture at least, more polite in the case of someone with whom you are on friendly terms. ",
