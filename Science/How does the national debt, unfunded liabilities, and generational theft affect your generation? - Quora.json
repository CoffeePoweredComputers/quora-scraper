            "answer_text": "The term \u201cunfunded liabilities\u201d is usually misapplied by sensationalists who want to paint the worst possible picture. Social Security and Medicare are both fully funded; on top of that, the US government owes the Social Security fund over $3 trillion, excess cash collected over the years. The idea that \u201cwe\u2019ll soon run out of money\u201d is equally absurd. What has happened in the past nearly 90 years is that the possibility of insolvency looms Congress simply tweaks the process ever so slightly to prevent insolvency from occurring. On top of that, millennials are now the single largest demographic group, and following them there will be an even larger group; the population of the US continues to grow and will for generations. It\u2019s the unnecessary debt accumulation that is crippling the status quo coupled with the tax cuts and two wars that have created it. Just stop cutting taxes, hold spending in check and the deficit will turn into a surplus and the debt will begin to be paid down. Just like occurred in the Clinton years, and was being approached during Obama\u2019s tenure. Instead we get pandering populists like Bush 43 and Trump saying \u201cdeficits don\u2019t matter,\u201d when in fact, they do because they turn into debt which does matter. ",
