People who are living their lives and have goals and dreams don\u2019t even think about race. If you watch a lot of TV, you will get a different idea, but TV has almost nothing to do with real life. Get out and talk with people, and you will almost never hear a word about race. ",

Personally, find any and all forms of racism as offensive, but many times today racism is a term used to fight the truth, have to be careful this is not the case when dealing with some facts. ",
