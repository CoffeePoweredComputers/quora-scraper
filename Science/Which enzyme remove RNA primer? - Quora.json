            "answer_text": "RNA primers can be removed by DNA polymerase with proofreading activity and RNAseH. Both work in different conditions. For DNA polymerase to act, it should be extending an existing template and RNA primers should be in their way. This happens during lagging strand synthesis of DNA replication. Their digestion can only happen in 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. RNAseH work when RNA primer is bound to complementary DNA strand and has nicks in between RNA-DNA primer. Alternatively, primers can be denatured using alkali wash to remove from DNA-RNA hybrid and digested by these ribonucleases. ",
