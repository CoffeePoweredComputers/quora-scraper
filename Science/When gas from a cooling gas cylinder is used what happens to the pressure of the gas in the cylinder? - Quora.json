            "answer_text": "The pressure should I think stay the same for a given temperature as long as there is liquid in the tank. When the liquid is all gone then the pressure will decrease pretty quickly as the gas is used. At the same time the evaporation of the liquid cools the cylinder lowering the pressure unless ambient heat maintains the cylinder temp. So while there is liquid left the pressure might decrease just because of cooling and lowering the boiling point. Otherwise not. ",
