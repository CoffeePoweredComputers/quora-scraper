            "answer_text": "If I understand the question correctly, you ask what will be the typical life cycle of a metal part when 3D printing techniques are used. First of all, the demands on the part should be studied: Physical factors like GD&T, stretching, shearing, bending, fatigue, etc, and more marketing-oriented things like need for weight reduction, hygiene, aesthetical aspects and foreseeable selling price and demand. This phase is nothing new, it forms part of any product development. The factors above are hopefullly enough to decide on the choice of metal or alloy, plus it will decide the maximal complexity of the part: If the selling price is low and the market is big, then the part should be designed for both Additive Manufacturing methods and more traditional production techniques. To illustrate: Imagine a simple door hinge. It usually constist of two plates with holes in it, with one edge bend in places to form several alligned tubes, plus a pin to join those plates together. Any blacksmith worth his salt can make a three-part hinge as described, but it will take a jeweller or a 3D printer to make it in one go. So: Mass market, low price -> limited complexity and integration; small market, high price -> unlimited complexity and maximum integration. Now for the mass market part the ideal PLM would look like this: Print part on 3D printer-mill part by CNC-print near-net part mold on 3D printers-mill near-net part molds by CNC-write off machined molds but keep original CAD and print files in your database for servicing the second hand market. For the small, high-value market the story should go like this: Spend another few rounds on design optimalization, to save material and printer envelope space. Simulate all possible use scenarios. Request a quote for the part as-is from the inhouse shop or service bureau. Try to get feedback on the design, to bring the price per piece down further. Simulate with the optimized design. Order, test and qualify a small batch. Decide on optimal order volume (a multiple of one machine build?) and order again. Stop ordering when demand stops but keep the CAD and print files in your database for servicing the second hand market. ",

            "answer_text": "Scrap steel is an essential ingredient for all new steel, so every steel-making plant is a recycling plant. The value of scrap steel ensures that whenever it can be collected and recycled, it is. But in many applications, steel lasts for a long time, so there is a lot of steel in the world, doing a useful job. Here is life cycle image for you:  Here some of the interesting fact for you: The recycling rate of steel depends on the end-use, but on average around 85% of steel, at the end of it\u2019s first useful life, is recycled.Over 99% of steel from scrap cars is recycledA UK study showed that 94% of steel is recycled when a building is demolished99% of structural steel is recycled or re-used when a building is demolishedIn Europe, over 70% of steel packaging is recycled, which is far more than any other packaging material",
