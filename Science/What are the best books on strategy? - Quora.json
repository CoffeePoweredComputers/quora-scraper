The art of war by Sun Tzu. 2. 48 Laws of power by Robert Greene. 3. 33 war strategies by Robert Greene. 4. Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim. 5. Strategy by Lawrence Freedman. 6. The strategy paradox by Michael Raynor. 7. The lords of strategy by Walter Kiechel. 8. On war by Carl Von Clausewitz. 9. Mastering the Rockefeller Habits by Verne Garnish 10. Science, Strategy and War by Frans Osinga. As you can realize, most books I have recommended are about military tactics and War. Applying all military theories and strategies are put into real life whether business or dealing with people, one becomes a master of strategy. Personally those are the books, that come to my memory first in comparison to few hundreds of books I have read on strategy. ",

            "answer_text": "In what area of life do you wish to apply strategy? The Prince by Machiavelli is very very good. Focused on politics. Many folks recommend \"The Book of Five Rings\" by Miyamoto Musashi, however my personal experience is that it is too opaque to be that useful. Or, if I could be more blunt, I would say one thinks they understand the book, but really, we don't.    I say that having lived in Japan and having both a third degree black belt and studied koryu bujutsu (the old stuff). Yagyu Muenori - The Sword and the Mind and The Life Giving Sword - these are very technical books about sword fighting.  There is (obviously) more there, but it may seem to you its all about \"strike at the wrists\" and \"still the mind\" The 36 Strategies of Ancient China, theoretically written by Sun Tzu, but probably written by Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms period. Its on my bookshelf, but I haven't read it yet. ",

Although Michael Porters books competitive advantage and competitive strategy almost have 30 years on their back, they still are relevant and have influenced millions of business leaders. Mintzberg and Levitt books are right there with Porter.  In general there will never be or should be a \"best\" book in strategy, since this will give the reader the illusion of \"this is it\" in strategy trying to mimic strategic thinking on what has already happened. Strategy books are like different set of tools, you collect the tools you need for the job at hand and you always start with a tool belt. ",

It\u2019s constrained enough to keep you focused. After using it for years I still discover nuances every day. That\u2019s not true of most of other strategy tools. Many of the classic strategy tests are deeply rooted in time and place, Marx, Jomini, Clausewitz, Sun Tzu and Machiavelli for example. You can extract maxims from them but they aren\u2019t universalisable. The books I return to again and again are at Over The greenes books on Power, war and seduction. They are deeply flawed but the number of historical examples acts as a wonderful stimulus to the mind. ",
