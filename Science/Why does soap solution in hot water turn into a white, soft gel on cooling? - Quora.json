            "answer_text": "The soap-water jells by the soap molecules' assembling into bilayers -- a lamellar form. These are sheets with the molecules in one face pointing the opposite direction from the molecules in the other face. The transition is governed by the thermodynamic equation G = H - TS, where G is free energy, H is enthalpy, T is temperature, and S is entropy. Setting G = 0, where the system is at equilibrium between the 2 conditions, and rearranging, H = TS, and solving, T = H/S. This gives you the temperature at which this transition can take place. The lamellar gel state has a lower entropy than the closer-to-random solution, so the gelation occurs at the temperature below which the diminution in enthalpy makes up for that in entropy. ",
