            "answer_text": "Can matter exist without energy? Since a particle of matter is an energetic excitation in a quantum field, energy is needed for matter to exist. Matter is not made of energy, but does have energy in the form of mass energy. This energy can be converted and released as other forms of energy, as shown by Einstein\u2019s famous equation, e=mc2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared). It is a misconception that there are things that are made of energy, and another misconception that there can be pure energy. ",

            "answer_text": "No. And not for lack of trying. You ever hear of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate? The fifth state of matter, after plasma, a BEC is a really, REALLY cold solid. For decades scientists have been trying to create a BEC with a temperature of 0 Kelvin. They\u2019ve gotten close. But an object with absolutely no heat might very well be impossible. Certainly we\u2019ve never observed it. And since all matter has a temperature of >1 Kelvin, all matter that we know of has at least some energy. And that\u2019s just heat. There\u2019s also the nuclear forces and all that. But let\u2019s focus on the obvious. ",

Any particle has minimum of its energy in a reference system in which it is at rest. The only exception is a photon which carries energy but has no rest mass. Mass-energy equivalence ",
