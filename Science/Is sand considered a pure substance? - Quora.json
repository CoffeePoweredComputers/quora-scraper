            "answer_text": "Sand is a textural term and not a compositional or mineralogical term. According to the Wentworth (1922) scale, sand ranges in size (based on diameter) from 0.0625 millimeters (mm) to 2.0 mm. Particles smaller than 0.0625 mm but larger than 0.0078125 mm are termed silt, while particles 2-4 mm in diameter are termed granules. Sand is commonly made of the mineral quartz, one of the harder and more abundant minerals on the surface of the earth. However, the black sand beaches of Hawaii and Iceland are composed of basalt, an igneous rock type made of iron and magnesium minerals. Some of the beaches on the southern shore of Lake Michigan are made of the mineral magnetite; other stretches of the beach have abundant particles of garnet. These latter examples are testimony to the compositional diversity of sand! ",

            "answer_text": "No, sand is a mixture of various substances even though majority is silicon dioxide.  However after a purification and beneficiation process sand can be brought to a very pure state, being 99.99% silicon dioxide.  The companies offering such very pure sand are located in North Carolina ",
