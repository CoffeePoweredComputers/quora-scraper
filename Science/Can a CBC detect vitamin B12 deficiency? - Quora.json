            "answer_text": "I would say that no, it can\u2019t detect a B12 deficiency. However, it can throw you a lot of hints. For instance I had B12 deficiency symptoms from infancy that got worse as I got older. In my 30s and later I went to over 100 doctors and not one of them found a correct diagnosis or any medication that helped. Of course after I figured it out, that they were nutritional deficiencies and how to correct them , I healed 200 symptoms. For 25 years before that I was called names like \u201cSecret alcoholic - Blood doesn\u2019t lie\u201d. My CBC was all messed up. Utah has a lot of secret alcoholics and the docs suspect that for all sorts of reasons. I was called things like \u201cYuppy flu\u201d (CFS), \u201cimaginary women\u2019s disease\u201d (FMS), \u201cconversion disorder\u201d (typical B12 deficiency neuropathies), \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head\u201d. \u201cHypochondriac\u201d. \u201cLiar\u201d. \u201cToo many symptoms to be true\u201d, \u201c\u201dWith all things you have tried you should have had at least one placebo effect so you are a liar\u201d, \u201cmedical student disease\u201d (data geek). The didn\u2019t dare call me as having \u201cfaker\u2019s disease\u201d which was properly identified as MS years before but they wanted to. Most wanted to try the same sets of drugs over and over which hadn\u2019t worked the first 3 or 4 times. I started MeCbl on May 21st, 2003 at 6:05 pm when I knew my life was changed, I never again needed to renew my Albuterol or a couple of other asthma meds, Compazine for daily vomiting and nausea, 9 months after starting I was able to discontinue 2400 mg of Ibuprofen and Dilantin for neurological pain. 7 years ago no more diuretic needed. All those drugs were for managing symptoms. The nutrients healed all those symptoms.. So a CBC can indicate something is anywhere from a little to a lot of weirdness in the results and more testing needs to be done. And then proper understanding is needed. Read this link at least twice and you will have a much better idea of what B12 deficiency looks like when considered as groupings of symptoms instead of ambiguous test results.
