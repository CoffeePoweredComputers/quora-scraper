            "answer_text": "In short, warmer! As you descend the temperatures rise so the theory is that the Incas took plants that grew well at lower altitudes and planted them at the lowest terraces at Moray. They then cross-bred the strains that did best and gradually took them 'up' the terraces until they ended up with plants that could cope with the highest altitudes. ",
