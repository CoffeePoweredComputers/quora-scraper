            "answer_text": "No. For one, the noble gases like argon are chemicals that don\u2019t have a pH. The only chemical compound that has a pH intrinsically is liquid water, because by definition, pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration in water. Solids and gases don\u2019t have a pH, because in order to have a measurable or meaningful hydrogen ion concentration, you have to have freely mobile ions that can move around homogeneously in solution. Therefore, even for water, pH isn\u2019t really defined for ice or water vapor. There are also lots of apparently homogeneous water solutions that can be difficult to define pH in: pH can become very complicated to measure at inhomogeneous boundaries of solutions, like in micelles[1] . Slurries of solid and liquid might have a measurable pH, but this is measured in the liquid part and is only meaningful relative to the solid suspension if there is an equilibrium established between the phases. All other chemicals that have a pH only have a pH because they are dissolved in water and at some concentration move the hydrogen (and hydroxide) ion concentration in water either lower (less hydrogen ion concentration, higher pH) or higher (higher hydrogen ion concentration, lower pH) due to the transformation that occurs when you take the negative log of the concentration. The pH is dependent on the concentration of the mixture of a compound in a solution, so pure compounds don\u2019t have a defined pH. And it should be obvious that if something doesn\u2019t have an effect on hydrogen ions, it doesn\u2019t have a pH. This rules out things like argon, which by definition even though it is slightly soluble in water doesn\u2019t have hydrogen ions to give. Even many compounds that have hydrogens that they might give become extremely difficult to measure, especially if they\u2019re not soluble in water. While we can establish that compounds like methane do have a finite and estimable pKa, it\u2019s miniscule- a pKa of 60[2] for methane means that less than one molecule of methane will dissociate in a liter of water. The fact that we can talk about \u201cless than one molecule per liter\u201d is left for you to scratch your head at. In my book, methane doesn\u2019t have a pH, and people who give the answer \u201cthe pH is 7 because it\u2019s neutral, not an acid or base\u201d, are talking about water, not the pure compound, because pH of 7 only has meaning at one temperature of water. Even water\u2019s pH \u201cchanges\u201d with temperature because the dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide is an equilibrium that shifts with temperature. The pH scale can be extended beyond aqueous solutions and with stronger acids like magic acid, but in those cases you\u2019re generally using an analogous scale to measure the acidity, like the Hammett acidity function. This scale extends strong acids into deeply negative number territory but otherwise is entirely analogous and more or less contiguous with pH. see also: my answer to What substances (not water) have a ph of 7?my answer to Can a solution have no pH at all?Footnotes[1] A Study of the Surface pH of Micelles Using Solubilized Indicator Dyes[2] pKa Vaules for Organic and Inorganic Bronsted Acids at 25o Ca",

            "answer_text": "pH only applies to (usually) aqueous solutions and is the negative log(base10) of hydrogen ion concentration in moles per litre. A pH of 1 for example is 0.1 or 10exp-1 M hydrogen ions. A strong acid such as HCl for example fully dissociated at 0.1M also has 0.1M hydrogen ions and is pH1. So pH is irrelevant where there are no hydrogen ions, for example iodine dissolved in tetrachloromethane. In practice the hydrogen ions are hydrated in solution forming hydroxonium ions H3O+ ions. So the answer is no but remember in that case they don't have a pH of 0. ",
