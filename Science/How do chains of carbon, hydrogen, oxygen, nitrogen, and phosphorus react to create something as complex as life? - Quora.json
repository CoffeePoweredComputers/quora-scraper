            "answer_text": "First you need a situation in which any given reaction is energetically favored, so that the K for that reaction is far enough to the right that it effectively moves forward. Another possibility is that a product is quickly removed to another location, or consumed in another reaction such that the overall process moves in a forward direction. We can see this sort of setup in any chemical processing plant where several synthetic steps are chained together. Various techniques are known which will help, catalysts, temperature/pressure cycling, batch processing or other ways of removing intermediate products, etc. When we talk about LIFE, then a living cell is pretty complex and carries out 1000\u2019s of different reactions. Clearly that cannot simply come into being due to favorable overall conditions. Instead we have to look to an evolutionary process, so that simpler chemical systems arose, and then those which maintained themselves best were able to continue and predominate, and elaborate further. It isn\u2019t possible to know for certain exactly what the initial environment where life arose was like, but it had to have sufficient free energy to drive chemical pathways, significant raw materials in the form of organic molecules and other inputs, and perhaps it had some sort of cyclic process, drying out, freezing and thawing, etc. which acted as a \u2018ratchet\u2019. Another option would be that conditions varied considerably within a fairly small area, which might describe certain locations such as hot springs, black smokers, or similar locations. Perhaps life required more than one of these situations, with different elements of metabolism arising in each and then only combining later, or each set of conditions working on material generated in an earlier round of development. We just don\u2019t know. What we DO know is that there was enormous time, 100\u2019s of millions of years potentially, and vast quantities of material (petamoles) which could potentially participate. The combination of these two factors is probably key. No one step was excessively likely. Nature simply applied the ultimate battering ram to the problem, sheer repetition. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean by \u201chow do they react?\u201d The simple answer is according to the laws of chemistry. The actual formation and transformation of bonds generally follows the simple nucleophilic addition reactions, condensation equilibria reactions and electrophilic elimination reactions. Most are catalysed by enzymes, and while we do not know exactly how these work, my view is that through the \u201clock and key\u201d mechanism entropic barriers are removed, the local electric field can be enhanced by squeezing water out and through the configuration of all the amino acids as they become oriented and possibly their chains distorted, the electric field at the reaction site is greatly changed to favour certain reactions and lower the transition state energy by having the electric field favour certain electron pair movements. Simple strained molecules can favour reaction accelerations by about 10^12 at modestly remote situations without the entropic and permittivity effects. Of course getting the chemistry to work for you still leaves a lot to answer as to how life functions, but that we do not know yet. ",
