            "answer_text": "There are several questions in your two sentences. 1- Deep Learning is not hype, but it is only a stepping stone towards \u201ctrue\u201d AI. What we call AI now is basically statistical machine learning. It is very powerful but it requires careful training with high quality data and corresponding correct responses given or designed by humans. At the end of training, a trained Deep Network is a finite state machine, equivalent to a set of rules. It is a fundamental unanswered question whether the human mind/brain works like a set of rules. There is some indication that it might be the case. If this is so, then current advances in technology may bring about \u201cstrong\u201d AI in the next few decades. If it is not sufficient, all bets are off. We have proof that finite state machine can beat humans at Chess and Go and at many other specific tasks. It is likely that a carefully trained set of rules can drive a car safely in many situations probably better than humans. This has been demonstrated since the 1990s (Google or Uber did not start this effort). This is not \u201cstrong\u201d AI but this is pretty impressive. 2- Do we need a computer to emulate the human mind to bring about a AI-dominated economy? Probably not. There is going to be a time, probably soon, where AI is going to be so pervasive that our economies depend strongly on it. Maybe we\u2019ll have self-driving trucks or self-flying planes sometime soon, but even if not, count on more and more automated services becoming steadily available. Mistakes will be made, it won\u2019t come as easily or as quickly as many pundit say, but it will probably come. But AI will not be like Skynet in \u201cthe terminator\u201d or anything like that. It will not really outsmart humans, but it is an important technology that will become ever more pervasive. ",

There are many jobs that are likely to be replaced by robots/AI in the future: truck and taxi driversmanufacturing and retail workersor even journalists and doctorsthe list goes on\u2026Depending on the level of complexity, this will take longer or not so long, but this change will deeply influence society and the way people live together, much like industrialisation completely shifted what 19th century society looked like. Right now, deep learning is still having a couple of problems that prevent it from being absolutely dominant, but with the ongoing pace of innovation, you can expect exciting stuff from AI. ",
