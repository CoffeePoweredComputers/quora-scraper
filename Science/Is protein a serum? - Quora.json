            "answer_text": "Human blood serum contains around 7 per cent protein, two-thirds of which is in the fraction of albumin; the other third is in the fraction of globulin. Serum electrophoresis shows a large peak of albumin and three smaller peaks of globulin, the alpha, beta , and gamma globulins. The amounts of alpha-, betaBeta-globulins, and gamma-. The concentrations in normal human serum of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globulin are approximately 1.5, 1.9, and 1.1 per cent , respectively. -- fraction of globulin is a mixture of many different proteins, as the immunoelectrophoresis has shown.The blood contains antibodies (substances produced in response to a foreign material injected into the body) to each of the human serum proteins; each antibody combines with the serum protein (antigen) that caused it to develop in the animal.The effect is the development of about 20 regions of insoluble precipitated antigen-antibody, which appear in the transparent gel of the electrophoresis medium as white arcs. Each region corresponds to a different protein on the human serum. ",
