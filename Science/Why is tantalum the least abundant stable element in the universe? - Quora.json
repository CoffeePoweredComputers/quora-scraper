            "answer_text": "Tantalum, like most metals, is produced via stellar nucleosynthesis. Tantalum is typically produced in stars through either the s-process or the r-process; a nucleus of an atom such as iron gains mass through neutron capture. Some of the captured neutrons undergo spontaneous \u03b2\u2212 decay, resulting in a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino. So a nucleus of an element such as iron gains neutrons to become an iron isotope, then undergoes \u03b2\u2212 decay to increase its atomic number (in this case from iron to cobalt), then captures another neutron, and so on. The s-process is a slow process, where low to moderate neutron flux over a long period of time causes gradual accumulation of heavier and heavier elements. The r-process is a very fast process that occurs at extreme energies and high neutron fluxes in the few moments surrounding the collapse of the core of a supernova. But here's the thing: these processes have outcomes that are not statistically evenly distributed across all possible isotopes. They favor some isotopes over others, simply because neutron capture and \u03b2\u2212 decay are statistically more likely in some nucleus configurations than others. Stellar nucleostynthesis statistically strongly favors tantalum-181 over the more stable isotope tantalum-180. (This by itself is not unusual. The most stable nucleus configuration is not necessarily the most favored by stellar nucleosynthesis. Nickel-62 is more stable than nickel-56, but more nickel-56 is made in stars, because it's generated by the alpha process, where alpha particles are successively captured to build the nucleus.) Tantalum is a strange monkey. It's only found in certain types of stars, called barium stars or barium giants. I don't fully understand why that is, and it's 5 am so the folks I might call to ask are all asleep (which is where I ought to be), but the gist is that it's hard to reach tantalum through any of the normal stellar nucleosynthesis processes, and those processes strongly favor (by about a thousand to one) production of tantalum-181 over the more stable tantalum-180. (Edited to add) I'm assuming the question is actually asking why tantalum-180, the most stable tantalum isotope, is so rare, given that tantalum-181 is not in fact the least abundant stable element.

Tantalum is not actually the least abundant stable element even in the Earth\u2019s Crust ,that position goes to Osmium .  according to This above graph Tantalum is middle of the road rare even in earths crust. Extrapolating the fact that many earth like planets have been found with similar geology to our planet I can safely make the conclusion that Tantalum is not the least abundant element in the Universe . Fun Fact Tantalum Coins are minted by The bank of Kazakhstan.(the middle part is Tantalum).  ",
