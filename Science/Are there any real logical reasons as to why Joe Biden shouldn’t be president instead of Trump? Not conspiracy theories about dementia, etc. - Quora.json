I got tested for AIDS. I know Barack got tested for AIDS.\u201d \u2014 Joe Biden 10) \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d \u2014 Joe Biden ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, you have to have been there. Two brain aneurysms (explosions in the brain), not troubling to someone without experience in brain trauma. Having suffered at least two traumatic brain injuries myself, taken care of a relative for a year with end stage dementia, I may have a few remarks to at least disabuse someone from discounting some relevancy for \u201cspeculating\u201d, not \u201cconspiring\u201d a theory regarding cognitive acuity, or lack thereof, normal decline of cognitive function (senility), or affect in speech (a really good indicator of neural symptoms that at least might interest someone writing a list of variables), as to how someone organizes thoughts & plans for the future (this is really the most relevant one with my medical history). Etiologies for neuropsychological histories are varied & very convoluted, like mine are. But safe to say, there are ubiquitous instances of questionable function from the cognitive perspective for the Democrat nominee, so I hope people look for the very hard to see differences I think you\u2019re likely to wonder about, e.g. is this person loquacious in ways that sound like their mind is \u201crunning on\u201d, without what one might seek as a denouement for logical stream of thought? Linear reasoning seems first & foremost someone on performance enhancing \u201cmedication\u201d (my own guess would be \u201cConcerta\u201d, a pseudo-amphetamine which has fewer side effects than Ritalin) \u201cperforms\u201dcompetently, but Concerta or its amphetamine like counterpart, Ritalin, don\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d anyone use classical, linear thought the way you might observe them doing. These drugs are given to fighter pilots in combat zones to allow them to do back to back sorties for the following: It makes the brain stay in \u201cgear\u201d, that is all. But again, look for why a person seems not to have to reach a conclusion with a logical, & more importantly, linearly reasoned thought. Yes, it\u2019s speculation when you do this about your neighbor to the local crisis line, but HIPAA laws preclude any official response to anything short of what a team of social workers could be convinced a possible danger to someone\u2019s health is, & the definition of that is whether a reasonable person thinks a crisis is possible. High bar to hurdle, isn\u2019t it? But let me finally ask the possibly relevant question as to whether the situation is a little different in this case. It has been common practice in the not-so-mainstream media to seek to know if there are any anomalies in high government officials\u2019 medical examinations. A few reporters have tried to ask Mr. Biden about whether assessments of him might be made public. As you know, the most viral of the responses from Mr. Biden was to a reporter from the not-so-mainstream media, who instead of answering his query responded to the reporter with, \u201cWhat are you, a crack addict?\u201d I can envisage some conversation Hunter Biden was having with his Dad about getting thrown out of the Air Force (or was it Navy?), & the idea of taking drugs \u201cjust popped up\u201d in Joe\u2019s head. Hah, hah! You know, nobody really gets to wonder whether somebody can successfully take performance enhancing medication without serious accompanying cognitive therapy. I sure couldn\u2019t, & that\u2019s after two tours in the Infantry, and at least two traumatic brain injuries. It, like I suppose brain aneurysms, changes your whole outlook on life. You shouldn\u2019t be too agitated when people see some correlation between the lack of ability to stay on topic (the ability to have \u201clinear\u201d thinking all the way to the end of logical trains of thought), & how Joe instead sounds \u201cvigourous\u201d at other times. Don\u2019t worry, though, the not-so-mainstream media grades Joe on the lowest common denominator. I, on the other hand, do not. #Biden #neuropathology #Concerta ",

He has been at it for 47 years and is admired by most everyone. Keep in mind that any of the people criticizing him now have only done so to appease their leader. Joe is a decent human being. Again, everyone from both parties have said so until their notorious leader told them they no longer can. Joe is an honest man. Just ask any republican prior to being told they no longer are allowed to think so by their corrupt leader. Joe understands how government works. Or used to work. As well as it ever works. Trump took a system that works poorly and made it worse. Joe will strive to get it back to functioning. And\u2026\u2026. Trump is a buffoon. He is a criminal. He is corrupt. He is a chronic liar. He is an imbecile. He wants to take healthcare away from millions of people just because Obama gave it to them. He wants to do away with Social Security which we all have paid into. He has reduced taxes for the rich and corporations and has no interest or concern for how that hurts the rest of us. Why on god\u2019s green earth would anyone support that? They wouldn\u2019t.

And while his supporters are certainly passionate they\u2019re not always rational or cognizant of the need for actual negotiation processes or the need for detente and protocol. Yelling at people, calling people childish names, and weird tweets aren\u2019t presidential and they just diminish our international standing. Biden is experienced, has the ability to work with Republicans, understands real middle/lower class families and what they\u2019re going through, is calmer, and when he speaks he sounds intelligent. Biden doesn\u2019t try to be something/someone he isn\u2019t. Biden doesn\u2019t brag how rich he is, has provided his taxes for our review and will continue to do so. Biden wants to be president because he feels he can make a positive difference and not because he has $421 million in personally endorsed foreign loans coming due in the next 2\u20134 years. Biden has a plan in place for the next 4 years while the current administration can only try to spin negative nothings about others but have no plan other than more of the same. Biden doesn\u2019t make snide remarks about having ogled half dressed teenagers, grabbed or groped women and BTW Tara Reade\u2019s alleged assault can\u2019t be confirmed by anyone she worked with. Tara has zero credibility and that\u2019s why her allegations imploded. I\u2019m so tired of a loud not very intelligent guy who wears too much make up, uses the WH as a cheap prop, brays like a fired up drunk and makes almost as much sense. ",

And, this is Trump\u2019s time, but he will not acknowledge it. As a University professor, I could see in the last 10 years of my tenure (30 plus years in all) that standards were falling at the university level (not just in Canada where I am from) and I fought hard where I worked to change it, though this trend was wide spread across the university system, so I needed allies. So I got on Regional and National Boards to try to influence things. But too many people wanted it to be that way. So in the end, I gave up and retired, and to date no one has taken up the baton to change things. So Biden\u2019s fight unlike mine is needed in the US. Standards must change and the only way to change them is to get rid of Trump. Biden must not give up as I did. He is a kind, compassionate and emphatic man, who needs the US to stand with him. He needs allies and I think there are lots of potential ones out there. So please vote. I wish him well and hope he will win this battle for the heart of the US. ",

Biden also wants the green new deal which would cost this country trillions of dollars and would destroy our energy industry. Also Biden wants to repeal Trump\u2019s tax cuts which would affect every citizen who pays taxes costing them more. It would also devastate businesses as their tax rate would increase therefore they would have less money to spend on infrastructure and hiring employees. Trump believes in deregulation to get the economy going and cutting taxes again to help businesses expand more thus hiring more people. These are just a few of the logical reasons why one should vote for Trump and not for Biden. While it is true Trump at times acts in presidential with his comments his policies and actions have overall benefited Americans and this country. ",
