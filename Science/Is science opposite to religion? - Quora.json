            "answer_text": "\u201cReligion\u201d is a very broad category. No doubt there are some religions where science is simply its opposite, though I imagine this is very rare; there are certainly more religions where science is simply not an issue and the two are kept in completely different mental spaces. If the concern is more specifically with Christianity (and philosophically similar religions like Islam and Judaism), then arguably science couldn\u2019t exist without it, or at least not without its presuppositions. For instance, science assumes the universe is rational and intelligible by humans; as much as we assume this, this has not been particularly obvious to many peoples throughout history. The universe can also be seen as a chaotic place, under the control of unpredictable personalities, where humans are at best small players and at worst victims of their unavoidable fate. In order to do science, you need to have faith (yes, I used the word) that the universe is rational, even mathematical in its rationality, and that humans are equipped somehow to accurately interpret it. There is necessarily also some appreciation that the physical universe matters. A religion or philosophy which denigrates matter as really illusory or somehow \u201cbeneath\u201d the consideration of enlightened people will never be interested in experimental science. For all their sophistication, the ancient Greeks largely fell into this trap, doing wonderful things in the realm of reason and making ridiculous mistakes about the physical world (e.g. Aristotle). Christianity, but arguing that its God became fully human and inhabited a fully human world, allows a valuing of matter that was unheard of around the ancient Mediterranean. There is a lot of thought on this. Some of the more accessible works on it would be things like Lennox\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?\u201d or Plantinga\u2019s \u201cWhere the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism\u201d. The internet is largely a wasteland for dealing with these issues; your local public library (when available!) is likely to be a better resource, or at least have less noise. ",

            "answer_text": "yes and no: at a very logical level, no, as most of the existing answers point out. however, in practice, yes: over many years, science explains more and more things, and we have less reasons to pray god for anything just take an example of an epidemic: if you Albert Camus\u2019 La Peste, the archbishop of the Algerian city closed by plague organized a special mess on a special Sunday to pray God to protect them from the plague. half century later, under the current epidemic (or pandemic), how many churches in the world organized such a special mess to pray God to protect us from new virus? in France, all the churches are closed for two months under the so-called \u201cconfinement\u201d, and people are even taken out a basic right to pray in church. as far as I can follow, people accepted this policy in name of science. as science progresses, people pray less, and look for a solution in science, rather than to pray god for a help. yes, nowadays, the religion has a meaning only for spiritual matters and about matters after death, etc, most of things in real life is decided by science. neuroscience even begins to understand our spirituality, and it may conclude you that it is helpful for your mental health to pray, but it would no longer be a real prayer: it is just another \u201csport\u201d for your health. probably, science will never deny the existence of god, but your god will have less and less role to play for you as science progresses ",
