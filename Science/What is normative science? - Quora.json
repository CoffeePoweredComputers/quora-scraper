            "answer_text": "Normative science is the attempt to apply science to normative questions, for example, how long should we stay quarantined? I don't think this concept is very well named because normative science can't be science. You can make ethical decisions based on scientific conclusions but those ethical decisions will always draw on ethical premises (premises about what would be right or wrong) which are not part of science. For example science can't tell us that we don't want people to die or that we do want the economy to be healthy. Even such obvious ethical premises are not part of science in any sense. ",

            "answer_text": "A science is empirical, a way of learning from experience (one\u2019s own and that of others). \u2018Normative\u2019 means applying norms of behaviour - how things \u2018should\u2019 be done. The only senses in which science can be normative, as I see it, are when the methods of a scientific procedure are specified, so that results of different test conditions can be compared; or when the results suggest a best way to do things for a desired result. Both would apply, for example, to medical research. ",
