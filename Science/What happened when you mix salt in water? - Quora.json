            "answer_text": "At the molecular level, salt dissolves in water due to electrical charges and due to the fact that both water and salt compounds are polar, with positive and negative charges on opposite sides in the molecule. The bonds in salt compounds are called ionic because they both have an electrical charge\u2014the chloride ion is negatively charged and the sodium ion is positively charged. Likewise, a water molecule is ionic in nature, but the bond is called covalent, with two hydrogen atoms both situating themselves with their positive charge on one side of the oxygen atom, which has a negative charge. When salt is mixed with water, the salt dissolves because the covalent bonds of water are stronger than the ionic bonds in the salt molecules. The positively-charged side of the water molecules are attracted to the negatively-charged chloride ions and the negatively-charged side of the water molecules are attracted to the positively-charged sodium ions. Essentially, a tug-of-war ensues with the water molecules winning the match. Water molecules pull the sodium and chloride ions apart, breaking the ionic bond that held them together. After the salt compounds are pulled apart, the sodium and chloride atoms are surrounded by water molecules, as this diagram shows. Once this happens, the salt is dissolved, resulting in a homogeneous solution. ",

            "answer_text": "OK, I\u2019ll bite. You get salt water. Is salt water different from Fresh water in any important way? Yes it is! It is denser so humans (And any other object) have more effective positive buoyancy. i.e. You float better.It\u2019s a much better conductor of electricity as sodium chloride has a lot more free valence electrons just ready to do their thing. By varying the amount of salt in water, you can vary the resistance and make a crude dimmer switch. (I made one in 6th grade to control a simple carbon arc light for a science fair, so I know this works, and I scared the crap out of the judges when I fired it off. It was running on house current, not some low voltage batteries!It makes plain old tap water turn into a pretty good electrolytic solution so you can copper plate things with just water, salt and a copper strip. This is called electrolysis and every salt water sailor knows all about it as it will eat away at many metallic parts of you boat unless you have sacrificial zinc nodes to control the reaction.Lots of marine life live in Salt water and many humans would starve to death if we lost all out salt water (e.g. the oceans and seas)Edit #1: I just thought of another really cool thing about salt water. You notice that athletes often suffer from salt depletion when they sweat a lot. Now, since salt water tastes pretty lousy, you mix some flavoring into it like Lemon-Lime and some acetic acid to cut the salt taste and bottle it and call your creation Gatorade. Then you sell it to a major beverage conglomerate for oodles of scratch, retire to the British Virgin Islands on your 120\u2032 yacht for the winter and motor on up to Newport RI in the summer and and hang with your buddies at Bailey's Beach Club (AKA The Spouting Rock Association) swilling gin rickeys. Life is good, and all because of Salt water.Summary: Sounds simple, but salt water is pretty important stuff! ",
