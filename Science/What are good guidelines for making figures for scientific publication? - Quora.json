            "answer_text": "The most important guideline is that the figures should be able to tell the entire story of the paper. In fact, most expert readers will only read the figures and abstract. Thus, it is a good idea to make the figures before writing the paper. In many fields, it is customary to begin with or end with a \u2018summary figure\u2019 or a \u2018schematic figure\u2019, which may entail making art as much as science. Second, make sure your figures are in a vector format so they can be resized arbitrarily (many journals won\u2019t accept them otherwise). Invest in learning software to play with vector graphics, such as (but not limited to) adobe illustrator. Be sure to try printing out your paper with the figures in it, to make sure none of the labels are too small. Also, before submitting your paper, be sure you call out all of the figures and subfigures in the text, and that you call them out correctly (the latter is a common error that pops up as you edit the paper and figures).
