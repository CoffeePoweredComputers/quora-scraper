            "answer_text": "The best solutions to climate change that we are applying is changing our attitudes and lifestyle. We, the public, need to stop buying products that contribute to climate change, such as, fossil fuels, petroleum products, and the current type of automobiles. If the public started creating a market for readable/sustainable energy sources, such as, solar power, wind power, geothermal, etc., climate change would slow to a crawl. As long as we insist on creating a market for fossil fuels by driving cars with internal combustion engines, which are obsolete, we are contributing to global warming. The price of electric cars would go down if more people bought them. They would manufacture more electric cars, if we the public created a market for them. They would then be more profitable. Any time anything is more profitable, it is manufactured in larger quantities. That's just common sense, not to mention how the market works. As long as we the public insist on using and buying products that are bad for the environment, and manufacturers of such products will continue to manufacture them. If we the public do not create a market for such items, they will become unprofitable and corporations will stop manufacturing them. That being said, it's up to us the people to bring about a change of lifestyle that will no longer continue to contribute to global warming. We must demand change for nothing will change, and our entire planet faces extinction from global warming. ",

            "answer_text": "Short of mass euthanasia the absolute best solution for climate change will be to drive the technology for each person to use less energy and to use it as efficient as possible. In 1900 the modern mode of transportation was still the horse with massive amounts of manure and trains belching huge clouds of coal smoke and electricity wasted almost 50% of the time. In 2000 the automobile was king getting an average of around 20 miles per gallon. Airplanes becoming very efficient and industry becoming aware of the benefits of lower energy costs. By 2100 cars should get 50 miles to the gallon and drive themselves, mass transportation will become like a second skin. Airplanes will be 30% lighter and use a lot less energy. The incandescent light bulb will only be in museums along with fluorescent bulbs overtaken by led\u2019s and the next step in lighting, laser lights. Housing and industry will find new ways to insulate against hot and cold. New materials not even invented yet will transform how we live. New battery technology, solar and wind and nuclear and fusion will make whatever climate changes come our way be nothing but blips. No matter the climate changes, the future for mankind looks very bright assuming we don\u2019t blow ourselves up!! ",

            "answer_text": "Biochar. Create a biochar unit. build it into a standard 53 foot sea can. Gets dropped off at a farm, and has connections or this and that. Put baled ag waste in one end. Unit produces a mix of charcoal, methanol, and heat as outputs. Farmers can use the heat for shop, livestock barns, domestic hot water. Methanol can be sold. Biochar incorporated into fields, sequestering it. There is some question as to whether biochar is stable in temperate soils. If this is the case, then you retune the unit to produce just methanol and energy. Is still a win, since the energy is being created from biomass. Methanol can be easily changed to dimethyl ether which can use used in any diesel engine. This requires NO new science. It\u2019s chemical engineering. ",
