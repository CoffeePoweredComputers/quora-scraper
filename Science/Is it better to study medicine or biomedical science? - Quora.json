            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you want to do with your life, but the primary distinction is whether you want to be a doctor or not. Assuming you are interested in the human body and hence want to study one of these, you have to think about why you are interested.  Do you want to use the knowledge you gain to help diagnose and treat patients, being in contact with staff and patients everyday. Studying medicine means studying everything about the human body, down to every little bone and tendon, understanding each system as a whole and being able to give the best care to a patient who needs it.  Depending on where you study, biomedical sciences (assuming non-accredited degree) is often much more flexible in terms of what exactly you study and how. It is more science-intensive, learning how to design experiments and think critically about what you are learning. From biomedical sciences it is an easy enough transfer to study medicine, and a lot of people start with biomedical sciences if they aren't sure they want to commit to medicine (and it is 100% a commitment of your life). I personally would not be able to be a doctor, my beside manner would be terrible, and I am much more interested in focussing my research, but I know many people that started in biomedical sciences and decided they hated lab work and became great doctors.

You also study a hell lot about the human body itself, your systems and anatomy. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s right to say but maybe medicine is the big picture, what people see more often and what take credit for your health getting better.

Study biomedical sciences if you like to advance biomedical knowledge, to elucidate the genetics of diseases, study biomarkers and cell to cell interactions. Think of it like screenwriters behind the scenes. If you have equal passion for both, why not get a medical degree, and pursue research as a side task? It's hard but can be done. ",
