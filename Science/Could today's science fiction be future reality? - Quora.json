            "answer_text": "Some thoughts on that. Science fiction as a thing is already real.No particular science fiction story is likely to ever \u201ccome true,\u201d i.e., to become factual; it is, after all, fiction.Individual speculations in many science fiction stories have, over time, become \u201creality\u201d; good examples include \u201cwaldoes\u201d (robotic arms controlled by human hands in special gloves), from \u201cWaldo\u201d by Robert A. Heinlein, and flip phones, from Star Trek.Some individual speculations are already true when they are published. During World War II, Cleve Cartmill published a story in Astounding Stories called \u201cDeadline\u201d, which drew the attention of the FBI because it described a nuclear weapon too similar to the one being developed by the Manhattan Project.Some individual speculations are already false when they are published. In the early \u201860s, Larry Niven wrote a story called \u201cThe Coldest Place\u201d, whose twist ending was that the incredibly cold place where it takes place is not the surface of Pluto but the dark side of Mercury. After it was sold, but before it was published, science discovered that Mercury is not (yet) tidally locked to the sun, and has no permanent \u201cdark side\u201d.There is no sixth item.Some individual speculations will never - well, let\u2019s just say \u201care unlikely, given what we current know, ever to\u201d - become realities: Faster-than-light travel, time travel to the past, anti-gravity, and similar ideas that make for good stories, but violate basic principles of what we currently think to be true about the Universe.Hope this is more help than confusion.

            "answer_text": "Lots of authors have predicted specific things that have then come about. Here\u2019s a few off the top of my head: A man walked on the moon.Satellites are in geosynchronous orbits.Water beds.Flip phones and had-held computers.The rise of evangelicism in American politics.Wall-hung flat-screen big TVs.3D holograms.Nuclear warfare/atomic bombs.Establishing a new identity through computer manipulation.The First Lady having her won private astrologer.And some of the authors that made those \u2018predictions\u2019: Dozens of authors starting with Jules Verne.Arthur C. ClarkeRobert A. Heinlein.Star Trek.Heinlein again.Ray Bradbury, George Orwell.Star Wars.Cleve Cartmill.John Brunner.Yep, Heinlein again.Did they get all the details right? No, of course not. That is not the purpose of SF. The core requirement of SF is asking a question\u2014\u2019What if\u2014?\u201d, not making a prediction \u2014\u2019This will come to pass\u2019. After having asked \u2018what if\u2019, the work may go on to giving a possible answer; but the main driver is the question. Many of these\u2019predictions\u2019 came about as a means of lending verisimilitude to an imagined world. That\u2019s the role of the communicator and the note pads in Star Trek, for example. Some came about as a direct result of being familiar enough with the then-current scientific knowledge in a specific sphere to make informed extrapolations that turned out to be more or less accurate. I am thinking specifically of Cartmill\u2019s Deadline, which got him investigated by the FBI when Astounding published it in 1944, because it predicted atomic bombs, and the science was very accurate, within the constraints of the story. The Manhattan Project was in full swing at the time, and the story scared government that the secret had leaked. It hadn\u2019t; knowing the non-classified science was sufficient for anyone that truly KNEW to science to predict, rather accurately, the atomic bomb. Any psychic/astrologer will be accurate a certain small percentage of the time if that person makes enough predictions. So too will science fiction hit the nail on the head sometimes if enough of it is written. ",

            "answer_text": "In years past, many of the stories in science fiction included descriptions of possible future technologies - and their impact on society - which turned out to be rather prophetic. Now, not so much, as all the really viable ideas have been explored and exploited. It seems unlikely that a science fiction author will imagine a technology that is not obvious that is also viable. Some of the concepts that can never be viable are used again and again, like time travel, teleportation, dimensions as realms (in physics, dimensions are humble metrics, not realms at all), faster than light travel, and so on. It seems that in the minds of many, the past predictions that turned out to be prophetic means that all and every fantasy will become reality, just you wait and see. For certain ideas, you\u2019ll be waiting a long time if you wait until they become real. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The science fiction of the 1960s is fast becoming science fact. Carl Sagan and Arthur C Clarke have shown us the future with their books and films. Most recently in the 2010s we have seen the introduction of (mostly) science fact films. However, we must be careful not to take this too far. My favourite film of that 1960s era was 2001: A Space Odyssey. The spaceship technology was good but we must treat the Black Hole entry with scepticism. Much the same could be said about the film Interstellar. Also, I would not get too excited about the 'warp' speed travel found within Star Trek. Some things are just too fantastical! ",

Well's novel \"The World Set Free\"   What about the communicator that the Star Fleet folk used.  Those have become our cell phones.   Computers were grist for sci fi stories long before they ended up on our desks or in our pockets.  And the laser is a clunky version of Buck Roger's ray gun.  And how about rocket ships that carry men to other planets.  It happened in 1969.  Hooda thunk it. ",

Armoured self-propelled vehicles were anticipated in the 1890s along with a submarine with a cruising range that spanned the globe. Robert A. Heinlein predicted both mobile phones and what an inconvenience they could be in the 50s. Mind you, there are always details that are inaccurate if you compare fiction to reality with rigor. Real submarines don\u2019t and can\u2019t attack by pulling a kamikaze on surface ships. Real tanks are a tenth of the size of the leviathans in the stories. ",

Our forthcoming SF TV series will be written so as to assure that it\u2019s plausible\u2014and that the world it depicts is desirable. ",
