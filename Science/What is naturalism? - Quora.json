            "answer_text": "As a philosophy, naturalism is the belief that there are only natural (and not supernatural) forces operating in the universe. Ideas such as the existence of a consciousness or a soul could only be explained through natural sciences. As a result, nature just operates. There can be no intrinsic purpose in nature as there is no supernatural driving force. In this way it was somewhat influenced by Darwin\u2019s new theories. Naturalism as a literary movement began in the late 1800s as an offshoot of realism, founded by the famous French author \u00c9mile Zola (whose novel Therese Raquin is perhaps the most prominent naturalist work). It stemmed from the philosophical movement (hence why I started my answer with it). It is characterised by detailed, accurate accounts of events and characters and viewed its characters as simply a combination of the factors which have influenced their lives to date. This was captured in Hippolyte Taine\u2019s maxim \u201crace, milieu, moment\u201d: RaceHeredity. Your biological make-up influenced your actions. In this way, men and women would behave differently in the same situation, for example. Race was somewhat simplified and perhaps stereotyped and almost certainly by todays standards, racist. For example, in naturalist literature Africans were seen as more \u201cpassionate\u201d and impulsive people. MilieuSocial environment. The people around you and your social situation would affect the way you see the world. For example, a naturalist author might write a novel exhibiting how poor people are much more likely to steal and commit illegal actions as a result of their upbringing. These first 2 points are essentially a simplification of nature vs. nurture. Naturalists believed that both influenced who you were. MomentHistorical context. For example, if you were born in a country at a time when republicanism was rife in the area, you would likely grow up to share similar sentiments. It was these three things, and these alone, which naturalists believed affected human beings. Romanticism espoused in absolute morality (i.e. if something is \u2018wrong\u2019, it is always wrong, in any and every situation) and Realism espoused moral relativism (i.e. in some or most cases, an action may well be wrong, but in other situations it is acceptable to do such a thing, given the circumstances surrounding the action). Naturalism dispensed entirely with morality, believing it to be an imagined construct. For them, things happened because of preceding causes, not because of any underlying sense of \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019, relative or otherwise. In this way naturalists saw themselves as students of human beings as organisms, not as part of some collective, constructed humanity (i.e. with constructed morals and societal structures). Their characters\u2019 actions were merely responses to outside \u2018pressures\u2019 on that character and influenced by the above three points. As such, naturalist characters were Darwinian organisms, biological animals responding to stimuli as a result of genes, upbringing and past experience. As such there was often heavy foreshadowing and determinism (as the characters\u2019 fate was pre-decided by factors beyond their control) present in the novels. Critics were unforgiving at first with naturalist books. They argued that it was a bleak, depressing view of the human race and that the authors had ruined realism. They were also horrified by the rather explicitly intimate scenes prevalent, to which the authors replied that their work was not to be taken as a moral construct but as an exploration of humans as organisms and as such was devoid of a moral compass. As a result of all this, narrators in naturalist novels were often detached and observed events with clinical precision. This challenged the reader\u2019s expectations because the reader would already have a set of \u2018ideals\u2019 and \u2018morals\u2019 which would be attacked by the novel\u2019s different view of the world and of events.

            "answer_text": "Naturalism is an approach to philosophical problems that interprets them as tractable through the methods of the empirical sciences or at least, without a distinctively a priori project of theorizing. For much of the history of philosophy it has been widely held that philosophy involved a distinctive method, and could achieve knowledge distinct from that attained by the special sciences. Thus, metaphysics and epistemology have often jointly occupied a position of \"first philosophy,\" laying the necessary grounds for the understanding of reality and the justification of knowledge claims. Naturalism rejects philosophy's claim to that special status. Whether in epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, or other areas, naturalism seeks to show that philosophical problems as traditionally conceived are ill-formulated and can be solved or displaced by appropriately naturalistic methods. Naturalism often assigns a key role to the methods and results of the empirical sciences, and sometimes aspires to reductionism and physicalism. However, there are many versions of naturalism and some are explicitly non-scientistic. What they share is a repudiation of the view of philosophy as exclusively a priori theorizing concerned with a distinctively philosophical set of questions. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy ",

            "answer_text": "Naturalism simply means there is no magic.  There are no special powers that allow one to override how the world works.  Unlike the other post, that doesn't mean that there is no beauty or sense of self, or anything else.  It simply means that there is an explanation possible for these things with doesn't require a magical agency operating outside of \"nature\". Despite many people thinking this is bad, it's actually quite comforting.  If I die in a plane crash, it is much better to know that it was a mechanical failure or even pilot error than to consider that it was simply an act of malicious magic by some demon. Similarly with most other things in life.  If we can understand things than we can potentially change or influence different outcomes.  In a world of magic, you can rely on nothing except fear and avoiding the attention of malicious entities.  Nothing you know is reliable. I prefer naturalism, even if we are largely ignorant as being vastly superior to a state of where nothing can be known with certainty. ",

One example is the existence of God, which is excluded by naturalism because God is not found by empirical means. Another is the meaning of life, which is excluded by naturalism because meaning is not an empirical entity. Naturalism is equivalent to scientism, and other doctrines that exclude all knowledge outside of the empirical sciences. As many have pointed out, these doctrines are not discoverable by the methods of the empirical sciences, so they are self-defeating. Many people ignore this and follow naturalism anyway. ",
