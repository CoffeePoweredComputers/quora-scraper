            "answer_text": "I think you can learn a subset of Rust in two weeks, sure. To master the language though will take a long time as it is quite dense and advanced. As I have continued learning it, I find that Rust introduces a lot of new concepts for me. They may not be novel ideas but I have never thought of things such as lifetimes or trait bounds before and this is what adds complexity for me. With that being said your experience may differ based on prior knowledge and aptitude for programming. One of the best ways to learn Rust may be to read code from the standard library or third-party libraries. I think it\u2019s easy to write Rust but it\u2019s challenging to write Rust using all of its features. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "If you know C (and that\u2019s often very large \u201cif\u201d) then learning rust is will come quickly. The language is coherent and well documented, so I\u2019d say that for anyone proficient in programming already it would took maybe few days to get familiar with all new concepts and then a week or so to practice it, but it heavily depends on how much time and attention you\u2019ll dedicate to it, how much programming experience you have and how good you are at learning. If you are lacking programming experience, then you\u2019ll be learning more then just a language and its hard to tell how much time it may take, however few days is enough to determine how well its going, so just do it.
