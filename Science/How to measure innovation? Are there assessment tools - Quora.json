            "answer_text": "Hi, The definition of INNOVATION can be stated Innovation in its modern meaning is \"a new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method\". Innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. The IET use the word INNOVATION as part of the CEng selection criterion. It doesn\u2019t mean that the candidate has to be a top engineer with NASA or working for Microsoft. The initial assessment/interview is designed to probe the candidates qualifications and work. For example, he may well be working for Microsoft/Google on the latest designs or in reality he is probably an engineer within one of the major industries, e.g. Electronics/Chemical/Nuclear etc and he will be asked to describe his work from his own prospectus, in other words his day to day job Innovation could be an example of working on the latest designs of microelectronics, or how he/she overcame a problem and this could be a case that he/she had to re think their own strategies in order to overcome the problem. Innovation , in a way could be taken as \u2018Thinking outside the Box\u2019 to overcome a problem. I hope I haven\u2019t confused you too much!!! ",
