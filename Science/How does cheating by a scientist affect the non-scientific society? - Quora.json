            "answer_text": "Dishonesty in the field of science can, and often has been catastrophic for society. We should remember that dishonest science entails dishonest scientists and, unfortunately, there are such charlatans in almost every field who will happily lie if paid to do so, or if there is money to be made by creating uncertainty and false conspiracy theories and conflicts, and then selling books \u201cproving\u201d or \u201cdisproving\u201d them. For some it is a full time profession. Consider: At a murder trial, the prosecution calls a scientist who says the DNA evidence is conclusive with virtually 0% chance of error. The defense then calls a scientist who says that DNA evidence is not reliable because DNA can deteriorate and be contaminated. Both are being paid for their testimony, and one of these scientists is lying (of course it is the scientist for the defense). Barry Scheck famously produced scientists in the O.J. Simpson trial who who convinced the jury that the DNA found in many locations somehow was all contaminated with OJ\u2019s DNA, or even that it deteriorated to a point at which it was identical to OJ\u2019s DNA. Nonsense to anyone with even a minor knowledge of biology or DNA, but that didn\u2019t stop a lawyer and a few scientists from creating and \u201cproving\u201d a lie, and a murderer walked free. (To his credit, Scheck co-founded \u201cThe Innocence Project\u201d which has used DNA - ironically - to free many falsely accused inmates). The effect of dishonest science on the non-scientific community is obvious. Consider: Virtually every climate scientist in the world warns us that over production of carbon dioxide and other chemicals by humans (mostly industry) is causing the global climate to progressively get warmer, which will reach a point at which it is too late to reverse it, and the effects will devastate all living things on the planet. There is a very small percentage of dishonest scientists who dispute this with no scientific evidence to prove their claims. Not coincidentally, most or all of these scientists are employed by the corporations which produce the most pollution, or the law firms that represent them. If these few are right, and global warming is just a hoax perpetrated by a global conspiracy of scientists, we\u2019ll get clean air and water all for nothing. If they are wrong (as logic and science both demonstrate) then humanity is headed toward a catastrophe of global proportions. You would think they would be concerned for their grandchildren and future generations, but for some people money is more important than their progeny. Consider: Scientists (so-called) who worked for the tobacco industry produced falsified \u201cstudies\u201d and lied for decades about the harmful effects of smoking, saying it was safe (or even healthy) and about addictive chemicals added to tobacco products by their employers. An uncountable number of people have suffered and died because of their lies - so they could make a few bucks. The effect of dishonest science on the non-scientific community is obvious. Consider: Despite indisputable and irrefutable evidence that species evolve, and have been doing so for billions of years, there are a few dishonest scientists who \u201cconfirm\u201d that the Biblical creation story is true and that the Earth is only thousands, not billions of years old. Again the claim is made that science (biology, geology, archaeology, astronomy and others) is a big conspiracy for -well, for some reason, usually to steal tax dollars for their \u201cphony\u201d research - while countless millions of dollars are made selling their books to \u201cprove\u201d it. The effects on the non-scientific community of all these things, and many more, include the dumbing-down of society in general, making the population more gullible and manageable for those who want to control it. And, of course, the insidious, intentionally causing distrust in real science, which in turn will lead to the slowing of scientific progress in medicine, industry, education, and many other fields. That is the best scenario - the worst is the death and destruction it causes now, and causes for the future of humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "Effects can be from completely negligible to catastrophic. The autism induced by vaccin is one such example. Another one is the Climategate scandal. More precisely the hockey stick fraud perpetrated by Michael Mann (see for details the books The Hockey Stick Illusion: A W Montford, A Disgrace to the Profession, Mark Steyn, the blog Climate Audit and the always interesting Richard Muller here on Quora). We can discuss the climate change issue at length, but what is undeniable is that Michael Mann perpetrated fraud. Final results so far: The credibility of climate scientists has collapsed because of unfortunate collective behavior of wagon circling (see Richard Muller's answer to It is claimed that 97% of climate scientists state that anthropogenic climate change is real. What evidence do the 3% who don't think so have? What are some good counterarguments to their claims?).Ground for reasonable discussion has collapsed. Now climate issues become an issue of belief with question like \u201cDo you believe climate change is real?\u201d. This has moved the issue from science to religion, politics and Hollywood. Thus the problem has become by definition unsolvable since those three thrive on conflict.Possibility of planned coherent action world wide has collapsed because of this. I do not claim that climate change is real or not, not my issue. But if it is real, it is very good to have trust between countries.",
