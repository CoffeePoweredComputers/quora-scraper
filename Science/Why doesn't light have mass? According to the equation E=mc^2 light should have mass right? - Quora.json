            "answer_text": "You can hang mass or at least mass density onto light if you don't mind extending E=mc [math]^2[/math] just a hair beyond its natural range |v|<c to encompass c itself and a making a few other questionable assumptions. 4 definitions get you relativistic kinetics from scratch. Definition 1. The Lorentz factor \u03b3\u2261 [math] 1/\u221a(1-(v/c)^2) [/math] Definition 2. Relativistic mass [math] m\u2261\u03b3m_0. m_0, [/math] called rest mass, is the mass of an object measured by apparatus at rest relative to the object. Definition 3. Relativistic momentum p\u2261mv (so =[math] \u03b3m_0v [math] ). The definition of the Lorentz factor immediately rearranges into [math]\u03b3^2[1-(v/c)^2] [/math] \u22611. Multiplying through by [math] m_0^2 [math] and applying definitions 2 and 3 gives at once The relativistic mass conservation law [math] m^2-(p/c)^2\u2261m_0^2[/math] . The law applies wherever the 3 definitions apply. That's all you need to do relativistic kinetics; but to provide continuity with prerelativistic kinetics, one more definition is given: Definition 4. Relativistic energy E\u2261mc^2. ( so = [math] \u03b3m_0c^2[/math]). multiplying through by the constant c^4 converts the relativistic mass conservation law into the kinetically equivalent Relativistic energy conservation law [math]E^2-(pc)^2=(m_0c^2)^2[/math] When |v|=c, m=\u221e\u00d70 :indeterminate. If you put [math] m_0=0[/math] in the above, you can write m=p/c, or p=mc, But this is very misleading: they both express \u221e\u00d70=\u221e\u00d70, manifestly indeterminate. if you're ok with these dodgy results, you can go ahead and write the relativistic energy conservation law E=pc= [math] mc^2 [/math]. So far it's all indeterminate. Einstein's photon idea doesn't really work out, but if you go along with tiny particles carrying between emitter and absorber the quantized energy E=hf , which Max Planck actually discovered as localized interchanges at light-matter interfaces; you can go ahead and write m=hf/ [math]c^2 [math] for light of frequency f. Maxwell did give us light's energy density, so somewhat less questionably, you can divide it by c[math]^2[/math] to endow light with mass density. So you can consider light as having mass and/or mass density if you like, but it's not really part of physics. Note to Quora: Please stop blocking use of superscripts and subscripts except through use of the awkward [math\u2026. /math] patch, which introduces unwanted bold, italics, and enlarged fontsize.

            "answer_text": "When we say that light does not have mass, we are referring to the rest mass [math]m_{0}[/math]The mass term [math]m[/math] from [math]E=mc^2[/math] is defined as [math]m=m_{0}\\gamma[/math]. But:since light does not have rest mass, we can write that [math]m_{0}=0[/math]the [math]\\gamma[/math] factor is defined as: [math]\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}[/math], which for light tends to [math]\\infty[/math], because in this case [math]v=c[/math]This means that for light, the term [math]m=m_{0}\\gamma[/math] is undefined. But at least we know that it is a constant ([math]\\infty\\cdot 0=[/math] constant).The fact that the photon is massless (it does not have rest mass) is intimately linked to the special relativity postulate which says that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. Think about what it means for a particle to have rest mass. It means, among others, that there is an inertial frame of reference relative to which the particle is at rest (its proper frame) in which the particle\u2019s mass can indeed be measured. The reason why the photon, the particle of light, does not have rest mass is because the photon must always travel at the speed of light, and according to the special relativity postulate, if something travels at the speed of light in one frame of reference, it should travel at the speed of light in all inertial frames of reference. Thus, the photon does not have a frame relative to which it could be considered at rest, precisely because it travels at the speed of light. Photons are always traveling at the speed of light. Hence, the photon is massless (it does not have rest mass). To avoid any confusion about the notation, it\u2019s better to use the energy-momentum equation: [math]E^2=p^2c^2+m_{0}^2c^4[/math] Which in natural units ([math]c=1[/math]) becomes: [math]E^2=p^2+m_{0}^2[/math] However, modern textbooks (especially in Particle Physics) consider the relativistic mass concept as outdated and confusing, and use just one term for mass, which is just the old rest mass. And indeed, the rest mass is much more meaningful since it is a Lorentz invariant quantity. If, for the sake of the argument, we continue to use the [math]m_{0}[/math] as rest mass, and [math]m[/math] as relativistic mass, we can indeed retrieve the [math]E=mc^2[/math] equation from energy-momentum equation. [math]E=c^2\\underbrace{\\sqrt{p^2+m_{0}c^2}}_{m}[/math] where [math]p=mv=m_{0}\\gamma v[/math], and [math]m=m_{0}\\gamma[/math] If you really want to find an expression for [math]m[/math] in the case of photons, you can use the Planck-Einstein relation. [math]E=h\\nu=mc^2[/math] [math]m=\\frac{h\\nu}{c^2}[/math] But this quantity is really, as it can be seen, just a measure of how much energy the particle (in this case, the photon) has. So why use [math]m[/math], when you already have [math]E[/math], which is exacly the total energy of the particle. The really cool thing about the rest mass is the fact that it is a Lorentz invariant quantity, as it was aforementioned. From now on I will consider [math]m[/math] as rest mass and I will use the natural units convention. Mass is in fact related to the length of the energy-momentum 4-vector. Calculating the Minkowski norm squared of the four-momentum leads to the energy-momentum relation: [math]p_{\\mu}p^{\\mu}=E^2-p^2=m^2[/math] Let\u2019s consider three distinct inertial frames of reference: [math]K, K\u2019, K\u2019\u2019.[/math] Let\u2019s say that [math]K[/math] is the proper frame of a test particle. In this case, what is the relationship between the particle\u2019s mass, momentum, and energy? A particle in its proper frame will have the momentum equal to zero, because it is at rest. Thus, in [math]K[/math] frame of reference: [math]E^2-0^2=m^2[/math] From [math]K\u2019[/math] reference point of view, the particle is not at rest. If we consider that the frame [math]K\u2019[/math] is moving with constant velocity [math]v[/math] relative to the frame [math]K[/math], then, according to the frame [math]K\u2019[/math], the particle is moving with a constant velocity [math]v[/math]. Thus, the total energy of the particle will be greater in this frame, but so do the momentum. [math]E'^2-p'^2=m^2[/math] The same thing is true for [math]K\u2019\u2019[/math] frame of reference, which moves, let\u2019s say with constant velocity [math]u[/math] relative to frame [math]K[/math]. In this frame: [math]E''^2-p''^2=m^2[/math] We see that energy and momentum will have different values in different inertial frames, but the difference between the [math](total[/math] [math]energy)^2[/math] in one inertial frame and the [math]momentum^2[/math] in the same inertial frame, will always give the particle\u2019s rest mass squared. And this is valid for all inertial frames of reference. For a photon, the difference between its energy and its momentum is [math]0[/math] in all inertial frames. ",
