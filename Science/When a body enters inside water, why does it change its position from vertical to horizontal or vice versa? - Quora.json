            "answer_text": "In almost all cases, it takes a position of lowest Centre of Gravity. A cuboid body will do that, plus seeking a stable attitude. A ship, for instance, with a rectangular cross section, will lean slightly to one side, because in that position, whichever way it rolls fromt here, buoyancy will push it back. That is called a RIGHTING MOMENT. If perfectly upright, a slight heel will not push it back to upright. My dad was a Naval Architect, and one day during his time working in Mumbai, he witnessed a ship, heeling slightly, and having some cargo on deck, the captain ordered the cargo to be moves to \u201cright\u201d the ship. When enough cargo was moved, the ship came upright, but continued rolling until it capsized to the other side and many of the crew drowned. The ship HAD been stable in it\u2019s original attitude and so was safe. It was the momentum of the roll that did the damage. ",

            "answer_text": "It has to do with two \u2018centres\u2019 - centre of gravity of the object, and centre of buoyancy (= centre of gravity of the water the object displaces). For floating, without toppling, the centre of gravity of the body must be vertically below the centre of buoyancy. \u2026AND to find out if an ant is a boy or a girl, just drop them in the water, if it sinks it\u2019s a girl-ant, if it floats it is a boy-ant :):) ",
