            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t yet have the means to really qualify habitability that well yet enough to say which planets would be \u201cmost likely\u201d to harbor life. As it stands right now, the answer could easily be none of them. The problem here is twofold: First, we don\u2019t yet fully understand the prerequesite conditions for abiogenesis (the origin of life) here on Earth, let alone on an exoplanet. And so basically the only thing we have to go off of when looking for habitability in other worlds is to basically ask, \u201chow Earth-like is it?\u201d By our definitions of life, there could very well be plenty of exotic life forms that evolved out of an entirely different set of conditions than here on Earth. Second, we aren\u2019t quite at the technological capability of qualifying how Earth-like a planet is, let alone whether it meets the conditions for Earth-like abiogenesis. We can classify the parent star easily enough to determine whether its sun-like. We can find the orbital period and therefore distance of an exoplanet and the amount of starlight incident on the planet. We can even find the radius and sometimes the mass of the planet, though for Earth-like planets, mass is exceedingly difficult to constrain with current detection methods and technology. What we can\u2019t yet acheive is an in depth spectral analysis of an Earth-like atmosphere to determine its composition, let alone its temperature, pressure, or layering. We don\u2019t yet have the technology for direct imaging or mapping of the surface, let alone ever find anything out about surface geology. Even with more advanced technology, we may never be able to get past simply speculating on habitability short of recieving some kind of purposeful signal from an intelligent civilization telling us they are here. If we concern ourselves only with Earth-like life, however, what we can do is point out where life is unlikely to be for the worlds that aren\u2019t even remotely Earth-like. In order for a planet not to get immediately removed from consideration, the first test it has to pass is whether or not the planet is in the habitable zone, the region of space around the parent star where there is suitable levels of light incident on the planet so that it is not too hot or too cold for sustaining an atmosphere that could harbor liquid water. There are currently only 40\u201350 exoplanets that we\u2019ve discovered that happen to lie within their parent star\u2019s habitable zone, and a little over a dozen that are well within their star\u2019s habitable zone enough that we necessarily can\u2019t rule out the potential for life. Also, the vast majority of these planets orbit M-class red dwarf stars, which are far less massive and far less bright than our sun, leading to the habitable zone planets having much smaller orbital distances and becoming tidally locked as a result, where only one side ever faces the star like the Moon does with us. We are not sure a tidally locked planet could harbor life. These stars also vary more significantly in brightness and frequently flare, which could adversely affect the habitability as well. And so if we narrow ourselves down to sun-like stars, most of the planets that remain are still super-Earth, i.e. larger than the Earth in radius, and sometimes by a wide margin. While some of these planets could potentially be ocean planets, covered globally by water, we\u2019re not even sure if global-ocean planets could harbor life without the unique interactions between the oceans and geology on the continents here on Earth, which result in photochemically-enriched molecules finding their way into the ocean. Examples of these include (in no particular order): Kepler-61b, Kepler-62e & f, Kepler-22b, Kepler-442b, Kepler-452b, & Kepler-1638b. ",

            "answer_text": "Unknown. They might possibly have life, but it would not be life we easily recognize. The only life we know of is on earth. So that's the only life we know to look for. Of all the planets we have found, the number of planets we belive to have life as we know it iis 0. Or able to support life as we know it. Ask just about any astronomer, or someone familiar with the size, age and variety of objects within our known universe what they believe the chance of life g\u201dout there\u201d is, the answer is consistently 100%. What that life looks like is anyone's guess. It's possible we have evidence of it now, from pics 50 years old, but we just don't recognize it as life. The universeis so huge and diverse, many of us believe it's just not possible that there iisn't life out there. The thing that really sucks is that if there is no way around being able to communicate at only the speed of light, its most likely we will never knlow. ",
