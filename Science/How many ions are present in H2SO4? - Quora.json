            "answer_text": " sulfuric acid is a molecule with all atoms covalently bonded. There is no ion. Now if you are referring to what happens when you dissolve this in water that\u2019s a different story. In dilute solutions, (less than about  molar) It breaks up into three solvated ions. Two  and one  solvated ions. In more concentrated solutions only one proton comes off 100%. The second only partially dissociates. This leaves more of a mess of ions,  . The exact proportion of these will depend on the concentration of the acid. ",
