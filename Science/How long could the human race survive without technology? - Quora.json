            "answer_text": "First by \u201ctechnology\u201d. Using a spear is technology, sure it is stone age technology, but it is technology. Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.  So that would mean everyone would have to unlearn everything they know. As a result you would have fully grown babies that can\u2019t even walk or talk.  So, let us adjust this to state modern technology. Food: Over the past few decades even though the population has increased, the number of people going hungry has declined. This is due to advances in farming, transportation, and preserving food. Without modern technology, starvation would become common place. Before modern technology, the Earth\u2019s population was around 200,000,000 people. Due to competing for the few resources available, the population would likely dip much lower, potentially to less than a million. Shelter: Clothing and houses are not just to make us feel good, or have a reason to go to the mall. They protect us from the elements. As such homes would be hot in the summer at best, clothing such as thermal padding would vanish, and the cold would be life threatening. There are so many environmental risks out there that would become a real risk to many, especially with food scarcity. The Environment: Global climate change is a problem today. However it would be a nightmare if everyone had to cook on wood or coal. 7 billion people cooking and heating with campfires! If you live in the US, odds are you saw how bad smoke can get on the 4th of July, potentially the same for other countries that celebrate with fireworks. Imagine that every single day around the world. Until people starved, we would be ravishing our world. Technology has done as much for reducing pollution as anything else. This not only will quickly eat up forests, but choke us out. This would disappear after a bit when starvation ravishes the human race.  The survivors End the end, we humans are creative and inventive. Intelligence will become a fundamental requirement for survival. Many believe the bullies, and strong physically will dominate, this is not the case. Extreme competitions for survival like this require mental awareness, creativity, ingenuity more than brute strength. The physically strong that survive will either be smart as well or working for someone who is smart. Once the population reaches a point where the world starts to normalize and recover, the human race will find it\u2019s way in the world. However in the long run, it really is important what caused the sudden loss of all technology, or specifics as to what was lost. If we cannot build advanced technology ever again, we will have big problems with smaller populations, half a billion people using fire will likely do more damage than 7 billion with increasingly fuel efficient cars.

            "answer_text": "This depends on what you mean by \u201cwithout technology\u201d. Do you mean \u201call electronics fail after a global EMP\u201d? Do you mean \u201call machines vanish from the earth? You can simulate this by dropping a naked human in the middle of the Amazon. One person, especially a city dweller, will probably die of thirst, disease, starvation, etc in a matter of days/weeks. But, a hundred people, randomly scattered around, and some of them will survive. Even if they have no technological artifacts with them, they will create them. A sharp stick, some leaves sewn together with vines, a pitcher plant to collect condensation at night, etc. If you mean, \u201call humans forget every tool they have ever learned about, all technological artifacts disappear, including caves, buildings, etc\u201d, and you\u2019re not talking about fall damage from people who were in skyscrapers before they disappeared\u2026. then the human race would STILL survive. Huge numbers would die off. Cannibalism would become common in areas that had previously been cities. Old, young, weak, and sick people would have it the worst. But, there are over 7 billion people on Earth right now, spread across every subclimate. It only takes two people capable of adapting and breeding for the race to continue. That said, inbreeding would change the look and characteristics of humans if we got to that small of a group again. ",
