            "answer_text": "Well perhaps we already can, it\u2019s just that we aren\u2019t designed to be especially good at it! Since the human genome doesn\u2019t encode a cellulase like EC 3.2.1.4, we depend on microbes to digest cellulose for us. However our gut transit time is only about 6 or 7 hours and this doesn\u2019t give enough time for our gut bacteria to do very much of this degradation. Herbivores tend to have very long intestines indeed for this very reason \u2013 the gut transit time is around 48 hours in horses, for example. Now it probably would be possible for a human intestine and its microbes to adjust to a cellulose-rich diet if we go the way of the panda. Panda genomes don\u2019t encode cellulase so they depend on microbes; they also have a short intestine like ours with a similar transit time. So how do they manage? Well, they have to eat a huge mass of leaves in comparison to their bodyweight, which they digest rather inefficiently (panda poo tends to have a lot of identifiable, semi-digested leaves and stalks in it), and they also restrict their calorie-burning activity. So you might like to try the experiment \u2013 increase your leafy intake by several orders of magnitude and just lie on the sofa all day watching TV (except for many breaks to poo \u2013 though try not to be too far from the bathroom so that you don\u2019t have to use up too much energy). Do humans already have cellulose-degrading bacteria? The answer is yes. Although this paper (Chassard et al., 2010) found that individuals with a lot of cellulolytic microbes also had a correspondingly high population of methanogens. Does this mean that we\u2019d expect vegans to fart a lot? I don\u2019t know, but maybe that\u2019s the follow up study: The cellulose\u2010degrading microbial community of the human gut varies according to the presence or absence of methanogens ",

            "answer_text": "Our bodies are unable to breakdown cellulose. This is because of the structure it has. Interestingly enough, cellulose is very similar to starch, which we can break down. It is made of repeating glucose units bonded together. The deference lies in their orientation. While starch has glucose molecules that are all oriented in the same direction, glucose alternates between one glucose \u201cfacing up\u201d and one glucose \u201cfacing down\u201d. This small difference makes glucose impossible for the enzymes in the body to successfully break it down and so it just goes right through indigested. Crazy isn\u2019t it? You can have two things that have the exact same chemical composition, the same mass, and yet you change the orientation of one of the molecules in it and suddenly your body has no clue what to do with it. Cellulose is one of the components that makes up \u201cfiber\u201d in your meals and it helps you poop. So while you may not be able to digest it, cellulose can still help your body function well. ",

But as do ruminants !How come studies trying to observe effects of dietary fiber, note elevation of small fatty acids alias SCFAs. Those fatty acids are down-products of cellulose digestion by colon microbiota, which are partly taken through the colon wall and used as markers of colonic population and also a source of energy (~10% of the total energy consumption). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735932/ It may depend of everyone microflora, as it changes from one individual to another. Mostly people producing methane have the best ability to degrade cellulose. The cellulolytic microflora of the human colon: evidence of microcrystalline cellulose-degrading bacteria in methane-excreting subjects But when talking about cellulose, we often think about grass or hull, which are specific. By their high level of silica and lignin, it impairs cellulose digestion by micro-organisms. Whereas cellulose from succulent plants like cabbage or carrots are the more bioavailable. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1432575/pdf/gut00393-0005.pdf ",

This was a bit of surprise to me, but very interesting read as to colon as an important producer of nutrients. ",
