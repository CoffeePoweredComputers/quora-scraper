For example Sociology tends to focus on society (but isn't limited to) Anthropology tends to focus on culture (but isn't limited to) Geography tends to look at the physical spaces (but isn't limited to) So like\u2026.if you were looking at say newly discovered society or subculture: The sociologist would look more in-depth at social pressures, gender roles, the overall functioning of said society The anthropologist would typically look at the symbolism in cultural practices and events, look at what the culture values as important The geography person would look at the physical space itself and how the climate impacts the way the society and culture are affected by it. If those distinctions seem vague that's because they are.

            "answer_text": "You can divided social science different ways, and there are some categories which fit into multiple branches: There is the study of human behavior: psychology (individual level), sociology (society level) and anthropology (culture level). Sometimes anthropology is seen as more of a life science. Then, human geography, which is how man interacts with the physical environment is sometimes grouped with archaeology, methods of uncovering the past history of man. Linguistics deals just with one aspect of man\u2019s development, language. Typically social science deals with more qualitative than quantitative research, except for demography, which is based on statistics of a population.
