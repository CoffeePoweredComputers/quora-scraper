            "answer_text": "Space is a term that can refer to various phenomena in science, mathematics, and communications. In astronomy and cosmology, space is the vast 3-dimensional region that begins where the earth's atmosphere ends. Space is usually thought to begin at the lowest altitude at which satellites can maintain orbits for a reasonable time without falling into the atmosphere. This is approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the surface. Astronomers may speak of interplanetary space (the space between planets in our solar system), interstellar space (the space between stars in our galaxy), or intergalactic space (the space between galaxies in the universe). Some scientists believe that space extends infinitely far in all directions, while others believe that space is finite but unbounded, just as the 2-space surface of the earth has finite area yet no beginning nor end. In mathematics, space is an unbounded continuum (unbroken set of points) in which exactly three numerical coordinates are necessary to uniquely define the location of any particular point. It is sometimes called 3-D space because it contains three distance dimensions. If a continuum requires fewer or more than three coordinates (dimensions) to uniquely define the location of a point, that continuum is sometimes called n-space or n-dimensional space, where n is the number of dimensions. Thus, for example, a line constitutes 1-space and a plane constitutes 2-space. When time is considered as a dimension along with the usual three in conventional space, the result is sometimes called 4-space, 4-dimensional space, time-space, or space-time. In digital communications, the term space refers to an interval during which no signal is transmitted, or during which the signal represents logic 0. The term space may also be used in reference to the time interval separating two characters, bytes, octets, or words in a digital signal.

            "answer_text": "Space Science is the study and exploration of anything and everything to do with whatever is out there beyond Earth\u2019s immediate influence. Here I am ignoring the fact that Earth\u2019s gravitational influence stretches a long long way beyond our atmosphere.  Space Science includes disciplines of astronomy (studying things in space by remote observation and data) and aerospace engineering (reaching out into space for exploiting its resources, using its location advantages, and gathering data on celestial objects). Earth is so small that whatever science has achieved until now is a tiny (tending to zero) part of the possibilities of science. The rest is out there, in space, to observe, understand, discover, and invent for. In the timeline of science we haven\u2019t even taken the first full step since humans starting walking on Earth. We still have to understand most of: How the universe was formed and how it worksWhat\u2019s on the other planets, stars, galaxies, star systems, and everything between themHow and why the objects in the universe were formed and how they interactLife beyond EarthThe possibilities of traveling in space and our limits for itHow objects in space affect us in the short and long term\u2026Go on. Think about it and keep adding your thoughts in the comments. This list is endless.  ",
