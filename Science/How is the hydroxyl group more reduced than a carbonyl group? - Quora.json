            "answer_text": "There are three popular answers to this question: In organic chemistry we tend to refer to reduction as the amount of hydrogen atoms in a substance, and oxidation as the amount of oxygen atoms.In a carbonyl group there\u2019s a carbon atom and an oxygen atom.  In a hydroxyl group there\u2019s one carbon atom, one oxygen atom - and one hydrogen atom. More hydrogen atoms = greater reduction.  It can be also be referred to the bonds instead of the atoms themselves, i.e. more C-H bonds state greater reduction, and more C-O [or C-N / C-X (X is a halogen)] state greater oxidation.Carbonyl groups exhibit two C-O bonds, and zero C-H bonds. Hydroxyl groups on the other hand exhibit just one C-O bond, and one O-H bond, which is insignificant when compared to a C-H bond. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a decrease in the total amount of C-O bonds, which means there\u2019s a decrease in the oxidizing state. Another accepted point of view on the matter examines the partial molar mass of each substance in a molecule. The greater the fraction of oxygen mass from the hole, the more oxidized the substance is - and the same goes for reduction with hydrogen molecular mass.The molecular mass of a carbonyl is 28.01 (g/mole). The molecular mass of oxygen is 15.999 (g/mole). The partial mass of oxygen in a carbonyl group is 57.118%. Equally important, the partial mass of hydrogen in this compound is 0%. The molecular mass of a hydroxyl group is 29.018 (g/mole). The partial mass of oxygen in this context is 55.134%, and the hydrogen partial mass is 3.473%.  ",
