            "answer_text": "Sarcopenia, muscle mass and strength loss, in seniors was considered to be the cause of reduced physical activity and lead to loss of independent living capability. While it is true a person loses some strength as they age, the cause and effect direction is actually reversed. Lack of physical activity leads to much greater muscle loss than aging alone. The social expectation that seniors needed to slow down after a certain age led to sedentary behavior. A senior citizen would notice they seemed unable to do certain things, and just accept the fact they were getting weaker and slower. Wrong thing to do! The upside is even frail seniors can increase their physical strength and stamina. ",
