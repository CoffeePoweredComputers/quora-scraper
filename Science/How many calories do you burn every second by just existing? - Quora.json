The average male burns 2000 ish calories a day. 2000 divided by 24 (hours) = 83.3 per hour. 83.3 divide by 60 (minutes) = 1.38 calories per minute. 1.38 divided by 60 (seconds) = 0.02 calories per second. You can multiply them back up and you get 2000 calories per day in total. So 0.02 calories per second on average.

Determining an exact value requires locking you in a sealed, climate-controlled chamber known as a \u201croom calorimeter\u201d for a period of time and monitoring oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for indirect calorimetry. The standard way of estimating BMR is with the Harris\u2013Benedict equation. It depends on factors including your age, weight, height, and sex. You can use one of many on-line calculators to find out what the estimate of your BMR is: BMR Calculator. ",
