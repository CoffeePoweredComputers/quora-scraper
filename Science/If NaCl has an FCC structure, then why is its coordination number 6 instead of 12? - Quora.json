            "answer_text": "Hi, Dont confuse between an element and a compound. FCC is packing of an element. For, NaCl, it\u2019S not simply Na or Cl its a combination of both; in NaCl, each Na+ is surrounded by 6 Cl- and vice versa. so, coordination number is 6. its structure can actually thought to be: Cl- ions in cubic closed packed arrangement with octahedral holes filled by Na+ ions. for compounds you talk about ratios,for NaCl, its 6:6 because each type of one atom is surrounded by 6 atoms of the other type. In CsCl, we have 8:8, similarly, for Na2O, we have 4:8, etc. In these we have Cs+ as bcc and in the next, O2- as ccp. in compounds you talk about coordination number individually. like, in Na2O, Na+ has coordination no. as 4 whereas O2- has 8. Conclusion : So, the coordination number for an element, for example, Ag, is 12, but it is not SIMPLY 12 for any compound. Actually this explanation is written by me in the notes, when sir said it, so u won't understand, though i purely intended to help you. ",

Each Na ion has 6 Cl nearest neighbors, and each Cl ion has 6 Na nearest neighbors. Each Na ion has 12 Na second-nearest neighbors, and each Cl ion has 12 Cl second-nearest neighbors. If that isn\u2019t clear for you, then you need to find a ball-and-stick model to look at. ",
