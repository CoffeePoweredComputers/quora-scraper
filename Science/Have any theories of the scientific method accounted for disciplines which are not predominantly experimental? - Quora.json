            "answer_text": "Certainly. The scientific method was largely created and validated in astronomy, an entirely observational field. We continue this line in astrophysics, especially stellar evolution, and cosmology. Of course, they also have experimental support with laboratory and field experiments on magnetism and later electromagnetism, the force of gravity, the speed of light, quantum mechanics (including nuclear fusion), and General Relativity, such as time dilation in atomic clocks. Science advances when there is enough experimental or observational data to invalidate a previously-accepted idea, or to demonstrate a phenomenon about which we had no idea. To give one example, Tycho Brahe's observations showed inaccuracies in both Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy, but he was unable to find a solution. Kepler then worked out that the orbit of Mars was elliptical, in an immense creative leap. This was by far the most accurate account of the observations, clearly falsifying all other explanations previously put forward. Kepler was also able use the observations to derive other laws of planetary motion, which laid the groundwork for Newton's theory of inverse-square gravitation. Observation, experiment, creativity, math, and falsification all work together in the scientific method. Of course, we also observe pseudoscience in the world, attempting to cover itself in the trappings of science. Global Warming Denialism, for example. We also observe both science and pseudoscience in many other areas, including human psychology. The science of pseudoscience and science denial is a fascinating area of study, amply validated in areas such as mathematical crankery, perpetual motion machines, Creationism, lead denial, DDT denial, acid rain denial, ozone-destroying chemical denial, tobacco denial, drug denial, human reproductive biology denial, anti-vaxxerism, homeopathy, and cold fusion, among many other topics. Many of them pollute our politics, too. ",
