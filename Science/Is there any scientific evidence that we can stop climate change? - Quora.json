            "answer_text": "In a word, No. In more than a word - read on: The entire climate change debate appears to have destroyed many peoples notions of what science is. Scientific evidence is either laboratory and experiment-based, or extremely robust data analysis. If we are talking about geo-engineering robust data analysis alone doesn\u2019t cut it. The consequences of getting it wrong do not bear thinking about. Your question cannot be answered until science has shown what is causing the current climate change. Not scientists, but science. Not governments but science. The hypothesis for global warming is \u201cif co2 is increased in a closed system the temperature will increase\u201d, or a variant of this due to the theory that because CO2 is IR active it can affect temperature. Then you do an experiment to prove the hypothesis. Until you do this no further action can be taken. Your question starts with an untestable hypothesis - \u201c if we do this the climate will change\u201d, and the \u201cthis\u201d is not defined. You could go the route of \u201cif we reduce CO2 the temperature will fall\u201d but you will still need to test this by experimentation. Science is mostly about simplifying the world and its processes so we can understand them. If the processes are complex we need to dissect them, understand them and then put them back together again. Eventually, this sum of knowledge results in brain surgeons and rocket scientists. In climate change we are examining a massive, complex and chaotic system that has been around since the planet had an atmosphere but our data is limited. The only reliable data we have is what we have recorded. There are some proxy records which are relatively accurate, and some which may be prone to error due to pressure, the solubility of CO2 in H2O and especially under pressure and over millennia. We barely know anything about the oceans or what lurks at the depths. We will never know enough or collect enough data to be able to build any accurate mode. Even if we could the system is chaotic which is notoriously difficult to model. ( I understand the technical term most often used is \u201cimpossible\u201d). But it gets worse because right now everywhere is warming twice as fast as everywhere else which complicates any potential remedy. Country X is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world - enter any country you like into the following search - good game, good game Ireland warming faster than rest of the world at DuckDuckGo ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cIt\u2019s warmed up around one degree Celsius since 1900, and life expectancy doubled in the industrialized democracies. yet if that temperature ticks up another half a degree, the entire system crashes. That\u2019s the most absurd belief.\u201d - Pat Miichaels, Climate alarmists hide from debate, Stossel sets it straight This question is worded as if not the vague unfalsifiable hence unscientific notion of climate change but CO2-driven global warming is the subject. Since that CO2-driven global warming theory is a scientific hoax pushed for political purposes by the globalist Marxists at the U.N. and their politician-run IPCC octopus of kept scientists, academics, journalists, and politicians, the truth is that only the Sun\u2019s radiation controls climate, hence humans are powerless to do anything to warm it, although nuclear war and other actions can cool it, threatening a new ice age. The IPCC wants you to believe that capitalism causes global warming not cooling, and although it\u2019s hardly noticeable now it must be stopped in x years or irreversible runaway global warming Armageddon will ensue. Their sick non-sequitur punchline is that only by giving these secularists power to dismantle capitalism and foist Marxist world government can we be saved, almost turning the Christ-Armageddon Bible story upside down and backwards. I answer this question more fully in my Quora articles: TL Winslow's answer to If climate change is a hoax, why do so many scientists say it's happening? TL Winslow's answer to How can anyone deny climate change when the evidence is so compelling and the stakes are so high? TL Winslow's answer to What is environmental concept? TL Winslow's answer to Where is the evidence that seems to persuade people that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not causing global heating? TL Winslow's answer to What makes global warming such a complicated concept for people to understand? TL Winslow's answer to What is the scientific reason behind 'normal lapse rate' that is the decrease in temperature with increase in altitude?  ",
