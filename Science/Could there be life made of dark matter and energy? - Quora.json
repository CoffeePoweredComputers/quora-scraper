            "answer_text": "This is a great question, since in principle it might be possible (except that it\u2019s more-or-less ruled out through observations). To have life, you\u2019d need a fairly rich \u2018dark sector\u2019, made up of particles/forces that do not strongly interact with any normal matter, but interact strongly enough amongst themselves to form life. Some of the best evidence for dark matter\u2019s existence also seems to rule out conventional life in a dark sector. Here\u2019s the sort of evidence I\u2019m talking about[1]:  This is the bullet cluster. The yellow/blue-ish points are galaxies (visible/infrared light), the reddish central bit is x-rays, and the blue blobs I\u2019ll explain in a second. What has happened in this image is a collision between two galaxy clusters \u2014 a smaller cluster came in from the left of the image and passed through a bigger one. The interstellar gas actually makes up most of the visible matter, and when the galaxies collided the gas got heated up and slowed down. It was heated enough to give off x-rays, so the red bit in the middle is the distribution of the gas \u2014 notice you can see a nice shock wave from the collision on the right side of the red distribution. Now on to the blue blobs. This is the mass distribution of the cluster, as inferred by gravitational lensing[2]. Notice how most of the mass isn\u2019t located in the same spot as most of the visible matter (the red bit)? That\u2019s because most of the mass is in the form of dark matter, which has sailed through the collision more-or-less unperturbed. But think about that last sentence. Sure, dark matter may not interact with ordinary matter or give off photons. But if it interacts with itself, then we\u2019d expect the dark matter to have gotten slowed down and be in the middle of the image in a similar way that the gas was. Physicists have used these sorts of measurements to constrain the possible self-interaction strength of dark matter. We can\u2019t set constraints on dark matter-dark matter interactions that are as strong as those of dark matter-ordinary matter interactions, but the constraints are strong enough to rule out life as we know it.

            "answer_text": "oh boy........this is a very tricky one. First off, we know next to nothing about dark matter and energy. Second, ANYTHING, and i mean, ANYTHING, is technically possible (except for something being impossible, but that paradox is besides the point). im going to rephrase your question, and then answer both. Can there be life made of ANTIMatter? the answer to that, is yes. Like conventional matter, anitmatter has every single part/piece regular matter has, literally the only difference (that im aware of) is that antimatter has the exact opposite spin and quantum properties. However, if there was a galaxy made of just antimatter, then life very well could form, and to them, WE would be the ones made of antimatter. Dark matter/energy, we know nothing about. We know its there, and that it has the opposite effect of gravity, pushing, instead of pulling. THATS IT. and quite frankly, thats not much to go off of. CAN it happen? OF COURSE. will it happen? who knows, it may have already. has it happened? we dont know. moral of the story, Antimatter lifeforms, %110 possible. dark matter lifeforms, %N/A possible. we simply dont know enough to create an answer on that one. Hope i helped in SOME way shape or form. =) ",

Dark energy is very weak and well\u2026a form type of energy that only seems to affect space-time. Dark matter is very defuse and does not seem to interact with anything, including itself, so it seems it can\u2019t form anything with any real structure. Normal matter interacts with itself via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. Dark matter doesn\u2019t seem to interact with the those forces hardly or even at all. ",
