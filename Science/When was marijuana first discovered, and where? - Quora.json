            "answer_text": "Marijuana (Hemp) was first used as a rope and string making plant 12,000 - 15,000 years ago and still remains the source of ship ropes to this day. The stalk was used in this regard. String and rope was one of the greatest innovations for humans. It was an excellent building and weapon making material. Use of the leaves and flowers as a medicinal herb came along later and was initially weak in psychoactive properties. I can only assume that through experimentation of trying different plants for food and medicine that the leaves and especially the flower buds was discovered to have psychoactive and medicinal properties. When it was first smoked is obscure. There are many plants that have been dried and smoked. For example, native Americans discovered the relaxing effects of smoking and chewing tobacco. Asians discovered the sedative and analgesic effects of smoking opium. Native south Americans discovered the anesthetic and stimulating effects of chewing coca leaves. Early humans may have observed animals eating fermented fruit and getting intoxicated or eating caffeine containing plants and becoming stimulated and copied them thinking if it did not kill them it must be safe. Millenia ago, humans were practicing genetic engineering by mating plants and animals to make a better product. Cows tripled their milk output, Corn went from a grass to a grain and is now the staple food for half of the world. Likewise, marijuana has evolved into a panacea medicine that is now many times more psychoactively stronger than it was 10,000 years ago. In that time, this plant also mutated to create dozens of other combinations of properties such as the ability to subdue seizures, eating disorders, nausea, pain relief, anxiety, glaucoma relief and many other ailments. An interesting and perhaps innovative development from using marijuana as a pain reliever is that it does not block neurotransmitters to stop pain like opioids. Instead it takes the mind off of the pain. You can only feel pain if you think about it. However, this is mostly true for mild to moderate pain. Severe pain is still better relieved by opiates and other analgesics. Another benefit of marijuana is that it is not physically addictive, but it can be psychologically addictive. ",

            "answer_text": "Cannabis plants are believed to have evolved on the steppes of Central Asia, specifically in the regions that are now Mongolia and southern Siberia. The history of cannabis use goes back as far as 12,000 years, which places the plant among humanity's oldest cultivated crops. Record of the drug's medicinal use dates to 4000 B.C. The herb was used, for instance, as an anesthetic during surgery, and stories say it was even used by the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung in 2737 B.C. (However, whether Shen Nung was a real or a mythical figure has been debated, as the first emperor of a unified China was born much later than the supposed Shen Nung.) From China, coastal farmers brought cannabis to Korea about 2000 B.C. or earlier. It was then introduced to the South Asian subcontinent between 2000 B.C. and 1000 B.C., when the region was invaded by the Aryans. The drug became widely used in India, where it was celebrated as one of \"five kingdoms of herbs ... which release us from anxiety\" in one of the ancient Sanskrit Vedic poems whose name translate into \"Science of Charms.\" Paraphrased from Marijuana's History: How One Plant Spread Through the World  ",
