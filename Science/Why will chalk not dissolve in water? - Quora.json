            "answer_text": "For a substance to dissolve in water, it must be able to form ions in water, which consists of molecules that have partially positive and partially negative charges. For example, table salt (NaCl) is made up of sodium and chloride ions. Both these ions are able to dissolve in water as the positive dipole of water molecules drag the chloride towards them, while the negative dipole of water molecules in water attract the positive sodium ions. This breaks the crystal structure of NaCl, causing dissolution to happen.  Chalk is chiefly composed of limestone (calcium carbonate), with small amounts of silt and clay. We know that silt and clay do not dissolve in water. Calcium carbonate cannot dissolve in water because the calcium and carbonate ions are very strongly bonded to each other. The force required to tear its crystal structure apart is very large. Water is unable to provide this force. Therefore, calcium carbonate (chalk) remains in its crystal structure when you put it in water, existing as an insoluble solid phase. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to take it that the question already assumes the enthalpy relationships embodied in the observation, and is not looking to simply have its premise restated in those terms. Is it possible to break this down reasonably to a more basic level of \u201cwhy-ness\u201d? I think so, at least to give an idea of how calcium sulfate could have a significantly greater solubility than calcium carbonate. They\u2019re both salts of dianions with dications, so those parameters in Coulomb\u2019s law\u2019s input to lattice energy are the same. What\u2019s different is how closely the charge centers can approach each other. The sulfate ion\u2019s bigger than the carbonate ion, so the calcium ion can get closer to the carbonate than to the sulfate, thus achieving a greater attraction as packed into a crystal lattice for chalk than for gypsum. The situation\u2019s complicated by the differential hydration enthalpies of the carbonate and sulfate ions, but that enthalpy difference is a lot less than the difference in formation of the crystals of the salts. In fact, the dissolution of calcium sulfate is so highly exothermic (enthalpically driven) that heating a concentrated solution of it can cause some of it to precipitate! ",
