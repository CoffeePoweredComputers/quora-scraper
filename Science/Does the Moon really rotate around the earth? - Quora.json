            "answer_text": "The trick to understanding the Moon\u2019s rotation is to understand it is not a perfect sphere but an ellipse with its major axis and densest half always pointed toward the Earth\u2019s center. The Earth\u2019s stronger gravity actually stretches the moon along this axis over time. The next point is that the Moon originally had a significant spin but because of its ellipsoidal shape & inhomogeneous density, there is a torque applied to its long axis against the direction of spin every time that long axis points \u2018away from\u2019 the Earth. Then over time, the aggregation of many of these torques removes rotational inertia till the Moon\u2019s spin is all used up and the Moon\u2019s major axis always points to the Earth. However, the Moon still has a small spin vector, called a tidal locking vector, that keeps the same face on the major axis always pointed to the Earth. Proof: Try this at home: get two oranges and run one in your right hand around the other fixed in your left hand and observe the finger tips on your right hand. At the top of your orbit fingers point away from the \u2018center orange\u2019 and at the bottom they face toward it. So if they must always face toward the center orange like the Moon\u2019s face always pointing to Earth, then you must rotate your orange in the right hand. And that is exactly what tidal locking causes the Moon to do in order to minimize rotational energy in the Earth-Moon system. It comes about because the Moon\u2019s rotation is stopped by the Earth\u2019s accumulated applied torque on the Moon\u2019s major axis and over time the Moon stops rotating. However, this means that the Moon\u2019s major axis still has a residual \u2018pointing away\u2019 from the Earth\u2019s center (see the oranges) and the torque on that axis from the Earth continually tugs on the major axis till it faces the Earth at ALL TIMES meaning the Moon has a small induced residual spin. So if you look at your orbiting oranges, it means that the moon is still rotating, but slowly, with one face (the densest side of the Moon) in sync, facing the Earth\u2019s center. PS If you want to find all the Gold & Uranium on the Moon, start digging dead center on the side facing the Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "In a very strict sense, both the earth and the moon move around a common point, the centre of mass of the moon-earth system. This point is about 4700 km from the centre of the earth. As a result, the earth executes a circle of around 4700 km radius, while the moon executes a circle of around 384,000 km. As you can see, the orbit of the moon is much much larger than that of the earth and in comparison to the motion of the moon, the motion of the earth can be neglected. It is for this reason we often say that the moon revolves around the earth. In a similar fashion, the sun moves in a complex motion around the centre of mass of the solar system due to the presence of the planets. This motion can be analyzed; with distant stars, the analysis of such motion is one way of detecting planetary systems. One simple way of understanding this motion is to realize that in the absence of external forces, the centre of mass must move with uniform velocity. Thus, if the moon is going around, so must the earth! ",

Observers on Earth might notice that the moon essentially keeps the same side facing our planet as it passes through its orbit. This may lead to the question, does the moon rotate? The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis. As a result, the moon does not seem to be spinning but appears to observers from Earth to be keeping almost perfectly still. Scientists call this synchronous rotation. ",
