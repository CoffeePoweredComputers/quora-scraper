I would say it is often hard to judge which is the best of a series of books, people read books for different reasons. I keep a copy of Advanced Organic Chemistry by J. March in my office, this is the book I go to when I want to get advice on how to do a reaction, this book is very useful for the professional chemist but for a first year undergraduate it is unlikely to be useful as it is too advanced. Thus for me J. March is close to perfect while for a freashman it would be a poor choice of book. The freashman needs an introduction to the topic which explains the basic ideas to them in a way which they can learn from. ",
