            "answer_text": "One of the reasons why water is used for specific gravity measurement is because of its universal availability. So when you say specific gravity of a certain liquid is \u2018x\u2019 I know whether it is heavier or lighter than water since I have used water all my life I have an intuitive feel of the mass of a liter of water. You can use any liquid as a reference since specific gravity is just a ratio and can be defined with any liquid. ",
