            "answer_text": "People complain about its not being falsifiable. It\u2019s normal for a scientific theory to undergo a certain period of construction during which it is only half-baked. I think some people have an idealized notion of how science works, which treats falsifiability as a simpler more straightforward issue than it is. The level of difficulty in getting predictions from string theory, however, has gone on for decades now, and even some of us who like string theory in general find it troublesome. We want it either to show signs of success or of failure, not to be stuck in some squishy middle ground. One possible difficulty with getting actual predictions out of it is that it seems to predict that there are many different possible (pseudo-) vacuum states. One estimate was [math]10^500[/math] possibilities. It\u2019s called the \u201clandscape\u201d. If you do a web search for \u201cstring theory landscape\u201d you should find places where you can read more. The laws of physics on the level of what we discover in particle accelerators (which would not be completely fundamental) would depend on which vacuum we are in. There might be multiple sub-universes which have different vacuum states. In order to get predictions one would need somehow to eliminate a lot of the possibilities for the vacuum in this particular universe, using what we know about the visible universe\u2019s laws, and then find a new prediction which is consistent among the ones which you have left. String theory seemed to work better with supersymmetry. Supersymmetry says that each fermion (matter) particle there is an associated boson (field carrying particle) and vice-versa. One of the justifications for building the LHC was that it was hoped it would find the supersymmetric partner of some known particle. Now that the LHC has failed to find evidence for them, it\u2019s being speculated that maybe the supersymnetric partners are heavier and possibly could be found if the next larger particle accelerator were built. Meanwhile young particle physicists are to some extent being steered away from working on supersymmetry. There was some reason to think that for string theory to work, one needed to have the cosmological constant or \u201cdark energy\u201d to be the opposite of what it is (causing less expansion, rather than more expansion). Then a work-around was found. I think some people are concerned that string theory may have had to work around too many things in an ad hoc way. Beyond qualms about the theory in itself, I think there may be even more of a complaint about string theory having gotten too big a share of the research funding in fundamental physics. Even if one thinks it should continue to some extent, one might want it scaled back so other approaches to quantum gravity can get more. I took a stab just now at finding specific figures on research funding levels without success. Some of the complaints make it at least sound like string theory has really dominated efforts for a long time, but I don\u2019t know really what the ratio is. Personally I hope they keep working on string theory to some extent, for the sake of possibly getting quantum gravity out of it, but it\u2019s not clear it should be treated any longer as the clear front-runner. This is a difficult shift to make, since so many academic careers are based on specializing in one area in physics, and one can\u2019t easily just migrate into another one. Sabine Hossenfelder has a video on YouTube where she explains her qualms about string theory, worth watching if one wants to know more about these issues. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RQ6ugMWZ0c&t=335s ",

            "answer_text": "It has pushed out other ideas from physics. It\u2019s promoted as a definite theory of everything by many when it\u2019s no such thing. But, for me, most of all, it\u2019s because String theory is supposed to be simple, but, in reality, presents complexity is different forms. There isn\u2019t just one thing - the string. There are open strings and closed strings. For open strings the ends have to have special properties (boundary conditions). Strings have inbuilt orientations. Strings oscillate. Strings must oscillate in more that 3 dimensions. That means three dimensions of space are different from another 6 or so. The extra dimensions have to be curled in different ways to determine particle families. Strings which are open end on \u201cD-branes\u201d which can have a variety of dimensions, including none. Strings have tension. That means different parts of a string attract each other. How? Strings have a coupling constant which determines how often strings will break. How does that work? Finally, why are fundamental particles strings? String theory requires supersymmetry, which increasingly looks like it isn\u2019t true. There are SO many parameters in string theory and it STILL hasn\u2019t been able to make predictions about rye particles of our universe. ",
