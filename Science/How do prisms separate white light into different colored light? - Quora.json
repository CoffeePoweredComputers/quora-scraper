            "answer_text": "One way to think about this is that there is no such thing as white light to start with. There is light - and if we think about the visible wavelengths (about 360\u2013780nn) then when we see individual wavelengths we experience certain colours. Thus we normally see red then we see light at 700nm. And when we see light at 400nm we normally see blue. Now the interesting thing is what happens when we see two or more wavelengths at the same time. According to the rules of additive colour mixing we see other colours. Seeing 700nm (red) and 540nm (green) at the same time results in the perception of yellow. This yellow may be indistinguishable from the yellow that we experience when we see single-wavelength light at 580nm. However, other combinations of wavelengths results in perceptions of colours that are never experienced when we see individual wavelengths; for example, we see purple when we see wavelengths 400nm and 700nm at the same time. And, we see light when we see wavelengths 600nm and 490nm together. Yes, white can result from lots of combinations of two or more wavelengths. When we see all the wavelengths in the visible spectrum together we tend to see white. So it\u2019s not so much that white light is \u2018split\u2019 into separate colours when it is passed through a prism. It is more the case that the prism separates the individual wavelengths (since the prism refracts or bends the different wavelengths to different extents) so that we are able to see the individual wavelengths.

            "answer_text": "A prism causes the separation of the different frequencies present in white light. Although the frequencies of light do not change, their speed, orientation and wavelengths do. This process is called refraction.  Each frequency of light bends by different amounts as it passes into and out of glass, with violet light bending the most and red light the least. These differences are quantified by a constant for each frequency of light called the refractive index (n). n is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed in a particular medium. Snell's law relates n to the angle theta that light makes with the normal to an interface:  The value of n for all frequencies in air is 1.00. Since violet light has a value of n in glass greater than red light does, it slows down more and bends more as it enters glass, and speeds up more and bends even more as it re-enters air.  This differential response of the various frequencies in sunlight produce the characteristic prismatic effect of a rainbow when light is refracted by water droplets suspended in the air. ",

            "answer_text": "When light goes from one medium to another, it bends.  You can see this in the \"broken pencil illusion\": light coming from the pencil under water appears to come from a slightly different place that the water that's just in the air. It's called \"refraction\".   Different frequencies of light bend at slightly different angles.  Long wavelengths like red bend the least. Blue wavelengths bend the most.  Any piece of glass will do this, even a flat one, but in a flat piece of glass the sides are parallel.  That means that the light bends, then bends back in the other direction, so the effect of the refraction is small.  The sides of the prism are at 60 degree angles, which increases the effect: it bends, then it bends some more:   The overall effect is to spread the light out, with the red frequencies nearest the original direction of the light and blue frequencies the furthest.
