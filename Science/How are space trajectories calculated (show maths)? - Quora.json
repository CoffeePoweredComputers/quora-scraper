            "answer_text": "Specification of space trajectories are primarily based on Newton\u2019s laws of motion, Newton\u2019s law of gravitation and Kepler\u2019s law(s). Based on these basic principles, space scientists/engineers use Hohmann Transfer Orbit and gravity assist trajectories for inter-planetary travels as well as journeys to outer space. Kepler\u2019s first law states that \u201cthe orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci\u201d. Although, it is to be noted that earth's orbit is almost a perfect circle with eccentricity of only 0.017, whereas Pluto has the the most eccentric orbit with an eccentricity of 0.25. The more a planet (or any other body in the solar system) is influenced by the sun\u2019s gravitational pull, the less is its eccentricity. Based on the same principle, any spacecraft leaving the earth for inter-planetary travel tends to follow an elliptic path around the sun. The point at which the spacecraft's trajectory is closest to the sun is called the perihelion, and the point corresponding to the farthest distance is called the aphelion.  To send a spacecraft from Earth to an planet further away from the sun, such as Mars using the least amount of fuel possible, it should be sent to an solar orbit suitably adjusted such that desired orbit's perihelion (closest approach to the sun) will be at the distance of Earth's orbit (1 AU), and the aphelion (farthest location from the sun) will be at the distance of Mars' orbit (1.5 AU). This is called a Hohmann Transfer orbit. The portion of the solar orbit that takes the spacecraft from Earth to Mars is called its trajectory. By applying more energy at perihelion, the distance to the aphelion can be increased, and this can be accomplished by accelerating in the direction of Earth's revolution around the sun at the perihelion, thus increasing the orbital energy. The applied energy is exactly equal to the amount required by the spacecraft to reach the aphelion, which is the Martian orbit. In the figure above, [math]\\displaystyle C_1[/math] and [math]\\displaystyle C_2 [/math]represent the orbits of earth and mars respectively, around the sun (represented by the point at the center). [math]\\displaystyle r_p[/math] and [math]\\displaystyle r_a[/math] denote the distance of the perihelion and aphelion respectively of the target transfer orbit which the spacecraft must follow to successfully enter mars\u2019 orbit. As shown above, to allow the spacecraft to leave the earth\u2019s orbit and follow an elliptical trajectory, a \u201cdelta-V\u201d is required (an impulsive acceleration generated by the thrusters), represented by [math]\\displaystyle \\Delta v_1[/math]. The spacecraft needs to be sent into the above-mentioned elliptic trajectory within a small time window such that it reaches the Martian orbit (at a distance of [math]\\displaystyle r_a[/math] from the sun) when Mars is physically present there. Such an opportunity to launch a spacecraft on a minimum-energy transfer orbit to Mars occurs about every 25 months. If [math]\\displaystyle \\Delta v_1 [/math]is too small, the spacecraft will never reach the Mars\u2019 orbit, and if it is too high it will require significantly more fuel to decelerate to match Mars\u2019 orbital velocity.  To transfer into a (almost) circular martian orbit from the elliptic Hohmann transfer orbit (both orbits being around the sun) , the spacecraft must decelerate relative to Mars\u2019 orbital speed using an orbit insertion operation (leading to a velocity change of [math]\\displaystyle \\Delta v_2[/math]) requiring significant amount of fuel. To further reach the surface of Mars, the spacecraft needs to decelerate even more by aerodynamic braking (assisted by the martian atmosphere) combined with parachute or further retrograde burns. Until now, the discussion has focused on outward Hohmann transfer orbits, i.e. the orbits followed by spacecrafts launched from earth to reach planets further away from the sun. On, the contrary, inward Hohmann transfer orbits require a decrease of the spacecraft\u2019s energy at the aphelion (which is now located at the earth\u2019s orbit, with the perihelion located at the target planet\u2019s orbit) which is carried out by accelerating opposite to the direction of Earth's revolution around the sun. It can be asked why the spacecrafts leaving the Earth and intended for Mars are not directly aimed towards Mars when it is closest from the Earth. The reason why it isn\u2019t done is that as governed by Kepler\u2019s first law, the natural trajectory of bodies affected by the sun\u2019s gravitational pull is elliptic with the sun at one of its foci. (Due to its much less mass than the earth, the spacecraft is much less influenced by the sun\u2019s gravitational pull, thus having elliptical orbits with high eccentricity.) Also, such a spacecraft will orbit around the sun at a speed much higher than that required to reach the Martian orbit, and the process will be extremely fuel-inefficient due to the requirement of extreme deceleration to successfully enter the orbit. Apart from the above mentioned Hohmann transfer orbit there are several other types of orbiting maneuvers to change orbits, like the bi-elliptic transfer orbit (shown below). It is a three-stage maneuvering process requiring slightly less total delta-V, whereas the total maneuvering time increases manifold thus increasing the operational costs.  While the above mentioned transfer orbits are useful for inter-planetary travel within our solar system, for travelling to outer space often additional gravity assisted trajectories (often referred to as gravitational slingshot) are used to minimize fuel cost by transferring a part of the enormous amount of energy and angular momentum of the intermediary planets to the spacecraft. For example, The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts took assistance of the gravitational pull of the Jovian planets to attain the solar system escape velocity and escape to the outer space.   It is to be noted that although this answer focuses on space trajectories involved in inter-planetary travels and journeys to outer space and doesn\u2019t include a separate discussion on trajectories followed by man-made satellites orbiting around the earth, the basic principles behind the orbital transfer in the latter case remain the same. Finally, I\u2019d like to present an excellent infographic from the National Geographic Magazine showing the paths of (almost) all the cosmic journeys by man-made vehicles until now.

            "answer_text": "I did a project about this a couple of months ago. Einsteins general theory of relativity gives us the most accurate calculations of the trajectories of planets and spacecrafts. However, these calculations are quite complicated and for most applications the mechanics described by Newton are enough. Calculating the trajactory of objects in space comes down to an n-body problem - Wikipedia, which Wikipedia describes as follows: the n-body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. These calculations make use of Newtons universal law of gravitation: [math]F = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{|x_2-x_1|^2}\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}.[/math] As you might know, solving the n-body problem analytically is impossible in most cases. Therefore a couple of consessions must be done when calculating the trajectory of a spacecraft: Since the mass of a spaceceaft is way smaller than most celestial bodies, often we can neglect the gravitational influence of the spacecraft on celestial bodies.To find an approximation of the trajectory of a spacecraft, a numerical method should be developed to solve the differential equations (Newtons laws of motion are essentialy differential equations) that describe the motion of the spacecraft. For a full example of this, see https://sites.temple.edu/math5061/files/2016/12/final_project.pdf (not mine).",
